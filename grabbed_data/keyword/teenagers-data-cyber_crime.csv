They have made the sub private and are trying to hide it. The cyber bureau of nepal said that they will ""do something about this"", but in the end they will most probably end up banning reddit in nepal. We all must do something about this(idk how i can report against them). Word has come that even after being reported multiple times, reddit has done nothing about that sub. We all must unite against these people, they better keep their dirty thoughts with themselves rather than spread it on the internet. I believe with proper efforts redditors can stop them. Help us, help the victims of such cyber crimes."
1,cyber crime,teenagers,Some teens are setting a bad example for our generation.,1,ghjlfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ghjlfu/some_teens_are_setting_a_bad_example_for_our/,2020-05-11 18:19:34,"Recently in India, some screenshots of a few Instagram groups were leaked. They were filled with 14-17 year olds rating girls and sharing nudes. There were a few who were even casually throwing rape threats. Within a few hours, the whole situation went viral all over Twitter and Instagram. A cyber crime investigation was started against the members of the group. But still some smartasses threatened the women who leaked the chats with guess what, MORE RAPE THREATS. India has a large cultural and economical divide, so some people assumed that these boys were from poor, mismanaged and uncultured households. But to their surprise, all were from A tier 1% of the 1% rich families. They study in the most expensive high schools and colleges. Soon enough, such chats were also leaked from a FEMALE group. So it's not just a boys thing, although the majority were boys. Now, it's easy to dismiss by westerners as a ""Indian thing"" but that would be inaccurate as I've seen plenty or Americans behave just like these degenrates. So what I want to say is that I understand that we all have needs, and we all have means to satisfy them WITHOUT objectifying women and making it a bragging rights and boastable topic. Such teens give our entire generation a bad reputation as they become the poster boys for ALL OF US. Soon enough, in an unrelated incident, a teen commited suicide because many started attacking him for a false rape allegation. So, if you think it's alright to behave in such a demeaning way, think about all the innocent and good people who also are a part of our generation. Think about how you're misrepresenting us as a whole and needless to say making women AND men suffer just because you can't control yourself and make horniness a boast. Posting this on reddit as I think we here are capable of thinking. So, tl;dr, some assholes made ig groups for sexually judging people and circulating nudes, who got exposed and now an entire country hates our generation for it."

They usually list reasons such as cyber bullying, pressure to fit in and pressure to constantly be online and in on what happens. As well as social media creating unrealistic expectations and impossible beauty standards. I just... dont see any of this? As for cyber bullying, I legitimately dont know anyone who has been actually cyber bullied, as in consistently harassed online. That seems really rare to me. I know someone who has idiot friends that made a group chat to back talk them (which they couldve just done in person) and someone who got their nudes shared, but thats a legitimate crime that they went to the police with so I feel like that goes a bit beyond bullying. Ive had stupid arguments on the Internet where people were mean to me, but calling that bullying is a stretch. Pressure to be online? I really dont get this. My parents are much more active on social media than me or my friends. As for the unrealistic expectations, I get it, but its not like celebrities and media didnt create unrealistic expectations for people before the Internet. And now people are actually having a conversation about this, which is nice. Have I just been lucky? Im not denying that in some ways the world was better, every generation has unique sets of problems and advantages. This whole the internet must be so hard so survive as a teen I just really dont relate to."
4,cyber crime,teenagers,A sneaky attempt to end encryption is worming its way through Congress,1,fhuvzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/fhuvzg/a_sneaky_attempt_to_end_encryption_is_worming_its/,2020-03-13 16:46:04,"  A sneaky attempt to end encryption is worming its way through Congress The EARN IT Act could give law enforcement officials the backdoor they have long wanted  unless tech companies come together to stop it By Casey Newton on March 12, 2020 6:00 A thing about writing a newsletter about technology and democracy during a global pandemic is that technology and democracy are no longer really at the forefront of everyones attention. The relationship between big platforms and the nations they operate in remains vitally important for all sorts of reasons, and Ive argued that the platforms have been unusually proactive in their efforts to promote high-quality information sources. Still, these moves are a sideshow compared to the questions were all now asking. How many people will get COVID-19? How many people will die? Will our healthcare system be overwhelmed? How long will it take our economy to recover? We wont know the answers for weeks, but Im starting to fear the worst. On Wednesday the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 had officially become a pandemic. A former director for the Centers for Disease Control now says that in the worst case scenario, more than 1 million Americans could die. This piece by Tomas Pueyo argues persuasively that the United States is currently seeing exponential growth in the number of people contracting the disease, and that hospitals are likely to be overwhelmed. Pueyos back ground is in growth marketing, not in epidemiology. But by now we have seen enough outbreaks in enough countries to have a rough idea of how the disease spreads, and to understand the value of social distancing  that is, staying behind closed doors. So I want to recommend that everyone here reads that piece, and consider modifying your behavior if youre still planning events or spending a lot of time in public. * * * One risk of having the world pay attention to a single, all-consuming story is that less important but still urgent stories are missed along the way. One such unfolding story in our domain is the (deep breath) Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) Act, which was the subject of a Senate hearing on Wednesday. Heres Alfred Ng with an explainer in CNET: The EARN IT Act was introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (Republican of South Carolina) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Democrat of Connecticut), along with Sen. Josh Hawley (Republican of Missouri) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Democrat of California) on March 5. The premise of the bill is that technology companies have to earn Section 230 protections rather than being granted immunity by default, as the Communications Decency Act has provided for over two decades. For starters, its not clear that companies have to earn what are already protections provided under the First Amendment: to publish, and to allow their users to publish, with very few legal restrictions. But if the EARN IT Act were passed, tech companies could be held liable if their users posted illegal content. This would represent a significant and potentially devastating amendment to Section 230, a much-misunderstood lawthat many consider a pillar of the internet and the businesses that operate on top of it. When internet companies become liable for what their users post, those companies aggressively moderate speech. This was the chief outcome of FOSTA-SESTA, the last bill Congress passed to amend Section 230. It was putatively written to eliminate sex trafficking, and was passed into law after Facebook endorsed it. I wrote about the aftermath in October: [The law] threatens any website owner with up to 10 years in prison for hosting even one instance of prostitution-related content. As a result, sites like Craigslist removed their entire online personals sections. Sex workers who had previously been working as their own bosses were driven back onto the streets, often forced to work for pimps. Prostitution-related crime in San Francisco alone  including violence against workers  more than tripled. Meanwhile, evidence that the law reduced sex trafficking is suspiciously hard to come by. And there is little reason to believe that the EARN IT Act will be a greater boon to public life. Yet, for the reasons Issie Lapowsky lays out today in a good piece in Protocol, it may pass anyway. Once again Congress has lined up some sympathetic witnesses who paint a picture that, because of their misfortune, whole swathes of the internet should be eliminated. It would do that by setting up a byzantine checklist structure that would handcuff companies to a difficult-to-modify set of procedures. One item on that checklist could be eliminating end-to-end encryption in messaging apps, depriving the world of a secure communications tool at a time when authoritarian governments are surging around the world. Heres Lapowsky: The EARN IT Act would establish the National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention, a 19-member commission, tasked with creating a set of best practices for online companies to abide by with regard to stopping child sexual abuse material. Those best practices would have to be approved by 14 members of the committee and submitted to the attorney general, the secretary of homeland security, and the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission for final approval. That list would then need to be enacted by Congress. Companies would have to certify that theyre following those best practices in order to retain their Section 230 immunity. Like FOSTA/SESTA before it, losing that immunity would be a significant blow to companies with millions, or billions, of users posting content every day. The question now is whether the industry can convince lawmakers that the costs of the law outweigh the benefits. Its a debate that will test what tech companies have learned from the FOSTA/SESTA battle  and how much clout they even have left on Capitol Hill. The bills backers have not said definitively that they will demand a backdoor for law enforcement (and whoever else can find it) as part of the EARN IT Act. (In fact, Blumenthal denies it.) But nor have they written the bill to say they wont. And Graham, one of the bills cosponsors, left little doubt on where he stands: Facebook is talking about end-to-end encryption which means they go blind, Sen Graham said, later adding, Were not going to go blind and let this abuse go forward in the name of any other freedom. Notably, Match Group  the company behind Tinder, OKCupid, and many of the most popular dating apps in the United States  has come out in support of the bill. (Thats easy for Match: none of the apps it makes offer encrypted communications.) The platforms are starting to speak up against it, though  see this thread from WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart. In the meantime, Graham raises the prospect that the federal government will get what it has long wanted  greatly expanded power to surveil our communications  by burying it in a complex piece of legislation that is nominally about reducing the spread of child abuse imagery. Its a cynical move, and if the similar tactics employed in the FOSTA-SESTA debate were any indication, it might well be an effective one. The Ratio Trending up: Amazon and the Gates Foundation might team up to deliver coronavirus test kits to Seattle homes. The test kits include nose swabs that can be mailed to the University of Washington for analysis. Trending up: Amazon will give all employees diagnosed with coronavirus or put into quarantine up to two weeks of paid sick leave. The policy includes part-time warehouse workers. COVID-19 has really been a watershed for tech giants treating their contract workers like the human beings they are. Outbreak On the policy front: The White House met with Facebook,Google, Amazon, Twitter, Apple, andMicrosoft to coordinate efforts over the coronavirus outbreak. (Reuters) YouTube will begin letting creators make money from their videos about the coronavirus. Its a reversal of an earlier decision the company made to automatically demonetize videos that talked about the outbreak. That decision angered creators, and now the company has walked it back.

The economic downturn is also impacting airlines and hotels, but hosts have fewer resources to cope. (Erin Griffith / The New York Times) Travel influencers also say the spread of COVID-19 has impacted their lives and bottom lines. (Tanya Chen / BuzzFeed) On the office front: Google is asking all employees in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa to work from home due to coronavirus concerns. Employees in North American have already been given the same advice. (Isobel Asher Hamilton and Rob Price / Business Insider) On the conference front: The Council on Foreign Relations had to cancel a roundtable discussion about doing business under coronavirus due to, well, the coronavirus. Its one of many events that have been canceled or rescheduled in recent weeks to do the viruss spread. (David Welch / Bloomberg) The biggest trade show in video games, E3 2020, was canceled due to coronavirus concerns. The event was supposed to take place at the Los Angeles Convention Center this June. (Jason Schreier / Kotaku) On the misinformation front: A Facebook group called U.K. Preppers &amp; Survivalists is trying to stop misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic from spreading. One of the moderators said that while people should question news and politicians, questioning doctors isnt helpful.

The fake HIV emails are designed to look like they come from Vanderbilt University. (Jane Lytvynenko / BuzzFeed) WeChat users in China are evading censors by translating a viral interview from a coronavirus whistleblower in Wuhan, China. Theyre rewriting it backward, filling it with typos and emojis, sharing it as a PDF, and even translating it into fictional languages like Klingon. (Ryan Broderick / BuzzFeed) We need to combat misinformation about coronavirus the same way were combating the virus itself: with a communitarian focus. This strategy emphasizes the needs of the community rather than just focusing on the individual, this piece argues. (Whitney Phillips / Wired) Elsewhere: Microsoft, Google, and Zoom are trying to keep up with demand for their software, which allows people to work remotely. The companies have also started giving it away to companies and schools for free, as the coronavirus pandemic intensifies. (Rani Molla / Recode) Heres the case for why coronavirus quarantines could be good for memes. Finally, some good news! (Brian Feldman / Intelligencer) Governing Maryland, Nebraska, and New York have all proposed taxes that would force tech companies to hand over a portion of the revenue generated from digital advertising. The proposals mirror taxes countries like France have also considered. Ashley Gold at The Information has the story: The proposals vary in approach and scope, but they all center around the idea that big internet companies, having built their fortunes in part through the use of consumers personal information, should be contributing more to government coffers. The bills, which face mixed prospects for adoption, have drawn the ire of tech companies and other business groups, who say it could be challenging to determine precisely how much of their ad revenue comes from each state. In addition, tax experts said, the proposals could run afoul of federal law. But lawmakers and other advocates believe the proposals might find favor with voters concerned about the power wielded by Silicon Valley and large corporations in general. Also: The UK government confirmed that it will levy a 2 percent tax on the revenues of search engines, social media services and online marketplaces which derive value from U.K. users starting on April 1st. The United States government has been strongly opposed to the plan. (Shakeel Hashim / Protocol) After 2016, Americans are alert to Russian election interference and outside attempts to spread discord. But conspiracy theories and vitriol are now coming from influencers in the United States  verified users, many from within the media, and passionate hyper-partisan fan groups that band together to drive the conversation. (Rene DiResta / The Atlantic) Joe Biden has more than tripled the amount of money his campaign is spending on Facebook ads following a strong showing on Super Tuesday. His spend on Facebook ads in March has exceeded that of Bernie Sanders and President Trump. (Salvador Rodriguez / CNBC) As big tech companies struggle to moderate content with a mix of algorithms, fact-checkers, and policies,Wikipedia is quietly managing to stave off misinformation with an army of anonymous volunteers. (Alex Pasternack / Fast Company) Clearview AI let multiple people associated with the Trump campaign use its facial recognition app. Venture capital firms including SoftBank, Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, and Founders Fund also ran searches. Clearview previously tried to claim that the app was only for law enforcement. (Ryan Mac, Caroline Haskins and Logan McDonald / BuzzFeed) Microsoft organized 35 nations to take down one of the worlds largest botnets  malware that secretly seizes control of millions of computers around the globe. The move was unusual because it was carried out by a company, not a government. (David E. Sanger / The New York Times) Content related to far-right candidates in Poland makes up a greater percentage of general Facebook content than of content on mainstream outlets Facebook pages, according to researchers at Stanford. Evidence suggests this might be because far-right pages are especially good at boosting engagement on Facebook by posting content simultaneously across their networks. (Daniel Bush, Anna Gielewska, Maciej Kurzynski / Cyber Policy Center) Industry TikTok is launching a Transparency Center in Los Angeles to give outside experts more insight into how the company makes content moderation decisions. Its one of many moves the company has made in recent months to quell the concerns of US regulators and lawmakers. This ones interesting. Reuters explains: The center would later provide insights into the apps source code, the closely guarded internal instructions of the software, and offer more details on privacy and security. Several U.S. agencies that deal with national security and intelligence issues have banned employees from using the app, whose popularity among teenagers has been growing rapidly. According to a 2017 Chinese law, companies operating in the country are required to cooperate with the government on national intelligence. Egon Durban of Silver Lake is the latestTwitter board member to have never tweeted before joining the board. Rihanna just announced shes opening a Fenty Beauty House for TikTok creators as part of a promotion for her makeup line. Creators will be able to raid the fully stocked Make-up Pantry to create their own beauty-focused content. What a fun time to be trapped together in a house with a bunch of people you barely know! Dont share make-up brushes yall! (Bianca Betancourt / Harpers Bazaar) Alphabet was supposed to help Googleinvent its next blockbuster technologies. But nearly a half-decade has passed since it launched, and the breakthrough new businesses havent materialized. (Nick Bastone and Jessica E. Lessin / The Information) Google has pressured TV manufacturers not to use Amazons Fire TV system. The strategy has slowed Amazons efforts to expand its Fire TV platform. (Janko Roettgers / Protocol) Googles sibling company Sidewalk Labsis walking back plans to create a futuristic city in Toronto. The plans, which combined environmentally advanced construction with sensors to track residents movements, raised privacy concerns. In May, the government will announce if the project will proceed.

So I have two cousins, one who is 13 and another one who is 20. Me and the 20 year old have been banned from talking to the 13 year old or seeing her because of past cyber bullying incidents involving my aunt and her family. My aunt thinks we are terrible people and bad influences and has banned us from ever seeing her kids. Now my other cousin who is 11 has been following me for years. The 13 and 11 year old live together. A few days ago one of the 13 year olds accounts decided it wanted to follow me and talk to me which I thought was weird but ok. All of a sudden it kept bringing up past issues and how it was sad we never get to see eachother anymore and how she hates the 20 year old and how she even hates her own mother (shes a mamas girl). And shes sneaking around on her phone during school and yadda yadda. Weird... And then asked me questions if I ever snuck around to talk to somebody and got in trouble (yeah with you when I was 14). Then shes like nobody in my house knows Im talking to you dont tell anyone (who am I going to tell your mother hates me) I thought it was the 20 year old for a while but idk. My Instagram account is a private account. So then she said she was going snow tubing yesterday, meanwhile the account wouldnt send me pictures of snow tubing or any selfies. Very one worded responses. I asked her sister if she was snow tubing with her sister and she said that her sister was at musical practice and she doesnt think thats the 13 year old. Today I said hows my favorite cousin doing? Lets share selfies with this filter. She didnt even read it. Then I called her out saying  listen here asshole, I know this is *20 year olds name* this is completely pathetic that you are hacking/impersonating our little cousin to try and talk to me. I knew it was you all along. You wouldnt send me any selfies. My family is done with your drama. Leave us alone. Its not funny. Its not cute. I dont want to talk to you or have anything to do with you. Yeah we both have made mistakes growing up and did some pretty shitty things to destroy this family but even I know impersonating/hacking someone is a crime and I wouldnt do it. This is ridiculous. This conversation is over, goodbye she still hasnt read that yet but the account wont load. I think she deleted it. But the messages are still showing. There are 3 other accounts out there....and Im not sure if my 13 year old cousin knows she has access to them or not. Completely ridiculous. They havent tried to talk or follow me yet. My aunt hates us both with a strong passion. So idk if I should just let it go or bring it up but I feel like if I bring it up it would cause more drama."

After finding out about this, i decided to make a group chat and message about the fact that we got kicked out. i messaged one of my friends on this group, we said stuff like 'oh i dislike Derick' and i'm sick of Derick being mean to us' and other stuff. The next day one of my friends (one who got kicked out of the group) asked him why he kicked us out of the group and he said 'because you guys aren't my friends and this is MY group and i'm the leader around here' (he wasn't, everyone in the group was an admin and he didn't even create the group, he was just being egotistical). Around a week later, my teacher found out, one on my friend's friends found out about the group and told the teacher, and was angry at us for making the group and said 'he had reasons to kick us out of the group and i'm going to get you banned off of whatsapp' (yeah.. your going to prevent me from talking to people online.. oh no) and, as the title suggests 'IM GOING TO CALL THE POLICE AND UNLESS THE PERSON WHO DID IT ADMITS TO THE CRIME THEY'VE DONE, IS GOING TO GET ARRESTED' (i don't know how they would arrest me if they didn't know who did it.) And as the stupid 9 year old i was i decided to tell them (I say stupid because i believed them, that i would go to jail.) After school that day, i heard Derick saying 'why would anyone dislike me? Im a great guy. Im P E R F E C T ' (which i found stupid and egotistical. I D O N ' T K N O W I F A T E A C H E R T H R E A T E N I N G T O C A L L T H E P O L I C E O N A S T U D E N T I S I L L E G A L ."
11,cyber crime,teenagers,My classmate is receiving 8 felonies for something he sort of didn't do,1893,boj6q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/boj6q3/my_classmate_is_receiving_8_felonies_for/,2019-05-14 23:51:19,"My high school classmate, Ajay Bhattacharya, was arrested for ""hacking"" into our superintendent's email. There are a lot of things wrong with this, because he found the info in the general share of the high school network. He found the login info of the superintendent, in the general share, without hacking to find it. The school says he ""hacked"" into the school when it was mostly their fault for not maintaining security. Many other students have started the #FreeAjay movement to support him, but many believe he did nothing wrong. He did login to the superintendent's account, but he did not change any info or grades or anything like that. The school is trying its best to make Ajay sound like a cyber criminal when in reality he just found some info and used it not causing harm. The school's security should have prevented this somehow, as there are many things in the general share that should he obvious but simply are overlooked like the info Ajay found. I'm not sure what to do as far as helping, but I wanted to make more than just our school's students aware. We need more than just Ajay's friends to support him and help with his case. If the school gets what they want out of him it will be extremely hard for Ajay to go to college, get a job, and have a successful career. Ajay is one of the smartest kids I know and should not have his life jeopardized because of a security mishap. Granted he should not have logged in to the account and things, but 8 felonies is a little much for logging into an account. Before these events, there was more computer shenanigans where Ajay and some of his friends used old admin accounts for questionable things, like downloading vpns and using school laptops for things other than their intended use, like downloading steam and such. The school was already mad at the group and pinned Ajay as the leader when all were responsible. They were suspended for some amounts of time, from a few weeks to a month or two. I think the current events show how they want to get back at him and make his punishment the worst it can be and exaggerate the crime. Some links to news articles if there is more info on them: URL URL URL Any more info you need can be found by googling Ajay Bhattacharyya Gates Chili. I don't know what the right thing to do is, but hopefully we can get help somehow. The school is blowing his case way out of proportion, and they need to stop before they ruin his entire life ahead of him."

Apparently, this was not just for my account, but for the whole school boards servers. I legit got pulled into the principal's office, where he told me that it counts as a cyber crime. So it seems we are at an end, 1 post, 3 days, and 2 terabytes later."
