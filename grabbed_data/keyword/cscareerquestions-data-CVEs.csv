0,CVEs,cscareerquestions,[Guidance required] Career switch from developer to cybersecurity engineer,1,fqsr8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fqsr8t/guidance_required_career_switch_from_developer_to/,2020-03-29 08:16:25,"Hello world! ***To people who need to decide whether they can provide me relevant guidance, here is the EXTREMELY brief version -*** I am a novice developer having interest in cybersecurity engineering and wish to perform a switch in the most optimal way (economically and career-wise) possible. **Now here is the complete situation -** I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering last year and have been part of a well known organization (FANG) as a Software Development Engineer. Since the last 6 months, I have been exploring cybersecurity as a research field and have been trying to get some exposure in the same too. Recently, I have been having some thoughts about exploring cybersecurity engineering as a serious career option. By cybersecurity engineering I don't mean setting up firewalls and networks. I am aiming for something close to application security engineering (CVEs, application pen-testing, exploit development, etc). I have been exploring open positions for the same, but here is the catch - they all need 2+ yrs of development experience **AND 2+ yrs of security experience**. Here is where I needed some advice. I can garner 2 yrs of development experience, but how should I try to justify myself regarding the 2+ yrs of security experience. As far as certifications are concerned, I seriously doubt it would be of much help (knowledge wise/substitute for experience) to someone already in the IT industry. Please correct me here if I am wrong here. I am open to all options that take into consideration my economic investment and the future of my career into consideration. *Thanks for your help!*"
1,CVEs,cscareerquestions,Moving into a Dev/Security Position,0,cvvmd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cvvmd4/moving_into_a_devsecurity_position/,2019-08-27 09:00:15,"I am a compsci student nearing graduation who currently has spent almost a decade working in cybersecurity, and hold a CISSP. Outside of some basic Bash/Powershell tools, I do no CS related work at my current job (primarily compliance, vulnerability management, DLP, and perimeter security) I'm looking to move into a field in security that can utilize my coding skills and further develop them without leaving the career I've built here in cybersecurity. Does any such career exist? Thank you all in advance! [PS (optional read) my dream job is to be a security researcher and get some CVEs under my belt someday. I just want to continue both my security and code skills till I get there. Thank you for hearing me out!]"
2,CVEs,cscareerquestions,No idea what software development field/industry to go into after graduation,0,ce7tc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ce7tc8/no_idea_what_software_development_fieldindustry/,2019-07-17 14:07:42,"I am currently attending a community college and will be transferring to a pretty good (but not amazing) state university (in the Western US) to get a bachelor's degree in CS. I have been coding since I was 14, although not continuously (mostly during breaks). I have done a variety of small projects (applications/tools that I needed for personal use or small projects that I thought were mildly interesting). I still have a couple of years before graduation but I am a bit worried because I have no idea what area of software development I want to go into. The only thing thing I am really sure of is that I don't want to do front-end (web or otherwise) development as I don't like UI/UX development (and especially hate CSS) and anything networking related (seems very complicated and frustrating to me). The areas that I have thought about focusing on are embedded/firmware development, security (not sure what subfield exactly as I think I wouldn't enjoy pentesting or reading code all day to find CVEs), programming tools dev (e.g. compilers, VMs), audio/video development and just random backend development (in the financial/corporate world; I'm guessing this would mean focusing on mastering Java/.NET). At one point I even considered going into system administration but it appears to me to be a dying field as things are moving into the cloud/being outsourced and automatized. The problem is I feel that some of the more niche areas (audio/video development, programming tools dev, maybe security) are only looking for exceptionally smart and super passionate people while I suspect I am only (slightly above?) average and work/life balance is extremely important to me (after all almost all multimedia software, for example, reuses the same libraries that implement all the hard stuff). Embedded/firmware development seems really interesting to me but defense work wouldn't be an option as I am not a US citizen and I have some moral qualms about this sector (I am not opposed to it per se as I realize that defense is a necessary and legitimate business but I am very uneasy about some arm sales that I think should not have happened or shouldn't be happening and obviously it is impossible to dictate as a developer how your product is going to be used and by who) and I feel like most of the other jobs would be in IoT (which I consider rather distasteful considering the current amount of electronic waste and how most of these things are completely unnecessary gadgets with planned obsolescence) and consumer electronics in general. I wouldn't mind working in the transportation or satellite field, but that would severely limit my options I imagine. Of course other things matter as well such as geography, benefits (and the associated cost of living). I believe I am probably being too picky and that I should wait and see what jobs are available when I graduate, but on the other hand it would be nice to know what sort of side projects I should be working on while I am in college. I am hoping some people here with actual experience will be able to offer me some insights."
