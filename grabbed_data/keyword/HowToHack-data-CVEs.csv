0,CVEs,HowToHack,How to politely and anonymously tell a stranger that they are at risk.,11,bsmzbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/bsmzbu/how_to_politely_and_anonymously_tell_a_stranger/,2019-05-25 08:05:19,"So in my quests of curiosity, I have a few times accidentally stumbled upon a system that was exposed and very vulnerable to the world. I, not being one who would exploit the innocent or otherwise, have no wish to do any harm. often the vulnerabilities are well documented CVES so it's not like you would be reporting the vulnerability to a manufacturer, but more likely a webmaster or business owner. Now, you weren't hired by that webmaster/business, so what do you do? I often feel like I should let them know, but what if it spooks them and they take somekind of legal action. Is this where you upgrade your hoody for a cloak and somehow anonymously let them no? What would you do, assuming you have good intentions."
1,CVEs,HowToHack,Completely stumped on a mock pentest,147,bmacug,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/bmacug/completely_stumped_on_a_mock_pentest/,2019-05-09 06:29:06,"So, the professor in charge of my schools cybersecurity club is doing a mock pentest (in cooperation with the sysadmin and with the blessing of the administration team). The goal is to have an account with administrator rights AND to leave a .txt file with our name on the professors computer. We can use any computers in the lab, and we have to play by these rules: Rules: 1. Students cannot work together, but are not forbidden from working with non-club members as long as we are notified (if you dont want the professor to know, notify the sysadmin). 2. Computers outside the lab can be used, but not hacked (for example, students can look at shared folders but not hack other computers) 3. Hacking absolutely must not result in a denial of service for any other student or faculty member, no matter how brief (The professor gave later clarification that a minor (less than a few minutes) denial of service solely on his systems in the lab was not a disqualifier) 4. Hacking the accounts of faculty members and students, with the sole exception of the professor's account, is prohibited 5. Hacks cannot cause lasting damage to any computer, server, WiFi network, or website 6. Students are allowed to use a personal device (phone, laptop, tablet, etc.) and USB drives Some computer info from using a scanning program I wrote, plus tidbits I know (this applies to all computers in the lab): OS: Windows 8.1 Pro Version = ""6.3.9600""; Manufacturer = ""ByteSpeed LLC""; Model = ""ByteSpeed Value H81M-C"" Roles = {""LM_Workstation"", ""LM_Server"", ""SQLServer"", ""NT"", ""Potential_Browser""}; BootupState = ""Normal boot""; OSArchitecture = ""64-bit""; OSLanguage = 1033; OSProductSuite = 256; OSType = 18; Cmd, regedit, and run are all disabled All ports are filtered from outside scanning &amp;#x200B; I figured the easiest thing to start with was escalating my privileges to admin on a computer in the lab, then use PsExec or a RDP program to create the txt file on the target computer. I got around the disabled cmd by writing a python program to pass commands instead of the command line. Any command passed through the program is run at the same trust level as the program itself. I found out because theyre lab computers, powershell is not only enabled, but it also isnt scanned as intensively as it is on other computers (it will catch mimikatz, but it wont catch things like PowerView or other powersploit one liners. &amp;#x200B; Because powershell was enabled, I decided to use that as my starting point. I acquired a list of users and a list of local admins. I looked for any way to escalate privileges to get admin, and I found an unquoted service path which I planned to exploit to run my python command program as system, then add myself to the local admin group. Unfortunately, while I could write to the C drive, I couldnt write to Program Files or any of its subdirectories. The only other thing I found was the panther.xml file but, as expected, the password was removed from it. I also looked for CVEs but I only found vulnerabilities in old windows XP systems that were located outside the lab. &amp;#x200B; I then turned my focus to the GPP password. I pulled the file and copied the cPassword string, took it home, ran it through a GPP-decrypt script and got an output. The output was a little strange looking, and looked to be a far better password than I wouldve given the sysadmin credit for. I came back the next day and attempted to use it to login as local admin. Unfortunately, something was wrong. I was aware that the GPP password had been patched by Microsoft, but I had figured if it was still in the file that meant they hadnt updated it. Either it had been patched then changed post-patch or the decryptor was wrong. Either way, a bust. &amp;#x200B; I decided to try something a little more brute force, so I asked the professor if using external software was ok. He said as long as it didnt violate one of the rules, it was fine. I burned a password reset key at home and tried to simply reset the local admin password. Unfortunately, the BIOS is locked with a password and I cant get to the CMOS battery AND reassemble the computer fast enough for the professor to not notice. &amp;#x200B; Im totally stumped here. Everything Ive tried has failed, and Im not finding much else I can do as a normal user that will let me escalate to local admin. The contest will end in 6 days. I can bring a laptop if needed. Any suggestions on how to proceed?"

7,CVEs,HowToHack,So you want to learn how to hack? Read here!,47,3o5ee0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/3o5ee0/so_you_want_to_learn_how_to_hack_read_here/,2015-10-10 08:32:10,"**Intro** Just note that the path of an Information Security professional isn't an easy one, or more people would be doing it. As a matter of fact the amount of people going into it is decreasing as technology gets more complicated. The learning curve for a lot of people seems too steep, so they don't attempt it until later on in their career when they get more confident with their abilities. There's nothing wrong with that though! That's how many ended up in security in the first place! Most people in InfoSec are in their 30s to 50s. I've worked at a variety of companies from McAfee, Intel, all major telecom providers, several major banks. At 25 now I'm still the youngest person in every team I've ever worked with by at least 5 to 6 years. I started young and was crazy enough to choose this as a career. Just know this: It won't happen overnight so don't get impatient. I'm going to give it to you straight. This is probably a 5-7 year timeline at least: - **Learn and understand a programming language.** And I mean truly *understand* it. You won't be a good hacker if you can't look at code without really understanding what it's doing. Python is typically recommended. Most tools are written in it or similar language (like Ruby). Plus it's easier to automate web application pentesting using Python because the library support is really strong for such tools in Python 2.7. - **Learn and understand the industry by gaining experience in a professional role.** It's very unusual to end up in a security role without any prior experience. Get a job as a systems administrator or network administrator. School and degrees are not required (and often are a waste of time, more on that in the certifications portion). If you have true knowledge and certifications, it won't be difficult to find a position once you understand the rest of what I'll mention. Start small. Without professional experience you likely won't land a $60k/year sysadmin role. Your first role might even be making $13 an hour as a helpdesk operator. Additionally, understanding how the IT world works will make you that much better of a pentester. Just by seeing a few things on social media or scanning the resumes of your target you'll immediately know where to hit or what to look for when you're attempting to intrude in an authorized penetration test. - **Know and understand network protocol.** Obviously, you need to know very low level information on how computer systems and networks interact with each other. Full knowledge of TCP/IP, UDP, DNS, etc. is absolutely required. - **Network in the industry.** Learning from others is the best way to learn. You gain different perspectives and can build off of not only your own experience, but others as well. Your peers will have all had exposure to a very wide variety of networks, vendors, tools and platforms. Learn from them. This obviously comes in line with building professional experience. - **Metasploit, Burp, and other tools are only the tip of the iceberg.** Using MSF console or another tool without really understanding what you're doing is script kiddie shit. Yes, it is totally possible for any monkey to figure it out - they are designed to be easy to use. There's a discernible difference between a professional who knows what they're doing with the tool and one who only has a limited scope of what to do with a tool because they've cracked a few metasploitable VMs. It isn't uncommon to have to tweak things. It doesn't always work right out of the box. - **Social engineering is debatable security.** If you handed a client a penetration test that had social engineering in it, and that's the only way you broke through the perimeter, they'd probably be mad and never return to your agency. Pentests ain't cheap. If they didn't ask for it, DON'T give it to them. You'll work out social engineering aspects when defining the scope. When clients are paying for an ethical hacker, they're paying someone to find things that they couldn't. Their security staff probably already knows the risk of phishing. You can save hardening against phishing for another service agreement with them. Give them the good stuff. - **Certifications, not Degrees!** Getting the right certifications gets you past the robo-resume crunchers and gets you in front of a potential client. Plus, in the process of getting them you'll actually learn useful and relevant information. C|EH, CISSP, GIAC GPEN, CCNA, OSCP, Security+ to name a few common ones. Do your research and find out what people are looking for the most in your area or market. Use that Python knowledge to scrape job boards like LinkedIn and search for how many hits each certificate gets. If there is a lot of mention in job reqs for the CISSP, for example, go get one if you don't have one. As for degrees, don't waste your time with an infosec one *unless you already have your foot in the industry*. It seriously won't help you get hired at all with limited or no experience unless you *really, really* knew your shit. Believe it or not, no, the degree won't teach you that level of knowledge. Coursework usually brushes over infosec topics with outdated tools and materials. That 4-6 years you wasted studying English/History/Mathematics for your master's degree could have been spent *in the industry,* gaining *real knowledge relevant to your field or specialty.* I know it sounds odd or even counter intuitive, but if a job req states they want a degree, what they're really asking is ""we want someone who isn't a complete idiot."" The exception I've found is in non-technical management roles. A degree is pretty much required for those in larger corporations. - **Watch your background.** Obviously, don't go hacking away and getting arrested for BS when you're starting out. It may be too tempting because it really is too easy. Having a record of any kind makes it difficult to break into certain markets, like the government or organizations that are governed by federal or state regulations (finance, gov orgs like NASA, public utilities, medical, etc.). Conducting any kind of illegal activity and getting caught for it could very well end your career or halve the potential employers you could work for depending on charges. Really cliche, and I don't judge by any means, but don't steal shit and stay out of drugs and it's pretty much a non-issue at that point. A lot of advice seems to glaze over or completely neglect to bring up this point. Yeah, I'm 90% sure 90% of us have done SOMETHING illegal or at least really in the gray area. But that doesn't make it ok for you 'just because others did it too.' **Love to learn and live to do it.** There's an ancient Greek legend that can apply here: Milo of Croton, an ancient Greek Olympic athlete. I suggest you read it, because starting will be similar to that. The story goes like this: Milo carries a baby Ox every day. As the oxen grew and matured, so did he and his strength. Eventually he was able to carry a full sized Ox like the average guy carried a sack of flour. I know the feeling all to well of staring at the mountain of information and wondering where the hell you even start to scale it. Remember Milo and start small. I constantly learn new things from electrical engineering to new computer science concepts. The truly successful in our industry are the self-start self-study nerds. The more information you want to vacuum up every day the stronger you'll get - just like Milo. Just don't do it all at once. You can't go lift an full sized Ox right from the beginning. If you have more questions, ask :) **So what now? Where to start** Generally speaking there is a lot of information and there is not any best place to start. Take my information and use it to work out the best path for you. - **Don't underestimate books.** If you were involved in a public school system, you're familiar with textbooks. The majority of what you know now was learned through textbooks. Think about it. All the teacher did for the most part was assign work for you to do in your textbooks. Now you're your own teacher. Build yourself a curriculum and force yourself to adhere to it. Environment is everything. If you're in a distracting environment (that includes being alone at your house) it makes it almost impossible to learn. It's so easy to click that damn Reddit bookmark and just lose 3 hours of your life. However, that's 3 hours of time you just robbed from yourself. If you're a student, your school's library is a great place. A public library as well. Anywhere public with a solid learning environment is best. This includes downtime at work too, believe it or not. If I ever have a free moment, I usually spend it wisely and knock another chapter out of book if I can, or maybe rebuild or add a new feature to a tool I built. - **What is the general certification path?** Again, there isn't any solid answer for this question. Generally recommended is: **Net+, CCNA, Sec+, CISSP, Master something like Python, C|EH, OSCP,** Use your employers $$$ to get some **GIAC/SANS shit like the GPEN** because its super-ultra-mega expensive. Don't buy the SANS stuff with your own money. If you're going to do that just buy yourself a motorcycle and ride to Alaska instead. Money better spent at this point in my opinion. When you're old and crusty with 10-15 years experience, invest in a masters degree. By then you may have plateaued pay wise and NOW the timing is right for a degree, but it isn't totally necessary. A degree doesn't really increase your pay in InfoSec like it does in other fields, but it does help you get into a non-technical and sometimes a technical management role which will probably pay better with overall total compensation (pension, etc.). By now, stuff that was around when you were a kid is being called 'vintage' by young technology addicted people with ridiculous hairstyles, so that pension and 401k stuff you didn't give a shit about on your offer letters 15 years ago matters more than it did when you were 20. - **The CompTIA Network+.** This is for those of you who have no idea what the hell a value of 06 means in the protocol information of a packet dump. It will teach you the basics. It's like pouring the cement foundation for what you're going to build next. You can't build up without a foundation, it just doesn't work that way. The thing is with certifications is they have different versions. So get the right book for the current version of the test. At the moment the current version is the **N10-006 exam**. (*People from the future, be sure to check CompTIAs site for the current version*). Try this material to study for it [ISBN-10: 0071848223.](URL - **CompTIA Network+ Reference:** Book: [ISBN-10: 0071848223](URL Exam Code: N10-006 Voucher URL: [Link](URL - **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA).** Once you have a solid foundation in networking it's time to build that up with actual skills. It is impossible to pass the CCNA without knowing your way around the terminal in Cisco's IOS. This will teach you how to work with the most common networking equipment vendor: Cisco. It also goes more in depth with networking concepts and how they apply to the IT world. Knowing networking isn't enough. You also need to be able to answer questions a business might ask like ""How do we achieve network segmentation between these applications?"" Experience will be able to answer that best but you can start with the CCNA. The current exam at the time of this post is the 200-120 CCNA. I recommend [ISBN-10: 1587143879](URL Seeing as how this directly involves in working within a terminal on an actual switch through the console port, I *highly* recommend picking up a used Catalyst 3500 series switch so you can get intimately familiar with the remote terminal. - **CCNA; Routing and Switching Reference:** Book: [ISBN-10: 1587143879](URL Exam Code: 200-120 CCNA Voucher URL: [Link](URL Recommended Training Hardware: Cisco Catalyst 3500 series (Typically $75~$200 used depending on model) - **Get to work!** By the time you have a solid understanding of network and routing and have achieved a few certificates, you should be working somewhere in IT. You absolutely need that experience. Also, most employers will pay for training so you don't need to fork the money over for the increasingly more expensive exam vouchers from this point on. If you're having trouble finding work with the CCNA and Net+ under your belt, you need to look smaller. Remember the Ox analogy? You might have to take a helpdesk role or expand you experience to include Microsoft and Linux systems administration. There are certificates for those, but they're not totally necessary. Don't look at big companies. Look at small local companies. You also may need to expand your job hunt to *nationwide* or at least *statewide*. Don't be afraid to move. This is your career after all. Passing up a nice opportunity because you're afraid to take the plunge and move to another state isn't a wise decision. Because of my line of work I've had the opportunity to live, work and travel all over the US! Just keep in mind you'll never break into any real info sec role without prior experience. Once you have your foundation built don't pour your time anywhere else but resume building. One of my first ever contracts was making $14 an hour as a network administrator at a start up. Sometimes it's not all about the money. What I learned at that role landed me a Systems Engineering role at a larger company making more serious money a couple years later, and they loved how technical I was. I couldn't have done it without my lowly net admin role where I got exposure to all kinds of amazing tools. - **CompTIA Security+**. The Security+ had a bad rep with the older version. It wasn't technical enough with older versions. Well now, that has changed. It's actually challenging, and a really good solid foundation to launch into the CISSP with. The current exam you want to take is the SY0-401. The SY0-301 is the older one that's about to be depreciated. Don't bother with that one, it sucked in my opinion. This exam will go into networking concepts, as well as security concepts like business continuity, CIA, and other things you'd expect to find on the CISSP. If you're fresh into security, it's a good way to start. The exam vouchers are cheap and like with all CompTIA certs, coupon codes or programs for vouchers are widespread. It's a low-cost low-risk intro into the CISSP. Additionally, it knocks an entire year off the experience requirement for the CISSP! Very useful for getting a headstart. It has it's place so don't bash it. - **CompTIA Security+ Reference:** Book: [ISBN-10: 1118875079](URL Exam Code: SY0-401 Voucher URL: [Link](URL - **ISC^2 CISSP: Certified Information Systems Security Professional:** This has become the defacto security certificate in the industry and is practically mandatory... for HR purposes. Yes, that's right. It's a common misconception this actually teaches anything about hacking. It does not. **It is NOT a technical certificate.** What it DOES do is expand more on the *business* concepts you learned about in the Security+. It will teach you everything from what fire extinguisher to use in the event of an electrical fire (I'm not kidding) to a brief overview of firewalls and architecture design. It covers a very wide and broad overview of Information Security and IT in general. There is not a lot of depth in the program as far as raw technical knowledge goes. I'll describe it like this: It's like a lake that's 10 miles wide and 2 inches deep. Lots of coverage, not much depth. That being said you absolutely should get it, just don't misunderstand what this certificate is. You won't be a 1337 h@x0rz just by getting your CISSP. I've seen plenty of people who passed the exam but don't even know what a reverse shell is. But it will help you land that SOC Analyst role at UltraMega Corp, Inc., ltd LLC. That's when you'll start picking up real skills. - **ISC^2 CISSP Reference:** Book: [ISBN-10: 1119042712](URL Exam Code: CISSP Voucher URL: [Link](URL Vendor Reference URL: [Link](URL - **Learn a Programming Language!** Now, if you haven't been working on this slowly over time, now is the time. You're going to need to write your own tools or tweak existing tools at some point by this point. Python is THE language to learn first. Not only is it easier to learn than any other language, it is what probably 90% of the tools are written in and has amazeballs library support for info sec tools. There's lots of ways to learn but the best way I found was the Learn Python the Hard Way book. I've recommended it to a few people and they all ended up launching into other books and landed roles in web dev after about a year of self study. LPTHW won't work unless you do EVERYTHING. Answer and understand every extra question the textbook asks. Buddy up with some programmers at your work place and ask them to mentor you when you get stuck. Having someone explain it to you like you're 5 is an awesome thing. One thing to be wary of when asking experienced programmers is they may look at your code and recommend 5 other random libraries you've never heard of. Take it with a grain of salt. Programming is like handwriting, we all write it differently. You won't totally know everything about code after a book like LPTHW, but you'll be able to launch into other books. 4 or 5 books later you'll be awesome. One thing I'd like to mention that worked better for me is to get the actual physical book. Soft copies like PDFs have never cut it for me. I carry around the books I'm working on with me every day and set them on my desk. It's a good physical reminder that I need to finish them every day and having a physical copy makes it much easier to just flip it open to the book mark and pick up where I left off. Plus you look like some bad ass wizard with a giant bookshelf of programming manuals. - **Python Security Reference:** Learn Python the Hard Way: [ISBN-10: 0321884914](URL Learn Ruby the Hard Way: [ISBN-10: 032188499X](URL Violent Python: [ISBN-10: 1597499579](URL Black Hat Python: [ISBN-10: 1593275900](URL Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide: [ISBN-10: 159327288X](URL Learning Penetration Testing with Python: [ISBN-10: 1785282328](URL - **EC Council Certified Ethical Hacker; C|EH:** Like the Security+ and Network+, this is a foundation into penetration testing. This is like the ""introduction to tools."" It goes over the tools and tactics for basic network security penetration testing, like using Metasploit. It's a great resume builder and learning experience to take your next step away from an Information Analyst role and into a more technical role. Those tools are designed to be easy to use, so believe it or not, you don't actually need to know shit about security or hacking to take and pass this exam if you study hard enough. To be fair, the same can be said for *any* of these certifications. It just seems to happen a lot more than usual with this one, maybe because of the way it's marketed. **DO NOT** do that. Don't be that guy. You devalue the certificate and the people who have worked hard to achieve this certificate AND know what they're doing. You'll get crushed in an infosec interview if you up and get this cert without a good foundation and expect it to teach you what you need to know to get a specialist role. You'll waste the employers time and your own. Plus you'll look like an idiot and pretty much ban yourself from working at that company (those managers stick around for long times at larger companies, and yeah we will remember you if you apply again 2 years later as 'that one guy').

This exam is *tough*. I'll put it this way: The exam is 24 hours long, and you have to actually hack into systems. There's no questions. There's no multiple choice. Just an objective. Most people use almost that entire time to do the exam and write the pentest report. If you're ready to put your skills to the test and prove you can faceroll systems with Metasploit, this is the exam to take. It's like a shining beacon of awesomeness on your resume too. If you have this certificate there is often little doubt that you know your shit if it's backed up with some solid experience and industry reputation. That being said, it specifically covers several tools widely used in the penetration testing biz. It won't teach you how to hack into satellites to broadcast traffic in order to hide your botnet or any fancy shit like that. But you'll be able to break systems that have common vulnerabilities no problem. This test takes MONTHS to prep for. You absolutely need a really solid background with everything previously mentioned in order to successfully complete the lab. Even as tough as this cert is, it's still considered *entry level.* That's right. After everything you've learned and even with an OSCP you're only starting to crawl. Writing your first 0day and publishing your first CVEs are a still a few paces ahead at this point. I told you it would take a while. Your Ox is essentially a juvinile now.
