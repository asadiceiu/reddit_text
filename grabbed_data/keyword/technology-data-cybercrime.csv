Banking, government services, property management and more are available from your mobile phone. In addition to the obvious advantages such as timesaving, transparency and ease of use, the new service channels have disadvantages, the main of which is remote fraud. The fraudster no longer needs to be physically present at the scene of the crime, and it becomes almost impossible to catch them. The physical presence does not guarantee us against fraud, but it does make a high price error for the fraudsters, they can be caught red-handed right on the spot. High risks kept large numbers from fraud in the pre-digital era. However, remote services removed this restriction. According to Symantec Inc., every second Internet user faced cybercrime. In fact, the perpetrator could take over our entire lives by faking our identity. In this context, the tasks of human identification come to the fore. More and more complex methods of identification are used. First, we came up with the identification of the fingerprint, but for a long time fraudsters have learned to make a fingerprint and overcome this barrier. Then we learned to identify a person by voice quite accurately, but even now, filters like Lyrebird allow us to fake any voice with amazing accuracy. There is similar case with identification through video, AI services have already learned to generate video indistinguishable from the original, creating three-dimensional holograms is a question of time. Moreover, modern technologies make offline channels more vulnerable too, modern makeup is very difficult to distinguish from the real person, and the pattern of fingerprints and the iris is easily applied to silicone pads or lenses. All these gives rise to great concern, it will take some 10 years and the scammers will be able to completely fake a person. Whats left? The answer is seen in DNA identification. The cost of DNA testing every year is a multiple of decreases and this is the thing that we will not be able to fake for a long time. I hope so we will get a reliable method of identification for several decades. But it is not accurate"

3,cybercrime,technology,Explained like you're Five. The real issue of the Apple Backdoor isn't that the Government wants to spy on you. It's the repercussions of building something like this.,7,46l4r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/46l4r5/explained_like_youre_five_the_real_issue_of_the/,2016-02-20 02:28:03,"I've been following this news story for days now. After Apple's letter to it's customers, and the subsequent backing of Google, Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter, it's gained my interest, and I read article after article every single day. What frustrates me the most about this news story, though, isn't the content; it's the comments. I've read comment after comment on news sites, tech sites, social media sites, hell even Reddit that are inane and spreading complete misinformation. So I'm here to try and piece together in a somewhat coherent fashion my thoughts, as a 23 year old SysAdmin with a base level understanding of encryption and a pretty good grasp of politics, the issues that are going to arise to the common layman like me should Apple or any other technical company be forced to comply with the judges order. **Disclaimer:** _This is all purely swayed by my opinion and technical understanding, which, while better than the average worker outside the IT industry, I **do not** profess as fact._ Your Government, whether US, UK, Germany, Italy, Holland, Australia or China doesn't care about your personal information. They don't care about the nudes you sent to your ex girlfriend while your wife was out of town. They don't care about the risky snapchat you sent while you were at work. They don't care about the text message you sent to your best mate about that crazy night you just had. Seriously. Get that in to your mind now, and this will become a lot easier. Your government _doesn't want_ your personal information. There's people out there who do though. There's people who want to know what information is stored on your phone, and it's a lot of information. Nobody cares too much about your browsing habits, but the fact your Facebook account, your Reddit account, Your Twitter, Bank Account, Credit Card(s) and all the other personal information that could help them take what they want from you, they care about that stuff. Think of a common case of identity theft. It starts with social engineering. They find out who you are, what you like. Eventually, they find your passcode to your phone. But that can take months, and especially if you have a fingerprint scanner, or better, a '10 strikes and all the information is wiped' feature (to be topical!) means they have to be sure they're right, or they don't get in at all. If they do, though, they can take apart your life piece by piece. This is what Apple is trying to prevent first and foremost. What they're asking for is a way to circumvent inbuilt security features. Right now, if you enter the wrong passcode in to a phone too many times, it locks you out from attempting again for a progressive amount of time. First minutes, eventually going up to hours at a time. This means the amount of human effort necessary to get into _just a single phone_ isn't really viable if you don't know what's in there, and even if you do, it's mostly not valuable enough for that amount of time anyway. Here's what the FBI want. They want a way to stop that auto-lock out from happening based on incorrect attempts. They want the feature that you're able to switch on to be disabled that will wipe your phone of **all data** after 10 incorrect passcode attempts. They want a way to keep trying passcodes without having a person there (electronically, and with a computer). This is good, in fact, what they're asking for, they're doing it for the right reasons. Here's the ramification of building something like that. When it gets out into the open about how it's done (and it will, John McAfee, legendary hacker - read some of his stuff on social engineering - it **_will_** happen), the people who are currently restricted suddenly aren't. They can remotely hack your phone, even if it's in your pocket, or on your desk, or whatever. And they can do it _fast_. A computer entering in to a phone every passcode from 0000 to 9999 will take hours, minutes, even, once an algorithm is built and streamlined to do it for you. And then they have access to your whole life. Everything you've ever put in to your phone. Your history, your bank details, your address, your family, and their address, even. It doesn't take long to become public knowledge. The hackers will find it and abuse it. And it's a danger to the general populace worldwide, not just the people the governments of the world might think are slightly dangerous. The FBI have said they want this as a one time use programme, but believe me when I say, there is no way to build this for a one time use. Slightly modify the parameters, and bam, it'll work on any iOS device out there (and it's been widely stated that there's a billion in the world today). It won't be long before it's modified to work on OS X too. A couple of scenarios you should imagine while we're here. David Cameron, Prime Minister of the UK, Barack Obama, POTUS, and many other world leaders have iOS devices. A technical terrorist could get hold of their information too. That's dangerous on a lot of levels. Another; should the FBI force this through on Apple, they can use the same laws in the same context to force this through on any tech company. Windows, Mac, Android, iOS - none of it will be safe. Not even Linux. So please be informed about this. The real issue isn't that your Government wants to spy on _allthethings_, it's that the code that would have to be built can be socially engineered into the open, and that puts everyone, including you and I, at a major risk. **TL;DR**: Your government isn't spying on you, but the precedent they're setting means someone else easily could. Everyone is a potential victim of cybercrime, and this would make that victim pool so much easier to damage."
4,cybercrime,technology,A rather bland and generic response I received from Senator Warner (D-Va) explaining why he voted in favor of CISA.,4,3xw13a,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3xw13a/a_rather_bland_and_generic_response_i_received/,2015-12-23 09:22:18,"Dear &lt;scumbag&gt;, Thank you for contacting me regarding S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue. This bill aims to improve cybersecurity by encouraging private companies and the government to voluntarily share information about threats, while protecting privacy and civil liberties. On October 27, I voted for and the Senate passed this bill by a bipartisan vote of 74-21. In April, the House passed two similar cybersecurity measures: H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act, and H.R. 1731, National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015. The House and Senate versions will now head to conference to agree on the final legislative language. Cyber-attacks are among the most critical threats our nation faces, jeopardizing both our national and economic security. Estimates indicate that cyberattacks and cybercrime account for between $24 and as much as $120 billion in economic and intellectual property loss per year in the U.S. Furthermore, cyberattacks against the nation's critical infrastructure have the potential to cause significant disruptions, and even deaths. The recent cyber-attack at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that compromised the personal information of at least 22 million individuals demonstrated the impact of this threat on Americans. As we have seen with attacks on Target, Neiman Marcus, Home Depot, banks like JPMorgan, and others, this problem is not limited to the government. Encouraging increased coordination and information sharing between companies and government is critical to better identify and protect against threats and is a good first step towards protecting our nation. I was very pleased that this legislation included two provisions I championed to strengthen the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) authorities to protect civilian networks and to conduct threat assessments of critical cyber infrastructure affecting public health, the economy, or national security. The Federal Information Security Management Reform (FISMA Reform) Act of 2015, which was included in CISA, will bolster DHS's ability to protect federal civilian (.gov) networks. The second provision requires DHS to assess whether the government receives adequate information from those critical infrastructure entities whose failure in the aftermath of a cyber-attack would cause severe damage to national security capabilities. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I will continue to monitor cybersecurity issues as they develop and to look for further opportunities to strengthen our cybersecurity capabilities, while protecting privacy and civil liberties.
