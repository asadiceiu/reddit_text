Value transactions were paused since February 12 because IOTA's most popular wallet (Trinity) had a security issue with a third-party integration. Several seeds (private keys) were stolen. The IOTA foundation organized a seed migration period from February 29 - March 7 to allow users to migrate to a new seed. If you have missed this migration period, and if you have used Trinity, you still need to take action as soon as possible: ""If you used Trinity between 17 Dec - 17 Feb and you have not migrated your seed, make sure to create a new seed in Trinity and transfer your funds from your old seed when the network is restarted later today."" David, one of the co-founders, has stated that he will refund all victims. They still have good hope to catch the thief under the official police investigation: LKA Berlin, Center for Cybercrime, case number: 200213-1717-i00290. ""To bring assurance to everyone here, I will commit to that all victims identified here shall be made whole again.

1,cybercrime,CryptoCurrency,IOTA Trinity wallet hack - status update,1,f6akgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/f6akgu/iota_trinity_wallet_hack_status_update/,2020-02-20 00:28:40,"A short update about the current situation. 1. As a reminder, ALL TRINITY USERS WHO OPENED TRINITY BETWEEN 17 DECEMBER 2019 AND 18 FEBRUARY 2020 WILL NEED TO USE THE SEED MIGRATION TOOL IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR TOKENS. We are still working on building and testing the seed migration tool. We will inform you here as soon as it is ready. 2. Last night we released an updated mobile wallet for both iOS and Android. Please visit the App Store or Play Store respectively to download it or update your current version. While, as of now, we have no indication that mobile users were affected by the attack, out of an abundance of caution, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT EVEN MOBILE WALLET USERS CHANGE THEIR PASSWORD AND USE THE SEED MIGRATION TOOL AS SOON AS ITS AVAILABLE. 3. Trinity users who have already updated their wallets will have noticed the removal of MoonPay services from the updated versions of the wallet. This was necessary because the security vulnerability was introduced into the Trinity wallet via the MoonPay integration. We are working on an incident report in which we will publicly disclose the details of the vulnerability, how it was introduced, how it was exploited, and the steps we are taking to improve our security practices as a whole. 4. We have received requests from several users to provide information as to whether any Trinity users credit card information might have been compromised in connection with this security incident. Moonpay provides payment processing as a function of its own platform, which is independent of Trinity. For now, we can only share with the community the below statement from Moonpay on this matter. Please note that the IOTA Foundation is not in a position to independently verify the accuracy of the statement, due to the fact that the evidence to support it is not in our possession. MoonPay Statement to Customers on Credit Card Information MoonPay, as a partner of Trinity Wallet, has been working with the IOTA Foundation and third-party experts to assist with the ongoing investigation. At this time, as the payment processor of the Trinity Wallet, we want to inform users who have input their credit card details into the Trinity Wallet that, to the best of our knowledge, their credit card information is unlikely to have been compromised by this security incident. Credit card details are encrypted and processed in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. However, until the investigation has been completed, we would like to ask users who purchased Miota using the Trinity Wallet to monitor their statements and report any suspicious activity they observe to their banks immediately. 5. We are constantly in contact with law enforcement in several countries and are working closely with them to ensure fast and thorough investigations. If youre an affected user, we would greatly appreciate it if you could please file a report with your local police, as this will help us with the criminal investigations. In most countries you can quickly file a report online. We recommend that you include in your report the following German case file number so that the authorities in your country can quickly get in touch with the other authorities already working on the investigation elsewhere: Germany, Center for Cybercrime, Case Number: 200213-1717-i00290 6. We are still refining the remediation plan in light of continuously updated information and will provide further details as soon as we can. Thank you all for your patience. We will continue to update you on all important developments as we are able."
2,cybercrime,CryptoCurrency,What are AML/KYC for?,1,d970f1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/d970f1/what_are_amlkyc_for/,2019-09-26 04:01:44,"The modern world is increasingly striving to remove anonymity from cryptocurrency circulation. Client identification is a big problem for blockchain companies today. The KYC / AML rules, offering their solution to the problem of identification, ensure the acceptance of cryptocurrencies in society, but on the other hand, they cause a conflict between users and regulators. SwapSpace explains what the contradiction consists of, what the terms are themselves, how to pass verification on the exchange with KYC / AML requirements and what exchangers stay anonymous. **Know your customer, (KYC)** is a term of banking and exchange regulation for financial institutions and bookmakers, as well as other companies working with private money, which means that they must identify the counterparty before conducting a transaction. Such practice prevents money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. The KYC implementation led to the gradual prohibition of servicing anonymous bank accounts. KYC procedures are created to help financial institutions better verify their customers and monitor transaction risks. Among them, the main ones can be distinguished:  customer identification procedures (obtaining passport data, birth certificate, etc.);  transaction tracking;  risk management (comparison of data on the quantity, the content of transfers, counterparties, material support, etc.). **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** is a more extensive term than firstly means anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing and counter-weapons of mass destruction financing. The AML process includes:  Monitoring of transactions worth more than $10.000;  A requirement to report certain types of transactions;  Control the movement of coins both abroad and within the country;  Obtaining KYC information to confirm a persons identity, and to check whether he was involved in illegal activities. These steps should help identify and seize illegal funds and prevent scam. **Similarities and differences** Often the terms are confused or used interchangeably, but its incorrect.  regulatory authorities will use the terms AML, viz. anti-money laundering and terrorist financing;  sellers of goods and services often refer to the term KYC commitment. Customer identification (KYC) is a component of the AML. You can call KYC a set of procedures and tools, a principle in the framework of the general AML policy. N.B.: the terms KYC and AML are primarily associated with the social responsibility of the business, with protection against fraud risks. Often they are found in contracts of companies from countries where there are legislative restrictions, state control over business entities. **AML/KYC in the crypto sphere** Blockchain technology has brought a problem to the financial sector. Most cryptocurrency transactions are made remotely and anonymously. Even though transactions in the traditional system are made open: the appearance and signature of the client can always be compared with the passport data. The advent of cryptocurrencies has expanded the market for financial instruments and brought the necessity of regulation. At first, cryptocurrency privacy policy was a distinctive feature, however, the necessary of transaction safety led to toughening requirements for personalization of users. The KYC and AML norms are also the main obstacle to crypto protection, as they contradict one of the fundamental ideas of the blockchain - anonymity. In other words, cryptocurrency transactions must be anonymous and inaccessible for tracking. But since regulators are preoccupied with the problem of cybercrime. Thats why now the verification requirement on cryptocurrency exchanges is becoming important. **AML/KYC at SwapSpace** There are no AML/KYC procedures on SwapSpace itself, we dont even have registration. However, we are an aggregator that integrates several swap services, some of them are completely anonymous, but others could ask an ID. We dont provide transactions on our own, F.e. Changelly uses AML/KYC. ChangeNOW doesn't require your data, but in particular cases, they could ask you to show your ID document scan or some extra information. You may exchange currencies at anonymous registration-free exchangers or choose the safest way if you think so. Our service provides both - just choose the most suitable way to exchange. &gt;*SwapSpace team is always ready for discussion.* *You can drop an email about your suggestions and questions to* [support@swapspace.co](mailto:support@swapspace.co) *Join our social networks:*[ Twitter](URL Medium](URL Facebook](URL *The best rates on* [URL"

Bitcoin and smaller coins are a safer way to keep your stash safe, to shop around the Web, and to use on your daily necessities, if gas stations would accept cryptocurrency. That would stop millions of dollars worth of scams at the pumps and markets. With compromised credit cards and data breaches often in the news in the past couple of years, fraud is on top of mind with many people. Though EMVchip cards have made some payments safer, experts predict fraud  specifically card-not-present fraud  will remain a growing problem for years to come. For 2017 and 2018, identity theft statistics have taken center stage among the many stats and facts encompassing the entire realm of cybercrime. While ransomware gains more attention, identity theft remains much easier to pull off and monetize. One more point in the scoring board making cryptocurrency a better choice. It is ridiculous the amount of bad news, bad fame, and shit many ignorant people post on their sites, print on their news papers, and spend hours on tv and radio criticizing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Its like they have a mission. A mission that tries to destroy the solution to world currency stress and bring a clear view for the people of the money that comes in and the money that comes out. Perhaps the solution to world hunger. There is no comparison between crypto crimes and the amount of money that was stolen since the existence of gold, silver, and FIAT money since the beginning of time. There must be a more Sinister plan behind all this negativity, lies, and bullshit. Because crypto Is a better currency. Behind these monsters must be money and greed, there is no way big news sites such as the New York post, CNN, CNN en Espaol have not ever accepted a single cent to keep their mouth shut, on any story, please..

Who tried to coordinate a sell of the illegally obtained original Ether to coordinate crashing the price of the original Ethereum to convince users to adopt their new version of Ethereum that has features to enable the Ethereum Foundation to change any past transaction, stop smart contracts, allow third parties to replace the code of a smart contract. Due to gross negligence of Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit promoting and trading a security created on their cryptocurrency Ethereum called DAO, collaborating with the swiss SA Bity and the German company Slock.it created a security contract and sold according to wikipedia 160,000,000 USD worth of the newly created security for the cryptocurrency Ether. Source: URL After being informed by security researchers a bug in the contract had been found both Bity SA and Slock.it continued to promote the security, ignoring the risk. If you look at the forum.daohub.org community you can clearly see, they see it as a security threads like ""Is profit from DAO investment unlikely?"" The contract they created can be found here: URL Source: URL Source: URL Statistical analysis was done on purchasers of the DAO security, using blockchain data. It was determined ""The wealthy few (top 1% of addresses) control over 55% of the voting power of proposals, while everyone who contributed 100 Ether or less (more than 66%) control barely over 2% of the total tokens."" Source: URL After the exploit was reported and disregarded by the operators an anonymous entity used the exploit to steal 1/3rd of the cryptocurrency that was used to buy the security. Worth est. 50,000,000 USD worth of Ether at the time. After the exploit was used, Vitalik Buterin, the leader of the Ethereum Foundation, trying to encourage buying said ""@junseth I will provide my opinion in the way that @Truthcoin would approve of: I have been buying DAO tokens since the security news"" Source: URL Anyone with knowledge in finance would immediately ask, why is the leader of a project that just had 50 million dollars worth of securities stolen, continue to buy those securities? The answer is because Vitalik Buterin had not yet announced it, but had already unilaterally decided that they would be creating a hard fork, essentially creating a new version of the Ether cryptocurrency and modifying the contract to stop it, and replace it with different code. The original Ether would still exist, but they would start a new one alongside it. Invalidating the claim on their website that Ethereum: ""Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference."" Source: URL Despite pretending this decision was made by the community, the entire decision process was centralized to the Ethereum Foundation internal private chats. Later it would come out with chat logs between the exchange operators after the event and even more later in pull requests from the Foundation that internal chats had decided the entire thing long before it was announced. So when Vitalik Buterin was buying DAO tokens, he had already known he would soft or hard, regardless of the stakeholders. Chat log between Ethereum Foundation and Exchange Operators You can validate the authenticity of this chat log easily by talking to the exchange operators, they operate: URL , URL URL URL Source: URL Comments on code published clearly state that decision to implement the hard fork in the client used by roughly 95%+ would be defaulting to the option that benefited them the most financially. The deciding factor it would be implemented because the majority of users do not even know how to change the setting. ""default behavior of Geth to be pro-fork as per internal discussions"" Source: URL While they implemented this they started a back up plan where the Ethereum Foundation, Slock.it GBMH and Bity SA worked anonymously as a hacking group named ""The White Hat Group"" or ""Robin Hood Group"" (WHG or RHG). They captured 2/3rd of the Ether that was in the DAO security using the same exploit the original exploiter did. This plays a very important part later but because there was a fork, advertising efforts were made to brand the new copy of Ethereum with changes to one contract as the real Ether while many people continued to use the same Ether The Ethereum Foundation had sold them in the crowdsale. The speculated reason for breaking their system, creating an entire new one is due the massive loss taken by the 1% of DAO owners. The Ethereum Foundation actively promoted the DAO security on their blog, the inventors of Ethereum both Gavin Wood and Vitalik Buterin became ""curators"", claiming they would check every contract for errors making sure the DAO was secure.The Ethereum Foundation having pitched sales of the DAO to wealthy investors from the financial sector had to answer to them when the contract they were supposed to check, failed. Knowing they would lose all their instituational investment from the Financial industry they created a new Ethereum that was fundamentally different than Ethereum. Some people in the Ethereum community began to call this new version Ethereum hard fork, or ETF. This new ETF Ethereum had features that allowed the developers to change old transactions, stop applications, and allowed third parties (them) to arbitrary change out the code in a contract. This made ETF distinctly different than the Ethereum that much of the community continued using that they originally received directly from the Ethereum Foundation during the crowdsale. It did not match any of the advertising about unstoppable applications, but the original Ethereum didn't have all these new features that changed it into essentially the opposite of the description of Ethereum. So people wanting unstoppable applications, with no third party interference and censorship resistence just kept using Ethereum, trading it and building with it. Then the Ethereum Foundation, Slock.it GMBH and Bity SA used the exploit used by the hacker that led to the hard fork to get control of the 7,000,000 Ether they wrestled from the hacker before the fork. Without telling anyone they begin to launder the money. They did this by splitting the amount into smaller amounts and sending it to random addresses they created before sending it to the markets. But because it was done poorly it was quickly determined where it was going, to currency exchanges to be sold. Source: URL Before some exchanges managed to freeze their accounts, they had successfully sold off large amounts of the stolen ETH to buy a new asset/security that was recently created, which they hold significant portion of total security/token. Source: URL The ""White Hat Group"" moved large amounts of the original Ether to exchanges and coordinated a mass sell trying to crash the price. The goal was to crash the price and convince people still using the original Ethereum that they had no choice. Leaked Skype chat logs from the private Ethereum Foundation internal chat were leaked showing they were in fact colluding to control the price and force the community to follow the decision they unilaterly made. If all the chat logs could be obtained from Skype it would be very clear to what extent the collusion and illegal usage of the Ethereum Foundation. In the private chat of the supposedly non-profit Ethereum Foudnation Skype channel, they are seen colluding control the price of the competing original Ethereum. Chat logs from leaked Ethereum Foundation chat log indicating they were colluding to control the price of competing the original Ethereum. Source: URL In the chat logs, Jeffrey Wilcke and Fabian Vogelsteller can both be seen discussing ways to use the resources of the non-profit Ethereum Foundation to control the price of the original Ethereum and the new Ethereum. Owning significant amounts of the new Ethereum. This is not an isolated incident of Ethereum Foundation using their insider knowledge from operating the non-profit to make purchasing decisions. Vitalik Buterin of the Ethereum Foundation, shortly after the hack but before he announced there would be a hard fork announced he was buying DAO security/tokens on Twitter. This is the exact opposite of decentralized governance, depsite operating as a Swiss non-profit with money raised by the community crowd sale for the ""mission to promote and support research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols"". Source: URL There are likely more crimes actively happening but we only know of this because the currency exchange operators froze some of the ""White Hat Group"" accounts due to suspicious activity. This forced the ""White Hat Group"" to reveal themselves. It would be best to talk to Kraken.com and Poloneix.com, both exchanges who froze assets of the ""White Hat Group"" members after their attempts to launder and sell the cryptocurrency. Ursium on reddit is Slock.it COO Stephan Tual creator of ""The DAO"" security, who originally designed with the intention to fund his businesses including Slock.it. Clearly named Ethereum Foundation devs as the first people on the list of the ""White Hat Group"" and included his own company Slock.it. Notice the ordering, the Ethereum Foundation is the first one listed when talking about the ""White Hat Group"". ""Bit more info: this isn't spur of the moment. A lot of people have worked around the clock for several days now to prepare for this. The community (individuals from the eth foundation, devs, security experts, ethcore, slock, etc) all came together to organize a response, which is currently ongoing."" Source: URL Alex Van De Sande, or avsa on reddit and twitter, of the Swiss non-profit The Ethereum foundation is now denying any responsibility, or association, likely because of the legal fallout of recent events. But Alex was clearly involved with organizing the white hat group clearly was involved with organizing. He was seen organizing on reddit.com/r/ethereum as seen in the screen shot below. Source: URL And more reddit posts with the titles ""We are doing a white hat attack on the DAO."" by avsa. Source: URL Alex of the Swiss non-profit the Ethereum foundation even goes further on reddit, tell people specifically to not to sell the DAO security they had previously promoted heavily on the Ethereum Foundation blog. Stating is actively being hacked by them. We here could mean presumably the ""White Hat Group"" or the Ethereum Foundation. ""We are doing a white hat attack. More news to follow. Do not panic. Do not sell."" URL He was seen organizing on twitter.com, claiming it was ""our white hat counter attack"", presumably he means the ""White Hat Group"" but the Ethereum Foundation. And from twitter he stated during the first use of the exploit by the ""White Hat Group"", clearly having insider knowledge by being in the internal private Ethereum Foundation chat. ""alex van de sande @avsa Jun 21 DAO IS BEING SECURELY DRAINED. DO NOT PANIC."" ""alex van de sande @avsa Jun 21 I repeat. There was an attack on the DAO so we launched **our** white hat counter attack. More updates will follow"" (Emphasis is mine on 'our') What is clear by all this that the recent claims that Alex Van De Sande has nothing to do with the ""White Hat Group"" is an obviously lie. While there is no evidence he was active participant in the laundering or selling of the original Ether cryptocurrency for the new version in collaboration Bity SA is not clear. What is claer, is there is evidence from a leaked Ethereum Foundation skype chat that they were actively t rying to manipulate the price of the original Ethereum cryptocurrency to force investors to buy the new Ethereum they promoted. This original Ethereum cryptocurrency never stopped being used by its community, even if the Ethereum Foundation actively tried to manipulate pulbic opinion. The exact same cryptocurrency they told exchanges was worthless, was being traded for almost 2 USD per coin. This was also the exact same cryptocurrency they worked with Bity SA and Slock.it GMBH to steal millions of USD worth and dump on the market. The primary purpose of the blockchain which cryptocurrencies are built on is to prevent modificaiton of past transactions to prevent double spending. The Ethereum Foundation added the ability to modify past transactions, to stop applications and allow third party interference so they could replace the DAO code. In doing that they no longer were working on Ethereum, and Ethereum never stopped being used or valued even if they did not want it to. They got upset and then commited theft, fraud to manipulate the markets and force their centralized unilateral decision on the whole community. The Ethereum Foundation lied to exchanges, telling them no one is still using the original Ethereum network, despite massive arguments in the Ethereum forum ongoing for a month, where many people said they wanted to 'stay on the original Ethereum. One person even wrote a manifesto, convincing others that staying is the only way for Ethereum, the one they were advertised and bought in the crowd sale, could continue existing. Please start an investigation, please stop these three organizations from operating a corrupt system where they take no risks, because they can rewrite history, where they get to decide for everyone which one is ""real"" even if others are actively using, trading and programming the original Ethereum all along. Using an exploit to illegally seize the securities they created on the cryptocurrency Ethereum is theft. We are sending this request to you, with copies to the SECs distribution list for this proceeding as noted in the cc below. [My/Our] particular rights, duties, privileges, immunities or other substantial interests that may be affected if the SEC does not act immediately, start an investigation and work with Swiss Federal Police. Swiss Federal office of police actively encourages people to report corruption. They have built a special hotline, corruption they want reported includes: ""non-profit organisations (such as associations or foundations) in order to gain an unjustifiable material or immaterial advantage."" Report to Swiss Federal Police URL Evidence that Ethereum has been abusing their non-profit for unjustifiable advantage is more than clear, as they commit massive crimes hoping the system is too complex for them to ever be investigated.
