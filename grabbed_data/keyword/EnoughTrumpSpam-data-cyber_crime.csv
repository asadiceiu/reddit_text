As more and more states refused to comply with what Trump described as his very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL, he questioned, What are they trying to hide? 2. By midweek, 44 states and DC refused to provide some or all of the voter roll data requested by Trumps Election Integrity Commission. 3.

A Maryland official, Deputy SoS Luis Borunda, resigned from Trumps commission. 6. Several experts on the regulatory process told The Hill that Trumps commission may have violated the law by failing to submit the requests to states through OIRA, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act. 7. A DOJ letter sent to 44 states election officials on the same day Kobach and Pence made their requests, asks states to detail their compliance with the NVRA. This request also raised concerns about voter purging. 8. At a rally in DC Saturday night, Trump continued his attacks on the fake media, saying, Im President and theyre not. 9. On Sunday, Trump tweeted a video created by a Reddit user from both his personal account and the official @POTUS account, showing him violently wrestling down a person whose face is the CNN logo. 10. The Reddit user was named HanAssholeSolo and his posts were full of anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic and other white supremacists materials. 11. The Reddit user later apologized, but Trump did not.

Per Week 33, David Pecker, owner of National Enquirer is also interested in Time Inc. 18. Maddow reported that TRMS was sent a forged NSA document.

Maddow said that other media outlets may also be receiving forged documents as well, citing recently retracted stories at CNN and Vice. 20. POLITICO reported on the Trump regimes obsessive crackdown on leaks from the intelligence community, which has led to an increasingly tense and paranoid working environment in the national security community. 21.

In a 53 page memo to the court, Trump attorney Kasowitz argued for the dismissal of a sexual harassment lawsuit against Trump, claiming Trump cannot be sued in state court while in office. 34.

The online real estate investment company has a value of $800mm. 54.

Trump Organization renewed more than 1k web domains, including many which refer to Trump and Russia, like TrumpTowerMoscow.com., indicating possible interest in future development. 57. Axios reported that Russian government-owned Sputnik news is coming to the DC airwaves after taking over a FM radio station. The FCC has not yet been notified according to a spokesperson. 58. Matt Tait, who is cited in the WSJ story on possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia on Hillarys deleted emails, wrote an op-ed, The Time I Got Recruited to Collude with the Russians, to tell his story. 59. Tait said it was clear to him that Smith knew Flynn and his son, well, and that they knew the dark web was likely Russia but didnt care. Tait warned it could be part of a wider Russian campaign against the US. 60. Tait also received a document titled A Demonstrative Pedagogical Summary to be Developed and Released Prior to November 8, 2016, which list four groups involved, including group one which listed: Bannon, Conway, Clovis, Flynn and Lisa Nelson. 61.

The company also serves as a subcontractor for US federal software contracts, and was used by the DNC last summer. 63. CNN reported that Russia is stepping up spying efforts in the US post the US elections. Officials cited said Russia feels emboldened by the lack of a significant retaliatory response by Trump and Obama. 64. US Intel estimates that Russia has 150 operatives in the US. Since the election, many have tried to sneak in under the guise of business. 65. Strangely, the State Dept reportedly continues to grant temporary duty visas to suspected Russian intelligence officers, despite knowledge. 66. AP reported on a lawsuit filed by Coalition for Good Governance, saying Georgias 6th Congressional election results should be voided because of previously identified problem with the touchscreen voting system. 67.

Pew Research found that 17 of the 19 G20 countries in their survey look to Merkel, not Trump, to lead in world affairs. 74. Guardian reported Trump considered a sneak visit to Downing Street in order to avoid massive UK protests en route to or from the G20 summit. After the story broke, the WH said Trump would not visit. 75. Instead, on his way to the G20, Trump chose to stop off at Poland, despite the new far-right governments authoritarian leanings including cracking down on judges and the media. 76. AP reported the Polish government promised the WH cheering crowds as part of the invitation. Members of the ruling party and pro-government activists bussed in groups of people for Trumps speech. 77. Trump gave another of his dystopian speeches in Poland, saying Western civilization was at risk of decline because of radical Islamic terrorism and government bureaucracy. 78. At a news conference in Poland, Trump said he thinks meddling in the US election was done by Russia, but it could have been other people in other countries and that nobody really knows for sure. 79. Also on his trip to Poland, Trump continued to dismiss and belittle US intelligence, saying, Do we even have seventeen intelligence agencies? 80. The day before Trump was set to meet with Putin, seemingly as a bargaining chip, The Moscow Times reported the Russian embassy to the US is accusing the US of kidnapping a man accused of cyber-fraud. 81. Ahead of his meeting with Putin, top Senate Democrats sent a letter to Trump saying not raising Russias interference in our election would be a severe dereliction of the duty of the office to which you were elected. 82.

Only Tillerson and Trump were present from the US side, despite media speculation that McMaster and Fiona Hill would be included. 87. Lavrov and Tillerson gave different accounts of what happened behind closed doors. Lavrov said Trump told Putin some circles in America were exaggerating allegations of Russian interference in the US election. 88. Sally Yates tweeted Trumps refusal to confirm Russian interference insults career intel pros &amp; hinders our ability to prevent in future. 89. Tillersons version differed, but both said they agreed to put whatever happened behind them: There was not a lot of re-litigating of the past. Tillerson added, This is a very important relationship. 90. Russia faces no consequences from Trump for interfering in our election. It was unclear if Trump returned the two Russian compounds seized by Obama as punishment for Russia interfering in our election. 91. In an op-ed, Trump Caves to Putin, conservative journalist Stephen Hayes laid out an indictment of how Trump bowed to Putin on Russian interference and foreign policy. Elected Republicans however were silent. 92. AP reported Saturday that Putin said, he thinks Trump believes his denial of Russian meddling in US vote, but better to ask Trump himself. 93. Ivanka took her fathers seat at a G20 meeting on Saturday. Normally, government ministers or senior officials would take such a role. 94. Trump isolated the US from other G20 countries on a series of policies ranging from climate to free trade. 95. The US abstained from signing onto the G20 communique on climate-related issues, the sole country at the summit to do so. 96.

3,cyber crime,EnoughTrumpSpam,"""Some 400lb Guy on His Bed"" - the compelling evidence that Russia is behind the DNC attacks, as well as many others worldwide - Timeline",28,5km76z,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/5km76z/some_400lb_guy_on_his_bed_the_compelling_evidence/,2016-12-28 08:24:05,"#My Purpose# --- It has been often and repeatedly claimed that 'there's no evidence', 'there's no consensus', and 'the evidence is weak' that Russia is linked to hacking targetting the Democratic Party and the campaign of Hillary Clinton. As I found in attempting to 'connect the dots' via a simple timeline, a shape begins to appear that ought to concern any American. Even though we lack the ability to put everything under an X-ray and validate it, the appearance is that mysterious sources like Guccifer, DCLeaks or Wikileaks have behind the scenes links to whoever is responsible for an extremely sophisticated and effective worldwide hacking campaign, and that they both may have suspicious but difficult to deny links to the Trump campaign itself. At the very least, the President-elect cannot deny that ""APT28"", or ""Fancy Bear"" is a major threat to the free world; if he wants to continue to pretend it isn't Russia, then he must confront who it actually is. (It's Russia.) The hacking is not benign and 'just for laughs'. It's military in nature, and serious. My purpose is not to provide a legal standard of proof 'beyond reasonable doubt.' When bullets fly, it isn't always necessary to trace them back to the barrel of an enemy gun, when bombs explode it isn't necessary to reverse the trajectory and track them to an enemy plane overhead - at some point things become quite obvious, and this is that point. We have the means and motive, we have the substance. We have the accused throwing back combative denials. Russia in this case knows that its tracks are covered... and they can afford to deny until indisputable evidence appears, at which point the lie is justified by the reality. ""Of course I bit you. You knew I was a snake."" The story is multidimensional in that the Russian intelligence agencies - in the guise of Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear - launch attacks worldwide, with the only common thread being that they are either attacking or exploiting groups or nations that are very specific to Russian foreign policy goals. My focus is primarily to follow the thread associated with the US Election, although by following other threads there is plenty to discover with regards to attacks on Ukraine, Turkey, or others. Also, it bears notice that we only know what is publicly reported; 'consider the source' always applies, and it is always possible that Russia is being skilfully 'framed', although the mountain of evidence grows. There are also undoubtedly hacks not discovered or reported. My goal is to follow the verifiable truth, not an agenda. If you are aware of any better (linkable) sources for certain facts please make me aware, in most cases I am looking for the earliest contemporary media source, and where analysis is available, to get it directly 'from the horses mouth' as the media is horrendous about garbling information. If you are aware of any mistaken logic or contradictory information, please let me know. ##THE TIMELINE## --- #Prologue (2007-2015)# --- **August 3, 2011** - According to emails released under FOIA, [Hillary Clinton's clintonemail private address is targetted by 5 spoofed emails](URL from ""New York State Department of Motor Vehicles"" claiming a traffic violation.

It is unknown if this mistake of wording led Podesta or one of his staff to access the link and provide the password to the attackers. **March 21** - The date of the last emails in the Podesta email release Part 1 on Wikileaks. Although there is a possibility that Wikileaks (or the hacker, or middlemen) have additional emails which were not released, the date seems to indicate that Podesta's email may have been secured shortly after breach, and the hacker may only have been able to pull historical emails up to this date. The emails would not be released until October. **March 22** - a Spearphishing email is received by Billy Rinehart, a regional field director for the DNC. The email, [later analyzed by ThreatConnect](URL is traced to being sent from a Russian webmail provider, Yandex. It uses the same bitly links and domains and even the same format and the same *Ukrainian IP source address* as the Podesta spearphish. **Late March** - Per [TheSmokingGun](URL this is the timeframe in which Sarah Hamilton's gmail account is targetted by spearphishing. The emails would not be strategically leaked to TheSmokingGun.com until June, and released to the public July 13. **April** - According to analysis by Crowdstrike, the group known as APT28 or ""Fancy Bear"" infiltrates the DNC network, which is already infiltrated by ""Cozy Bear"". The evidence indicates that they may not know of each other's presence and are not cooperating. **April 10** - DCLeaks website has its first (private) post containing emails from the account of Air Force Gen Philip Breedlove, the head of US and NATO forces until his resignation in May. It is apparent that this post was timestamped prior to the public registration and promotion of the website. **April 19** - the DCLeaks.com website is registered. The site claims to be founded by ""the American hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech, human rights and government of the people."" Site content relies largely on information copied and pasted from Wikipedia. According to analysis, the site is registered through Romania and probably hosted in Malaysia. Although DCLeaks has no public promotion activity until June, it is apparent from later reports that hackers are using it to collect and post selected emails obtained by hacking Washington insiders, and in some cases are using it to privately leak to small online news websites. **May 3** - Ali Chalupa, a DNC staffer, comments in an email \([later released by Wikileaks](URL that she has received security alerts from Yahoo indicating that her account is the target of 'state sponsored actors'. **May 9** - Judge Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News commenter, makes an unsubstantiated claim - [""Theres a debate going on in the Kremlin between the Foreign Ministry and the Intelligence Services about whether they should release the 20,000 of Mrs. Clintons emails that they have hacked into.""](URL At the time, neither the DNC, DCCC, or Podesta email hacks have been revealed, and the comment seems to be referencing Hillary Clinton's State Department emails, but specifically refers to Russian hackers.

The emails date from October 2015 and are a smattering of little political interest, including individual donors responding to fundraising event RSVPs. None of the emails are actually from the RNC ""Party"" Employees, but are from various state and campaign volunteers. The bylines do not offer an indication of whose account was compromised. According to later analysis by TheSmokingGun, the common thread appears to be that all of these GOP entities contracted IT with [a Tennessee firm called Smartech,](URL for web or email hosting.

""Guccifer 2.0"", the faceless online personality later claiming credit for the hack, claimed that he gained access through ""NGP-VAN"", the 3rd party voter database which is used by the DNC and individual campaigns. Guccifer's explanation of the hack is basically a gobbledegook of hacker jargon but does not stand up to scrutiny.

4,cyber crime,EnoughTrumpSpam,Culminating Analysis of DNC/DCCC/Soros/Colin-Powell/NATO-General-Breedlove/NSA-Equation-Group/Podesta Leaks and Hacks,6,5bhf48,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/5bhf48/culminating_analysis_of/,2016-11-07 06:11:34,"It has been a running theme lately that the U.S. government blaming Russia for the DNC/Podesta leaks is an attempt at deflection and is false. In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source. The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts: &gt;At six o'clock on the morning of May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch woke up in a Los Angeles hotel to an alarming email. Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network. &gt;Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked. &gt;The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence. &gt;Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing. &gt;Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says. &gt;For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Cho. &gt;... &gt;Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy."" &gt;The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!"" &gt;an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion. &gt;Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC."" &gt;Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. votersa first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' "" &gt;... &gt;Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author. &gt;Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress. &gt;... &gt;Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me. Source: [The Russian Expat Leading the Fight to Protect America](URL The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks: &gt;It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podestas email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other peoplesprimarily governmentsattribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. Were talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. &gt;Weve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that its connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, which is also known as Fancy Bear. From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they dont work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that. &gt;There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devicesoverriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldnt be started up again, or so that the switches couldnt come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. Whats interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and were much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult. &gt;&gt;Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia? &gt;Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCsby looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. &gt;Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trumps nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that its not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election. Source: [Cybersecurity Expert: Proof Russia Behind DNC, Podesta Hacks ](URL Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this: &gt;In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website that allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1). &gt;[Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL.](URL &gt;Recipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat actors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account. &gt;[Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page.](URL &gt;**Encoded target details** &gt;Analysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded Base64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target clicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the individuals email address. &gt;[Figure 3. Spearphishing URL.](URL &gt;[Table 1. Decoded Base64 values from the phishing URL used by TG-4127.](URL &gt;**Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service** &gt;A Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4). &gt;[Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL.](URL &gt;Using a tool on Bitlys website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing URL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed that it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts. &gt;[Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. ](URL &gt;**Target analysis** &gt;CTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the threat groups intent. &gt;**Focus on Russia and former Soviet states** &gt;Most of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former Soviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russias military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia. &gt;**Other targets worldwide** &gt;Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories: &gt;* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%) &gt;* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%) &gt;TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government. &gt;[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](URL &gt;**Authors and journalists** &gt;More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the targets spouse. &gt;[Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. ](URL &gt;**Government supply chain** &gt;CTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of organizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals access to and knowledge of government clients information. &gt;[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](URL &gt;**Government / military personnel** &gt;TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9). &gt;[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](URL &gt;TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assads regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations. &gt;**Success of the phishing campaign** &gt;CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful. &gt;Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful. Source: [Threat Group-4127 Targets Google Accounts](URL Here's another article by SecureWorks: &gt;**Spearphishing details** &gt;The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access. &gt;**Hillary for America** &gt;TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account. &gt;[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](URL &gt;CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity. &gt;The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles: &gt; * National political director &gt; * Finance director &gt; * Director of strategic communications &gt; * Director of scheduling &gt; * Director of travel &gt; * Traveling press secretary &gt; * Travel coordinator &gt;Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times. &gt;**Democratic National Committee** &gt;CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network. &gt;**Personal email accounts** &gt;CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once. &gt;**Related activity and implications** &gt;Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now. &gt;Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points. &gt;Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services cant realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose. Do you need more proof? &gt;--- &gt; dont want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians. &gt;As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words dont meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce. &gt;Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear. &gt;Anyway that doesnt mean that I support him. Im totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. Its a nonsense, absolute bullshit. &gt;I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him! &gt;--- &gt;Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce. &gt;--- &gt;As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you? &gt;--- &gt;It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds. &gt;--- &gt;I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I wont be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trumps financial docs. No doubt who could give them. &gt;--- &gt;Id like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies. &gt;As Ive already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities. &gt;I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly. &gt;I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

I first found out about The_Donald, the alt right and pretty much everything else that is screwed up about this election through my experience with online trolls during the whole ""Ghostbusters"" fiasco. One day, the Ghostbusters subreddit was suddenly taken over by misogynist anti-Ghostbusters trolls that used terms like ""cucks"" and threw the name ""Milo"" around a lot. So, I researched Milo Yianopoulos and my mind was blown when I realize that Gamergate, anti-Ghostbusters AND crazy Trump supporters that use the word ""cuck"" a lot online and hate women were ALL connected through the common thread known as MILO. This was all Milo's fault! He was the ring-leader! (I thought) Then I learned about BREITBART and the ALT RIGHT and was even more surprised to learn that Nigel Farage, Brexit, Trump, and Milo were all linked together by their common goals of misogyny, anti-globalism, anti-Islam, etc. through the common thread of the ""ALT RIGHT"" and that they all seemed to simultaneously be swirling around the disgusting online publication known as BREITBART. This was all Breitbart's fault! BREITBART was behind all the insanity recently! (or so I thought) Then I began occasionally noticing the presence of Russian online trolls on Reddit and online news sites. Whenever a huge news story that looked bad for Russia came out, there would be a sudden surge of pro-Russian trolls in /r/Worldnews and suddenly all the top comments would be stuff like ""This is just an unfair article from an anti-Russian propaganda site!"" or ""The US shouldn't be in Syria anyway"" or ""NATO is a crime. Why is our government backing NATO? They are just bullying Russia! No wonder Russia is mad... they have a right to protect themselves!"" I found out about the Russian Web Brigades and suddenly all that trolling made a lot more sense. URL ""Their campaigns of disinformation sound very similar to all the sorts of strategies being used by The_Dumbass"" I thought to myself. And also other parts of the Alt Right (vote manipulation and brigading to influence the score of Ghostbusters on IMDB, trailer, online discussion, etc). Then I found an article about a journalist doing a story on pro-Kremlin trolls that are paid by the Russian government. In December of 2015, he said that he noticed many of the Russian-paid professional trolls he was tracking had suddenly switched over to pro-Trump accounts. URL Then I found at that Putin has been using disinformation campaigns to influence the elections of several European countries, including involvement with Brexit and Le Penn in France. The interests of Putin and the goals of Breitbart and the Alt Right seem to line up pretty well. URL So, this might all be RUSSIA and PUTIN's doing! Russia has been systematically trying to install governments throughout Europe that are ""anti-Globalist"", ""anti-muslim"", and anti-NATO.... basically all of the things that the Alt Right also stands for. If you look at the foreign figures that have ""endorsed"" Trump officially or unofficially they seem to perfectly overlap with Putin's allies, the Alt Right and the politicians that have benefited from Russian meddling in European elections (Le Penn, Nigel ""Brexit"" Farage, ""Golden Dawn"" in Greece leader Ilias Panagiotaros). They almost seem to line up ""perfectly""... and represent pretty much ALL of Trump's foreign ""endorsements"". (look them up individually) URL However, there is one Trump endorsement that seemed to just come out of ""nowhere"" and be almost totally random. That would be KIM JONG UN's announcement that he thinks Trump is the best candidate in the US election. But then I realized that Kim Jong Un has a few common ties to this ""Putin"" tree that sprouts out into branches of Alt-Right, pro-Trump, anti-Ghostbusters, Breitbart, anti-globalists, etc that all seem to end up being interconnected to each other. Kim Jong Un has visited with Putin recently. And there is talk that they want to become allies. URL SONY was most likely hacked by a cyber attackers from NORTH KOREA in 2014 because of their anti-North Korea comedy ""The Interview"". The hackers stole a bunch of private e-mails and information and then leaked it online to damage SONY. SONY was also the company that released ""Ghostbusters"". While it wasn't ""hacked"" this time around, it was the target of what you could argue is another type of ""cyber attack"" - a huge online campaign to spread hate about the movie and ensure that it would be a flop. It's true that the movie had women in it and there is a huge presence of misogynist online trolls., so the explanation could be as simple as that. But it's interesting that they targeted this movie so specifically and basically waged all-out war on it as if this movie was the coming of the apocalypse. It could be that whoever decided to organize a campaign of online vote-manipulation, propaganda against the movie, wars on Twitter, etc. was trying to financially hurt the company because of a grudge. Perhaps this (admittedly possibly coincidental) SONY connection plus Kim Jong Un's endorsement of Trump and sudden friendliness with Putin might indicate that North Korea is also somehow involved in the craziness that is going on online during this insane presidential election?

""Trump Taj Mahal received many warnings about its deficiencies,"" said FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery. ""Like all casinos in this country, Trump Taj Mahal has a duty to help protect our financial system from being exploited by criminals, terrorists, and other bad actors. Far from meeting these expectations, poor compliance practices, over many years, left the casino and our financial system unacceptably exposed."" Trump Taj Mahal admitted that it failed to implement and maintain an effective AML program; failed to report suspicious transactions; failed to properly file required currency transaction reports; and failed to keep appropriate records as required by the BSA. Notably, Trump Taj Mahal had ample notice of these deficiencies as many of the violations from 2012 and 2010 were discovered in previous examinations. Director Shasky Calvery expressed her appreciation to the Internal Revenue Service, Small Business/Self-Employed Division, which performed the examinations of Trump Taj Mahal, for their contributions to the investigation and for their strong partnership with FinCEN. She also thanked the Commercial Litigation Branch of the U.S. Department of Justice for their assistance with this enforcement action. Trump Taj Mahal petitioned for bankruptcy in September 2014. That bankruptcy remains pending. The Bankruptcy Court approved of Trump Taj Mahals settlement on March 4, 2015. FinCEN seeks to protect the U.S. financial system from being exploited by illicit actors. Its efforts are focused on compromised financial institutions; third-party money launderers; transnational organized crime; terrorist and other security threats; significant fraud; and threats to cyber security. FinCEN has a broad array of enforcement authorities to target both domestic and foreign actors affecting the U.S. financial system. SOURCE: URL"
