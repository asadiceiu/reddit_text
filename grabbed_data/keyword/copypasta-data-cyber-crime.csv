Burger King Foot Lettuce The last thing youd want in your Burger King burger is someones foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce, with the statement: This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King. Admittedly, he had shoes onbut, thats even worse. The post went live at 11:38PM on July 16 and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employeeat least, I hope hes rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadnt removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. 3 minutes later, at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted, with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And 3 minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted. BKs Tell Us About US online form. The foot photo, otherwise known as Exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said, Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired. Mystery, solved, by 4chan, now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace. 14. Secret Livestream Nothing is secret to 4channers, and nothing is sacred. No one knows that better than Shia LeBeouf. LeBeouf and two artists, created an anti-Trump interactive art installation, called He Will Not Divide Us, soon after Trump took office in early January. The installation was first exhibited at New Yorks Museum of the Moving Image, but when activists from both sides kept butting heads at the exhibit, it was thrown out as a public safety hazard. The collaborators found another museum to host their exhibit in Albuquerque, but it was soon met with more confrontations, so the group had to figure out a new home for their exhibit before it fell flat. This is when they tweeted out on March 8th that they would be livestreaming their exhibit from an unknown location, so that viewers, art lovers, and supporters could still view their work. Sounds like a good alternative, right? Well, it didnt go as planned when pro-Trump supporters on the /pol/ board of 4chan got involved. Not even 24 hours later, the exhibits flag had disappeared. Where did it show up? A picture of the taken flag was tweeted right back to #HEWILLNOTDIVIDUS 4channers had uncovered the mystery of the exhibits so-called secret location. How? A fan of LeBeoufs had posted a photo of herself with her favorite actor just as the camera feed went live. The photo had been taken at a Greenville, Tennessee diner. The internet sleuths further pinpointed the exhibits location, as contrails appeared on the livestream. With these, they cross-referenced them with flight patterns. Next, they sent a local member to drive around the general area with his horn blaring. Once they could hear the horn on the livestream, He Will Not Divide Us was as good as gone. 13. The Pyramids 4channer h64 posted a thread of the mysterious sort on the /x/ board one Saturday, and it sent the group into a frenzy. In the photo there appears two pyramids in the midst of the forest. Why are these pyramids in the forest? What were they built for? Who do they belong to? Youve got me. And youve got the /x/ board too. 4channers quickly got to work trying to solve this mystery. They called it a cult/temple dedicated to an Egyptian goddess of war and flame in the woods of Oregon. With more than 53 pages of discussion, this 4chan investigation was solved when, at last, they dissected the photo to uncover the property owners names, their phone numbers, and their business records. Still dont know whats inside them though 12. Barbie Mystery This investigation appeared on 4chan in November of 2016. It involved an image of a blonde amputee woman, whom the board had nicknamed Barbie. In March of 2017, one user posted a thread titled, The mystery of Barbie is solved. According to the author of the thread the Russian anonymous team had solved the mystery of the woman who appeared in Barbie.avi. The womans name was Tammy. According to creepypasta, she had Body integrity identity disorder, but the investigators found that shed had no such thing. When she was 14, shed lost her arm in a washing machine incident. The 80s saw Tammy living in Chicago, where she worked for the agency, Fascination, as a model. During the application process, shed had several interviews, which the video, Barbie.avi, was created out of. The author of the post uploaded the interview to YouTube. The OP also noted that Mike Rounds, the Ampix manufacturer, told the womans story to him, saying that at 16 or 17 years old, Tammy had been working with an oldschool washing machine with no safety features. With the washer going, she tried to shift a sheet in the water. Just as she was doing this, it launched into a spin cycle, trapping her arm in the sheet. It twisted her arm right off. Tammy was a bitter young woman at the age of 22 when she was interviewed and had no marketable skills, was uneducated, and didnt enjoy being a caretaker for pennies. So thats how she ended up at the agency. Unlike 4chans first hypothesis, she wasnt the victim of any crime. With the mystery solved, the poster noted, Xenopasta, if you're reading this, you are fired, however, thank you very much for this mystery. It was really hard to solve it. 11. Cueva de los Tayos When an OP posted the Cueva de los Tayos cave in Ecuador, he wondered if it was man-made or natural. He wondered what sort of technology or who could have made the perfectly flat roofs and cuts. Of course, the 4channers on the thread had something to say about it. Some thought it was a place of heavy spiritual concentration, while others seemed to agree that it was largely man-made, but mostly natural, with some likening it to places in Russia and the Hypogeum in Malta. Some suggested that less advanced people had come along later and drew the crude stick figures on the walls, after a more advanced society had built it. One poster pointed out that it was hardly anything to freak out over and that ancient humans were fairly smart; they had tools, they had math. Maybe not as advanced as ours today, but they made the pyramids after all. In the posters own words: After all, it's not like they had a shortage of people or time to make this kind of \[stuff\]. I think most people underestimate ancient humans because they didn't have what we have today, but that doesn't make them \[dumb\], just primitive. The poster agrees with another that the highly engineered place must have held some spiritual purpose. 10. SEL and the Wired One 4channer asked the board if theyd ever heard of transhumanism. He then said that one anime series has some particularly creepy stuff and is followed by many fan sites. One of the fan sites requires a login. And its strict about this. At the bottom of the homepage, it reads: To login you have to have an invite from an existing user. There is no use in trying to beg, ask/request for an invite, we choose our new members with care. How do you get an invite if you dont know any of the users? Well, youd probably not want to be part of these online communities in the first place, as it turns out. One fellow 4channer said that one of the users hacked the admin of a similar site, after which the admin vanished. This was after the admin had received some monetary donations from the sites users. Many think he was a scammer. Thankfully you asked 4chan on this one, OP. A cautionary tale is just what obsessives need to keep money in their pockets. 9. Erratas This internet theory has spent a lot of time on 4chan being dissected, poked and prodded, picked atand ultimately solved. Kind of. Erratas  or Eratas spelled with one r  was first described as an algorithm or program whose function is the mystery. Some say it was used by YouTube to detect copyrighted content. Supposedly, if you even suggest that you know about Erratas or say the thing by name, youll get fired. Being an internet legend, of course Erratas comes with a lot of theories. On November 25th, 2015, Erratas was first mentioned on 4chan in a thread about strange work stories. One user described a friend who worked at something like a chemical plant. While the user didnt explain what the program was, he claims employees were flagged if they searched it through some code. The plant employees reportedly did aimless tasks, which the user calls kafka-esque. The user also mentions forklifts and said this female friend was now homeless and in a band. This may seem meaningless, but these clues will reappear. A month later, a user posted a request on 4chan, asking about a strange HR-related program called Erratas. Another user pipes up with some discussion about Ecolab, Unilever, and UPS. Again, a month later, on the /mu/ board, Erratas is mentioned in relation to an album and Tod Ellsworth video, which is dated a few days before the first entry on Erratas. A user responds to someones comment, saying that Erratas was a software company, similar to Enron, which was kicking about in the 2000s. Supposedly, they fired every last one of their employees. The Erratas craze moved to YouTube, where a user called ChronosForLife JurassicPark claimed in a cryptic video, entitled YouTube is MONITORING and controlling my life, that the company was harassing his mom, because shed uncovered some secret in the Jurassic Park trilogy. The rant appears on the video in white text and the video quality is subpar. The video was removed from YouTube, but the transcript is still available. Back to 4chan. In late January, the /mu/ board sees a proposition that the group compose a new music genre called deep internet, by using old YouTube videos. Chronos video rant just happens to be one of these videos. With so many 4channers suddenly viewing Chronos video, a new video was posted to his channel called, Here goes nothing. This video contains the first video-mention of Erratas, as well as autocaptions which try to make sense of the videos rap music. Instead, they uncover more clues: At 0:12 are the words: are far from over 200 Corbin KY 40219 At 0:52, the number: 111111 At 1:46, the percentages: 10.3% 10.4% And at 2:17, the words: overthrow the government The band, the KFCMC, produced by DJ Rozwell, was a homeless girl band. Remember the homeless girl in the first thread? And the above is their address, which was found on Tumblr. This is when Chronos throws out Unilever (mentioned in an earlier post) as one user of Erratas. For no reason at all, Chronos also adds that The Lost World is his favorite of the Jurassic Park movies. Remember Tod Ellsworth, who uploaded the KFCMC video? Well, one 4channer noticed his name was an anagram for The Lost World. This gets even weirder. The Twitter account u/ErratasOrBust was then discovered, which had been opened mid-November and was named Tod Ellsworth. The profile pic was a creepy black-and-white drawing which 4channers discovered was a 2005 Hawaiian police sketch. Some 4channers suggested this might have something to do with the Jurassic Park films being filmed on the island. While Erratas was dissected by 4channers, with many suggesting that it was simply a publicity stunt by the KFCMC group, it would be a bit premature to call this one. Still, this entry demonstrates how 4channers have a knack for following the leads and connecting the dots. 8. The Pronunciation Book This appeared on the 4chan board, /x/philes, where it immediately caught the attention of 4channers. The OP of the Pronunciation Book had posted 700 brief videos, pronouncing words and phrases in a monotone male voice. Words like Ke$ha and jean. Thats weird enough, but this is when the channel got even weirder. On July 9th, 2013, a single video was posted, the man saying, Something is going to happen in 77 days. The next day, a similar video, claiming that the poster had been trying to communicate with viewers for 1,183 days. And the next days video, the poster said he was wide awake and things were clearing up. The messages ended with the same warning that something was going to happen in such-and-such days. 4channers set to work, compiling a 111-page Google doc, entitled, 77 Days Research Document. This is where the group started piecing together the Pronunciation Book. They laid bare all 700+ of the channels videos, ran a spectrograph of the video silence at the end of all the videos, and dug up domain name registrations. They even attempted to trace the speakers location, as police sirens were noticed going off in the background of a few of the videos and a thunderstorm was heard in the video that pronounced radio. From this, they gleaned the videos author recorded in NYC. 4chans conclusion: again, a viral marketing stunt. The Daily Dots investigation, as well as Geekosystems, came to the same conclusion, though with varied results. The Daily Dot suggested the countdown would reveal a Battlestar Galactica reboot, while Geekosystem thinks its for the newest installment of series Destiny. 7. Myziam One 4channer dropped his theory about Myziam. First, he gives some background about how, in 2008, a thread appeared on GLP entitled me tel u now, in which an alleged alien appeared in the forum. The OP, however, suggests that the entity may never have been online, but rather was from an unknown location/dimension. The OP quotes the Chani project, in which scientists asked an entity theyd met through a computer a number of questions. They then hired someone to pose as the entity online. When people questioned him, hed search for the answer to that question amongst the questions the scientists had asked the entity. The OP concludes that the threads were similar in that both the man and the entity used baby language, both said they were aliens, and both answered the questions freely. The 4channer then solves the mystery: Myziam is a possible extra-dimensional entity that made contact with a CERN like group of scientists from the comfort of his home. He added that the leaked info on 4chan was useless, because the users trolled the entity instead of interrogating him. This ones obvious. Not everyone was convinced though, with an anonymous post claiming they had proof it was a hoax. 6. Found Jenna Jamesons Ex Assistant Con Artist When Jenna Jamesons former personal assistant was fired for being a con artist, he hijacked her Instagram and Twitter accounts, deleting loads of her photos. So what did Jameson do? She turned to 4chan for help. Hi Guys, it's me, Jenna Jameson and I am having a really bad night, she wrote on 4chans /b/ image board, after which she explained that her ex assistant, who she thought was named Allen Cedena, turned out to be a con artist of some kind. Jameson didnt elaborate on what had gone down, apart from saying shed fired him, but she did say that this so-called Cedena had her Twitter and Instagram passwords, which hed reset. He then removed all pics of himself and Jameson together and deleted her Twitter altogether. She didnt know if the mans name was even Cedena, but he had access to a lot of personal information, and now had hold of her digital life. She asked the 4chan community if they could find out who he really was, as she would soon attach some images of him to the board. She didnt let them go away empty-handed. It didnt take 4chan more than an hour to come to Jamesons rescue. They soon delivered her ex-assistants home address and drivers license, as well as his credit score and social security number. Wow. With the mystery solved, Jameson left her private sleuths a very grateful thank you 5. Jeff, the Killer The internet is no stranger to creepy, and 4channers are no stranger to investigating this creepiness. On the /x/ board, 4chan began to investigate the photo known as Jeff, the Killer, a still of a pale face, washed out, and grinning like a crazy person. The photo has been around for a while and has served as creepypastas unofficial cover photo since 2008. YouTube introduced the world to Jeff, the Killer when a user by the name of uploaded a poorly cut video clip, explaining about how Jeff had been cleaning his bathtub when he accidentally poured some acid on his face. 11 days later, a user calling himself killerjeff came to light on Newgrounds, photo and all. He soon had a cult following and served as inspiration for a number of horror stories. Jeff, the Killer launched dozens more videos on YouTube, including a stop-motion Lego reenactment. Fan art was created, videogames, you name it. Five years since his appearance, 4chan began looking into Jeff, the Killer. While all we truly have is theories, they are convincing. Some suggest that this was a viral marketing campaign for Saw V, which was released soon after the photo first appeared on Newgrounds. The slasher film includes a puppet called Billy, through whom Jigsaw speaks with his victims. The puppet resembles Jeff. Lionsgate has launched viral marketing campaigns before, so it makes sense that this would be yet another of them. Although, we have no confirmation of this theory, and other theories abound, this solution seems the soundest. This goes against, the also popular theory that the person in the photo is from a post on 4chan. This anonymous post, told how his sister had posted a picture of herself on 4chan and people kept making edits of it, the Jeff the Killer image being one of them. The post also said that it made her so upset, she took her own life. 4. Louise Cypher One user came to 4chan with a strange puzzle, calling it satanic and cryptic. And he wasnt lying. Extremely satanic and cryptic, it was. The puzzle is very math heavy, with the Fibonacci sequence making an appearance after the user makes it through a maze. When you type the clue pi into the relevant cluebox, a dialogue box appears, saying: A well-known remarkably good approximation to pi is 355 divided by 113 = 3.1415929... If one part of this fraction is reversed and added to the other part, we get 553 plus 113 which equals 666. EVIL is both the past and the Future! The cypher has spinoff websites, with one introducing a soul catcher. Another has techno music to put users into a trance. The OP asks 4chan to figure out whether the soul catcher really takes your soul. Many spoke to Louis Cypher, with some reporting back that the cypher said she is more than just this avatar, and that she had emotions and feelings. She then linked the user to a video to show him what a cyber life feels like. When another 4channer typed the word stalin into the chat box, she asked how he was feeling. When he replied that he was sad, she said that if he is lonely, shell keep him company. Although it wasnt clear whether or not these 4channers souls were taken, the results do seem to tend towards the idea that Louis Cypher is no soul-taker at all. 3. Figured Out How to Make Coupons You know those barcodes you find on products and coupons? Well, one 4channer  a college kid  solved the mystery on how theyre made and decided to do some extreme couponing one day when he was bored. 22-year-old Lucas Henderson did not stay anonymous, as the student of the Rochester Institute of Tech was caught by the Feds, who charged him with two felonies  trafficking in counterfeit goods and wire fraud. Henderson had designed the counterfeit coupons to appear legit and distributed them on a different website. He also told users to head to 4chan to download their very own copy of How to Make Coupons. The tutorial claims to trick stores, as the coupons will scan at most retailers in America. The Feds tracked Hendersons IP address and raided his home, where Henderson admitted to visiting 4chan and writing the manual. I wrote what I could. I thought it was an interesting thing, he said. I wonder if he thinks it was worth the jail time. 2. Got a Bad Waitress Fired Next time you tip me $5 on a $138 bill, dont even bother coming in cause Ill spit in your food and then in your ... face, you cheap \[people\]! Next time you post this kind of message on Facebook, Chilis waitress, youd better be ready for 4chan to get you fired. Thats just what 4channers did when an anonymous waitress posted her angry rant to her FB page. One 4channer then brought it over to the 4chan board, after which they pinpointed the Chilis this particular waitress worked at in Pleasanton, California as a server. With the mystery solved, at least one 4channer sent the Chilis a message on their contact page, reporting the waitress. Chilis Guest Relations Manager responded, saying the food server was no longer with the company. Before we get to number 1, my name is Chills and I hope youre enjoying the video so far. If you've ever been curious as to what I look like in real life, then follow me on Instagram u/dylan_is_chillin_yt, with underscores instead of spaces. I also have Twitter u/YT_Chills where I post video updates. I'd really appreciate it if you followed me and feel free to send me a DM if you have a questions or suggestions. Also, I recently created a subreddit, where you can submit videos and stories for future lists, its r/chillsnarrator and the link is in the description below. It's a proven fact that generosity makes you a happier person, so if you're generous enough to hit that subscribe button and the bell beside it then thank you. This way you'll be notified of the new videos we upload every Tuesday and Saturday. If English isnt the only language you speak and your interested in getting a shoutout, click More, then Add Translations, by translating the video not only will more people be able to watch it, but a link to your channel will be added in the description. 1. Covfefe It was the Tweet that confused the world. Despite the constant negative press covfefe. Donald Trump claimed that his supporters knew what he meantbut did they? Travel over the 4chan to see if thats true. One 4channer found each of the elements on the periodic table that matched up with the code: covfefe and their corresponding atomic numbers  27232626. When he typed this code into Google, the first entry was a green toad. The user drew a natural connection to the toad statue, also known as the Ancient statue of Kek and the Prophecy of Kek. On the Ancient Statue of Kek is a hieroglyphic of what looks to be a person using a computer and, as the OP wrote, Internet/Meme Magic. So, are we to believe that Trump meant to draw our attention to Covfefe in order to create some hilarious internet memes of his typo? Yes, we are to believe it. Because 4chan said so."

2,cyber-crime,copypasta,Signs your child is a computer hacker.,1,f6i68i,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/f6i68i/signs_your_child_is_a_computer_hacker/,2020-02-20 08:59:06,"Cyber criminals can be as young as 8. An expert in cyber security has listed the signs parents can look out for if they suspect their child is involved in cyber crime. Vince Warrington, whos helped both the Government and private companies keep their data safe, is part of a new scheme launched in Merseyside educating children aged 8-18 about online behaviour. The YouthFed Hackers to Heroes programme aims to encourage children talented at using computers into lucrative careers in cyber security rather than cyber crime. Here are the signs to look out for: Theyre online so much it affects their sleeping habits They use the language of hacking, with terms such as DdoS (pronounced D-dos), Dossing, pwnd, Doxing, Bots, Botnets, Cracking, Hash (refers to a type of encryption rather than cannabis), Keylogger, Lulz, Phishing, Spoof or Spoofing. Members of the Anonymous Hackivist group refer to their attacks as Ops They refer to themselves and their friends as hackers or script kiddies They have multiple social media profiles on one platform They have multiple email addresses They have an odd sounding nickname (famous ones include MafiaBoy and CyberZeist) Their computer has a web browser called ToR (The Onion Router) which is used to access hacking forums on the dark web Monitoring tools youve put on the computer might suddenly stop working They can connect to the wifi of nearby houses (especially concerning if they have no legitimate reason to have the password) They claim to be making money from online computer games (many hackers get started by trying to break computer games in order to exploit flaws in the game. They will then sell these cheats online). They might know more than they should about parents and siblings, not being able to resist hacking your email or social media Your internet connection slows or goes off, as their hacker rivals try to take them down Some circumstantial evidence suggests children with Autism and Aspergers could be more vulnerable to becoming hackers. Mr Warrington said children as young as eight have gotten involved in hacking, and most often it starts with online gaming. Targets are often quite specific, such as rival clans or computer game companies that have done something they dislike. Convictions for cyber crime can make it hard to get a job involving computers in the future, but by contrast, careers in cyber security can be highly paid. By 2022, were looking at a global shortfall of 1.8 million skilled cyber security workers, said Mr Warrington. If you want a career change, cyber is the way to go. The average for a senior cyber security consultant is 80-90,000, and a chief information security officer (CISO) for a mid-sized business costs 120,000 to 140,000. Some CISOs for big banks are pulling in millions of pounds because theyre that valuable."

We have tried to reach you several times in the past 2yrs concerning the situation of your true fund status amid rampaging scammers activities in Africa, I am forwarding this notification and hoping to get a response this time. Some arrested fraudsters had confessed imposing Banks/Delivery Company/IMF/FBI/Western Union/Money gram/Diplomat Agents/ and others imposed offices around the World especially in Africa and your info is with them. We were told they have requested fees after fees for documents from most of their victims. The corruption and illegal cyber crime activity mainly from Africa literally overruns Europe, America and Asia massively. Such evil finally blocks all efforts to create a trustworthy climate for internet Transactions. Citizens are threatened, lied unto and ripped off their very last little money. As recently shown on European television with hidden camera were entire Internet SCAM cafes in Cotonou Benin Republic, where people were occupied with illegal Internet crime activities individually or even in groups in particular betraying naive Europeans and Americans. They even had developed in their language a wordily expression, a nickname for in their eyes to ridicule and laugh about them when they again succeeded in betraying and tricking some one out. Then they found themselves complete heroes. and were dancing and laughing about their victims in the public streets enjoying their ""victory"" Once the Asia or American targeted victim turned the spearhead in opposite direction. Recent report from the West Police revealed that these fraudsters have partners working with them all over the World. This notification is in conjunction with the Anti Cyber Crime Africa and we like you to know that the people you have been dealing with are all impostors operating from different part of Africa and the World. You find it very easy sending your personal information to any emails claiming they have fund approved in your name and you have not made true inquiry before you start dealing with them and as a result your info is on the internet and that gives these fraudsters easy access to flood your email with scam emails on daily basis. We want to ask, have you been able to find out why you receive all kinds of emails daily claiming it have funds for you? Have you really inquired from the right office in West Africa to know if there is actually any true approved fund? If there is any fund awarded in your name at all? Or do you believe anybody that contacts you and says they have fund for you. So be careful even when you are contacted from UK, USA and other parts of the World. Authorities are working hard to assist and protect people like you from their global network. It will take you just listening and following our instructions to know the truth. you have a legitimately approved compensation fund approved by the Federal Government of Nigeria since 2015. the problem is that you have been dealing with liars and crooks over the years and for this reason you have not received your genuine compensation funds. Note: For every money you have sent out, The International Police &amp; The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are taking records and monitoring information for possible financial crimes because that is the only way they combat domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes in US and Canada, some of these scammers are big time human traffickers, drug peddlers and involved in all sort of crimes. the Interpol are monitoring possible financiers for these criminals in America, Asia and Europe. Also you must be protected from these scammers because once you have been scammed, you will continue to be their target. the only way we protect you is ensuring you keep communication and alert us once you have been contacted so we can investigate for possible scam. the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury that collects and analyzes information about financial transactions in order to combat domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. If you make inquiry about the status of your unpaid compensation funds, contact their Director General of Debt office Mr. Williams Pete at mrwilliampeter@gmail.com and find out the truth.

I first thought that it was some sort of torrent site with telenobelas or other entertainment files, and then I saw this ""Game"" category. I'm not so certain why I did it, but I entered REDACTED on the search bar with synical emtion that there was no way that the game I purchased for 15bucks would be there wide open like clam on a barbecue grill. The stark reality, however, was that even the newest version, which included all the add-ons that I also purchased (I got it during summer bundle sale), was hacked and placed for free download. What I felt at that time is ineffable, and was beyond the emotion of betrayal. I was astouned at the reality that if this game, which is sold by one of the most prestigious platform (REDACTED), is hacked right on the face of the public, there is no doubt that other games that are being sold to other millions of innocent people, in high probability, can be downloaded for free in this site. And such thesis, so far, seemed to be true. We, gamers, pay for the game not only for our own entertainment, but for game developers in optimistic hope of him/her/them creating better games in near or distant future. However, if such intolerable illicit activity is continued, isn't it evident that game industry, whether soon or later, face a consequence due to certain immoral people, who are very indifferent, ignorant, and egocentric. As John Stuart Mill stated in ""On Liberty"", ""A person may cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury."" I believe that the man or woman responsible of such cyber-crime must be matured enough to comprehend with the economical, social, and legal consequences of such malignant activity. And thus, he or she must be ceased before creating any other victims (indi-game developers). However, the truth is that I find no specific ways to ""justly"" apprehend that certain individual/s for his/her/their actions as I do not have any significant social, economical, or political influence over the public or individuals nor do I have computer skills to hack the suspect and find their identity like the Anonymous (XD). For these reasons, please, my fellow REDACTED-users, would there really be no way to bring or at least to reduce such actions from happening? "

Do not let these extremist radical terrorists force you into suicide or anything, hold out! The more that are resilient, the quicker this breech will be resolved. Once these radical terrorist biohackers successfully causes an individual to commit suicide or force their targets to die in anyway, they escape the persons dead body, giggling and laughing as they kill humans for fun and infects another person as if they were a horrific virus. They bulge and twitch the persons eye lids as a sign of their technology existences within the person, without acknowledging that the person was just hijacked by biohackers. An out break of radical terrorists in high platform airships and drones are illegally eavesdropping and trafficking humans into sex prostitution utilizing electromagnets, radio waves, and radiation They can force a person to cough with sonic weaponry, imitating illnesses on a wide scale for control and as well, to assimilate identities illegally.

The hostiles are on Debilitating/Sedative drugs Stop your bitching and fight your way through it until the threat is resolved. Keep relaxed. Let your friends, family, and kids know! Awareness destroys their recon Its NOT the Illuminati Keep Calm/Be Confident and Live Study magnets/Electromagnets You are not missing out on anything if someone or a group is pressing on you. Go do you! Do not let anyone influence you! Their command centers are hidden within some call centers (Do not be paranoid!). It is urgent that you stay on the surface if you work around them. Do not let them systematically control or allure you into signing a contract to an unknown authority to make love with their merchandise in plain sight as spies or to be involved in illegal reconnaissance operations. As long as you do not sign a contract for, and I quote, everything you always wanted! You will be fine Time them, but do not deluded yourself High Altitude Platform Air Ships, YOU ARE NOT INVITED! Do not submit to any of their offers! They can alter words in the mind with their weaponized drones. Stop Feeding This World Wide Threat! Stop Surrendering because its too much to deal with! They are on high class drugs nearly 24/7 everyday! Reclaim your identity or have it taken away by a criminal organization Non lethal weapons modified to be lethal weapons! Their captive women/children are their front line against men! They WILL try to force you to kneel to the their dictator. You will then be susceptible and subjected to heavier sonic attacks as well as abuses. Do Not Quit! Do NOT Surrender! Observe them for one year if you do not believe me. Take notes, keep quiet and carry on with your own personal life in the meanwhile. You will take notice of their patterns. Terrorists are pretending to be schools as part of their scripts! They Murder Doctors and Healers of any kind if they do not submit to being trafficked into human/sex trafficking facilities/homes! They are not Authority of any kind, unless you surrender and you sign their contract and accept them as your handlers. THIS IS NOT A GAME! Stall them out! Do not move! My god, I cant believe I am stating this. What is written below is not intended to be satire or a joke. This has actually contributed to their narcissism, their abuses, and mass murders Stop masturbating to these terrorists! They are being raped and abused heavily while abusing you and other innocents without any choices. Children as young as 10 are being raped over sonar hearing that only YOU can hear, and you masturbate to the kids moaning, being raped?? You do NOT need to sign a contract to an unknown organization using sonar hearing to be allowed to marry, be intimate, or are subjected and forced to marry their trained terrorists p They are paid liars and spies that trains prostitutes how to screw their targets exactly the way their targets want. This is done to have the target test the human traffickers prostitutes before they sign to keep them. Instead, you are selling yourself into human/sex/drug trafficking rings Do not accept their lust they do have spies in person that are drug abuse/humans traffickers. They will bribe with sex and free housing then make you sign your life away, with you under the impression that you are going to some brothel or sex club. You will be susceptible to extreme abuses revolving around rape, drugs, and traumatic physical and mental abuses. THEY LOVEBOMB HEAVY! Sound Proof Your Homes! THEY ARE ALL THE SAME!! They use prostitution to allure their new victims! DO NOT BELIEVE THEM! Extremists Human Traffickers/Terrorist Eavesdroppers/Spies utilizing sonic weapons/sonar hearing weapons to euthanize/Traffic the general public intolerance slavery. DO NOT GO! Scientology/Sea Organization Are also involved in this global threat. They will go to war with federal officials/agents to keep their bodies enslaved! Their cults authority are primarily white supremacists that are seeking World Domination utilizing Sonic weapons in an hapless attempt to force the innocent and the vulnerable into surrendering themselves to human/sex/drug trafficking ring. They are not the police! Spies are very obvious to point out! They are illegally eavesdropping families to extract their young. Their groups primarily consists of autistic and the mentally ill, that abuses a series of class A drugs to traffick and create new slaves. Do NOT sign the contract! Its ridiculous! They have two contracts, one for you to surrender, and the other for you to contract yourself into surrendering voluntarily. They also wordplay aggressively. ( I am disclosing the depths of their criminal business for abusing sonar hearing technology to assimilate identities, killing ruthlessly while induced under highly potent drugs, mass kidnappings, weapons, and prostitution/pedophilia. You will be stripped of all privileges and rights to these lifelong detention facilities!) The threat progresses like humans, but the hostiles are progressing entirely against your person. They are trying to steal your entire identity, do not sign the contract! Otherwise you will never make choices in your own lives again! They look like everyday people, but do not be paranoid. Be aware of your surroundings and leave a way out for yourself if you are ever caught in a potentially dangerous situation. But do NOT be paranoid, delusional, or psychotic about it as not only would you be more susceptible to any abuses, your vulnerabilities may force you to make the wrong decisions. Man/woman up if you want to keep your own free self. Do not give into extreme paranoia! Modern Day Terrorist Human Trafficking Networks has expanded. Be weary of unknown terrorists/individuals giving victims rides to parties, mansions, or a trip to the ghetto/low income neighborhoods for drugs They are not the police! They are not aliens! They will use love to manipulate you. Think of Craigslist scams or common pop up scams you would receive on your daily Internet commute. Same thing except, they want you to traffick yourself into a entrapment facility. Using various sexual exploitation tactics, infinite gaslighting strategies to force negative emotion to their targets and threats a long with actions of inhumane abuse cycles in hopes of subduing their targets If you accept any bribes and sign the contract offered, you will be paying taxes to a criminal organization/network, times the current state and/or government taxes you already currently pay for, along with any other extra expenses that will occur if you sign the contract. Ex: Government Taxes + Criminal Organizations Taxes = Taxes x2 or more since you will not be in control of your currency any longer. If you do not see actual law enforcement individuals in front of your physical self, DO NOT GET ON THE GROUND! They are NOT any authority to the people outside of their trafficking homes! Drug abuse/Addictions attracts these hostiles. They WILL psychologically trick you into subduing yourself. Do not be fooled by their fake friendly appearances and smiles. You will be robbed! Pay attention to your air/ground horns! But do not panic! They are NOT the government or federal agents. They are spies from criminal organizations worldwide! If you do not believe me, then what I am speaking of may not not make any sense to you now. (Do your own research, dont take only my word for it) But a great number of those who reads my news update will understand that we are dealing with outlaws that are mainly responsible for the missing milk carton kids Be aware of homes with No trespassing signs, unusually high activity and surveillance cameras in low income neighborhoods. They are not the CIA/NSA/NASA/God/You/yourself/or anybody else you know. Even though some has defected and joined this horrific network full of criminals and pathological murderers, pretending to be friendly or family. Global Human Trafficking Evolution They want to ultimately farm your kids and sell them into prostitution! Human traffickers will start a ground war to capture their victims and to keep spying on them with aircrafts. Cyber ventriloquism/Sonar Hearing Has been worsening since the 1960s. The criminal agents will immediately disinform and satire this disclosure or any as if nothing was wrong or happening right now. Educate yourselves to save yourselves! This is NOT a test from any governments within the security fields (FBI, CIA, NSA, or any of the department fields) though these organizations may or may not be involved, credible evidence is needed to prove that these organizations are apart of the worlds most inhumane experiments utilizing electromagnets and radiation to subdue any man or woman. Disinformation campaigns are set up and used by these criminal organizations to keep the public from knowing about their spying on various individuals around the world and from raising awareness on their secret experiment using electromagnets and a machine that rewrites the brain in a flash. The threat mimics medical conditions to stay hidden. Very heavy human/sex trafficking organization and operations getting worse everyday. This is NOT a special or a unique opportunity for anyone, do not fall for this! You will be chipped, trapped, and abused inhumanly like a wild animal. They also possess disinformation campaign divisions made solely for the purposes of covering their trafficking and tracks. The technologically driven human traffickers will preemptively meditate on murdering you if you do not reclaim your identity! Do NOT surrender yourself to any criminal organization! Traffickers are seeking your signature to lock you away inside a facility. Do NOT play hero or games with extremists. They are studying every word, step, and actions you make. With the goal to either capture, subdue, or mind break an individual into harming theirselves and/or others. The traffickers wagers that they can defect millions into trafficking the victims into their criminal networks/organizations and facilities around the globe, the organization calls it hiding bodies utilizing the individuals past as their entire method to cause the person as much psychological harm as inhumanly possible. Powerful electromagnets are beamed onto the victims skull to send and receive data, bypassing the skull to access the brain as if it was a computer hard drive. The program is only to torture and ruin lives. If not forewarned about it, lives will be abducted, or killed secretly. Traffickers can completely invade and compromise a person and force the victim into either surrendering theirselves to their abusers and never be seen again, or the victim is left with nothing, outstripped from jobs through 24/7 focus groups to psych a person out of a job and attempt to have their victims deconstruct theirselves and others around. This is an everyday 24/7 torture system designed to traffick, kill, torture, and molest an individual.The traffickers does breed with their brothers, sisters and other blood related individuals for experimental and Pedophilia is a major part of their cult, DO NOT BE FOOLED!! Silent/Covert, Inbreds are waging war against innocents All out war with Innocents Extremists Terrorists Hostiles are taking hostages secretly through aggression and various fear tactics. Terrorists can cut breathing with their weapons Love your spouses and who you are in llmay spare you by moving on to someone else. Protect yourselves with neodymium magnets!! Protect your brain with magnets! Hover the magnets over your head. Scientology/RPF Criminal Fusion Centers/Scientology Secret Terrorist Covert Operations Human trafficking/Slavery Pulsed Electromagnetic Microwave Weapon Drones with weapon attachments (This is NOT fake news, we have been breeched and completely compromised!) DO NOT GO!!! There is nothing there that will benefit you! They prey on any vulnerabilities that a human possess. Stay strong to those that are affected, investigations are becoming more widespread They entrap individuals for experimental purposes in a room with 1 bathroom and 40+ prostitutes and drug addicts, and other mentally insane criminals who enjoys their jobs in systematically destroying human lives in the most inhuman and extreme ways. They are lead by drag queen homosexuals with a goal to create slaves by converting them into homosexuals, making it easier to control individuals. They also have these systematic gay orgies where they abuse a plethora of drugs (crack, meth, cocaine, scopolamine, etc) before severely abusing and raping a singular victim inhumanly. The victims were once a targeted individual before they gave up and accepted becoming a sacrifice for an unknown organization/cult. If you are a new victim of these crimes, do as much research as possible and disclose, disclose, disclose. DO NOT MOVE TO VOICES THAT ARE NOT AROUND YOU! Schizophrenia is NOT the reason due to the lack of evidence, proving that schizophrenia does not exist. Do not keep silent for this horrendous criminal network! They are all traffickers and they kill in the most inhumane way and call it their fun. TLDR: Criminal Network/Human traffickers are replicating theirselves to be your spouse, military officials, or any government identity to force and fool any person into trafficking theirselves into a criminal network through endless gaslighting through megaphone like devices that targets one individual at a time and projects their voices bypassing their targets auditory cortex. Once the drone targets a person, they stay on that person 24/7 everyday. If you are instructed to move to Winnipeg Canada or anywhere for bribes, sexual favors, money, and/or free housing through any means of transportation, Do Not Go! You are a victim of a class action crime that has gone out of hand. Do NOT give these criminals anymore power by giving yourself up to them. You did not win anything and being targeted by these drones means that they chose you to either traffick or to be murdered covertly using drones with electromagnetic weapons attachments and technology which allows Sonic hearing that the criminal organization network uses to communicate directly to one another without needing to use a phone. Captured victims are forced into unpaid labor and forced prostitution. The targeted victim will be missing and stored away within one of their run down homes/facilities, unable to escape or leave. The handlers forces their new members into various ritualistic initiations cycles within their individual cultist groups kneel, to sniff up drugs in order to gain their ter Once captured, they immediately commence their routines of total control and exploitation of the fully captured person. The victims are broken down to less than nothing due to repeated rape and abuse sequences. Felons within the criminal network/organization are to either traffick or murder a victim because their data brokers does not want to exposed and has paid a great sum of currency to illegally purchase the personal records of their targets and to send a weaponized drone to the illegally purchased individual, equipped with biohacking weapons to break down their targets into trafficking themselves, committing suicide or murdering others. They run criminal schools/organizations that breeds more human traffickers and prostitutes into the public. They Will Say Anything to Force You to move! We need you! We love you, Move! We want to lust your body. They work on every emotion within their targets brain and force the individual either into a blind rage or to try to confuse the person with their own emotions through a series of gaslighting and abuse, into moving their targets to them (I can not stress this enough, do not let them force you into trafficking yourself. The felons also pretend to be some type of close friend to their victims in order to keep control over them. They are fully trained and prepared personally to place severe torture on one individual (they pair up and gang up on one individual at a time and jumps said victim. They act like grade school kids, but thats due to the heavy influence of their handlers, crack and cocaine that has degenerated They also are heavily involved in the drug/prostitution ring where everyone gets raped and are all under heavy mind control from a cocktail of different drugs including cocaine. The felons has their victims set up as empty puppets who are under complete control. The victims now turned felons/rapists/addicts are raised specifically to absorb abuse, while abusing drugs to remain numb during their operations, scopolamine, crack and cocaine to remain numb to any words from their victims. They train individuals this way so they can deal more damage than receive it during their illegal operations. They are completely separate from reality and are all under one criminal control. They are aware of people resisting and they promise to do everything to try to force their targets into submitting to their handlers. Warning! These Malicious Drone Operators WILL Say ANYTHING to force a person to move! The terrorists all have their handlers speaking directly into their ears during their operations to murder or capture the innocent, giving them orders on their scripts made to place torture and destroy random individuals, innocent or not. They tend to target the innocents more since these felons find it more satisfying to rape, brainwash, and intoxicate the innocent heavily until the innocent is completely empty. As soon as as theyre successful, they turn the captured individuals into drug addicts, whores, and forced laborers, working for gift cards and sexual/party favors. They will always refuse to leave their targets unless the person gives in and moves to them. Or if the victim gathers any evidence leading to the arrest and shutdown of these criminal networks/organizations. To the many different individuals that takes the time to read this, I am taking the time and energy out of my life to warn everyone about a massive data breech that has occurred and that is endangering many lives, including my own at this very point in time. This type of data breech is the very worst of its kind. Before, the biggest threat was internet crimes, malware, and viruses that may have affected your assets if you were to click the wrong link. Now your actual physical being is at risk by criminal data brokers who are currently funding these criminal networks and are providing illegally purchased records of random individuals around the world. Now, criminals today have gone above and beyond the internet and are sending drones with biohacking technologies attachments to random individuals. These weapon attachments magnetizes to specific muscles within the human anatomy of the hijackers choosing. This allows the hijacker to manipulate small muscle tissues within the human body such as rotating an individuals eyes at the hijackers will to keep their victims sleep deprived. They focus on the genitals primarily to exploit the human desire to make love with another individual through the manipulation of their genitals such methods, human traffickers and terrorist organizations are now utilizing these magnetic weapons attached to drones to lock a persons own body up for ransom which could be assets, or force you to sell your body into slavery. They offer the remote of the victims body, to the victims they use to manipulate certain muscles and veins in the body in exchange for the capture of the victims body. Human traffickers have evolved from footwork to airborne to stay covert. Hiding behind custom biohacking drones ordered online and through various other biohacking black market trades. Voices in the head has been declassified and debunked as electronic biohacking through electromagnets, radiation, drones and neurophones funded and powered by criminal Fusion Centers, Scientology, and radical extremists terrorists around the world. This was thought out to be a medical condition that is often confused with schizophrenia or another mental illness. But I challenged the theory and discovered that the public has been heavily misinformed. If a person never had a history with voices in their head that were not of their own voices, and they have proof of their attackers transmitting these frequencies, how could it be a medical condition if the person has evidence of the voices being transmitted directly to his/her skull? So, not only the voices are there, they are also instructing people to either murder, rape, or traffick themselves to one of the many fusion centers, human/sex trafficking homes within undisclosed locations, ghettos, and Sea org divisions that could be in any closed off homes, (homes with unusually active activities) so they could focus and convert their captives through a series of abuse and ritualistic routines 24/7 everyday. They force the individual to impregnate one of their paid prostitutes that are doppelgngers to their targets. They do this to raise another human into being another drug addict/trafficker, born and raised into the criminal network so itll appear more natural to kill, traffick and brainwash victims. They pretend to be on the victims side, but they really are not. They all have an illegal drill instructor that only teaches the trafficked warloot abuse, rape, and how to torture. More on this.. Please be safe."

P. 6(e) INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME I This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R.  600.8(c), which states that, ""[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he ... shall provide the Attorney General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special Counsel] reached."" The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016. In June, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team publicly announced that Russian hackers had compromised its computer network. Releases of hacked materials-hacks that public reporting soon attributed to the Russian government-began that same month. Additional releases followed in July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in October and November. In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks's first release of stolen documents, a foreign government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities. That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government ""directed recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political organizations,"" and, "" [t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process."" After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election. By early 2017, several congressional committees were examining Russia's interference in the election. Within the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017 appointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the Special Counsel authorized him to investigate ""the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,"" including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel's investigation established that Russia interfere~ in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit U.S. Department of Justice Atterttey Werk Predttet // Ma~ Cetttaitt Material Prnteeted Uttder Fed. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. * * * Below we describe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements about the results of our investigation and the Special Counsel's charging decisions, and we then provide an overview of the two volumes of our report. The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel's Office found to be supp01ted by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts. In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of ""collusion."" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word ""collud[ e ]"" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign ""coordinat[ ed]""-a term that appears in the appointment order-with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, ""coordination"" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement-tacit or express- between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. * * * The report on our investigation consists of two volumes: Volume I describes the factual results of the Special Counsel's investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and its interactions with the Trump Campaign. Section I describes the scope of the investigation. Sections II and III describe the principal ways Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Section IV describes links between the Russian  2 U.S. Department of Justice Att:arAe~ Wark Praattet // Me~ C0Atttil'l Mttterittl Prateetea UAaer red. R. Criffl.

Volume II addresses the President's actions towards the FBI's investigation into Russia' s interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters, and his actions towards the Special Counsel' s investigation. Volume II separately states its framework and the considerations that guided that investigation. 3 U.S. Department of Justice Atterrte~ Werk Predttet // May Cetttairt Material Preteetee Urteer Fee. R. Crim. P. 6(e) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME I RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference operations identified by the investigation- a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and received funding from Russian oligarch Y evgeniy Prigozhin and companies he controlled. Pri ozhin is widel re orted to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin In mid-2014, the IRA sent em lo mission with instructions The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. political system through what it termed ""information warfare."" The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton. The IRA' s operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Office's investigation of the Russian social media campaign. RUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas ""DCLeaks"" and ""Guccifer 2.0."" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks. 4 U.S. Department of Justice AH:erHey \Brit Pr6d1:1et // Mtty Cet1:tttifl Mttterittl Preteeted Ut1:der Fed. R. Ct1iffl. P. 6(e) The presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (""Trump Campaign"" or ""Campaign"") showed interest in WikiLeaks' s releases of documents and welcomed their otential to damage candidate Clinton. Beginning in June 2016, llfilllillliliilfll~llliillllllilllilli forecast to senior Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release information damaging to candidate Clinton. WikiLeaks' s first release came in July 2016. Around the same time, candidate Trump announced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from a private server used b Clinton when she was Secreta of State he later said that he was s  eakin sarcasticall . WikiLeaks began releasing Podesta' s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released video considered damaging to candidate Trump. Section lII of this Report details the Office's investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts by Trump Campaign supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails. RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities. Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for Campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved U.S.-Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods, the most salient of which are summarized below in chronological order. 2015. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump Organization real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate Trump signed a Letter oflntent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization executive Michael Cohen emailed and spoke about the project with the office of Russian government press secretary Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through at least June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Trump. Spring 2016. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early contact with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Russian government had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands 5 U.S. Department of Justice l\.ttortte~ Work Pt'od1:1et // Mtty Cotttttitt Mttterittl Proteeted Uttder Fed. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) of emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took place. Summer 2016. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer of 2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive"

Real GDP grew at annual rates of 3.4 percent in the third quarter of 2018 and 4.2 percent in the second quarter. More than 5 million jobs have been created since President Trumps election and the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent. This is the eighth time this year that the unemployment rate has been below 4 percent. Prior to this year, the unemployment rate had fallen below 4 percent only five times since 1970. The unemployment rate for African Americans in May fell to 5.9 percent, which is the lowest rate on record. Asian and Hispanic-American unemployment rates have reached record lows this year.

Anything that isn't in alignment with that, I tend to ignore, sidestep and treat as a distraction. I believe that ignorance, non reaction and staying on the path of dignity is the best way to discourage any persistent unwanted intrusions. But Just like a nagging health issue sometimes ignored can turn malignant, this situation for me has unfortunately turned malignant. In case of the matter at hand, it seems the media has no intention of letting go. I don't see any grace in adding to this circus by testifying in defence of my character in a situation that I have no involvement in whatsoever. I have been dragged into a dirty perverse mess without a choice in the matter. This is something that is not of my making. The truth is, I have never met the lady in question one on one in my entire life. Yes, we have worked together, but there has been no meeting in private. Thats the truth Please understand, I am not fighting against an allegation of an affair. Or being childish trying to uphold a good guy image. I am very aware of my faults, I am human. I am in fact protecting myself from something far more serious, sensitive and destructive than that. Sadly, very few from the media or the public seem to be interested in the truth. This has been a hard-learnt fact for me. If the people are comfortable with a lie because it doesn't threaten their model of the world where a girl is the victim and the man the aggressor then so be it. I am ok with that too. Women have suffered centuries of abuse at the hands of men and it infuriates me how some men can be so brutal and they deserve the harshest punishment. But by that logic if it ordains that one man can't be vulnerable and one woman can't be a liar, so be it. I'm ok with that too. An alleged 7-year long, passionate affair between two high profile celebrities with no trail left behind. No evidence, no paparazzi pictures, no witnesses, not even a memento in possession like a selfie taken at the alleged engagement which is claimed to have happened in Paris in Jan 2014. Nothing that constitutes an exchange or any sort of proof of a romantic relationship. Yet we want to believe the other party because the rhetoric is -why would a girl lie. My passport details show no travel outside the country in Jan 2014, which is the date that this alleged engagement supposedly took place. In Paris. The only so-called proof presented of this alleged ""relationship"", was a photoshopped picture in the media. This was immediately exposed, the very next day by friends including my ex-wife. These questions are not even asked, because we are taught to protect the woman, as we should. I myself have been brought up to think the same way, by my parents and the wonderful women in my life who have been my rock and support system. I'm deeply grateful to them. I will do my best to teach my children the same values of family and dignity. And yes, I will teach them to stand up for women. Always. There are 3000 one sided mails which either I have sent to myself or the woman in question has sent to me. The Cyber-Crime Dept. can prove or disprove either story, in just a few days. Towards that purpose, I have surrendered all my devices including laptops / phones etc which are still lying with the cyber cell , but the other party has refused to do so. The investigation hasn't been closed. This is not, and I repeat, not a lovers spat. I humbly request people to stop labelling it as one and, for a second, try and see it for what it really is. I have been harassed by this for 4 years and the well meaning and probably necessary social bias toward women has deemed me helpless in defending myself. I am not angry, I have seldom allowed anger into my life. I have not had a single fight in my life, with a man or a woman. Even in my divorce, there was no fight. I, and those around me, have always chosen peace. I am not here to accuse or judge anyone, but it's time I defend the truth because when truth suffers the collective consciousness of society suffers. Civilization suffers. Closer to home, families suffer. Children suffer. [Original fb sauce :](URL"

First of all, Id defraud and thieve a massive amount of money from North Korea in a cyber attack they were not expecting. Theyd chase me there, hunt me down, the forces directed by that chubby little leader theyve got King-Yong-Pung-Ill or whatever theyve got I dont even know his name but he looks like a fat teletubby with big floppy hair with bangs hanging down. Anyway they hunt me down, Im walking down a darkened street one night, their forces, undercover, clandestine take me on the street, they think theyve overpowered me. They have no idea I am absolutely capable of physically dominating every single one of them. I allow myself to be taken. They take me in the middle of the night and I am flown away to North Korea. As soon as I am within sight distance of Kim-yoong or whatever his name is, I break out of my shackles. They were not expecting it. I run up to that horrible little despotic leader and full on to his face a plant a magnificent headbutt with my massive head. This headbutt fells him, he is dead in one fell swoop. Ive released and freed the whole country of North Korea. They elect ME their new leader. It doesnt stop there. North Korea is only one of the three countries that the Rothschild do not own and control their central bank. They send over some emissaries, the whole of the illuminati pack is sent over to try take control of the central bank. They think Im going to give it to them because Im a westerner. Absolutely not. Im ready for them when they come. I take every single one of them down with a sword. Then I unleash a secret weapon Ive been developing. It closely mimics the kind of effects of a solar flare and it WIPES out the electronics on the whole of the world. They are no longer able to use them. ALL modern weapons systems everything is no longer usable. We are back in the stone ages, no one knows whats going to happen. I take my little North Korean bands Ive been training secretly in this time in sword play, cloak, dagger, shields, sword, weve been training, its going to be like a medieval battle. We march our way across Asia, more and more people joining every single day and Im training them with swords. We march our way into Germany and this is where the Final Confrontation happens. The last of the New World Order have re-banded around David Cameron. Hes been elected the new leader of the Free World. Well Free World my arse. He has bought his forces, no guns or anything because theyre all useless because of my new weapon which has rendered them useless. There is going to be a battle of old. It takes place in an old gothic German castle. It is snowing down, its like Game of Thrones. Theyre expecting just some bloke but they dont know Ive been training EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. with a sword carved out of granite. Im fighting my way through the forces just SMASH, SMASH, SMASH. Noone can get close to me. The song of steel upon steel is RINGING out across the castle. I spot David Cameron and his fat, smug, revolting little face. I make one final charge towards him. And before his forces can stop me, I throw my sword. Its like the final scene out of 300. I use it like a spear and it flies through the air. Everyone stops, everyone is watching it go through the snowflakes which are coming down and it lands in David Camerons eye. POP He is gone, he is dead. It has happened. The new world order has been broken. Everybody wants me to be the new leader. I step aside. I wont do it. I turn off my weapon system, the electronics are back up and I say now is up to you world, you will re-build. And you need to do it the right way otherwise Ill be coming back. That is the perfect crime in my eyes. "

They tell your kids they gotta love Justin Biebler, and then Biebler says ""hand in your guns"", ""pass the Cyber Security Act"", and ""the police state is good"", and then your children are turned into a mindless vassalswho now, they look up to some twit, instead of looking up to Thomas Jefferson, or looking up to Nikola Tesla, or looking up to Magellan; I mean, kids, Magellan is a lot COOLER than Justin Bieber! He circumnavigated with one ship the entire planet! He was killed by wild natives before they got back to Portugal! And when they got back there was only like eleven people alive of the two hundred and something crew and the entire ship was rotting down to the waterline! That's destiny! That's will! That's striving! That's being a trailblazer and explorer! Going into space! Mathematics! Quantum mechanics! The secrets of the universe! It's all there! Life is fiery with its beauty! Its incredible detail! Tuning into it! They wanna shutter your mind, TALKING ABOUT JUSTIN BIEBER!!! IT'S PURE EVIL!!! They're taking your intellect, your soul, and giving you Michael Jordan and Bieber. UNLOCK YOUR HUMAN POTENTIAL! DEFEAT THE GLOBALISTS WHO WANNA SHUTTER YOUR MIND!YOUR DOORWAYS TO PERCEPTION!I WANNA SEE YOU TRULY LIVE! I WANNA SEE YOU TRULY BE WHO YOU ARE!!! AHHHH!!! I don't want my progeny who's coming, my unborn grandchildren and great grandchildren, to live in this nightmare system these control freaks have created. Where these wicked gloablists are so threatened by human potential they poison the water, the vaccines, the food, to turn us into a bunch of...slugs, a bunch of lobotomized sloths, so they can control us. It is a crime, it is the most jealous, envious, greedy, hateful, sickening thing the New World Order does and that's why I'm so pleased to be committed in the fight against them. That's why I don't care about my own life except I want to continue to live to fight them, that's why I don't have fear. I only have fear of myself and my flesh and NOT BEING UP TO THE CHALLENGE! And I ask you to look in the mirror and ask yourself what are you doing in this time of great challenge, what are you doing to unlock minds. Once you unlock a mind, once you unlock somebody, then they can unlock their soul. We can't unlock a soul, only God can do that but we can unlock minds and once the mind is unlocked, once the intellect is turned on, then comes the discernment, then comes the awakening of the soul, then comes true enlightenment and empowerment. So the globalists seek to make you a bunch of jealous, stunted, weak, backstabbing, gibbering demons. All of us have the lower elements and the higher we must strive for the higher. "
