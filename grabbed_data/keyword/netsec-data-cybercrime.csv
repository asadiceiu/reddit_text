Since then, I've written a book, Spam Nation: The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime, From Global Epidemic to Your Front Door. I focus principally on computer crime and am fascinated by the the economic aspects of it. To that end, I spend quite a bit of time lurking on cybercrime forums. On my site and in the occasional speaking gig, I try to share what I've learned so that individuals and organizations can hopefully avoid learning these lessons the hard way. Ask me anything. I'll start answering questions ~ 2 p.m. ET today (Oct. 23, 2015). "
