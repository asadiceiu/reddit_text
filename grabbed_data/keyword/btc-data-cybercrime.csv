Initially, victims were being tricked to download a fraudulent update that stole their cryptocurrencies. Later on, the threat actors launched a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in response to Electrum developers trying to protect their users. Since our last blog, the amount of stolen funds has increased to USD $4.6 million, and the botnet that is flooding the Electrum infrastructure is rapidly growing. Case in point, on April 24, the number of infected machines in the botnet was just below 100,000 and the next day it reached its highest at 152,000, according to this online tracker. Since then, it has gone up and down and plateaued at around the 100,000 mark. - URL - URL - URL Older article, which explains the attack: - URL"
1,cybercrime,btc,Jimmy Birer of Bit reon/Cashflow Update - Scammer Report,91,93bl36,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/93bl36/jimmy_birer_of_bit_reoncashflow_update_scammer/,2018-07-31 15:07:04,"I am posting this on behalf of a fellow Redditor here who wishes to remain anonymous, and has worked hard to get us all these information. Will forward all well wishes to him. ------------- I am here to provide an update on the individual known as Jimmy Birer - this is how he calls himself in numerous online forums, per Reddit TOS I'll neither confirm or deny it's his real name - who owns the Reddit accounts /u/jbirer / /u/Roachzilla / /u/AlmightyJim. With major help of a few other Redditors here, we have gathered all the info on him via publicly available data and sent all the info with proof of his scamming and pedophilia (Some digging in forums and Discord servers that he was registered/part of revealed that he was a pedophile) to EGM (Security General Directorate) in Turkey (since foreign police departments kick the ball to Turkey's court) whom opened a police investigation on Jimmy Birer from the latest info they gave us. These claims have been sent to the police with proof of chatlogs, archive.is links, pictures. So all are solid, untampered evidence. I cannot reveal his personal info per Reddit rules but all the evidence I have has been sent to the police's cybercrime division via email (siber@egm.gov.tr), and a collection of them are also attached below. There are more information from the discord that contains pictures that directly links the person to the Bitreon scam, and the Coingeek conference he went to. Also he previously screwed with wrong people in a forum which ended up getting him doxed. So if you look hard enough, you'll find his info. Why am I sharing this info? He is developing this 'project': Bitreon. Its supposedly Patreon running with BCH but a few weeks ago he went silent and investors like /u/bitcoinhibby demanded a refund. He wrote ""HAHAHAHHAHA"" to Hibby. Not to mention him lying to others, saying that Hibby was a dev for Bitreon when in fact he wasnt. /u/bitcoinhibby shared all this in this post of his. Here are some proofs from his Discord. Do note that these do NOT include his personal info (Well these images at least) but include him confessing his actions. Where he links to his deed: URL (Part of) his wallet from the scam: URL Where he amuses himself about very criminal behavior: URL Where he ponders about escape routes: URL URL Where he ponders about a bigger exit scam when people actually pour money into his tumbling service: URL Where he admits to scamming: URL URL Where he wants to take his scam money and migrate to America: URL URL Where he complains about the failure of a (probably unrelated) scam: URL URL Where he apparently went to the Coingeek conference and scammed from folks there too: URL URL Random bragging: URL Where he probably dabbled in CP: URL Where he lays out the grand scheme of scam-and-CP: URL We also have even more of his personally identifying info, including his face, from Facebook and other sources, but we cannot reveal in this post as it is against Reddit TOS. Since the original thread by hibby was posted, he appears to have collected another ~30 BCH from new Redditors. I will advise strongly against giving him any more money. "
2,cybercrime,btc,The Perfect Bitcoin Auction Storm: the $830MM in BTC Seized from Infraud and the $1.7 Billion in BTC Seized in Bulgaria,19,7wuazv,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7wuazv/the_perfect_bitcoin_auction_storm_the_830mm_in/,2018-02-12 04:59:16,"Last week Sergey Medvedev was arrested in Bangkok. This was part of a coordinated international raid that netted the arrest of 13 people across the globe associated with darkweb site ""Infraud"" as reported widely in the press: URL URL Apparently, Medvedev was the administrator of the escrow service that Infraud ran to prevent members from ripping each other off in their transactions that seem to have been centered largely on stolen credit card information and devices to steal such info. (See URL Since transactions were (of course) conducted using bitcoin, Thai police are reporting that they have seized 100k BTC from Medvedev (worth $830MM USD at the moment). How Thai police could have gotten his private keys is a matter that has been debated on Reddit since the arrest. While one commenter humorously suggested that skillfully applied 50 baht pliers could circumvent any digital security measures, it is obvious that many nefarious forms of ""advanced interrogation"" could have produced the private keys. What isn't clear, is what will happen to those nearly $1 Billion USD in BTC. Will the Thai police keep them? Will the US Government end up with them? Will they split them? Most importantly, will they be sold off? The US Marshal's Service obviously has a track record of selling off BTC with the most notable example being the Silk Road Auction in 2014 after the arrest of Ross Ulbricht where Tim Draper and others bought huge chunks of the seizure at auction. Obviously, an $830 million USD BTC auction would make a lot of headlines and could have a significant impact on BTC markets regardless of what the eventual auction winners planned to do with the coins. But, a lingering question remains: What if Medvedev coins weren't the only ones seized? The Thai police announced the BTC they seized. But, the coordinated international dragnet also involved law enforcement in the U.S., Britain, Australia, France, Italy, Kosovo, and Serbia. Chances are good that there was additional BTC seized from the other 12 individuals. Luckily, the Department of Justice's Grand Jury Indictment of those people might give us a clue how much the DOJ thought those individuals MIGHT have. Here is the grand jury indictment of 36 people that led to that arrest. (URL As the US gov't is eager to seize any and all ill-gotten gain in such arrests, the document contains a bullet list of how much money the government would like to seize from each of the indicted defendants. The forfeiture list starts on page 46. In the case of Medvedev, and certain other ringleaders and others, the list just shows ""To be calculated"". This makes sense since Medvedev was apparently running Infraud's escrow service and the Feds didn't know how much Infraud BTC would be under Medvedev's control. But, for 21 of the other defendants, the indictment does list actual dollar amount. My quick back of the napkin addition is showing that these amounts add up to something like $566,047,662.74. Obviously, it's possible the arrested individuals didn't have these amounts, these amounts were not longer in BTC, the other 12 individuals actually arrested were not the ones on the list that correspond to the higher dollar amounts, or the arresting authorities were unable to recover these amounts. But, these are the amounts the DOJ would have been very happy to seize from these individuals. But, in any case, it wouldn't be at all surprising if at least another $200 Million in BTC was seized from the other 12 arrested individuals. So, if we add this amount to Medvedev's $830 million, we could easily be talking about $1 Billion USD in BTC. On top of this $1 Billion in Infraud BTC, we also have yet to account for the 213,519 BTC seized by Bulgarian authorities last May. (See URL Apparently, Bulgaria has been refusing to comment on what has or will happen to those coins. But, what we do know is that those coins would be worth something like $1.7 Billion USD today. So, between these two raids, we would have $2.7 Billion in seized BTC. Here's the nightmare scenario: some combination of the US/Thailand/Others in the Infraud Law Enforcement Coalition decide to auction off the Infraud coins, then Bulgaria doesn't want to get beat to the punch and they decide to auction off their seized coins. All of the sudden, we are staring down the barrel of a $2.7 billion USD BTC auction season. Some will call it far-fetched and impossible. But, the timing is perfect. The BTC market has basically just been steadily falling since the peak.The Bulgarian authorities seized their coins in May and watched the price skyrocket until December. Why sell since the market was just rising and rising. Now, they have seen the BTC market fall and fall for two months. Last week, the Bulgarians get the news that the US and the other arresting countries may suddenly have their own treasure trove of $1 billion USD in seized BTC. Now there may be two or more players in the mega cap bulk BTC sales game...plus prices are falling. The Bulgarians may just decide to unleash those coins. We already know that the US Marshals are more than happy to auction off huge amounts of coins at a whim. We also know that the press would LOVE to report on billion dollar bitcoin auctions, and that the resulting headlines could very likely affect the behavior of casual investors and newbs: Theyre going to sell a BILLION dollars of them.yeah, hard pass on buying for now. That could be the case even if it turns out that Bulgaria has already stealthily and slowly sold off their coins. The only remaining question is, whatever the chance may be of any of this occurring, what would the impact be on the market if some version of this DOES HAPPEN involving any substantial portion of the Infraud and/or Bulgarian coins? tl;dr We could have a hell of a bulk BTC auction season coming up!
