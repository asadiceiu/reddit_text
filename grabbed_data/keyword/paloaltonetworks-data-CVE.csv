One must be created manually. * Rules can be set for: * Specific applications * File Types * Direction (upload/download/both) * Action (alert/continue/block) * If a file matches multiple rules, the highest matching rule is applied. * If Continue is set, the transfer is halted to alert the user that a matched file is attempting to be downloaded.

Encoding includes files such as .zip, .tar, docx, .gzip, etc * The 'Multi-Level Encoding' needs to be set under the 'File Types' in the file block rule **Attaching Security Profiles to Security Policy Rules** * Security Groups can be used to group a set of Security profiles. This will simplify Security Policy rule maintenance and deployment by selecting one group that can contain AV, ASW, Vuln, URL Filtering, File Blocking, Wildfire and Data Filtering Profiles. * You can also assign individual Security Profiles to a rule **Telemetry and Threat Intelligence** * Opt in is required, and can be customized to what data you want to share * Information sent to PAN is sanitized before being sent to PAN, and is not shared with any 3rd parties. * Telemetry can be configured under Device &gt; Setup &gt; Telemetry and Threat Intelligence.

(Ref # PAN-85238 / CVE-2017-16878) **Severity:** Medium Successful exploitation of this issue may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary javascript or HTML. **Products Affected** PAN-OS 8.0.6-h3 and earlier. **Available Updates** PAN-OS 8.0.7 and later. **Workarounds and Mitigations** Customers not using the Captive Portal function within PAN-OS are not impacted by this vulnerability. **PAN-SA-2017-0032 - ROBOT attack against PAN-OS** **Summary** ROBOT is an attack that affects the TLS RSA key exchange and could lead to decryption of captured sessions if the TLS server originally serving said captured session is still alive, vulnerable and using the same private key. (PAN-89936 / CVE-2017-17841) **Severity:** High While SSL Decryption and GlobalProtect are susceptible to this issue, PAN-OS can be protected with use of content update 757, and further mitigated through the configuration changes described below under ""Workarounds and Mitigations"". **Products Affected** PAN-OS 6.1, PAN-OS 7.1, PAN-OS 8.0.6-h3 and earlier **Available Updates** PAN-OS 8.0.7 and later. Patches will be made available for PAN-OS 6.1 and 7.1 in the next available maintenance update for these versions. **Workarounds and Mitigations** Customers running PAN-OS 7.1 or later can configure their SSL Decryption profiles to disable RSA. If the GlobalProtect server certificate is using RSA, customers running PAN-OS 7.1 or later can opt to replace this certificate with one implementing the Eliptic Curve DSA algorithm as a safer alternative. In addition, Palo Alto Networks has released content update 757 which includes a vulnerability signature (""TLS Network Security Protocol Information Disclosure Vulnerability - ROBOT"", #38407) that can be used as an interim mitigation to protect PAN-OS devices until the software is upgraded. For complete protection, signature #38407 must be applied upstream from any interfaces implementing SSL Decryption, or hosting a GlobalProtect portal or a GlobalProtect gateway. "

I've checked and made sure that they are all up to date and the operating system that they are running isn't affected by the CVE that PA is listing. For a quick work around since it was resetting the connections I exempted the IP addresses and everything has been going okay. But I can't figure out why this threat is triggering or why the PA is just not picking up on it, although I would guess that a content upgrade caused it. Is anybody seeing a similar issue or know how I would prevent this from showing as it still gets logged as a critical event. Everything that I can find on it just says to update the machines but the servers and the client machines are up to date. Thanks for any help. "
