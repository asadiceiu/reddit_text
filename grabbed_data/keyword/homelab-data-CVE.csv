0,CVE,homelab,[PSA] Apache Guacamole CVE-2020-9498,1,hkkk4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/hkkk4d/psa_apache_guacamole_cve20209498/,2020-07-04 01:01:13,"Hello fellow labbers, Just ran across CVE-2020-9497 and CVE-2020-9498 for Apache Guacamole affecting versions 1.1.0 and below. I know it's popular around here and it doesn't update too frequently so, thought I would pass on a friendly reminder to update! The register covers it here: [URL &amp;#x200B; I believe the CVE's for Guacamole 1.1.0 and below are fairly low risk given that exploiting requires connecting to a malicious RDP server. However, if you haven't updated for a while, it's also worth noting that versions below 1.1.0 include FreeRDP versions lower than 2.0.x which also contain a number of serious bugs as well."
1,CVE,homelab,Need a router that has around 2000 Mbps capability,1,fw0uve,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/fw0uve/need_a_router_that_has_around_2000_mbps_capability/,2020-04-07 01:36:31,"Hello! Right now, I have a PCEngines APU2. I have the one with 4 GB of RAM and three i210 NICs that have 4 send/receive queues. It's running OPNsense. Recently, I've bought a few used managed layer 2 Dell switches off of eBay so I can play around with and learn VLANs, subnetting and 802.1Q. I now have my ESXi VMs, desktops, WiFi devices, IoTs on different VLANs/subnets. If relevant, I have a Cisco AP also with multiple SSIDs on different VLANs using 802.1Q. My dilemma is that any time I do SMB file transfers between VLANs and/or saturate my internet connection, all other activities going through the router then experience extensive lag and packet loss. It's frustrating when I'm downloading a very speedy torrent that's saturating my internet connection and then the rest of the network seems to go down. It seems from Googling and reading around, a lot of this is to do with OPNsense being just too slow for the hardware that I have. I guess QoS could fix this but it seems the better option is using a Linux based distro like VyOS, IPFire, OpenWrt, etc. as I would get more routing capacity as Linux is far more performant and optimized for this sort of thing. But how much capacity would I get though? VyOS looks pretty cool. It seems like the best option for my needs it seems like and I'm willing to learn how to configure that for my needs. I like that it has a mDNS repeater. Ideally, I'd like to be able to do a file transfer or anything of the sort that usually goes at wire speed across VLANs while at the same my internet connection is saturated with little lag and no packet loss on the rest of the network. My internet connection is around 700-720+ Mbps down/22-24 Mbps up. So, 2000 Mbps routing capacity is what I'm figuring while accounting for some headroom. I don't know if 2000 Mbps capacity is really expensive. I'm looking at used Cisco routers, MicroTik, Ubiquiti EdgeRouters, etc. and don't know what to get really. Layer 3 switches aren't off the table if I'm able to configure one for my needs although I'm aware ACLs aren't as flexible as a real firewall. I want to be able to set firewall rules between the different VLANs to do a DMZ configuration and isolate a VLAN like the one my IoTs are on. I'd like to restrict some open ports to certain countries with GeoIP ranges like I am now with OPNsense. I also want to be able to do 802.1Q on one port. Optionally, a mDNS repeater would be nice but this is not required as I would just put my IoTs that utilize it on the same VLAN as my phone and laptop. My budget is around $200 and I'm willing to go up a little more for something higher quality and/or a little more capacity. I'd prefer a Cisco router if it fits my budget because I would love to learn IOS more, although I wouldn't like emailing Cisco TAC anytime a CVE crops up because I won't pay for a support contract so something using a well supported OS that's open source and isn't proprietary would be nice hence why I'm eyeballing the MicroTiks and EdgeRouters. Anyways, thanks for reading and I hope that you guys can help."

For more information, please refer to this article posted on Intels website. URL Rest assured we are working diligently with Intel and others in the industry to address the issue. We highly recommend you bookmark the following pages where we will be publishing the latest information on affected Dell / Dell EMC products including BIOS updates as they are available. Dell Client URL Dell Enterprise (Dell Servers, Storage and Networking) URL RSA (customer login required) URL Dell EMC Storage &amp; Data Protection (customer login required) URL Dell EMC CPSD (customer login required) URL In addition, Dell recommends customers follow security best practices for malware protection to protect against possible exploitation of these analysis methods.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to mitigate this vulnerability. Common FAQs Is my 12G System also impacted? - Yes, 10+ passed years systems are impacted. - For 14G and 13G Dell has already received the microcode fix from Intel and has released the proper BIOS versions to fix the issues. - 12G microcode should be provided next week by Intel, so Dell release will be by next week or two. - 11G microcode should be provided at the end of the month by Intel, so Dell release should be early February. What about older generations? - There is no plan at the moment for previous generations (10G/9G). Support EOL is well passed at this stage. - In addition from an OS perspective platforms like 9G supports only OS versions that are also EOL, and OS vendors have no plan at this stage to release fixes on these versions. Why Dell website is talking of enhancement and not fix? - Ex : URL - Enhancement to address CVE-2017-5715 (URL details to be published January 2018. - Updated the Intel Xeon Processor E5-2600 v4 Product Family Processor Microcode to version 0x0b000025. - Updated the Xeon Processor E5-2600 v3 Product Family Processor Microcode to version 0x3B. - NOTE: The wording is currently being worked to get it more explicit. However, the BIOS update is not a fix by itself as the Software layer is also involved in the resolution of the issue. BIOS is fixing the Hardware layer of the issue. OS patches will have to be applied to fix the Software layer of the issue. Why only CVE-2017-5715 is listed into the new BIOS release? - The BIOS release is the only one scheduled for the 3 CVE fixes (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 - Spectre, CVE-2017-5754 -Meltdown). What is the performance impact? - From a BIOS perspective there is no measurable impact. - From an OS perspective, it may vary a lot depending of factors like OS type, workload and the portions of the overall fix you enable (OS specific). - As a general statement there might be some performance impact at software level anyway as there is mechanisms being implemented which should add some latency on some workloads Dell EMC continues to investigate this issue to identify any potential impact to products and will continue to update the above Knowledge Base Articles with information as it becomes available, including impacted products and remediation steps.
