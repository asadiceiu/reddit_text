Other BIOS updates for listed affected platforms will roll out over the coming weeks. All customers with an affected platform should download the latest BIOS update listed below, even if they have deployed an earlier BIOS version for this vulnerability. Those who have disabled the microcode patch using an OS configuration option should re-enable it manually after applying the BIOS updates. As a reminder, the microcode update is required for Spectre (Variant 2), CVE-2017-5715.

While it can be successfully removed on many older systems, it is paramount that you **do not** attempt to modify the ME in any way aside from official firmware updates on the XPS 15 9550/9560 or Precision 5510/5520. These devices have [Intel BootGuard and Verified Boot permanently enabled](URL and the first thing it does on power up is check the integrity of the ME. If it is modified in **any way**, the system will immediately shut down on boot. There is no way to bypass this; Verified Boot is permanently enabled at the factory via fuses. Additionally, unless you have hardware knowledge/experience, an SPI flasher, and an unmodified backup of the original ME/BIOS firmware images, there is no way to fix this. It is very likely that **most** Dell laptops have an ME and BootGuard+Verified Boot enabled, most modern Skylake and Kaby Lake devices do. If you'd like to check and confirm [like this user did for the 9550](URL you can do so by running Intel MEInfo from the Intel ME System Tools package, available [here](URL I tested my own 9550 with the MEInfo from Intel ME System Tools v11.6 r11; just extract it from the archive and run it from CMD or PowerShell. **However, do not mess with any of the other tools in that package, it is a package of tools provided by Intel to OEMs for configuring the ME on their devices before shipping and can seriously damage your device if you don't know what you're doing!**"
