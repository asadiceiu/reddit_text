0,CVE,Amd,Update to AMD Product Security: SMM Callout Privilege Escalation (CVE-2020-12890),1,hb9px9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/hb9px9/update_to_amd_product_security_smm_callout/,2020-06-18 17:04:56,"&gt; AMD is aware of new research related to a potential vulnerability in AMD software technology supplied to motherboard manufacturers for use in their Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) infrastructure and plans to complete delivery of updated versions designed to mitigate the issue by the end of June 2020. &gt; The targeted attack described in the research requires privileged physical or administrative access to a system based on select AMD notebook or embedded processors. If this level of access is acquired, an attacker could potentially manipulate the AMD Generic Encapsulated Software Architecture (AGESA) to execute arbitrary code undetected by the operating system. &gt; AMD believes this only impacts certain client and embedded APU processors launched between 2016 and 2019. AMD has delivered the majority of the updated versions of AGESA to our motherboard partners and plans to deliver the remaining versions by the end of June 2020. AMD recommends following the security best practice of keeping devices up-to-date with the latest patches. End users with questions about whether their system is running on these latest versions should contact their motherboard or original equipment/system manufacturer. &gt; We thank Danny Odler for his ongoing security research.

2,CVE,Amd,Vulnerability at AMD-SEV (CVE-2019-9836),22,c5n5of,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/c5n5of/vulnerability_at_amdsev_cve20199836/,2019-06-26 18:11:52,"AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is a hardware memory encryption feature. SEV protects guest virtual machines from the hypervisor, provides confidentiality guarantees at runtime and remote attestation at launch time. See [1] for details. SEV key management code runs inside the Platform Security Processor (PSP) [2]. The SEV elliptic-curve (ECC) implementation was found to be vulnerable to an invalid curve attack. At launch-start command, an attacker can send small order ECC points not on the official NIST curves, and force the SEV firmware to multiply a small order point by the firmwares private DH scalar. By collecting enough modular residues, an attacker can recover the complete PDH private key. With the PDH, an attacker can recover the session key and the VMs launch secret. This breaks the confidentiality guarantees offered by SEV. URL"
