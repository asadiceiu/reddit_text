(I am a long-time lurker on this thread with my main account, and I thought this community would be interested in something my team and I have been building over the last few months. Our intention is only to get some feedback from actual C developers like yourself, so I apologize if this post violates any of the rules for this subreddit.) We have built what we believe is the first true source-code level software composition analysis for C. Our tool looks for open-source known vulnerabilities (CVEs) as well as security bugs in your C code by comparing it against our massive vulnerability database with over 20,000 signatures. We also look for potential licensing conflicts with regards to open-source libraries that you may be using in your project. While the above is fairly simple to do for package-based languages like Ruby. PHP, Python etc, it is extremely hard to do for C. But we thought it was a problem worth solving, and hence we built this tool. If you have a GitHub account, you can try it for free at URL (There is also a forever free plan post-trial) Would really appreciate if you could try and share your feedback here or via DM. We would also be more than happy to provide extended premium usage for those of you who can help us with more detailed and actionable feedback."
