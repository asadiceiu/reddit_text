Most articles on infamous SQL Injections don't come with their CVEs hence i can't write up a detailed report on them."
1,CVEs,Pentesting,My career feels lost,1,dtqun3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pentesting/comments/dtqun3/my_career_feels_lost/,2019-11-09 14:51:04,"Ive been in software for about nine years. About four years ago, I decided to leave software engineering and get into pen testing. I joined a consulting firm and quickly moved up the ranks until I became a technical manager. I think I leveled up fast mostly due to my background in software engineering and dealing with clients. I pretty quickly carved out a space for myself at my firm as a code review expert, and then eventually as somebody who was fairly knowledgeable about cryptography. I trained other people up, found good bugs, got some CVEs under my belt, and managed a few projects on my own. Then, I ended up interviewing at a much bigger firm that specializes in other areas of security that Im interested in, and to my surprise they offered to pay me substantially more and said Id get to work on the type of research I want. I ended up taking the offer even though I was pretty happy at my old job. Im now about seven months in and Im absolutely miserable. On paper it seems amazing, but theres something really off about the fit that Im having trouble putting my finger on. Everybody is super smart, but fiercely competitive in a way I dont like. I got hired as a senior with the expectation that Id move up to manager in no time, but other managers seemingly have no interest in training me up because Im just another engineer. I find it painfully hard to get along with anybody. Theres very little socializing at work, short of a regular research paper reading group. Its as if everything that made me stand out at my last job never existed and I dont matter to anybody. My day-to-day happiness sunk fast. Im basically just getting thrown around to different managers and their projects. Pen testing isnt fun anymore. When I brought up my concern to senior management, that I specifically wasnt getting to do any of the things I thought Id get to do, I was told I was taking things way too personally and I just need time to learn the way they do things. That was three months ago. Nothing has changed and in fact, Ive been getting in trouble for not putting in expected extra work or missing small details on certain projects. Im finding it increasingly hard to focus and do my best when I feel like I dont matter anymore at work. Im at the verge of saying fuck it and leaving my career path. This firm is supposed to be one of the best, and I feel like Im getting absolutely destroyed and am nowhere good enough, even though I was doing great at my old job. I have no idea what Im doing and nobody seems to care enough to explain what I need to do to level up. Can anybody in the industry relate? Is this a thing that happens? Is it just a byproduct of me going from a small firm to a large one?"

Today I release version 2.0 of my cve-maker tool. As a reminder, this last one is used to quickly search for the names of CVEs (computer vulnerabilities), and to retrieve, compile and execute them on the current or a remote machine in a few seconds ! The perfect tool to quickly finish a Capture The Flag that requires a privilege elevation. [URL"

5,CVEs,Pentesting,Penetration Test Vulnerability Identification,3,4g9me9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pentesting/comments/4g9me9/penetration_test_vulnerability_identification/,2016-04-25 05:35:38,"I was just wondering what the best way for a beginner to check whether a vulnerability exists within a certain version of OS, Service Version or other. For example, we all use nmaps, niktos, nessus scans to identify possible vulnerabilities. However, I was wondering what the most effective next step is. For example, I nmap -sV [IP @] and I get a list of ports open and their versions, what next? I copy and paste them into Google but this isn't accurate and surely there is a better method. I've found databases such as exploit-db, and they allow you to search and you can even use CVEs. However, what I am trying to do is find out if a version is exploitable, I don't even know what the CVE is. And when using the exploit-db, it doesn't explicity state what requirements must be met, such as version numbers for it work. Alternatively, surely there is a way for system administrators to copy and paste versions into a database and to see if they are insecure? What does everyone else do?"
