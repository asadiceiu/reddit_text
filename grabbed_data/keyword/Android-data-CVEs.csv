0,CVEs,Android,How does anyone else deal with Android security patches not being distributed?,216,781ifm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/781ifm/how_does_anyone_else_deal_with_android_security/,2017-10-23 04:16:09,"I have a 2nd Generation Moto-X. There's nothing wrong with it and it works fine. Use it with Republic Wireless and have had monthly bills mostly sub $20 on one of their no longer available plans for several years now. However its patch level is 2016-08-01. This means there are tons of unpatched issues. From what I can tell BlueBorne is unpatched, Krack is unpatched (probably expected 'till next month anyway I guess), etc. I haven't gone through the whole list of CVEs patched on URL But there seem to be dozens. I'm basically afraid to use my phone at this point, it's not safe to use BlueTooth, it's not safe to use WiFi... So what do you do? Motorola's website says as of Friday that my phone should still be getting security updates. But I haven't gotten one in over a year. So I contact Motorola. Motorola says: &gt; I'm sorry but as per checking here, the security patch available is only for 2016. In regards to this, kindly try to check with the support forums to further assist you with the security patch issue. As we just have a limited resources here in our ends. As the one who will release the patch is Google, the manufacturer such as Motorola together with the carrier is the one who will distribute the patch but as of now we don't have the information on the updated security patch. WTF? Is there a class action about this? Am I overblowing the dangers? (To me this seems like a car maker with a car that has multiple recalls refusing to fix the recalled parts.) What's the deal with this insanity? Am I missing something? My desktop gets security fixes almost immediately every time one is announced. "
1,CVEs,Android,The issue of security in LineageOS,1204,6g9imm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6g9imm/the_issue_of_security_in_lineageos/,2017-06-10 02:31:52,"I think it's time we address an issue in the custom ROM community that is quickly growing in severity. ROMs such as LineageOS are often praised as a safe-haven for the privacy and security-conscious users. The unfortunate reality, however, is that LOS appears to be exposing you to an increasingly large attack surface. I'm not referencing the obvious and already thoroughly-debated risks of rooting your device and unlocking its bootloader. This is a bit more severe. LineageOS will often merge Google's monthly security patches into their ROM and quickly push these updates out to their users. This will update the security patch level in settings and give users a sense of security. **The disturbing truth is that very few of Google's security patches are actually being applied to the device**. In the case of LineageOS, it is the responsibility of the device maintainer to fix security holes. According to [LOS' CVE tracker](URL they don't always do a very good job. A few devices have a very high percentage of fixes applied. Others, however, have applied less than 20% of Android security patches to their builds. In other words, **while your device may be reporting that it has the latest security patches, you could still be vulnerable to dozens of security holes publically disclosed several years ago**. Some of which could be very severe RCEs and privilege escalations. LineageOS isn't trying to hide this issue, it's just not very well-publicized. In a recent blog post they state, ""If you didnt know, Google releases a set of security updates monthly, which fix a number of CVEs (security vulnerabilities). These arent always in the upper layers of Android, and are typically in the kernel. Because of this, it can be difficult to record exactly which devices, as a developer, have been patched against particular vulnerabilities."" I really think this issue needs more publicity. Users need to be aware of the fact that they may not be nearly as secure as they believe, and device maintainers need to understand the importance of patching these holes. Ordinarily I'd post this in r/LineageOS, but most of the posts over there are related to troubleshooting. This could be the case for other ROMs as well, I'm just only familiar with LOS. Edit: Fixed minor typos Edit: Noticed the LOS team is in the thread. Please know that I love what you guys do and don't mean to try and smear the reputation of the ROM. This is just too important and I feel like not many people are aware of this."
2,CVEs,Android,Has Stagefright been forgotten?,65,46fluq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/46fluq/has_stagefright_been_forgotten/,2016-02-19 03:38:12,"I recall multiple vendors stating that carriers had learned from the Stagefright CVEs and wouldn't be dragging their feet on security patches. Google added the security patch level, aka the shame date, in Lollipop. I own a Galaxy Tab S, a Moto X Pure 2915, a ZTE Maven, and an old LG Google Play Edition GPad. The only one of those devices that gets monthly security patches is the GPe tablet, the oldest device in the bunch. Did carriers and manufacturers forget about those lessons in only a few short months?"
