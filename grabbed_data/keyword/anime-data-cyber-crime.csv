1,cyber-crime,anime,No Guns Life review,1,e450he,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/e450he/no_guns_life_review/,2019-12-01 09:51:22,"Hello guys! I wrote a small review for No Guns Life and I would like to know what are your thoughts about it (if should be longer, doesn't go deep in the matter enough). I don't mean to make a critic about the characters or the plot events, but rather the premiss of the whole series, the idea of cyborgs and such. English is not my main language so any feedback is appreciated. Thank you for your time! \- In 1995, the movie Ghost in the Shell presented us with a visual dramatization about the borderline between human consciousness and artificial intelligence. We met Major Motoko Kusanagi, a sentient cyborg who has a personality and goes through situations similar to us, as human bystanders that we can empathize with, like when being alive seems like an absurd phenomenon that is no different of a dream. The film puts a question mark about what it means to *be* a human being and its relationship with *reality*, but mainly from an existencial point of view. We may ask if whether a person's ""essence"" can be transferred to a cyber state, but these differences are essentially semantic/conceptual. We already live in a time where artificial intelligence is absorbed and normalized in all aspects of our everyday lives, and the rest is a matter of progress. So let's move on to the next iteration of the cyber equation: the human being as a tool. No Guns Life (2019) is a Japanese animated series where the action takes place in the future where cyber implants are a common feature, so most humans are essentially cyborgs who are designated as ""Extended"". After a recent war, many Extended are former soldiers who resort to crime as a means for survival. The protagonist is Juuzou, an extended private detective who solves problems caused by other Extended. His head is a revolver, however, the trigger is placed behind it so he can't fire it and needs someone else to do it, but he doesnt trust anybody because he doesn't want to become a tool. Juuzo's life change takes a turn when an Extended renegade asks him to protect a boy named Tetsur from the Berhren Corporation, who his seeking after him to abduct him. Juuzou sees that the boy has been the subject of many experiments: the tendons of his arms and legs, as well as the vocal cords severed, making him unable to move or speak for himself. The film-noir look with intriguing jazz music, a cyberpunk setting and hard boiled literature, No Guns Life questions about the human being as a tool, a means to an end, addressing the principles that compose transhumanism. A mercenary detective whose head is a revolver is quite a very convenient utilitarian personification. Also, the character Tetsur, a boy who was a subject of radical experiments since childhood and to whom the greatest atrocities were made with a purpose that justifies the progress in the discovery of technological implants. With today's advances in biotechnology, DNA manipulation and cloning, it is inevitable that humans will eventually create a better version of themselves. Filled with *Extendeds* (the human cyborgs), the series questions about the human being as an instrument, as a tool, and how this creates a problem of identity and freedom of choice, as the functionality of a tool is usually fateful."
2,cyber-crime,anime,Netflix Shows and the Future of their Shows,90,cw7mmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/cw7mmn/netflix_shows_and_the_future_of_their_shows/,2019-08-28 03:28:09,"Listen, Netflix is going to stick around as an anime distributor for as long as they are alive (I'm still not convinced they will die by Disney, but whatever) and I've decided to compile a list of not only 2019 Netflix Anime shows, but beyond that! I'll be doing the synopsis' of each show that they have planned. Not only that, but the studio and the possible release window that they are released. I'll possibly give my opinion if there is enough information I can give an opinion, but that's about it. Let's get into it! ***Seis Manos*** **Studio:** Powerhouse Animation Studios (Castlevania and O.K K.O! Let's be Heroes!) **Release Window**: Fall 2019 **Synopsis:** The plot is set in the fictional town of San Simon in Mexico and revolves around three orphans trained in Chinese martial arts. When their mentor is killed, they join forces with an American and a Mexican police officer to avenge the murder. **Thoughts:** Besides the argument that it's anime or whatever, It sounds pretty interesting. This show and a lot of others will show the trend that Netflix really doesn't like making anime based on pre-established mangas (though there are some) and they seem more comfortable with original anime. This looks decent, but I don't really think the hype is there for it. ***Carole and Tuesday (*****Part 1*****)*** **Studio:** Bones (Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Eureka Seven and a bunch of other great stuff) **Release Date:** August 30th **Synopsis:** In the not too distant future, Humanity has colonized Mars. 50 years on from when the first colony settled humanity has entered into a new age of culture produced by A.I. 2 young women who aspire to become musicians have a fateful encounter and soon the pair starts a movement of music they didnt think was possible. **Thoughts:** Yeah, I know. This is another rule I'm adding in: I'm including shows that are technically Netflix originals, but only ones that are actually planned to be that (so that includes Beastars and Ultramarine Magmell). I know people already have opinions and while I haven't gotten around to watching it, it looks very good and the music I've heard is stunning. ***Levius*** **Studio:** Polygon Pictures (Knights of Sidonia and Ajin: Demi-Human) **Release Window:** Winter 2019 **Synopsis:** In an age where devices are powered by steam, technology that fuses bodies to machinery makes cyber-boxing fights immensely popular. A young man named Levius is drawn into these fights through what can only be destiny, but his talents will be what determines his future. **Thoughts:** Polygon has been one of these studios that I know are getting really good at the 3DCG stuff and they've continued to impress me and this looks like their best work yet. I'm actually interested for once. ***Beastars*** **Studio:** Orange (Land of The Lustrous, Dimension W and sadly not the ones that animated the Orange manga) **Release Window:** Since it's ending in December, let's be fair and say 2022 when it's on Netflix (I jest, but unless they say ""screw the dub"", then you're going have to wait a couple of months) **Synopsis:** In a world populated by anthropomorphic animals, herbivores and carnivores coexist with each other. Regoshi the wolf is a member of the drama club. Despite his menacing appearance, he has a very gentle heart. Throughout most of his life, he has always been an object of fear and hatred by other animals, and hes been quite accustomed to that lifestyle. But soon, he finds himself becoming more involved with his fellow classmates who have their own share of insecurities and finds his life in school changing slowly. **Thoughts:** This show sounds so fascinating and I honestly thought this was a crime manga, but I'm very wrong. Just by the premise alone, I'm expecting great things from it. ***Ultramarine Magmell*** **Studio:** Pierrot (Na Ni Mo) **Release Window:** December 2019 **Synopsis:** One day in the middle of the Pacific ocean a miracle occurred, a new continent appeared out of nowhere! The new continent was the home for new and mysterious plants, creatures and minerals! Humanity is excited as the age of exploration has returned. **Thoughts:** I'm shounen trash and I'm probably going to watch now matter how bad I hear it is (I heard it's really fucking bad) but I'll see it for myself. ***Eden*** **Studio:** Qubic Picutres (None so far) **Release Window:** Early 2020 **Synopsis:** This isn't a synopsis, but this is interesting. *Eden* is the collaboration between Netflix and Yasuhiro Irie. The Original anime is rumoured to release in Q1 of 2020 and is expected to be one the best anime on Netflix to date. Irie was in the directors seat for beloved fan favorite Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the original FMA series years prior. If Irie can reap the same level of success then Eden will be incredible. **Thoughts:** I think the main attraction of this show is that it's being made by the director of FMAB and while that is a very good attraction, I don't think it's enough to call this anticipated since there's only one image of it. ***Gods &amp; Heroes*** **Studio:** Powerhouse **Release Window:** 2020 **Synopsis:** Chronicling the illegitimate son of Zeus, a young man is tasked with saving heaven and earth despite the interference of a vengeful goddess and her monstrous forces. **Thoughts:** Sounds really interesting, but the execution is important and I'm interested to see how Powerhouse does with these shows. Since this (and Seis Manos) isn't being made by the guy that made Castlevania, I'm interested seeing how these new directors step up to the plate. ***Pacific Rim and Altered Carbon*** **Studio:** Legendary Entertainment and Anima (none I could find) **Release Window:** TBD **Synopsis:** For Pacific Rim, Two siblings in search for their parents are forced to pilot an abandoned Jaeger to cross their hostile world. For Altered Carbon, The anime will take place in the same universe as the series but will expand upon the mythology of the world. **Thoughts:** I grouped these up because they both have the same information. They could be good. I don't know. The biggest thing I could find is that Dai Sato will be writing the series (He wrote some episodes of Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and did the script of Wolf's Rain), so that's pretty interesting. ***Cagaster of an Insect Cage*** **Studio:** Gonzo (Try Knights and 7seeds) **Release Window:** TBD **Synopsis:** Set in a post-apocalyptic world, a disease that turns humans into monstrous insects has ravaged humanity. In this world, a young couple struggles to survive in the post-apocalyptic world. **Thoughts:** This could be good but Gonzo are all over the place and it's probably going to suck. ***Drifting Dragons*** **Studio:** Polygon Pictures **Release Window:** Winter 2020 **Synopsis;** Dragons, the rulers of the sky. To many people on the surface, they are a dire threat, but at the same time, a valuable source of medicine, oil, and food. There are those who hunt the dragons. They travel the skies in dragon-hunting airships. This is the story of one of those ships, the Quin Zaza, and its crew. **Thoughts:** I've read the manga and I'm so fucking hyped for this. The art is beautiful, the characters are very interesting and fun and the whole concept of this show is ridiculously cool. It's also like Food wars but with dragons and that's weirdly cool. ***Dragons Dogma*** **Studio:** Sublimation (No released series, but they are working on an original called Shikizakura) **Release Window:** 2020 **Synopsis:** On the continent of Gransys, a brave knight goes on a journey to find his heart after its stolen by Dragon. The appearance of the Dragon signals the end of days and the beginning of the apocalypse. Now an Arisen the brave knight is destined to face the dragon, must reclaim his heart and stop the apocalypse by slaying the beast. **Thoughts:** This is probably the weirdest choice to make an anime about. I do know Dogma has a fanbase, but I didn't know this needed an anime for it. I can't say much on the animation studio, but it seems possible that they will do it with 2D animation. ***Yasuke*** **Studio:** Mappa (Banna Fish and Kids on The Slope) **Release Window:** TBD **Synopsis:** In the war-torn era of feudal Japan, a retired ronin (a wandering samurai who had no lord or master) takes up arms once again after he is charged with the task of transporting a child to safety. The mysterious child is being hunted by dark forces that wish it dead forcing the ronin to bring his sword out of retirement and fight once more. Thoughts: I could actually see this being really good. MAPPA are really good animation studio when given a good director and since this is being created by LeSean Thomas, I could see it being really good. ***Trese*** **Studio:** BASE Entertainment (Nothing yet) **Release Window:** TBD **Synopsis:** The story is based upon Philippine folklore of mythical creatures that live in hiding amongst humans. Protagonist Alexandra Trese goes up against the criminal underworld of Manila whos crime bosses consist of supernatural beings. ***Ghost in the Shell SAC\_2045*** **Studio:** Production I.G (Psycho Pass, Haikyuu) **Release Window:** 2020 (If I had to guess, It will come out around the Summer of 2020 or possibly Fall 2020, due to them working on Haikyuu and Psycho Pass for two seasons) **Synopsis:** No synopsis yet. **Thoughts:** After seeing Ultraman, I do have faith in the 3DCG team for I.G that it can do a really god job with this. If they can tune it up and make it look half as good as the teaser image (this [one](URL then this could be really good. ***Super Crooks*** **Studio:** Bones **Release Window:** 2020 (Since their working on MHA till the end of Winter, Spring to Summer 2020 seems most likely) **Synopsis:** With the appearance of so many super villains, the authorities are trying even harder to subdue them. Tired of a saturated market and the authorities constantly hounding them a team of supervillains head to Spain to carry out a legendary last heist. **Thoughts:** This one is so strange for me to see. Bones doing a miller world adaptation is so weird for me to think about, but I guess we will have to see how it works. I still love Bones, I'm just interested to see how they do this. ***Spriggan*** **Studio:** Jojo's Bizarre Production (Jojo Part 1-5 and nothing else) **Release Window:** 2020 (They are working on a 4-cour of Fire Force and I don't know when they will take a break, I'm going to guess either Summer 2020 or possibly Fall) **Synopsis:** Many years ago an ancient civilization once ruled the Earth but ultimately destroyed themselves. Leaving messages to future generations to find, they detail how to use the powerful creations they used. Various factions begin to search for the mysterious artifacts in the order to use them against their enemies. Standing in their way is the ARCAM Corporation and their elite squadron of soldiers known as Spriggans. **Thoughts:** This is probably the most normal Netflix anime that they will have. It's based off a manga, it's being made by an animation studio that specializes in 2D animation and I could totally see this going week to week episodes but whatever. Excited to see this. ***Vampire in The Garden*** **Studio:** Wit Studio (AoT Season 1-3, Seraph of The End and Pokemon Movie 21: Minna no Monogatari) **Release Window:** 2020 (This could be released anytime of the year since Vinland is going to end the fall this season and they don't have much in terms of upcoming shows besides this. It's all really based off how fast they start the next season fo Vinland and if they get also start to animate the 4th season of AoT) **Synopsis:** A story about an unlikely friendship between human and vampire race that intertwines with the power or music. **Thoughts:** I'm just excited to see Wit actually make anime. Is that enough? And That's It! **Overall:** I think Netflix does have so potentially very good shows here. The stuff from Bones, Wit, Jojo and I.G sounds really good, but there are some others like Yasuke and Levius that sounds really good too. It just sucks that Netflix never wants to do any of these anime on a week to week basis. It sucks that they have never considered it and it's just disappointing to see it. I'm excited for a lot fo these anime, but I'm just worried in how they release it."
3,cyber-crime,anime,Shield Hero is a childish show with no respect for its viewers (Episode 21 spoilers),0,burwvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/burwvh/shield_hero_is_a_childish_show_with_no_respect/,2019-05-30 21:18:02,"While show has been on decline quality wise ever since the duel with the Spear Hero, this new episode takes the cake as the worst episode so far, which really surprised me after watching the pope fight for 2 episodes where everyone just stood around like a log in the cyber magic cathedral. Penkin's music is still good though, anyway: &amp;#x200B; 1. The Queen resolved the whole conflict by herself thus making Naofumi's journey pointless, since all he had to do was to wait until she shows up. \- Naofumi didn't have to make up with the other heroes, since he is still the most op character in the show and it takes the entire church to make him faint while he still beats you up. \- He doesn't need to confront his trust issues towards women since he has loli slaves who won't lie to him. (I would argue it's the worst aspect of the show) \- He didn't need to confront Myne or the king directly, making him choose either revenge or forgiveness, the Queen did it for him. He took his revenge by making everyone call the bad girl ""bitch slut"" and the king ""trash"", like some elementary school revenge plot where the mom scolds her daughter for making fun of you and as a bonus you get to cuss at her without anyone going mad, the perfect deal, the perfect cringe. So essentialy: ""Thanks for waiting Naoufumi, you win, you're a millionaire"". &amp;#x200B; 2. The show took its sweet time to establish not only the darker tone in the first couple of episodes but also basic politics and punishments for crime, and after all that apparently in Melromac, an attempt to assassinate the heir to the goddamn throne does not equal instant death, but a grade school name calling by the dude who's gonna hang around in this world only until the waves stop (so, a year maybe?) and who apparently has a final word in the trial where the Queen herself is involved. This is nonsense. If the show wanted to keep its antagonists alive there were so many diffrent ways to do this, simplest example: since the king's crime was summoning all heroes for himself the Queen could just banish him, stripping him of his titles. Myne in cell waiting for her execution gets help from Naofumi and escapes Tyrion style. &amp;#x200B; 3. People of Melromac are dumbasses. \- After one request from the Queen they throw away their religion which was part of their whole lives. \- The fantasy medieval lynch mob is happy that they won't get to see an execution of nobles apparently. \- They believe the magic screen (which makes close-ups and camera pans) that can be easily modified and fabricated &amp;#x200B; Also, Rising of the Shield Hero is a very sexist show. It has no respect to its female cast whatsoever, but that's a topic for another day and I wanted to focus on episode 21 alone."
4,cyber-crime,anime,The Great OAV Watch Week 21: Cyber City Oedo 808,6,6f9dcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6f9dcf/the_great_oav_watch_week_21_cyber_city_oedo_808/,2017-06-05 05:52:52,"Hey guys, welcome to yet another week of my great OAV watch. This is my little project of watching all the OAVs on my PTW list...all 170+ of them. Again I only have one show for you as I've been busy with exams but now I'm finished I should be getting back up to two or more per week. - **[Cyber City Oedo 808]( URL (1990-1991: Madhouse) 3/3 eps.** **Staff and Background** An action OAV made in the early 1990s featuring a ton of violence and lots of the colour blue, can you guess who the director is yet? Yep, it is our old friend [Yoshiaki Kawajiri]( URL and for once we get him making an original story. Weve come across him so many times in these threads that you should be aware of who is by now. But for those of you who dont know who Kawajiri is basically no man defined what anime was in America more than Kawajiri. Between his works and [Legend of the Overfiend]( URL mainstream America saw anime as being cartoons filled with hyper violence and graphic sex. This view has been consistently softening since the Pokemon anime made its way over, however sex and violence are still intrinsically bound up in the American and indeed most of the wests view on anime. So Kawajiri is kind of important. **Story and Characters** Cyber City Oedo is 3 episodes long and each episode is a standalone story with a different one of our main characters taking the lead in each episode. It is all set in this very 80s sci-fi future with lasers, cyborgs, and conspiracies all over the place. All of our 3 leads are cyber police, which means they are all ex-criminals who are working off their sentences by fighting crime. They each have on a collar that serves as a communicator but also as the way by which they are kept in line. The collars are packed with explosives so if they dont complete their mission in the given time then boom goes their neck. The first episode is dedicated to [Sengoku]( URL and has a bit of a Die Hard feel to it. The second episode is dedicated to [Gogol]( URL (Gambimaru in the sub) and involves some shadowy government shit. The final episode is about [Benten]( URL (Merill in the sub) and his, yep that is a dude, investigation of some apparent vampires. They are all really fun and interesting characters to follow, especially Gogol, and they perfectly match the cyberpunk world of the show. The plotlines arent the most inventive ever but they are really fun and dont feel too clich. **Audio and Visuals** As with everything Kawajiri, Cyber City Oedo looks [really fucking good]( URL I wish a blue-ray was available in the UK because this show fucking deserves it, there is so much insane detail! The action is all really well shot and is very fluid, for all his faults Kawajiri is a genius in terms of action. The art style is super dope and the characters designs are fantastic. Really there is nothing I could complain about visually. The audio side of this is pretty good too. So I watched the dub which turned out to be really solid. Sure, there were one or two awkward lines but in general the slightly camp dub worked fantastically with the show. Of course, they did fifteen the shit out of it, but again that actually worked with the kind of show it is. The sub is pretty good I assume, plus the sub has my man [Norio Wakamoto](URL in the role of the chief of the cyber police! The music was also pretty dope too, I love [the OP.]( URL Interestingly, on the original UK VHS release they completely replaced the music with a load of rock. Quite a few fans actually argue that this score is better and more fitting than the original OST, [heres a sample]( URL **Conclusion** Overall Cyber City Oedo 808 is just a really awesome cyberpunk action show. It has great action, a cool art design, rocking music, fun characters, and interesting plots. It is everything I love about Kawajiri but without all the things Im not so fond of, mainly the weird sex stuff. Look, just go watch this as it is fucking great. Did I mention there are [cyborg sabre-toothed tigers that shoot lasers from there mouth?]( URL 8/10 **42 shows down!**"
