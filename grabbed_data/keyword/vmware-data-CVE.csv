6,CVE,vmware,Happy Thanksgiving r/VMware. Lots to be thankful for including the latest VMware Skyline release available now!,1,e2moeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/e2moeg/happy_thanksgiving_rvmware_lots_to_be_thankful/,2019-11-28 07:57:47,"We are excited to announce a number of updates to VMware Skyline. Skyline is VMwares proactive support service, which identifies potential issues in your environment, and provides recommendations for how to avoid each potential issue, before it occurs. The following updates are made available via a combination of Skyline Collector version 2.3 and updates to the Skyline Advisor service, along with new integration with Dell EMC SupportAssist Enterprise. ### Enhanced Security Policy We have enhanced the process of granting user access to Skyline Advisor. Now, an Organization Owner must explicitly grant users access to Skyline Advisor. If your access to Skyline Advisor was removed, contact an Organization Owner within your Cloud Services Organization, and request they grant you access to the Skyline Advisor service role. The Organization Owner is usually the individual who originally created your Cloud Services Organization for Skyline. We have created the [KB Article 76319](URL to help you resolve the loss of access to Skyline Advisor. If you have any trouble with re-gaining access to Skyline Advisor, please start a discussion within the [Skyline Community](URL The Skyline Community is moderated by a team of VMware Technical Support Engineers. If you are a Premier Support customer, contact your Support Account Manager for assistance. ### Integrate Dell EMC SupportAssist for Enterprise with Skyline Thousands of customers leverage Dell EMC SupportAssist Enterprise (SAE) to proactively support Dell hardware. Dell EMC SAE is Dells proactive support technology for hardware, that is included in customer support entitlements. Dell EMC SAE and Skyline are joining forces, enabling a best-in-class proactive support experience for customers utilizing Dell PowerEdge servers 12G and above to operate their VMware products and solutions on. Customers who use Dell EMC SAE to proactively support their Dell PowerEdge server hardware will now see a notification providing them information about Skyline, with a call to action to download and install Skyline. Similarly, customers using Skyline will now see a notification within Skyline Advisor, with a call to action to download and install Dell EMC SAE. Before we continue, there is a caveat. As noted in the first paragraph, this integration is only available to customers using Dell PowerEdge servers 12G and above. The **Integrations** tab will only appear within Skyline Advisor if you are using Dell PowerEdge servers 12G and above. If you are using an older version of Dell PowerEdge servers or another vendor server hardware, the Integrations tab within Skyline Advisor will not be visible. Lets continue Within Skyline Advisor, a new **Integrations** tab may be available to you, which allows you to Opt-In to this integration. After Opting-In, Skyline Advisor will display which ESXi hosts within your environment have Dell EMC SAE enable for them, or not. This notification will appear within **Inventory** view of Skyline Advisor, in the Solution Tags column. The SupportAssist notification will only appear for Dell PowerEdge servers 12G and above running ESXi. &amp;#x200B; ![img](rgperjzjla141) The following is required in order to enable the Dell EMC SAE and VMware Skyline integration: * [Dell EMC SupportAssist for Enterprise v4.0.5](URL * Skyline Collector v2.2 or above. We recommend [Skyline Collector version 2.3](URL ### Upload Support Log Bundles for Horizon Connection Servers Customers who have added Horizon to Skyline, for potential issue identification, will now be able to upload a support log bundle to VMware Global Support Services (GSS), using Skyline Log Assist. A Horizon Connection Server that has been added to a Skyline Collector will now appear in the Inventory Tree, of the **Initiate Log Transfer** page. &amp;#x200B; ![img](rld1pdqlla141) The following is required in order to upload a Horizon Connection Server support log bundle to VMware GSS, using Skyline Log Assist: * [Horizon 7 v7.10](URL * [Skyline Collector v2.3](URL Also, ensure the account used to add your Horizon Connection Server to the Skyline Collector has the necessary permissions to initiate a log transfer request. We have updated [KB Article 59661](URL with the required permissions, and the steps to take within the Horizon 7 Administration console to create a role specific for Skyline. ### Collector Health The Collector Details page within Skyline Advisor has been updated to include both Collector, and configured product health. Now you can view the health of all Skyline Collectors registered with your Cloud Services Organization in one-place. Access the Collector Health page by clicking on **Show Collector Details**, located on the Skyline Advisor Dashboard page. For each Skyline Collector, the products configured for that Skyline Collector are displayed. Now, we are also displaying the health for each of the configured products. If there is an issue with a configured product, such as account disabled or password expiration, the status for the configured product will change to Communication Issues (red, instead of green). The Collector Health state, and configured product state, are independent of each other. What does that mean? It means that the Collector may be in a Healthy state, but all configured products are healthy (Configured). In this example below, the Skyline Collector **Skyline-HOL-Horzion** is in a *Failed to Collect Data* state. However, the configured Horizon Connection Server is in a healthy (**Configured**) state. In this scenario, there is an issue with the Skyline Collector, such as it is unable to send the product usage data collected to VMware. Perhaps a firewall policy was updated that is preventing outbound communication. There is not an issue with the configured Horizon Connection Server, as it operating correctly (sending product usage data to the Skyline Collector). &amp;#x200B; ![img](fo91istnla141) Remember, there are two types of data paths, one from the Skyline Collector to VMware, and the other from the products configured to the Skyline Collector. This is why there are two health statuses, and why they are independent of each other. ### Federated Authentication to Skyline Advisor Today, customers use their My VMware or VMware account to access Skyline Advisor, via VMware Cloud Services. Enterprises using Cloud Services can set up federation with their corporate domain accounts. This allows customers to use the same account they use to access their corporate IT systems, to also access Cloud Services. This helps simplify the control of access to both corporate IT systems, and Cloud Services. To set up **Federated Identity Management** to Cloud Services, and Skyline Advisor, follow the directions available in the [VMware Cloud Services Product Documentation](URL After setting up and configuring federated identity management, remember to add the Skyline Advisor service role to the corporate domain accounts added to Cloud Services. &amp;#x200B; ![img](0kyscftola141) ### Skyline Collector Active Directory Improvement In the past, customers had the ability to enable Active Directory authentication for the Skyline Collector. However, it required that anonymous bind be configured for Active Directory, which is not recommended. We are happy to announce that anonymous bind is no-longer required to enable Active Directory authentication for the Skyline Collector. &amp;#x200B; ![img](3fmb88lpla141) Now, customers can enable Active Directory users and groups to access the Skyline Collector user interface, without the anonymous bind requirement. Customers will use an account to bind Active Directory to the Skyline Collector. Note, the account used to bind Active Directory to the Skyline Collector is not stored by the Collector. Customers will be required to provide an account each time they want to allow a new user, or group, access to the Skyline Collector user interface. ### New Skyline Findings &amp; Recommendations We saved the best for last. Ten new findings &amp; recommendations have been added to Skyline. If applicable to your environment, you will see these new findings &amp; recommendations appear within the Findings &amp; Recommendations tab of Skyline Advisor. And security individuals, or teams, will be happy to see that we have added a check for the TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) Speculative Execution and Machine Check Error on Page Size Change (MCEPSC) Denial-of-service vulnerabilities. **VLAN Tasgging issues with Intel X710 network adapter** *Finding ID:* vSphere-VLANTaggingIntelX710-KB#2149781 *Article:* [URL **Host goes to non-responsive state  IPMI SEL unavailable** *Finding ID:* vSphere-hostnonresponsive-KB#70973 *Article:* [URL **Networking issues with dvSwitch in ESXi 6.0: Unsupported address family** *Finding ID:* vSphere-UnsupportAddressFamily-KB#2117308 *Article:* [URL **ESXi 6.7 U2/U3 unresponsive when running Dell OpenManage Server Administrator 9.3.0** *Finding ID:* vSphere-UnresponsiveOpenManage93-KB#74696 *Article:* [URL **ESXi 6.0 Update 2 host fails with a PSOD error mentioning Vmxnet3VMKDevRxWithLock** *Finding ID:* vSphere-PSODVmxnet3VMKDevRxWithLock-KB#2144968 *Article:* [URL **backtrace SCSI\_DeviceClusteringClearState PSOD in ESXi 6.5 Update 2** *Finding ID:* vSphere-PSODScsiDevice-KB#56492 *Article:* [URL **vSphere 6.7 HTML5 client cannot query more than 200 principals** *Finding ID:* vSphere-HTML5ClientMaximumObjects-KB#55617 *Article:* [URL **VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion updates address a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2019-5536)** *Finding ID:* vSphere-ESXiOS5536-VMSA#20190019 *Article:* [URL **Hypervisor-Specific Mitigations for TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) Speculative-Execution vulnerability (CVE-2019-11135)** *Finding ID:* vSphere-CVE-2019-11135-VMSA#20190020 *Article:* [URL **Hypervisor-Specific Mitigations for Machine Check Error on Page Size Change (MCEPSC) Denial-of-Service vulnerability (CVE-2018-12207)** *Finding ID:* vSphere-CVE-2018-12207-VMSA#20190020 *Article:* [URL &amp; [URL Important: Additional configuration is required after updating to enable mitigations, these mitigations may have a performance impact and are not enabled by default.

I updated server BIOS, VCSA, the ESXi hosts, the VM Hardware, VM Tools, updated the Windows OS, set the registry keys, and ran the Microsoft script to verify everything was good. I checked every VM and was in good shape. This past weekend, I did some SAN maintenance and shut all the VMs and hosts down. When I brought them back up and re-ran the script, I'm now seeing that I don't have hardware support for CVE-2017-5715 [branch target injection]. Nothing really changed, so I'm at a loss to what happened here. The VM I ran the script on is running within a VMware cluster on a SAN. I moved the VM to a similar standalone host (local storage vs. SAN) and re-ran the script and it came back good. Moved it back to the cluster and the script came back with no hardware support for CVE-2017-5715 [branch target injection]. Any ideas? Thank you!

Microsoft has a registry key to enable it, and we set it to 1 on our DCs. URL However this broke AppVolumes. The NTLM authentication wouldn't authenticate users when they logged in, so they didn't get any AppStacks mounted. I was wondering if there was anyway to change the authentication AppVolumes uses? I found this way to disable NTLM. URL But it is not clear what this does. Does it stop doing secure authentication? Or does it switch to kerberos? Has anyone seen this? Or know what AVM_NTLM_DISABLED actually does? Thanks!"
