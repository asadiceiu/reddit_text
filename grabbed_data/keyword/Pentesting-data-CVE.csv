The exploit itself was based on the fact that there is a ""use after free"" case in the ""drag and drop"" mechanism of vmware ( i listed the cve below ). Though I understand the ""use after free"" bug, I couldn't realize how it lead into code execution. So if it wasn't clear from the story, my question is how can ""use after free"" bug lead into code execution? The cve i referring: URL"

For example, we all use nmaps, niktos, nessus scans to identify possible vulnerabilities. However, I was wondering what the most effective next step is. For example, I nmap -sV [IP @] and I get a list of ports open and their versions, what next? I copy and paste them into Google but this isn't accurate and surely there is a better method. I've found databases such as exploit-db, and they allow you to search and you can even use CVEs. However, what I am trying to do is find out if a version is exploitable, I don't even know what the CVE is. And when using the exploit-db, it doesn't explicity state what requirements must be met, such as version numbers for it work. Alternatively, surely there is a way for system administrators to copy and paste versions into a database and to see if they are insecure? What does everyone else do?"
