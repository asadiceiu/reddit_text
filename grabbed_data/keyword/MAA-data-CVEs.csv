0,CVEs,MAA,Why Do You Keep Playing?,2,441s6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAA/comments/441s6h/why_do_you_keep_playing/,2016-02-04 07:48:53,"Hello everyone! I've been playing M:AA since it was first technically in Beta, and have spent several years chasing down certain characters, mastering PvE content and cringing at every new meta in PvP as it's developed. Although I've always played the game more casually than others (never once have I felt compelled to compete in PvP for more than maybe some gold), I've played almost every day for years. And, honestly... I'm done with it. Up until now, I've chased down every character. To date, I'm missing 6 characters, only two of which are available for general purchase. I'm 2 covers from Winter Soldier, 5 from Lizard. But I just don't see a point in continuing. I'm not sure what I'm getting from the game. I'm disappointed by routine CVEs, by the bugs that prevent certain character features from functioning, and by the general lack of care Playdom seems to put into ensuring the game runs smoothly. In other words, I'm not seeing a reason to keep chasing a carrot any more. To those of you still playing: what are you getting out of the game? Why do you continue to play every day? I'm not here to cast judgment, but to genuinely inquire as to what keeps you coming back."
1,CVEs,MAA,"Is there much value in submitting a ""ticket"" in response to CVEs/Forced Refreshes?",5,40iyu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAA/comments/40iyu9/is_there_much_value_in_submitting_a_ticket_in/,2016-01-12 08:22:23,"I ask as a player who has logged in diligently to raise their PVP rating and experienced a loss in ratings on the final day due to Forced Refreshes on matches which I have won. As a game which relies upon a freemium model it seems only fair that those who play the game are given a certain level of service. Of course as a member of this sub I have known the end of PVP to put a huge weight on the Playdom servers and accept some naive responsibility for the decline of my personal rating. Ultimately, I wondered if any other player felt inclined to report the lack of consistency in quality of gameplay. "

Afraid to try and boost my rank because of CVEs, afraid to drop below 1550 before time runs out. WHAT DO I DO?!"

4,CVEs,MAA,I'd like to take a moment and thank everyone here.,31,3qcb5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAA/comments/3qcb5u/id_like_to_take_a_moment_and_thank_everyone_here/,2015-10-27 09:33:02,"Like they say, ""once is an accident. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is a trend."" This tournament marks my third Adamantium finish since coming back to the game earlier this year, and I have to say that it happened thanks in large part to this community. I don't mean to be boastful...I'm legitimately grateful...I could not have done it without the best practices, ideas, and theorycraft that goes on here. I would be insane without a place to complain about CVEs and forced refreshes. I would have no idea which gear or heroes are worth a damn. I'd have no shot at A-Bomb (or Noir or Deathlok) without you guys. On top of that, the game is infinitely more fun when I have you all to talk about it with. So from the bottom of my cold, blackened heart, I thank you. TL;DR: /r/maa is the MVP of PVP in my book."
5,CVEs,MAA,I don't have constant CVE problems - here's what I use,6,3dgivo,http://www.reddit.com/r/MAA/comments/3dgivo/i_dont_have_constant_cve_problems_heres_what_i_use/,2015-07-16 12:23:39,"I use the browser Iron by SRWare. It's a variant of Chrome with less bloat. You can get a portable version too. URL I apply the following adblock plus filters, to get rid of the ad on top, the entire panel on the right, and the chat thing on the bottom right. -----here we go----- `##div#rightCol` `##div#xPromoHeaderForm` `##div#xpromo` `##div#xpromoHeaderIframe` `##form#xpromoHeaderIframe` `##iframe#xpromoHeaderIframe` `##target#xpromoHeaderIframe` `apps.facebook.com###fbDockChatBuddylistNub` `apps.facebook.com##._2pi9` `apps.facebook.com##.fbNubButton` `apps.facebook.com##.uiToggle._50-` `v.fbNub._4mq3.hide_on_presence_error` -------ok we're done---------- I'm sure most of these are unnecessary, but they work. Lastly, I go to the address bar, and type ""about:plugins"" and disable everything that's obviously stupid, like ""iTunes Application Detector"", ""Windows Live Photo Gallery"", there's a lot of stuff I could get rid of but I don't. Be as picky as you like, and experiment. For MAA, you don't need a PDF viewer, or VLC Web Plugin; I'm sure you get the idea. That's about it. I read about how many people are fraught with CVEs all through PVP and I don't experience the same thing. Naturally, the last day of PVP is horrible, updates cause a refresh, but I don't suffer from streams of CVEs that ruin my day. I hope this helps. I think I should quickly describe adding Adblock Plus filters in Iron. Copy that block of filters Right click on the Adblock PLus stop sign in the upper right Click Options Click ""Edit filters as raw text"" on the right, in between the two big boxes. Paste the filters into the bottom box Click Apply Changes on the right :)"
