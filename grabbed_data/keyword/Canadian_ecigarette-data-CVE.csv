After (as of posting) 2012 orders, it's been a tremendous ride and it wouldn't have been possible if not for our friends and fans, particularly those who found us through CECR. Why are we closing? I'm starting a new venture in the vaping industry that sort of overlaps with SZVapor: new storefront, new products, new everything basically, with potentially an actual storefront in 2019. The ""SZVapor scope"" is too narrow for this new vision, so think of it as a radical relaunching. While the SZ store is leaving, something bigger and better is taking its place. This has been in the planning stages for over a year, with a date determined just after CVE a couple of months ago. Everything's approaching completion on the transition so it's appropriate now to announce the end of SZ. What does it mean for the SZ flavors you know and love? Some may know but some may not know that we're been [revamping](URL our product line. The same tried and true SZ flavors you know and love will still be available, just under a different blanket if that makes sense. Not only that, we're pretty much ready to drop new flavors once we're live. Things that are different from what you're used to, from SZ or otherwise. I've gone on long enough, so I want to finish by saying thanks to everyone at CECR but helping shape SZ from its inception years ago to what it is today and what will be the fruit of all that effort."

First off, **Happy Father's Day**! As this is my first as a Dad, I'll be sure to enjoy it as much as possible. Our good friends from STLTH, Evaperated, and SUB-OHM have updates for you on our frontpage for Father's Day - so please do check them out! VapeDeals has been steadily growing over the past month, and we are in the midst of planning for scale / automation. As you may know, I started the site really to fulfill a hole in our community (deals and reviews) but did it without thinking that there would be so much interest. And thus, I did not automate a lot of the site. I've been traveling on business for the past two weeks and thus wasn't able to contact and update the site with more Father's Day Deals. Well, going forward, we will aim to make this much simpler by building in the capability for vendors to self-update our frontpage (for times when I'm away). We have quite a few things planned over the summer, and can't wait to share them with you. **With CVE coming up**, we'll be there in full force and look forward to connecting you with CVE as much as possible. Please let us know if there's anything you'd like to see from us for CVE and we'll be sure to do it if feasible. Cheers! Keith"

11,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Gamma Five and Helix by Cloudfire,8,8ujyue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/8ujyue/honest_review_time_gamma_five_and_helix_by/,2018-06-29 00:34:25,"Heres a look at the latest from Cloudfire, one of which happened to win Best in Show Menthol at CVE Toronto 2018. Cloudfire originally Hjelm Vapor is run by Ryan Hjelm a young ambitious juice maker out of Toronto thats been absolutely killing it for the past few years. I first met him at Juice Jam a couple years back where I picked up his original Cloudfire line for review and have been a fan ever since. At the Expo in Edmonton he was kind enough to set me up his latest release Cloudfire Dripgang: Gamma Five and Helix two incredible fruity blends that are just about perfect for summertime. Here are my honest thoughts on Gamma Five and Helix from Cloudfire Dripgang. Bottles: The juice comes in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla style bottles with labels that sport a sort of space theme with Helix rocking what looks like a DNA Helix on top or a moon or a planet and Gamma Five sporting an image of what looks like a cloudy nebula. Both bottles look fantastic and dont bear any resemblance to the original Cloudfire lineup with their almost comic book style labels. Both flavours come in an 80vg blend and the pair I got were in 3mg. Heres [a shot of the bottles](URL **Setup:** Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Gamma Five](URL **Site description:** A mysterious candy blended of sweet grapes, tart grapefruit and sour orchard fruits. **My thoughts:** Gamma Five is an interesting mix of grape, orchard fruits and just a hint of grapefruit. Its not super tart despite the grapefruit as it only tends to come through on the tail end for me and very subtle when it does. The grape is the most forward in the blend but is mixed with something that makes it a bit more sour which might possibly be something like green or Fuji apple but its blended so well that its a little difficult to distinguish it from the grape. In a way it adds a more natural note to the grape and keeps it from tasting like syrupy medicine or anything like that, its still not quite a natural grape but its much closer then it would be without. It kind of reminds me of a Grapple or grape flavoured apple like you can find in the grocery store or like a few Grapple flavours that Ive reviewed in the past. The whole thing has a very slight candy finish that reminds me of those SweeTart candies, more of a powdered candy taste then a boiled sweet. Generally speaking there arent many grape flavours out there that really do it for me but with Gamma Five is definitely making the short list. Its a little sweet but doesnt taste sweetened or sugary, is really gentle on coils and would do well as an all day vape and thats coming from a guy who almost never vapes grape. **[Helix](URL **Site description:** A summer blend of red and black currant finished with an icy candy twist. **My thoughts:** I really enjoy a good menthol vape especially in the summer but Ive never been a big fan of mint, instead I tend to prefer that hit of cooling without the mint that often accompanies it. With Helix I get exactly the kind of coolness that I like, not too strong but not too weak either that perfectly balances out the mix of red and black currants. Its a little bit sweet and a little bit tart but doesnt have any real bite or sharpness to it. Its a sort of smooth mix of the two types of currants, dark and sweet black currant and bright and tart red currants. Personally Helix kind of reminds me of a blackberry candy with maybe a hint of red raspberry as it doesnt quite have that tannic bite that Ive come to expect from fresh black currants or the puckering tartness of the red variety of the berry. To me its almost more of a softened taste, like a jam made with the summertime berries but with a nice refreshing kick at the end. But its not thick and jammy, it comes across fluffy, almost powdery at times but always finishes with that nice refreshing hit of coolness. If you like nice berry blends with a hit of coolness, youre going to enjoy this and I can see why it took home Best in Show for menthol. Absolutely ideal for summer time and Ive already been enjoying it out on the patio with a cold drink!! ---- **Overall:** Im already a big fan of Ryan and Cloudfire, the man works hard to accomplish what hes done so its really nice to see recognition being given where its due. Helix is a beautifully crafted menthol flavour and I think it was well deserving of the title Best in Show Menthol. I personally enjoyed Gamma Five just as much as Helix but you cant win them all. Sure menthol flavours arent for everyone but those who enjoy them would do well to check Helix out. Also feel free to check out the review on Vapedeals [here](URL"
12,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,[Review] STLTH,15,8un1gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/8un1gy/review_stlth/,2018-06-29 06:20:54,"At CVE I got to try STLTH for the first time. In fact, it was my first time trying not only STLTH, but also pod systems and salt nicotine in general. Wanted to shoot off a quick review on my thoughts after a full day of using one exclusively. As a point of comparison, I'm a DTL vaper who uses 3mg at anywhere from 60-80W with subohm coils (around 0.2). ##The Device Let's start here: the device is actually really nice. Very compact, lightweight, fits in your pocket. Hell, I could fit ten in my pocket. To give an idea of the size, two STLTH systems with pods maybe takes up as much room as a 60mL Chubby Gorilla bottle. It's suction activated (with or without pods) not unlike the cigalikes of the distant past. Comes in a variety of colors (off memory I know there was grey, black, navy, pink and one other I'm not so sure, white?). I got two grey ones and they're really snazzy aesthetically. As far as I'm aware, they retail for $24.99 each. ##The Pods Three pods in a pack. Packaging has all the necessary info like warnings and etc. Comes in a blister pack which is nice. They're small and durable (I've test dropped one a few times with no issue) and hold 2mL. Comes in a variety of flavors I don't remember, but I did get the raspberry apple flavor. The pods themselves have nothing on them. Nor do the blister packs. I'll get to this later as it's one of my main points of contention. They retail for $14.99 for a 3-pack from what I can tell. ##Using it As a subohm vaper, this is actually surprisingly nice. The flavor is extremely light, but noticeable enough. The vapor is nice, and the 35mg I have is not super strong. I get a lumpy feeling in the back of the throat which I did not get with other salt nicotine brands I tried at CVE (such as Saltnix). I tried 25mg and it felt like air, and 50mg was a bit starchy tasting. It might have been the flavor, but 35mg seemed adequate The flavor it produces is minimal, but as I said, noticeable enough. It's not a mouthful of flavor, it just kind of appears for a second and fades quickly. The device is super low voltage which makes sense why it doesn't make the flavor pop a lot. The raspberry apple is good, but I wasn't a fan of the other ones. The Tundra Berry or whatever their most popular is produced in-house and IMO it was ineffectual in giving me any kind of good flavor. Any kind of flavor at all, in fact: tastes like nothing with a whisper of menthol. It's satisfying, but I wish it was slightly higher voltage. Maybe a dipswitch to change from whatever they use to something a touch higher. I'm not their demo, though: for a smoker, it might be incredibly appealing, but for someone like me, while it's satisfying, it's just not ""vaping to me"" if that makes sense. It's so different in an alien way that it makes me yearn for my mod instead. ##Nondescript Pods The biggest thing I hate is it's impossible to tell what flavor you have without the packaging. Why don't the pods have the flavor name and strength on them? Imagine you bought a bottle of e-juice and it came in a box with branding, but the bottle was naked otherwise. If not the pods, why not the blister packaging? I have a dozen pods here I have no idea what they are. What if someone buys a couple packs, throws the packaging out, and mixes them up? It's impossible to tell the different without tasting, but the taste is weak enough I can't distinguish some flavors. ##Dry Hits The first pod I opened was one of the raspberry apple ones. It holds 2mL, yes, but around the halfway point, it started to taste burnt. If I let it sit for a period of time it doesn't improve, either. I thought maybe it had a wicking issue after using it all day but nope, it just tastes like crap when it's half empty. It's a closed system so it can't be user error, right? There's no way to screw up ""plug in and use"". I don't know, but it's unpleasant. ##Summary In all, I like the STLTH, but these flavors are either very weak or the device is just super low voltage. But again, I'm not their demo. I like the device more than I do the pods, as their nondescript container means headaches/confusion and I get dryhits halfway through the life of a pod. If I had to put a score to it, I'd say 6.5 out of 10 or so. It's not bad by any means, but it's not tailored to me. If it were, there'd be a couple changes to appeal to my interests but it's just not for me to begin with. They market towards smokers and if it works for them is outside the scope of me."

15,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,[Review] Horizontech Falcon Subtank,13,8w6cbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/8w6cbj/review_horizontech_falcon_subtank/,2018-07-05 10:33:54,"Let me preface this all by saying I (used to) hate tanks. Maybe I'm a crap builder or I get stuck with duds, but RTAs and subtanks with premade coils generally don't (or did not) agree with me. Flooding, wicking issues, leaking, crappy airflow, suboptimal flavor. You name a problem and I had it. I had a little success with the Avocado 24 and Theorem but neither really worked subohm and couldn't keep up with higher watts. Enter the Falcon. I bought six of them to use at CVE for my sample station. I did no research on the Falcon before buying them, I only went off of numerous suggestions on what the best subtank is, and this one won out, although a close second was the Fireluke. And I was so impressed with the reception they got (from both customers and myself), I ended up buying a seventh from Dashvapes on the showroom floor. ##The Falcon The Falcon is a 5mL capacity subtank which uses parallel coils or mesh depending on the premade coil option you prefer. They come stock installed with their M1 coils (mesh), although I have used the F1 coil (parallel wire) too. Comes in a myriad of colors, of which I have both the black and silver. Included driptip is huge and not to my liking, so I pop a Stash tip on it and all's well. Not much else to say about what the tank is beyond that and it has three huge cyclops airholes. It's bottom airflow. The wicking holes are surprisingly small but get the job done exceptionally well as you'll read later. I should mention retail price varies; it's [$40 at Dashvapes](URL and I think the general price range is $35-45 anyways, so it's a good place to get one if you wanted to pull the trigger. It's on the cheaper end but don't let the pricetag fool you. ##Using it What I was surprised mostly about this thing is starting to use it. Open the topcap sleeve to reveal two massive juice holes. Fill it up to capacity, put a couple of drops in the middle trying to hit the cotton, put it back together, and you can use it immediately. No fuss, no nothing, literally fill and use. I read about priming subtanks by letting them sit in juice for a tick but I was impatient and it worked amazingly out of the gate. On the Voopoo Drag, it tried to set it to 50W initially, and it worked good. Prior to the Falcon, I never ventured above 60W general, but I slowly ramped this thing up. Even using 80% VG juices, it held its own at 90W. It's a bit too much for me at that, so I vary 70-75W and it's a dream. A literal dream. No dry hits or anything, it works flawlessly chainvaping without issue. The airflow is nice but honestly I'd love even _more_ if possible. Having all three cyclops holes wide open, I still yearn for a little bit more, but it's still exceptionally satisfying. No complaints here, either. ##M1 Coils The preinstalled M1 coil has a mesh coil with cotton and I think flax paper? Some other organic material is in here, but only cotton contacts the coil. I think they're meant to be 0.15ohm but mine read at 0.2. The flavor is clear and warm--not hot, even at 90W. Some customers said they began to get hot around 110W but I never tried. It's so full of flavor and with such massive vapor production, it can appeal to anyone: cloud chasers or flavor chasers, it does both. I went through about 200mL of juice before it started to taste a little off. When I took it out to replace with an F1 coil, the inside was slightly tinged brown. Honestly I could have pushed it a little more and get another 30-40mL for sure, but the flavor began to deteriorate or become muted the longer I used it. Still, 200mL is incredibly impressive. ##F1 Coils The F1 coils say 0.2ohm and that's what my Drag reads on them too. It's a spaced two-strand parallel coil, running vertically through the coil. At first try, it tasted a little burnt. After letting it sit for a bit it went away. I preferred the M1 coils as the flavor in the F1 is not as nice and the vapor production is not as big. It's still very satisfying, what I would expect out of a typical fused clapton or something in another tank or RDA even. I don't think this is how it was meant to be enjoyed, so I firmly think the M1 is vastly superior. ##Opening this sucker up After such a glowing review, surely there must be something off about it? Sure! It's a pain to open. I had to intentionally break a tank on another Falcon to reach the coil, it's just that stubborn to open. It's almost as if it's press fit and threaded. I found luck in putting a screwdriver in the open cyclops holes to hold it still while turning the base to open it, but it was a pain nevertheless. I guess this is a good thing to some? It means you won't get leaks between tank and body. It was very annoying for me, but I think I have the hang of it now. ##Summary In all, this tank is a real winner, forever changing my opinion of tanks. I went from ""hate all tanks with a passion"" to ""I could use this all day every day"". It's that good. I've already stocked up on some replacement bubble glasses (7mL capacity) and packs of M1 coils. I still think if you're used to the economics of making your own coils or buying artisan coils from SHB or Campbell Coil Company, maybe it's not for you. These premade coils cost about $5 each, and for some you could get better life out of other coils, or make them yourself for a fraction of the cost. But as far as tanks with premade coils are concerned, I firmly think this is the king among them. #I give the Falcon a solid 10/10. Amazing."

18,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,[Review] Juice Brothers Odyssey,6,8xdxjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/8xdxjh/review_juice_brothers_odyssey/,2018-07-10 03:29:14,"During CVE, my wife and I became friendly with Juice Brothers. I think they stood out because their adjacent neighbor was selling hair products, why they were there I don't know. We shared laughs at the situation and over the course of CVE, we each visited each other's booths a couple of times. I gave one of their team a few bottles of our stuff, and just at the very end while we're beginning to pack up, they stopped by and gave us a little care package too. The label has Funk-e-joose, and a produced by Juice Brothers Co, so it's part of that line I'm assuming. They're out of Manitoba and I've known of them for a little while, but this is the first time I got to try. What we got were their Temptation Station line of flavors. They have a train motif with locomotive-style naming conventions. Really nice labels, the nicest in my opinion was Odyssey, with its blue-maroon color theme. That's what I'm reviewing today. I'm using it in a Falcon subtank using an M1 mesh coil reading 0.16ohm. Running it on the Drag and 75W with Falcon airholes as wide as they can go. ##Odyssey On their website, it reads ""A juicy voyage through the Blueberry Galaxy! Hold on tight as we enter the Marshmallow asteroid belt!"", so right off the bat I'm vaping it assuming blueberry and marshmallow, not an odd combo, but a little unorthodox and something you don't see often. I was expecting something like an ambrosia salad or something to that effect, but what I get is quite literal. On the inhale I get a sharp sweetness soon followed by a blueberry explosion. It's quite potent but not in a bad way. It's definitely blueberry, definitely sweet, but also quite authentic tasting. I have a feeling I've used this blueberry before as it's familiar to me. It's quite nice. On the exhale, however, it's kind of a meringue or light nougat type taste. You could call it marshmallow, sure. It is accompanied by the blueberry and reminds me very much of those fruit marshmallows you could get at a candy store. I've seen marshmallow bananas (hate 'em) and marshmallow cherries (hate 'em too), so imagine if you had a marshmallow blueberry. It's very pleasant but the marshmallow note is quite light. It's not like an ambrosia like I initially was expecting. Kind of like a torrone if it had dried blueberries in it and nothing else? It's hard to compare to something because the flavor is novel and the only way I can come up with something is imagining an imaginary confection. I got this in 1.5mg and while I normally vape 3mg, this was fine. For a 30pg/70vg juice, I expected a touch more vapor production as it's quite low in the setup I'm using, but it's still adequate. It's very, very thin and wicks great. The ancillary aspects of vaping it (TH, vapor) are good, but the flavor is excellent. For a relatively simple flavor profile (blueberry and marshmallow), it delivers for sure. I give it a solid **8.5/10**, something I could definitely ADV."
19,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,[Review] Marco Polo 1271,2,8xq427,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/8xq427/review_marco_polo_1271/,2018-07-11 01:18:17,"The man behind Marco Polo has been an acquaintance for some time now. Before I became a vendor or even joined Reddit, an online community I was a part of was Redflagdeals (hence setz*RFD*) where I managed a thread dedicated to e-cigs. I befriended him on that forum and we eventually both entered the industry. Interesting to note is that he's probably the first person besides myself to try my first flavors. Meeting him at CVE, I finally got to try his juice line: Marco Polo. There were two flavors, 1271 and (I think) 1274, both in regular and menthol variants. I wasn't a super fan of 1274 but I was definitely 1271, so I want to take a minute to review them, because it's been my ADV ever since the convention. I got both 1271 and 1271 Menthol at 3mg and 30pg/70vg. The ratio is not on the bottle so I had to dig on the website to find it out. They're produced by Theory Labs out of St. Catharines, although AFAIK the owner lives in the GTA. Theory Labs is actually only a couple minute drive from me, neat. Both vaped in a Falcon subtank at 0.16ohm using the M1 mesh coil and 75W on the Voopoo Drag. Falcon airholes wide open and vaped DTL rather than MTL. ##1271 This flavor profile is more aligned with fruits than anything, although it does have a tinge of a creamy note despite not tasting vanilla which it's typically accompanying cream. It's smooth, and the smoothness makes it creamy for me. The fruits involved are allegedly currants, mango, lychee, and while I can definitely pick out mango, the others sort of blend together to make an enigma that resembles fruit but not with any more specificity. Lets talk about that mango: I've had mangos that are sort of funky, almost like a super ripe, almost on the brink of being bad type funk, and it's not unpleasant. 1271 sort of has this vibe but it's fairly sweet and potent. It's delightful as a mango base. The other fruits I can't pick out specifically but they do add to the mango, dulling the edge a bit. It's not sharp, but complements the vague fruitiness otherwise. On the whole, it's a fruity explosion, even if some of the notes are vague. I'd call it a creamy mango upfront with other fruity undertones quickly following on both inhale and exhale. It's not super sweet, but sweet enough. It doesn't seem to gunk coils, as after 80mL it's still going strong, so my guess is low or no sweeteners involved. It also wicks great. In a sentence, it definitely gives an exotic vibe and a fruity punch. It's delightful and I give it an **8.5/10**. This was one of the best juices I got at CVE. ##1271 Menthol Incidentally, I'm not a huge fan of menthol flavors, but 1271 is changing my mind. I actually vaped this one before 1271 proper because it was awesome. It's a nice strong menthol, but it doesn't deter from the fruity notes within. It maintains the flavor even with the cooling addition which is rare in my opinion for menthol flavors. Just reread the previous few paragraphs to get the gist of it, but if I had to pick one or the other, this one is my preference. Fruity and cool, it doesn't get boring. Likewise it's gentle on the coils. It has a slight edge over 1271 proper, so I give it a **9/10**. Really, really good stuff."
20,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,[Review] Three from Dinner Lady,11,8y16p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/8y16p6/review_three_from_dinner_lady/,2018-07-12 02:43:20,"One of the cooler booths at CVE was Dinner Lady. Real classy booth, and the salespeople on the floor were wearing Little House on the Prairie type skirts and cardigans. It definitely stood out, so I had to try some of their stuff. They ended up giving me a pack of 10mLs of their various flavors, but I also bought a 60mL of Lemon Tart. I'm reviewing three flavors today: Lemon Tart, Blackberry Crumble, Cola Shades. All in 3mg and I'm assuming 30pg/70vg. Vaped in a Falcon subtank at 0.15ohm and 65-75W (you'll read why soon) on an M1 mesh coil. ##Lemon Tart Lets get this one out of the way: I think Lemon Tart is their new hotness and they're trying to push it out there, so of course it was the first flavor I tried. True to its name, it tastes exactly like a lemon curd tart. Exact. It has a sort of lemon meringue pie taste on the inhale: creamy but still predominantly lemon curd. It's very, very sweet. Almost too sweet, on the edge of being a hard pass for me, but it's not so bad I won't vape it. The lemon note is sweet, not sour. On the other bottles they show a sweetener % but not on this 60mL. They're a UK company and I think they did a special batch of labels just for CVE since they're bilingual and omit the % breakdown of the flavor profile. On the exhale, you get a little bit of crust. It's very light, not unlike from the butter/lemon tarts you can find at your local grocer for example. Normally I think of dark and rich profiles for crust/tart notes, but here it's very light. Combining the two to form one experience, it's very nice and on the nose a lemon tart as the name suggests. I'll get to the ADV potential for all three later since it's the same for them all, but this one is definitely a standout flavor. This one held well at 70W or so, but any higher and it began to taste a little off and burnt. I give Lemon Tart an **8/10**. ##Blackberry Crumble This is one I got a 10mL of. It's a very dark orange e-liquid which is odd to me as I equate blackberry (and other berry flavorings) as being fairly light or clear. Label says it contains strawberry, too, and sweetener at 0.5%. How you'd interpret this is to your imagination but it's not a super sweet juice. On the very first inhale, I was hooked. It's warm and rich and fruity, a lot richer than lemon tart but you still keep the idea of fruit+pastry. It tastes deadon like fig newtons which is amazing; I didn't know I wanted this flavor profile until I had it. The inhale is slightly sour and sweet, and the exhale is a fair bit warm and creamy. Almost as if it was a crumble topped with a scoop of ice cream, but I don't taste vanilla (or crumble specifically), just general notes of rich creaminess. I don't know what else to talk about that ""tastes like fig newtons"" doesn't suggest. It's pretty far from its intended flavor profile. It's a *very strong* flavor, maybe cloying to some but in the Falcon at 65W (above this is not as good), it's excellent. I give it a **10/10** for sure. ##Cola Shades This is a cola type flavor with a cooling menthol. I'm a sucker for cola flavors, with one of my long-time-since-then ADV being Blacklisted Vanilla Coke. Cola is hard to work with because it doesn't pair with much without extremely careful flavor development; think of all the notes you could combine with any given fruit, then compare to cola. Cola only really pairs with some fruits and vanilla: can forget about any kind of pastry notes. On both inhale and exhale I get about the same: deadon cola flavor, with a cooling aftertaste. Almost as if you took a gulp of ice cold cola. There's a slight sour tang, like if it was slightly perfumed with lemon flavoring, but it's 99% cola for sure, and it delivers for a diehard fan of cola flavors. Using it at 75W is great, but again, pushing higher makes it taste a little off. There's not much to this flavor other than it's spectacular in its representation of a relatively uncommon flavor profile in e-liquid. Why not a vanilla variant? Or cherry? Or blackberry? Or raspberry? As a foundation for more flavors, I could see using this as a base. I love it. I give it a **9/10**. ##ADV Potential Lets address the elephant in the room: these are all fairly sweetened flavors. Cola Shades would last 8 or 9mL before I begin to notice coil deterioration although it's still fine going a little bit further. Lemon Tart was a monster on my coils after only 6 or 7mL. Blackberry Crumble, incidentally, I've done 10mL and it's been great. These are also super rich and powerful flavors, stronger than any others I've had for sure. If it was gentler on the coils and I could push them higher (and what's with that anyways? I've never experienced a flavor that was good at only such a low range), I could definitely see myself using these all the time. But as they stand now, they're great in 5-10mL increments as a once-in-a-while thing. ##The other flavors I also got to try Orange Tart and Berry Tart and to be honest, they're not for me. If you've read some of my prior reviews, you'll know I hate orange flavors irrespective of representation and it still holds here. I had hopes for the berry one but nope: it's very muted and kind of vague in taste. It's not terrible but nothing worth a review. In general, their flavors were pretty good, their presence at CVE could not be ignored, and they were friendly to boot. This is my first taste of UK e-liquid and it doesn't disappoint for the most part. It's always fun trying juice other than Canadian or American, and you can definitely tell these have a whole different methodology to them. Very nice."

That I'd walk away (barely, I'm surprised my feet still work!) reeling from living in a cloud, and at the end of the day I'd feel like someone dipped me in a vat of glycerin. That my tastebuds would be struggling for their life... after the first hour. That I'd have copious flashbacks to misspent youth (1 for 15, 2 for 25!)

30,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Cream Factory c/o Drip Direct,9,85tb75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/85tb75/honest_review_time_cream_factory_co_drip_direct/,2018-03-21 01:53:54,"Hey guys, Here's another one from CVE that was given to me by the [Drip Direct](URL team. They're a Canadian wholesale distributor who carries a lot of fantastic juice lines and when I last saw them they set me up with this lovely set of cream based juices which I believe were just launching at the time. In the last year I've noticed a trend, a bit of a return to simpler but tasty flavours and this cream based line seemed to fit right in with that trend. Here are my honest thoughts on Cream Factory care of Drip Direct. **Bottles:** The juices come in clear 60ml chubby gorilla style bottles with bright coloured labels that bear a Campino swirl sort of background with a name and picture of the flavour dead center below the name Cream Factory. They're nice looking labels that remind me of something like a yogurt package or something. I believe they are all 70vg blends and the set I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the classic looking bottle I got](URL **Setup:** Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Blueberry](URL **(6/10)** **(Freshly picked sweet blueberries with a hint of vanilla sitting in a bed of whipped cream.)** Starting with the simplest one of the three, Blueberry to me is just a mix of a light blueberry flavour with a touch of sweet cream. I don't really pick up any other elements in it and despite there being an image of a vanilla flower on the bottle any actual taste of vanilla gets lost in the mix for me. The blueberry has an almost floral spice to it, like most other blueberry flavours out there that I've tried it has a sort of perfumey taste to it. It's not unbearable but it's something that tends to put me off most blueberry flavours. It's creamy, lightly sweet and really really simple, to me it's literally just blueberry and sweet cream and not much else that I can taste. It does have an overall pleasant feel to it but I personally have a hard time getting over that floral taste that comes with the blueberry. It's also not as jammy as some blueberry flavours I've tried but it could be that it's mixed with that creamy element. As a fan of blueberries and blueberry flavoured things I had some pretty high hopes for this one but sadly it wasn't really for me. **Will I finish it?** Not likely. **Will I want more?** Again, not likely. **[Raspberry Banana](URL **(8.5/10)** **(Creamy and fruity all in one bottle. A beautiful mix of tart raspberries, flavourful bananas and rich decadent cream.)** Raspberry Banana is unlike anything I've tasted before, it's such an unusual mix that I'd never have thought to try them together but somehow they sort of work. At first the raspberry and banana come out fairly even, I taste the bright tart red raspberry followed by creamy smooth banana but as I vape it, it tends to evolve. What I notice is the banana falls back a bit letting the raspberry shine through a bit more, it doesn't quite take the spotlight but almost comes out more as a raspberry cream with the banana taking a back seat to the brighter sweeter raspberry providing the creaminess but not so much of the banana. The raspberry is familiar, it has the bright red tart taste I've experienced with so many other flavours but being paired up with banana it takes on a slightly different vibe. The creaminess of the banana really smooths out the edges of the raspberry, it's still tart and bright but a little more subdued then usual. The tartness being played down just a bit by the smooth cream of the banana. The banana which comes off like a lightly sweet banana cream lands somewhere in the middle of artificial and authentic tasting. It's thick and creamy and gives the juices a bit of sweetness. I don't get a strong sense of that artificial amoxicilin sort of taste but it's not like fresh banana either. If you've ever had Banana Quik mix it sometimes reminded me of that but also a bit like a creamy banana smoothie or milkshake but instead of the usual strawberry it's blended with raspberry. Definitely a different blend and a very pleasant surprise for me. **Will I finish it?** I probably will. **Will I want more?** I just might! **[Apple](URL **(9/10)** **(Apple, apple and more apple with a nice creamy finish.)** This one was hands down my favorite from the line and a bit of a surprise. I do tend to like apple flavours but for the most part they've almost always been apple cinnamon mixes. From Apple I get a nice rich vanilla cream wrapped around a delicate blend of apples. Something about it reminds me a bit of a caramel apple but the apple flavour itself is almost fleeting. It might be that rich vanilla cream that gives it a slightly darker note which makes me think caramel but whatever it is it's familiar and comforting. The apple blend is a bit hard for me to distinguish cause it's quite light in the mix but I believe I pick up hints of tart green apple along with some sweet red. As I mentioned it's light and sort of like an apple juice blend as opposed to fresh sliced apple. The rich cream sort of wraps the whole thing up in a nice warm blanket and it's delicious! Much like Blueberry this one is a simple mix so not a whole to to say about it other then it's a really tasty mix unlike any apple flavour I've tried before. **Will I finish it?** Absolutely! **Will I want more?** It's a safe bet, yes! ---- I realize Drip Direct are a wholesale distributor so unless you own a shop they might not be accessible directly from them however they were easy enough to find online so if they sound appealing it shouldn't be too hard to track them down. Albeit all three flavours are fairly simple, I quite enjoyed at least two of them. If you're in to simple creamy fruit flavours these would well be worth checking out. To the folks at Drip Direct if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with the line, I really enjoyed trying them out!! "

The labels have all the good stuff we like to see in fine print around the sides. I believe the juices are a 70vg blend and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the warm weather themed bottles](URL I got. **Setup:** Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Sherbet](URL **(9/10)** **(Never done like this before. Let GCF bring you in to summer with this refreshingly sweet sherbert.)** I remember the very first time I ever tried sherbet. I was probably around 5 or 6 years old and having been raised on good ol dairy based Ice cream didn't really know what to expect from the fruity iced treat. What I got was a real eye opener of a flavour. A popping bright citrusy treat like no other I had tried before. With Sherbet from GCF I'm brought back to that first moment I tried the then exotic treat. With Sherbet I'm greeted with that same classic citrusy burst of flavour. It mostly tastes of orange but might also have a touch of something like peach or mango in there but the orange is definitely dominant. It's very bright and fresh tasting, almost like fresh squeezed orange juice but also somewhat creamy, like there's a touch of cream added to it much like an actual sherbet would have. With it being orange and cream you might be thinking Creamsicle but it's an entirely different more natural taste. If you're not familiar with sherbet it's a frozen iced treat made of fruit juice with a touch of dairy, sometimes egg or gelatin to give it texture. It's generally smooth and creamy but not nearly as creamy as actual ice cream. If you're wondering what the difference between a sherbet and a sorbet is, a sorbet doesn't contain any dairy like sherbet does. Now it's not just the orange and cream that really sets this one apart, it's the addition of a touch of cool on the exhale that really makes this one pop. I'm a big fan of menthol flavours but only if the balance is just right. I don't like them too strong or too minty, I just like that hit of cool on the exhale to compliment whatever flavour I'm vaping on. With Sherbet it's a perfect balance of the two, the fairly strong citrus of the orange up front followed by a nice refreshing blast of cool on the back end really makes this one a refreshing experience. Pretty much exactly the sort of thing I crave. I recently covered a similar mango based flavour and I'd put this right along side it. **Will I finish it?** Absolutely!! **Will I want more?** Yup!!! **[Chillatte](URL **(9.5/10)** **(Perfectly blended iced cappuccino. Nothing's better on a hot summer day.)** I love coffee flavoured vapes and you can pretty much always find one in my regular rotation so when I cracked open Chillatte it quickly made the short list and has been making the rounds with me for the last week. Coffee flavours have come a long way over the years. I remember when I first started vaping most coffee flavours I tried were either too bitter or had an odd burnt hickory taste which I just couldn't abide. Well fast forward a few years and things have really progressed. With Chillatte I get a lovely mix of sweet almost syrupy coffee with a nice creamy base. The flavour of the coffee in this reminds me of the concentrated coffee flavoured syrup they use to make iced cappuccinos. It's got a dark caramelized sugary taste that's reminiscent of brown sugar or molasses maybe. It's definitely on the sweet side and the juice itself is fairly dark so it's not the most cotton friendly but man is it worth it. It's sweet, creamy, rich and delicious but with a little surprise on the finish. Considering the line and the name of the juice I was half expecting a big blast of cool to finish off the flavour but in reality it's a much more subdued, barely noticeable hit of cool on the tail end. For me it's not even really on the tail end so much as it's a slow and subtle build up. I kept rinsing out my dripper cause I thought some of the menthol from the Sherbet flavour was creeping in but after like the third attempt at clearing it out I realized it was supposed to be there. It's just so mild you barely notice it, at least not right away. It's a perfect little addition to the flavour that really makes it pop for me. **Will I finish it?** Won't have any trouble with that! **Will I want more?** Uhh heck yeah!!! ---- This is just my second review for GCF and I've got to say I'm already mighty impressed. Ken definitely makes some fantastic juice and the fact that none of it has any added sweeteners or additives is definitely appreciated. I believe his website is going through a bit of an overhaul so it looks like options there might be a tad limited but hopefully he gets it all sorted out soon. If you've never tried Great Canadian Fog before I'd definitely recommend you check them out. And Ken, thank you once again for setting me up with your fantastic juice, I just found a new fav!!!"
34,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Apple Wood Tobacco from VapLab,12,82pf4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/82pf4c/honest_one_shot_apple_wood_tobacco_from_vaplab/,2018-03-08 03:13:32,"Hey guys, I've been taking it a little easy lately but believe it or not I still have stuff from CVE that I need to get to and the next CVE is coming up fast. Here's something I pulled out of the pile recently that's a bit different from the usual. It's a single tobacco flavour from a company called [VapLab](URL who operate out of Quebec and I believe are distributed by [Drip Direct](URL I'm a big fan of tobacco flavours and I've tried a lot of them but I'm pretty sure this is the first of it's kind at least that I've seen. Here are my honest thoughts on Apple Wood Tobacco from VapLab. **Bottle:** The juice comes in a dark 60ml chubby gorilla style bottle with a very classy looking label with a dark sort of paisley background embellished with gold coloured lettering wrapped around a gold coloured apple. It's one of the classier looking labels I've seen and it does a great job representing the flavour. The juice comes in a 70vg blend and the bottle I got was 3mg. Here's [a shot of the sharp looking bottle I got](URL **Setup:** Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Apple Wood Tobacco](URL **(9/10)** **(Vap Lab's OAK RESERVE Applewood Tobacco is an Oakwood aged, apple infused tobacco. Layers of tobacco are blended for an authentic Canadian tobacco flavour. At the same time sweet and smokey, this flavour hits all the right notes!)** I'm a really big fan of tobacco flavours, in particular tobaccos that are blended with a little bit extra. Usually you'll find tobaccos mixed with things like vanilla, nuts, chocolate, coffee, generally speaking rich flavours that add complexity and depth to the mix. With Apple Wood Tobacco VapLab still goes for rich and complex but they tried something a little bit different then most others and boy is it beautiful. From Apple Wood Tobacco I get a lovely mix of warm sweet apple and fresh dark tobacco with lovely deep notes of oakwood all throughout. The apple which tends to come out as one of the top notes is soft and sweet and reminds me of a blended apple juice as opposed to fresh sliced apple. It gives the flavour a really pleasant sweetness without coming off as sugary or overly sweetened. I can't really tell what kind of apple it is but it isn't tart and tastes more like a red apple then it does a green. The tobacco in the mix for me comes off as fresh and dark and not so much a dry cured blond tobacco. I feel it leans more towards a dark Cavendish or pipe tobacco blend, dark fresh and sweet. It's quite bold and at times I find it can have a slightly sharp edge to it, an almost grassy fresh bite that I don't really care for. That edge means it's not an all day flavour for me but instead it remains an after dinner treat to be enjoyed with a nice after dinner drink. I usually prefer a lighter dryer tobacco but I'll admit the darker fresher flavour kind of works in this. It could be the apple it's blended with that lends it some of it's sweetness but I'd like to think the tobacco adds it's own touch of complex sweetness as well. The thing that really brings it all together is the oakwood. It adds that deep woody complexity I've tasted in nearly all things Bourbon. It gives the flavour it's incredible depth and takes it from just an interesting tobacco mix to something much more mature and refined. The oak barrel aging process which seems to be rising in popularity these days adds nuances to the flavour that you just can't get from artificial flavourings alone. All told Apple Wood Tobacco is a standout in the field and a new fav to add to the list! **Will I finish it?** I'm sure I won't have any trouble finishing this one off!! **Will I want more?** Definitely!! ---- This was an entirely new experience for me and as much as I've enjoyed tobacco flavours I now feel like I've just barely scratched the surface of what's possible out there. VapLab who I've reviewed other things for in the past makes some mighty fine juice and this Apple Wood Tobacco is a welcomed new addition. Yes they're out of QC but with a quick search I found several sites that sell their stuff so it should be easy enough to find. If you haven't given them a try before or if you like unique and complex tobacco flavours I'd highly recommend you check this one out!! So to the folks at VapLab and DripDirect thanks so much for setting me up with this gem, it truly is unique!!"

36,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Notre Hritage from BDY Industries,13,7ub9ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/7ub9ro/honest_review_time_notre_héritage_from_bdy/,2018-02-01 03:51:03,"Hey guys, When I was at CVE I was fortunate enough to be introduced to the incredible folks behind [BDY Industries](URL They were kind enough to set me up with nearly every line that they make. The man behind their lines is Mr. Goffrey Berube a truly talented mixologist out of QC who also happens to be a very talented [mod maker](URL haven't picked one up). I've already reviewed a couple of their lines and have been nothing short of impressed. Well I just dug out another bottle from the pile and I'm seriously regretting not getting to it sooner. Because it's out of QC it might be a little harder to find but well worth the effort. Here are my honest thoughts on Notre Hritage from BDY Industries. **Bottle:** The juice came in a clear glass 60ml bottle with a long dropper. The label has a classic sort of medieval look to it and bears a family crest. After a bit of investigating it turns out it's [the Berube family crest](URL which then brings a bit more meaning to the name of the flavour as well. I didn't find the pg/vg ratio listed anywhere but it looks fairly thick so I'd guess 75 or 80VG. The one I got was in 3mg. I think the bottle looks fantastic and manages to stand out in a crowd. Here's a shot of the lovely bottle I got. **Setup:** Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Notre Hritage](URL **(10/10)** **(Hazelnut whiskey cream)** A lot of people will probably read the description and not even give this a try because of the whiskey component in it but they'd be doing themselves a serious disservice. Alcohol inspired vapes tend to be a polarizing profile with folks either loving them or hating them. I'm sort of in the middle as I find some of them are absolutely fantastic while others are just a bit too much to bear at least as all day vapes. Notre Hritage is an absolute stand out in the field of spirit inspired flavours and one of my new personal favs. It sounds fairly simple by it's description but it manages to hit all the major notes for me with it's rich and decadent blend. From it I get an absolutely incredible mix of a sweet hazelnut cream with just a very light touch of whiskey. The hazelnut cream is thick and creamy with a nice nutty sweetness to it, a classic staple in rich nutty flavours like this. I love hazelnuts and of course hazelnut spreads so a hazelnut cream was right up my alley. The note of whiskey in the mix isn't sharp or biting and doesn't overtake the flavour with it's often overbearing nature. Instead it perfectly compliments the blend of nuts and cream adding a mature twist on a seemingly common profile. It's a fairly mild addition so folks who would usually shy away from such grown up flavours may find it more approachable then some of the other alcohol inspired liquids on the market. It just seems to add a touch of that whiskey barrel taste and nothing more but without the sting of the real thing. I also found there's something almost tobacco like about it, it's depth and complexity giving it a somewhat savoury aspect like you might get with a sweetened tobacco blend but I don't actually taste a tobacco so to speak. I know I've reviewed quite a few alcohol laced flavours but Notre Hritage just took the crown as far as I'm concerned. **Will I finish it?** I'm trying to ration it, but sadly it will one day soon be empty. **Will I want more?** Absolutely and hoping someday it'll be more readily available. ---- I noticed it's not even listed on their site so I don't know if it's limited edition but I was still able to find it with a quick Google search. I'm only about half way through the stuff I received from BDY but I can already say they are among the best in Canada and Goffrey is at least to me one of the most talented mixologists in the business. If you haven't tried anything from BDY yet I highly recommend you do, they easily make my must try list and should be on yours as well. So to Goffrey and the wonderful folks from BDY, thanks so much for setting me up with this treat, it's absolutely fantastic!! Edit: the usual questions, thanks canucker!"

38,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest Banana time: Right Cheek from Banana Butt Eliquids,7,7weemd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/7weemd/honest_banana_time_right_cheek_from_banana_butt/,2018-02-10 03:05:02,"Hey guys, Final day of Banana week and this last one is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. While I was at CVE I met with a very lovely young lady who called herself [the Strawberry Queen](URL who set me up with this next banana based flavour. She was there representing her US based line which is being distributed up here via [Sith Distribution](URL I had never heard of them until then but I'm quite glad I did. Not only was the Strawberry Queen an absolute breath of fresh air but Sith Distribution distributes some of my favorite US based liquids, well at least a couple anyway. The Strawberry Queen was kind enough to set me up with a number of samples, one of which is a deliciously decadent banana flavour. It comes from a company called Banana Butt Eliquids so you know they're all about the bananas. It looks like there's two flavours in the line Left Cheek and Right cheek but I've only got the Right Cheek to expose. Here are my honest thoughts on Right Cheek from Banana Butt Eliquids. The juice comes in a clear glass 60ml bottle with dropper top. The label is bright and yellow with a caricature of a banana exposing his butt on the front with the name Banana Butt in big letters and the flavour name in a black box near the top. It actually comes in a box that pretty much mirrors the design on the label. It's a bit childish I suppose but I personally don't get too hung up on that stuff. The juice is 70vg and the bottle I got was in 0mg which I later nic'ed myself. Here's a shot of [the Banana Butt](URL and [the box it came in](URL **Setup:** Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Right Cheek](URL **(9.5/10)** **(A delicious warm fresh out-of-the oven banana cream pie with a flaky textured oatmeal cookie crust. Enjoy a delicious pastry dessert with all the right creamy banana notes accentuated.)** Growing up I was always a big fan of Banana cream pie but it wasn't something my mother would make very often so when I first got in to vaping banana flavours, in particular banana cream flavours were one that I naturally gravitated to. However in the earlier days of vaping most banana flavours would taste like amoxicillin which if you've ever been prescribed it as a kid you'll be familiar with it's fake artificial tasting banana flavour. It's a polarizing flavour, either you love it or hate it. I was never a big fan of the medicine but quite enjoyed things like Runts banana candies which had a similar artificial banana taste. Right Cheek is a really interesting mix of a thick sweet banana cream with an oatmeal cookie crust but to me there's a bit more to it. The banana cream hits you first with it's smooth, almost silky sweet texture and taste. It's super creamy but doesn't have that buttery taste a lot of thick creams often have. It's just a light smooth cream with a gentle banana flavour, again it's sort of in the middle of a real banana and an artificial one, not quite like fresh sliced banana but also not like amoxicillin. I've compared it to a banana milk mix or something like that, almost like a happy milieu between the two. Where the description lists an oatmeal cookie crust I actually pick up more of a banana nut bread sort of flavour. It's a classic flavour that I've tasted before in other things that has a nice warm welcoming flavour much like a fresh baked banana bread. It really adds depth and warmth to the flavour and elevates it well above a simple banana cream but almost takes it away from banana cream pie territory. To me it's almost like I plopped a slice of fresh baked banana bread in a big bowl of banana cream, comforting and delicious!! I mentioned this one is a bit of a guilty pleasure as it is definitely on the sweeter side but not so much it's cloying or unbearable. The day I cracked it open I didn't set it down until it was half empty and it even made the trip to work with me the following day. It's exactly the kind of thing I can vape all day!!! **Will I finish it?** Not even a question! **Will I want more?** Heck yeah!! ---- I know it's an American juice which can be a bit of an inconvenience but a quick Google search found it available from a number of Canadian vendors. Also the price may not be ideal but for me it's one of those flavours I'd consider picking up as a treat. It's probably my favorite banana themed juice at the moment and one I'd have no trouble recommending to any fans of banana cream or banana bread type flavours. Personally I want to try the Left Cheek now after having tried the Right as it sounds equally tasty by it's description. So to the Strawberry Queen, Sith Distribution and the folks at Banana Butt Elqiuids, thanks so much for this tasty tasty treat, I'm in love!!"
39,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Anyone has an idea what could it be? And is it dangerous?,1,7xduoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/7xduoa/anyone_has_an_idea_what_could_it_be_and_is_it/,2018-02-14 10:55:58,"A couple of weeks ago, I ordered 2 packs of Kangertech ceramic coils from FastTech. I put one of those in my Kangertech Protank 4 and it was really bad to say the least. Flavour disappeared within 2-3 hours and I experienced a constant burnt taste. The next day I installed another one. It performed slightly better and still held the flavour, but I received a burnt taste sometimes. I should note that I usually prime the coil and leave it overnight with juice inside the tank. Also, when starting on new coil, I usually slowly increase W, so looks like I'm doing everything correctly. It surprises me, because I got a pack of kangertech ceramic coils at CVE in Toronto and completely fell in love with the flavour and the lifespan of the coils. Thus, I have 2 questions: 1. Is it just a bad batch of coils or they aren't authentic (it stated in the description that they are) 2. I read a lot about the danger of ceramic coils health-wise, but didn't pay much attention, and 3 days ago I got this piece right in my mouth while vaping and totally freaked out URL Anyone has any idea what is this? Is it dangerous? Should I just throw these coils away? Devices are: RX200, Kangertech Protank 4 with 0.5 ceramic coils, 6 mg of nic (70/30) Thanks!"

I think it's safe to say if you've been in the vape community for any amount of time you probably know or at least have heard of the god fathers of vape Phil Busardo and Dimitris Agrafiotis. If you haven't heard of them they're two of the most well known and well respected vape reviewers on YouTube and have been around doing what they do for years now. I remember well over three years ago when I first started vaping tuning in to their juice and hardware reviews on YouTube to learn all that I could from their vast arsenals of knowledge and all these years later I still tune in when I can. I've actually had the pleasure of [meeting them both](URL on several occasions [at CVE](URL where they were always kind enough to [pose for a pic](URL and stop for a quick chat. If you ever have the chance Dimi has the best arms for selfies!! Seriously for as popular as they are you really couldn't meet two more down to earth and likeable guys. So when the opportunity came up to try out a new line that was made by these two industry giants I was thrilled to say the least!! The new line is produced by Labo LVS Canada, distributed by Pixetech Canada and sent to me from [Vapevapevape.ca](URL so it should be readily available across the country. Here are my honest thoughts on [VapeBromance by P. Busardo and D. Agrafiotis](URL **Bottles:** The juices come in clear 60ml authentic Chubby Gorilla bottles with matching themes on each bottle with slightly different colours. They were actually in boxes with similar themes and if you line them up just right they form [a full pic](URL Near the top of the labels is a heart with the name VapeBromance held within and just below to the left is their names. Just below center on the label is the name of the flavour with all the usual good stuff we like to see in fine print. On the label it lists the line as a 70vg blend and the bottles I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bromantic bottles](URL **Setup:** Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Strawberry Malt](URL **(8/10)** **(This creamy, frothy and delicious Strawberry Malt will bring you right to the 50s diner that your grandparents met in.)** You guys know how I feel about the literal thousands of strawberry cream flavours out there. They don't really move me like they used to and amidst a sea of copy cat flavours it takes quite a bit to stand out. So when I saw the line included a Strawberry Malt I was at least a little bit relieved that it wasn't just another copy paste strawberry cream. From Strawberry Malt I get a sweet creamy rather thick tasting strawberry milk or milkshake sort of taste. I say strawberry milk cause at times it smells like Strawberry Quik to me but other times it's more like a strawberry Frosty. It's fairly sweet but not sugary or cloying, with the strawberry also having a slight jammy quality to it. Now the cream aspect is where it stands to separate itself from the pack. Rather then a standard strawberry and cream or strawberry milkshake, it's a strawberry malt. As in a milkshake like they were made back in the day when they used to add malt to a shake to give it body and thickness. Malt if you're not familiar with it is a powdered processed germinated cereal grain usually barley that was added to milkshakes as a way to fortify them and thicken them up that was immensely popular back in the old days in particular right after prohibition. Well Strawberry Malt definitely benefits from the addition of said malt which comes out as a slight powdery feel in the cream. It's not quite grainy or gritty but definitely adds some 'texture' to the flavour. I think there might also be some yogurt in there to thicken it up as I get just a bit of that buttery almost sour milk taste I associate with yogurt. I wonder if it's Greek!? For what's essentially a strawberry cream flavour I was surprised at how much of a dent I put in the bottle. Sweet, thick and tasty this is one strawberry malt even I can get behind. **Will I finish it?** Surprisingly yes! **Will I want more?** Unsurprisingly no, I'm sure I could live without more. **[Italian Bread Pudding](URL **(10/10)** **(This secret recipe was so sweet and flavourful that it was taken in to discover what makes it so wonderful.)** I'm in a rare position where I constantly get to try new flavours and after three years of reviews sometimes things can get a little common place. However with Italian Bread Pudding I had one of those not so common 'Mmmmmhmmm' moments. I'm pretty sure it's the first of it's kind that I've tried, at least in vape form and it was an entirely new flavour experience for me. I've had actual bread pudding quite a few times, British wife an all and while it's not a dessert I typically would crave it's definitely not one I would avoid either. Bread Pudding is a dessert that is typically made with stale leftover bread, eggs, milk, sugar some cinnamon and sometimes things like raisins or nuts. With Italian Bread Pudding which I'm guessing is Phil's contribution I'm hit with a wonderful mix of custard, raisin, a hint of spice and a sort of bready almost rum cake kind of taste. It's one of those flavours that sort of morphs as you vape it and picking it up and putting it down I often pick up different elements coming through that I might not have noticed initially. Like my tasting notes were kind of all over the place and I really had to try and real it in before the write up. Essentially Italian Bread Pudding is a custard but one with so much more to it then your typical custard. Notes of spice and sun dried raisin along with a baked good sort of taste lift it up beyond the usual eggy vanilla custard so many of us already love. After the first hit I was in love. It is a touch on the sweet side but it's not over the top and it's exactly the kind of thing I could carry all day and not get tired of. Such a delightful treat!! **Will I finish it?** It's practically gone already. **Will I want more?** Not even a question! ---- I think it's hilarious how they play up their long running bromance, often posting awkward meme worthy pictures to show their unfettered love for each other and often getting meme'd in the process. They take it all in stride which is a perfect reflection of their very personable personalities much like these two fantastic flavours. Now I did hear a rumor that these were actually created by one of Canada's own renowned mixologists and not the industry icons themselves but I think it's safe to say regardless of who came up with the recipes that they're an incredible tribute to the Greek and Italian legends so many of us look up to. So if you have the chance I would highly highly recommend you check these out, they're both fantastic. And to the Phil, Dimitris and the wonderful folks at Vapevapevape, thanks so much for these wonderful juices, I'm in love!! Edit: One thing I completely forgot to mention was in the advertising for these two flavours they suggest that they're good on their own but great together. Initially I tried them together as a 50/50 mix but found it was mostly just the strawberry malt I was tasting with maybe just a bit of the pudding underneath. Well Dimitris himself suggested to me that the golden ratio was in fact 70 pudding and 30 strawberry. I just gave this mix a try and I have to say they are pretty great together but personally I still prefer the pudding on it's own. What I get from the two mixed together is an interesting blend of the jammy strawberry quality from Strawberry Malt with a nice bready custard undertone, the hints of spice are a bit diminished as the strawberry sort of takes over but it makes for a really interesting mix, sort of the best of both worlds. Worth a try if you get both of them!"
41,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Okanagan Max VG from Vape Strong,9,7ozay8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/7ozay8/honest_review_time_okanagan_max_vg_from_vape/,2018-01-09 02:41:53,"Hey guys, Here's another set from [Vape Strong](URL that I received from the man himself Mr. Saby Rock aka the real MajorVapes. I've reviewed a set of his liquids before that I received at CVE and still have a few more things to get to. It looks like they've been making changes to their lines so hopefully the juices I got are still available. This set is based on a line of fruit flavours that are representative of the Okanagan valley, each of the three flavours in the set is based on one original older flavour but with a slight twist to it. If you're not familiar with what the Okanagan valley is, it's a region in Canada known for it's beauty and I believe it's fertility as it's long been an agricultural hub mostly known for their production of orchard fruits. For folks who like fruity and creamy vapes these will definitely be worth checking out. I'll keep this one fairly short as it's essentially three variations of the same flavour. Here are my honest thoughts on [Okanagan Max VG from Vape Stong](URL The liquids come in clear 100ml authentic Chubby Gorilla bottles sporting labels with images of what I can only guess is the Okanagan valley. The labels are bright and clean with all the appropriate info we like to see on them. I think they look nice and definitely evoke a sense of nature and harvest.

Here's a shot of [the wholesome looking bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! Descriptions not really available for this as they're based on an older version of the flavour, here is the description from the MV Traveller edition - **We took everything we know and love about Okanagan and threw it away - then built it again from scratch. The result is an entirely-new and unique creation that captures the essence of Okanagan, but with subtleties and nuances that were never possible with the original. This is a decadent vape - bursting with fruit flavour from inhale to exhale.** ---- **[Okanagan Max VG](URL **(9/10)** I've never been to the Okanagan valley but I've heard about it ever since I was a kid usually on commercials for fruits and vegetables. VapeStrong attempted to capture the essence of the valley in this fruity harvest blend and I have to say it's pretty darn fantastic. While most of you know I don't tend to enjoy generic fruit blends Okanagan manages to win me over with it's wonderful, light and refreshing blend of Okanagan Valley Fruits. Probably the most notable flavour in the mix is watermelon, giving the whole thing a very clean light taste but with so much more to it. I pick up notes of sweet red apple, ripe pear, maybe some strawberry but all of the fruits in the mix taste light and clean with the watermelon remaining as the underlying note. The whole thing has an almost candy-like vibe to it but not in an artificial or overly sweet sort of way, in fact it hardly feels like any sweetener was added at all. It's really soft and pleasant with the watermelon really stealing the show yet still supporting the satellite flavours. If you've ever had watermelon aqua fresca it reminds me of something like that, bright, fruity and clean tasting it's one of the more refreshing watermelon based flavours that I've tried. Something about it is so familiar yet still quite different, like the taste of summer squeezed in to a bottle. **Will I finish it?** Yes I will. **Will I want more?** Yes I will. **[Okanagan Creamy](URL **(8.5/10)** Okanagan creamy starts with the exact same fruity watermelon base as Okanagan Max VG but adds a dash of sweet cream to the mix to really thicken it up and give the whole thing a touch more mouth feel. I still get the same great flavour as the original but with the addition of the cream it really changes the whole vibe of it. The sweet cream really doesn't change the flavour much but instead it just adds that creamy factor so many crave from their liquids. It's still rather bright and refreshing but just feels thicker, fuller without giving up any of it's fruity nuances. I think Okanagan Creamy will be for those who enjoy the original flavour but would prefer it with just a touch of cream. **Will I finish it?** I probably will. **Will I want more?** I can probably live without it. **[Okanagan IceCream](URL **(8/10)** Okanagan Ice Cream much like the Creamy version is pretty much the same flavour but with a good dose of what I imagine is vanilla bean ice cream. If Okanagan Creamy was creamy then Okanagan Ice Cream is downright thick. I've seen quite a few flavours out there that add a dash of vanilla bean ice cream to really transform the flavour from a fairly basic fruit blend to a rich and delicious fruity ice cream treat and that's exactly what Okanagan Ice Cream does. It takes that same incredible base flavour, adds a good dollop of vanilla bean ice cream and oh boy does it change up the flavour. It gives it a much richer, deeper, creamier body but still accentuates the light fruity notes of the Okanagan fruits it pays tribute to. Unlike Creamy this one is much more affected by the addition of the ice cream, it's not just adding a dash of cream but a rich vanilla component as well which really takes the fruit blend in a different direction. It's pretty incredible how much one little addition can change a flavour and it was really interesting to see how Vape Strong expanded on the original flavour with a couple of simple additions. **Will I finish it?** This one was going the slowest so maybe eventually I will. **Will I want more?** Again I can probably live without it. ---- From all of my experience with Vape Strong they make some really incredible juice and this Okanagan line is no exception. They have quite a large number of lines and flavours so I'm sure anyone could find something among them that works for them. Not only to they make some great juice but Saby and company are a wonderful group of people and an absolute pleasure to interact with. If you've never give Vape Strong a chance I'd definitely recommend checking them out. And to Saby and the fine folks of Vape Strong, thank you once again for setting me up with your fantastic juice, you guys rock!!"
42,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Great Canadian Custards from Great Canadian Fog,10,7eilr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/7eilr0/honest_review_time_great_canadian_custards_from/,2017-11-22 02:28:41,"Hey guys, Fairly recently a gentleman by the name of Ken managed to track me down on FB about doing some reviews of his juice. I've actually met him at least on one occasion or more at the Canadian Vape Expo or maybe it was Juice Jam, I can't remember. If you've ever been to one of the expos chances are you've seen him around too sporting some re-purposed tactical gear and rocking a majestic beard. I believe he lost the beard last year at which point he was virtually unrecognizable but luckily he still recognized me, at least on Facebook. If you haven't guessed it already the man is Ken from [Great Canadian Fog](URL and he sent over a giant box of stuff for me to review so I'll be spreading it out over the next little while but I wanted to get to a set that in particular was calling to me and was also recommended by Ken himself. It's a fairly new line that I believe was just launched at the last CVE called Great Canadian Custards and I've been thoroughly enjoying them. Here are my honest thoughts on [Great Canadian Custards from Great Canadian Fog](URL The juice comes in dark coloured 60ml chubby gorilla style bottles with dark coloured labels with the name of the line in bright yellow crossword style lettering with the names of the juices represented as big letters in the background. The letter is composed of smoke or vapour and at first glance it was pretty hard to distinguish one bottle from the other but once you clue in to the fact that the background letter is the flavour it becomes pretty obvious. Still more then once I grabbed the wrong bottle so it's something worth mentioning. I really like the slick dark theme of the bottles even though it can make for seeing your remaining liquid a bit of a challenge. The juices are 80vg blends and the set I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the dark themed bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[X](URL **(9/10)** **(X is a rich creamy custard with hints of light pastry and blueberries.)** I love custards, pretty much cut my teeth on them a few years back when I first started so this set had a lot of appeal for me. X starts with a nice round creamy vanilla custard flavour that reminds me of one of Canada's most famous custards and one I give credit to for helping me quit, but it's a bit lighter with some other stuff in the mix. It's got a light pastry crust that has a crisp feel without being particularly buttery, it just adds that taste of bakery to the mix giving it a nice tart like taste. The blueberry is fairly rich and more of a mid note in the mix that blends nicely with the rich vanilla custard. Blueberry I often find can have a slight floral vibe to it but X doesn't have anything like that, it's almost more of a blueberry jam or compote sort of vibe. It's not heavy or anything, just a nice sweet taste of blueberry without being flowery or overbearing in any way. Everything about this is rich and smooth, exactly the kind of thing that makes for a great custard. Of the three I think this one had the strongest vanilla custard taste to it with the other two having a slightly different focus. As far as custards go, this one is really nice and I can see why it's been getting the attention it has. **Will I finish it?** Yes I won't have any trouble with this one. **Will I want more?** I could see myself picking up a bottle if I have the chance. **[Y](URL **(8.5/10)** **(Y is a healthy dose of cinnamon pastry and tart raspberries blended into a creamy custard.)** Tart raspberry comes first in this one with just a hint of that powdery taste that often accompanies it. It's got a rich creamy feel to it but I get something more like thick whipped cream then a custard, reminiscent of a raspberry passion flake but with a slightly different finish on account of the cinnamon pastry. The cinnamon itself is actually quite mild despite the description and sort of settles in on the back end. There's no bite or dryness from it, just a light and gentle dusting on the tail end. Not only is the cinnamon rather light but that pastry aspect too is on the light side barely poking through the raspberry and cream. I also found the actual custard aspect in this one to be a much more subdued then X as I was getting much less of that rich vanilla note but still found it lovely, creamy and fulfilling on account of that thick whipped cream taste. Really this one seems to focus more on that delicate tart raspberry and cream and less on the vanilla custard aspect at least for me making it almost more of a dessert flavour as opposed to a classic custard. Don't get me wrong though, it still has a rich creamy aspect which makes it fit in well with the bunch and it's nice to see some real variety in a pack of custards like this. If you're not so much in to rich vanilla custards but still want something thick and creamy, this would be a great option. **Will I finish it?** Yes I will. **Will I want more?** I could probably crush another bottle. **[Z](URL **(7.5/10)** **(Z is a very passionate custard pie. Very light on the crust and heavy on the fruit.)** This one I surprisingly found to be the creamiest of the three. What was interesting though was I didn't find it to be more custardy like X or creamy like Y, it was almost as if it was a thick fruit flavour I was tasting. I also don't really get much of a crust from it at all. Like the description, it really is heavy on the fruit and light on the crust. The thing is I'm not sure I was even able to identify a single fruit note in this one. In my tasting notes I marked down things like banana cream, dragon fruit, notes of apricot, pear or maybe apple but with question marks next to all of them. I definitely don't get a berry vibe from it, more of a stone fruit or orchard fruit sort of thing. If I was going by the description though I'd probably guess passion fruit but I didn't really find it to be tart like I'd expect a passion fruit blend to be. Still it's very possible that it's something like that giving it that lovely fruity creaminess as I don't believe I've ever tried a passion fruit flavour on it's own. To be completely honest though my tongue was left a little bit confused by this one. Not in a bad way mind you, the creamy fruit flavour I get from it is really pleasant and I'm usually not one for obscure fruit flavours. It's definitely not a tropical vibe so the fruits are likely of the more common variety and even though I can't confidently pick any of them out I still found it quite enjoyable. **Will I finish it?** Probably not, it's pleasant enough but of the three I was reaching for it the least. **Will I want more?** Probably not. ---- One thing I neglected to mention is I'm quite sure all of Ken's flavours are crafted from lab grade diketone free ingredients with no sweeteners added. So for fans of super clean juice you'll definitely appreciate these! Even though they're custards all three left my cotton and coils clean if that says anything about them. This is my first time really getting to try GCFs juice and I have to say so far I've been quite impressed. If you've never given Great Canadian Fog a try I'd have no trouble recommending you check them out, especially if clean juice is a concern to you. And Ken, if you happen to read this, thanks so much for the wonderful care package, I'll be enjoying your juice for quite some time to come!!"
43,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Sommar from True Northern,13,7f0je5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/7f0je5/honest_review_time_sommar_from_true_northern/,2017-11-24 03:02:41,"Hey guys, Here's something that admittedly has taken me far too long to get to. It's a new set I picked up from the incredible folks behind [True Northern Vape](URL Yes our very own /u/frock_donghammer handed me these and I somehow dropped the ball on them. Not long ago I moved my vape den setup and they kind of got lost in the shuffle for a short while. I've got that all sorted out now and have still been trying to get to all of the stuff from CVE so forgive me if some of these seem a bit late. Earlier in the year I reviewed a line from them called Equinox, this new line is called Sommar and is part of the Seasons series much like Equinox. /u/frock_donghammer gave me some of the back story behind the line and explained how these were initially an attempt at something a bit more mainstream. If you're at all familiar with True Northern, you'll know they make some truly unique flavours but often being too unique can alienate some, Sommar was supposed to be an attempt to appeal to people who find their existing offerings a bit too exotic. However ultimately the resulting two flavours didn't quite feel right to the team so they revamped them in true True Northern style. I for one appreciate their unique style and I applaud them for sticking with what they can be proud of. Here are my honest thoughts on Sommar from True Northern. The juices come in clear 60ml chubby gorilla style bottles with labels that sort of echo those of the Equinox line but with their own unique summery style, a stark contrast to the winter themed labels of Equinox. I love what True Northern has been doing with their names and labels and it seems they're constantly expanding on their winning formula. I don't recall seeing the vg ration listed and their site is currently under construction for a relaunch but I'd guess they're either 70 or 80vg as they tend to be. /u/frock_donghammer I'm sure can clarify. The two bottles I got were both 3mg and here's [a shot of the lovely Sommar bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Sunbather](URL **(6/10)** **(A throwback to early summer days, vibrant melon meets the tangy sweet finish of gummy candies, with a touch of soothing summer florals.)** After talking to /u/frock_donghammer and as I mentioned above it came out that the line underwent a last minute overhaul with this one undergoing some significant rework right before it launched so the flavour ends up being a bit different then described. According to the man himself, he scrapped the idea of candy altogether and leaned it more towards the florals and botanicals. So as appealing as the original description sounds it's quite different from what the final product tastes like. Personally I kind of wished I could try the original candy melon flavour but admittedly this ended up being much more in line with True Northerns traditional offerings. However I found it ends up being pretty far from a melon blend and ends up more like a summery mix of flowers and light fruit notes. I can't really say I can distinguish the melon in the mix now but if I had to venture a guess I'd say it's got a hint of honeydew in it but it gets a bit overwhelmed by all of those florals in the mix. He'd mentioned honeysuckle was blended in along with a few other secret ingredients but picking out flowery notes isn't something I'm very good at. I found the flowery almost perfumey quality of it gave it a slight throat hit and unfortunately it wore on me pretty quickly. It's still a really interesting mix but it ends up being something I likely couldn't vape for long periods. It'd probably make a good accompaniment to an ice cold refreshing drink in the garden on a hot summer day with it's crisp botanical notes and light fruity finish but as a day to day this one isn't for me. **Will I finish it?** Not any time soon, but maybe when the nicer weather hits. **Will I want more?** I'm going to say I could probably live without more of this one which might be a first for TN. **[Bermuda](URL **(9.5/10)** **(Dewy mango nectar blended with papaya pulp, mandarin oranges and a vanilla sorbet... get lost in Bermuda.)** Bermuda is much more my speed and I actually reviewed something quite similar just a week or so ago. It's a lovely mix of mango and papaya with a very soft citrus note from the mandarin orange and a smooth creamy feel from the vanilla sorbet. It's stunningly beautiful and reminds me of a tropical mango smoothie. It has a really soft, smooth feel to it with that vanilla sorbet really smoothing out any rough edges and adding to the thick creaminess of it all. It's sort of hard to tell which of the two main fruits comes first as the mango and papaya sort of duke it out for attention with the mango mainly coming first and the papaya really adding to it's freshness with it's unique tangy tartness. Papaya can often be a tiny bit sharp from that tartness but Bermuda remains nice and smooth despite it's addition which I'm guessing can be attributed back to that vanilla sorbet. True Northern actually makes my favorite orange flavour out there so they know how to handle a citrus flavour and the addition of mandarin orange in this is perfect. I get it mostly as a mid or bottom note and it adds to that refreshing tropical orange coloured fruit flavour without taking over in anyway. All of the fruits in this by nature are orange but not the typical orange fruit citrus, more of a tropical bright orange fleshed fruit flavour and it's absolutely delicious. What really separates it from so many other tropical mango blends is that vanilla sorbet, it really adds a smooth creamy feel to it making the whole thing just super pleasant. All day material for me, this one has really brightened up these cold weather days. **Will I finish it?** Yup, I won't have any trouble getting through it. **Will I want more?** Again yup, I could easily handle some more Bermuda. ---- Overall both flavours bring that classic True Northern complexity and uniqueness. Sure Sunbather didn't quite work for me but it's still made in the same tradition with the same quality I've come to expect from True Northern and I'm sure plenty of folks will appreciate it more then I did. Bermuda on the other hand definitely piques my interest and won me over without any difficulty. It's a beautiful tropical tribute to summer and I for one enjoyed it. So /u/frock_donghammer and the rest of the TN crew sorry there's no poem this time around but thanks so much once again for setting me up with your incredible liquids, you guys are still tops in the unique fruit blend field as far as I'm concerned!! Fun fact: both flavours are named after the band Deafheavens two albums."

This set is based on rich tasty dessert flavours and the line is called Addictive,,, for a reason. I believe they just released a new flavour for the line but as it were I only had the original two. Here are my honest thoughts on Addicitive from BDY Eliquid. The juices come in clear 60ml authentic Chubby Gorilla bottles with bright colourful labels sporting images of their namesake flavour. The labels are clean and simple but do a great job of immediately letting you know what's in it. The label indicates they're a 70vg mix and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bright looking bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Glazed Danish](URL **(7.5/10)** **(Warm danish pastry dipped in sweet icing!)** When I looked at the set, this one was the one I was expecting to like the most. I'm a big fan of cinnamon sugar flavours so a glazed cinnamon danish sounded fantastic and believe me when I say I've tried a lot of them. From it I get a blend of cinnamon sugar cookie and cinnamon danish but I don't pick up a whole lot of the glaze or icing from the description nor do I pick up much of the actual danish pastry. Normally I associate a pastry or a crust with a sort of spice but if it's in this the cinnamon is probably overwhelming it since I barely pick any up. It's a touch on the dry side from all that cinnamon but it's not sharp or biting and doesn't quite get that dry pot pourri sort of feel. It could be the pastry which is lending it that slight dryness but the way it mixes with the cinnamon it's hard to tell. It's a fairly common flavour and one that's been reproduced by nearly every juice company out there and if you've ever tried a cinnamon sugar cookie or cinnamon danish flavour you'll probably find it has a familiar taste to it too. I personally would have liked the icing aspect to be a little more forward to help round it out and calm down that cinnamon a touch but as it stands it's still a solid cinnamon danish flavour and folks who don't like them too sweet will probably appreciate that fact. Warm and comforting I think most people will feel right at home with this one!! **Will I finish it?** Yes I probably will. **Will I want more?** Considering it's such a common flavour I can probably do without more. **[Apple Turnover](URL **(9.5/10)** **(Soft apple turnover with icing!)** This one was the surprise win from the set. As much as I've tried cinnamon sugar flavours I've also tried a lot of Apple cinnamon flavours and like the cinnamon sugar flavours they're basically a dime a dozen. However they're not all created equally and finding the perfect balance with any flavour is a challenge but if you ask me BDY nailed it with this one. It's a fantastic blend of soft warm red apple, a light buttery pastry crust, with just a hint of cinnamon and a sweet dollop of icing. The sweetness plays in to the apple aspect giving it an almost syrupy sort of taste, just like the warm gooey filling in an apple turnover. The cinnamon in this is much lighter then the danish one and loses any of that dry feel it might have brought with it. One thing I do note though is the pastry aspect is also light. I pick up little hints of a buttery crust but that's where they remain, as hints and not really coming to the fore. Doesn't bother me though as this one is mostly about that incredible warm, gooey, sweet apple filling and not so much the pastry. It really reminds me of the filling in a McDonalds warm apple pie or something else along those lines. Definitely the sweeter of the two flavours but not so sweet it's cloying. Warm, sweet and tasty, this one is a fantastic rendition of an apple turnover! **Will I finish it?** Already on my way!! **Will I want more?** I could definitely do with some more of this stuff!! ---- BDY if you're not familiar with them make some really incredible stuff and it's easy to see where they came up with the name for this line. While they do hale out of QC you can easily find them available online at a number of shops. And although this is just the second set of things I've reviewed for them, I'm already mighty impressed by the quality and complexity of their liquids. I don't know what it is about Quebec but I still believe most of Canada's best mixologists seem to come from the province and BDY are no exception. If you haven't given BDY a shot yet I'd definitely give them a recommendation and they're easily at the top of my recommendations list "

Basically when customers make their way around the floor, they're asked to fill in a ballot for their choice of best flavour at the show. I think it's a bit of a popularity contest as opposed to a legitimate measure of a particular flavour but it's still a nice thing that they do as it often brings some much needed attention to new and upcoming vendors. Somehow I usually manage to not pick up whatever best in show is and that was the case this time as well. At CVE Toronto 2017 a collaboration between [Pyxydust](URL and [T-Daawg labs](URL called Angel took the Best in Show award. I recently picked up a bottle at my local b&amp;m and have been enjoying it quite a bit. Here are my honest thoughts on [Angel from Pyxydust and T-Daawg labs](URL The juice comes in a clear 60ml chubby gorilla style bottle with a mostly black and white label depicting,, you guessed it an angel. The liquid is a 70vg blend and the bottle I picked up was in 3mg. All of the good stuff we like to see in fine print around the sides.

Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Angel](URL **(8/10)** **(Delicious and Heavenly Vanilla mix with a creamy fluffy cake.)** This flavour is simple and I was actually a bit surprised it won best in show considering it's simplicity but I'll admit, it's really damn tasty for what it is. It's a very simple mix of a smooth vanilla cream and a dash of white cake and that's about it. Like I said super simple. But that doesn't mean it doesn't taste good, after all vanilla is probably the most popular flavour of all time in the ice cream world and it's about as simple as it can be. Well Angel revels in that simplicity, taking tried and true but safe flavours and mixing them in to something that pretty much anyone can enjoy. A lovely aromatic vanilla cream that compliments a light and fluffy white cake perfectly. If you like cake or vanilla you're probably going to enjoy this. I mean there is absolutely nothing offensive in this, it's so soft and gentle, smooth and creamy, just all around pleasant. Sure it might lose points for complexity but it still scores really well by me for being such a comforting and familiar flavour. Easily an all day vape type of thing, it isn't cloying, harsh or overbearing. Folks who like nice airy, ethereal types of flavours will definitely appreciate the nature of this ~~beast~~ angel. **Will I finish it?** No question! **Will I want more??** I could definitely see myself picking up another bottle of this. ---- I think it goes to show you don't need super complex, fancy pants flavours to be amazing. Angel is one of the simpler flavours I've tried recently but it's oh so tasty and I'd say very well deserving of the title Best in Show. If you're into light fluffy vanilla flavours you should probably check out Angel, it's absolutely fantastic. I don't believe I've tried anything else from T-Daawg or Pyxydust but if they're anything like Angel I think they'd be worth a shot. And Pyxydust and T-Daawg, if you happen to read this congrats on winning best in show with Angel, it's heavenly!!"

The man makes some really fine liquids and I've reviewed a few of them in the past. He's based out of the US, MN specifically but his liquids are available here though a number of companies, namely Vape Brands International but I didn't see these listed. This time around, he's ventured into menthol territory with a set of liquids focused on strong mint/menthol flavours. I'm a fan of menthol liquids but even I found them to be a bit on the strong side so be warned these will be for menthol lovers only. Here are my honest thoughts on [Crme from Crme Premium Craft Liquid](URL The liquids came in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottles with really nice clean looking labels with a black box containing the name and nic content. The labels actually underwent a change so Kha had set me up with two sets, with the ones in the picture only containing VG if you're wondering why they're so clear. Both liquids come in a 7-vg blend and the ones I got were in 3mg.

Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Mint](URL **(7.5/10)** **(A robust crme and luscious mint undertone flavor.)** From what I understand the line is an ode to Crme de Menthe, you know that classic green after dinner aperitif that I'm guessing most people have sitting on the shelf of their Dad's bar. Pretty sure my dads bottle is somewhere around the 30+ year old mark by now as it's been sitting there since I was a kid. IRL I don't know anyone that still drinks it or requests it after a meal but I grew up around it so I'm quite familiar with it's smell and taste. From Mint, I get a combination of mint, menthol and cream. It's one of the strongest mint flavours that I've tried and it immediately took my breath away. It's not that it's just a simple creamy menthol flavour, it's a very well layered tribute to mint. I get a thick creamy feel which to me is akin to a nice creamy peppermint but I also get strong kicks of green mint, like a spearmint of fresh mint, maybe both. It's also got a very strong cooling sensation that compliments the layers of mint very well. I had a bit of an incident when I was a kid that left me unable to enjoy mint for many years, that was until I discovered vaping mint doesn't affect me the same way ingesting it does. No more headaches and I can enjoy the freshness of mint once more. Well Mint definitely delivers on the mint and koolada as well as a nice layer of thick sweet cream. It really does remind me of Crme de Menthe in both taste and smell, just without the booze and makes for a nice after dinner vape. Personally it's just a bit too strong for me to enjoy on it's own all the time but I've also been adding it to a number of juices for an extra little creamy mint kick and it actually works quite well, particularly with fruits. But as for vaping it straight, I think this one will mainly be for the hardcore mint/menthol fans. **Will I finish it?** Probably not straight but like I said it mixes really well with other things. **Will I want more??** I can't see myself reaching for another bottle anytime soon. **[Pom](URL **(8.5/10)** **(A pomegranate &amp; crme with a hint of mint flavor.)** I found I much preferred POM over the mint one and I was able to enjoy it straight without mixing it with anything. It's very similar in the cream and mint aspect as the other one but adds a very distinct fruity tone to it. In fact the mint almost takes a backseat to the pomegranate, letting it come out first and foremost but following it with it's smooth creamy refreshing mint menthol mix. That fruity tone is the pomegranate but if you've ever tried pomegranate you'll know it doesn't exactly have a distinct taste of it's own. Like the namesake fruit POM is sort of lightly sweet, slightly tart with almost a red berry sort of taste but not nearly as distinct as say a strawberry or a cherry. Don't get me wrong I love pomegranates and even enjoy a dash of grenadine in my drinks from time to time but tasting the fruit straight I'd have a hard time describing it's taste. I found it much the same for POM. Basically what POM tastes like to me is a cool minty fruit mix with a slight red berry vibe to it. There's also something to the fruitiness that reminds me of apples, sort of a mild white fleshy fruit taste but maybe just a bit more tart. With that familiar mix of mint and menthol it's super refreshing and falls right in line with the types of menthol vape that I like. The mint isn't quite as strong in this one but still incorporates the same characteristics, being smooth, creamy, minty and refreshing. With that mint/menthol toned down just a bit like it is I think this one will appeal to a much wider audience and not just the hardcore mint/menthol lovers. All around a very nice and refreshing flavour!! **Will I finish it?** Yup, half gone already!! **Will I want more??** I could definitely kill another bottle of this! ---- As I already mentioned Kha makes some really fantastic liquids and if you haven't had a chance to try any of them and you happen to like minty menthols I'd definitely recommend you check these out. I did find the straight mint one wasn't exactly to my liking but it gets plenty of points for being about as accurate as one could be in regards to Crme de Menthe, plus it blends really well with most fruits I've mixed it with. So Kha, if you happen to read this, thank you once again for setting me up with your juice, you sir make some mighty fine liquids!!"
48,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,[Review] Fortune Cookie by Vape Take Out,6,78o8br,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/78o8br/review_fortune_cookie_by_vape_take_out/,2017-10-26 02:02:03,"I've spent the last week and a bit in Toronto and took an opportunity to check out Vape29, a shop local to the College &amp; University intersection (I think it's called the Discovery District?). I only know of Vape29 of a Facebook post they posted years ago about Kenny Hotz going to this shop, so somehow after all these years it stuck. I went in twice: first to try a bunch of flavors before I lost track of time and had to go empty-handed, and a second time to actually pick something up. I settled on Fortune Cookie by Vape Take Out. Around the last CVE, I recall this flavor making a lot of buzz and it kind of died down since, so much so I never see it mentioned anymore. I wanted it then but kind of forgot about it myself, so I'm glad I got to try it finally. I ended up picking up a 60mL glass bottle for $29.99. It's a 30pg/70vg mix and I ordered it in 3mg. Vaped it in a Wasp Nano on an HCigar Inbox at 60W on a 0.27ohm groove fused clapton by Campbell Coil Company using Native Wicks. ##**Fortune Cookie** - *8/10* From the smell, it smells exactly like fortune cookies. Sweet, slightly vanilla-y and lemon-y, extremely slight cinnamon notes. Smells like a fortune cookie, or a close approximate would be a baked bun glazed with lemon oil. The smell absolutely does it, but what's more important is it's taste. Right off the bat I get fortune cookie, no doubt about it, but to the degree it replicates the ones you can find from Chinese takeout restaurants is up in the air. After going through 40mL of it, it's very close if not on the nose. I haven't had a fortune cookie in years so it could just be my foggy memory. I definitely get a cookie base with lemon and vanilla, but those two notes are so minuscule in comparison they'd be easy to miss. They blend well enough with the cookie that it's just an amalgam and not three different parts. The cookie aspect does have a slight hint of cinnamon. A big note in this flavor reminds me of simple syrup, which might raise questions of sucralose or other sweeteners, but I just cleaned my wick today and there was almost no gunk after 40mLs. Usually I equate these one-shot American flavors as being chock full of sweeteners and an absolute nightmare on coils, but I'm pleasantly surprised here. I mentioned that simple syrup note for a reason: I find I get vape tongue with this flavor fast, where all the flavor and life of the juice fades away and I'm left with just this simple syrup note. It gets cloying at times, but generally switching it up every 15-20mL helps alleviate it. The simple syrup taste lingers on the lips and tongue, and overall it's not a good note on its own, so caveat emptor if you're a chain vaper but your mileage will vary of course. I find if you were a DIYer or vendor, it's easy to make an approximate flavor, but hard to do something so specific. Like it'd very difficult to mimic Starbuck's london fog for example, when compared to just a general london fog; I find that Fortune Cookie has zoned in on something so specific, that it's a real feat they could do it. Overall I'm super impressed with this flavor. I'd probably order it again if it was on sale; I see it at $24.99 as some locations so I might inquire within those. But for $30, you could do worse. You do get something unique that has never been done before which is always exciting. Major kudos from me!"
49,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Bake Shoppe from Adhock Industries,9,79vxqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/79vxqr/honest_review_time_bake_shoppe_from_adhock/,2017-11-01 01:04:37,"Hey guys, Just recently a new company fairly local to me reached out through Instagram about doing a review. They're a new company but have already been getting some traction in local shops. They're based out of Toronto and the company is called [Adhock Industries](URL They sent over their Bake Shoppe line which I've been getting to know over the past week so without further ado, here are my honest thoughts on [Bake Shoppe from Adhock Industries](URL The juices come in clear 60ml chubby gorilla style bottles with sort of retro advertisement inspired labels which I think look pretty cool. All of the good stuff we like to see in fine print and the name of each flavour scrawled across the top. The main image being that of a 50/60s housewife standing in front of an open oven that looks cutout from and old newspaper or magazine ad. I think they look great and do a good job representing the line. The juices are all 70vg blends and the ones I was sent were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles I was sent](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[On the Fritz](URL **(8/10)** **(Apple lovers rejoice! Cinnamon glazed fritter with a crisp bite of apples.)** Right off the bat I've got to say this one has a rather familiar taste to it. If you've ever tried a particularly popular Apple Muffin flavour then you might notice this one is quite similar in taste. It's not an exact copy mind you but it definitely shares some similar traits. From it I get a really comforting mix of apples, cinnamon and bakery spice. The apples are bright, not a mild, soft or baked taste but a bright and crisp red apple sort of thing. The apple isn't tart or bitter or anything but definitely has a lighter brighter taste then others I've tried. I'm almost tempted to say the apples taste a bit green but I'm pretty sure it's more of a Macintosh or other such bright flavoured red apple. It's complimented by a nice cinnamon sugar mix which gives it a lightly sweet, almost syrupy sort of taste. A few hits in and I was reminded of the filling in a hot apple pie from somewhere like McDs, like the apples have a sweet filling/compote sort of taste which is nice and thick that takes away any sharpness from the cinnamon. The bakery aspect of this is the faintest aspect and it comes more as a bottom note of spice. Like on the exhale towards the end I get a sort of spice that I associate with bakery. It doesn't have that typical Play-doughy kind of taste a lot of people associate with donut flavours, it's almost more of a pie crust sort of vibe to me. As much as this one has a familiar taste to it, like I said, it's also just different enough to stand apart. **Will I finish it?** I'm pretty sure I will. **Will I want more??** Possibly but Apple cinnamon isn't something I generally crave. **[French Delight](URL **(8/10)** **(Vanilla fans look no further! Vanilla cupcake topped with a smooth french vanilla frosting.)** Here's another one that has a very familiar yet slightly different taste to it. If you recall I reviewed a flavour recently called Angel which won best in show at the last CVE, it was based on an angel food cake with vanilla frosting. Well the two really couldn't be more similar in both description and taste yet they're not an exact copy. From French delight I get more of a white cake/cupcake taste and a bit less of the frosting. In the description they call the frosting a French Vanilla but I don't pick up a French Vanilla, more of a standard vanilla if anything. When I hear French Vanilla I assume a slight eggy custard like taste as that's the main delineation between a standard Vanilla from a French one. A true French Vanilla always incorporates eggs unlike it's more basic counterpart and from French Delight I just don't pick up any of the custard like notes I normally associate with the real thing. Not a big deal, just an observation as it's still nice and pleasant. Much like Angel, it's inoffensive, light, fluffy, creamy, lightly sweet and quite delicate in it's profile. It's the type of thing all day vapes are made of, just a simple, to the point flavour that's not overbearing in anyway. Bottom line, it's a white cake with frosting and it couldn't be more simple. **Will I finish it?** I could definitely see myself finishing it off. **Will I want more?** Again, not something I tend to crave so probably not. **[Lemon Party](URL **(8.5/10)** **(A mouthful of flavour! Sweet lemon meringue, topped with a fluffy cream, sitting in a flakey crust.)** This one was hands down my favorite from the line. Over the past year I found I really enjoy lemon meringue based flavours and this one is a really nice addition to the list. It's a wonderful mix of light sweet meringue, a smooth creamy lemon curd and a lightly spicy flaky crust. The meringue is the most forward in the mix and hits my tongue first. Like I said it's lightly sweet and has that almost sticky syrupy sort of taste to it. It's followed closely by the lemon curd which is bright and tasty without being sharp or tart, rather it just lends the flavour a nice lemon citrusy pop. Similar to On the Fritz the bakery aspect is the lightest note in the mix, it too comes out on the bottom end as a hint of spice that's sligthly reminiscent of a pie crust but in Lemon Party that's what it's meant to be. It's not exactly buttery or anything but I find most pie type flavours aren't exactly buttery when trying to define the crust, it's almost more a spice then anything. It's quite well balanced with the meringue and lemon curd being slightly more forward but that's kind of what it should be like in a lemon meringue pie. Of the three I did find Lemon Party can have just a touch of throat hit and I'm not sure if it's from the lemon or the spice but it wasn't enough to put me off in anyway. Will it replace my current favorite lemon flavours, no probably not but like I said it's a nice addition to the list! **Will I finish it?** I'm already about half way through it so yeah, no problem! **Will I want more?** I could definitely see myself polishing off another bottle or two. ---- Overall I've got to say I quite enjoyed this set. While none of them were exactly new unique flavours I thought all three were done quite well. The entire set has a nice comfortable, even welcoming feel to them. Like things you'd find at home when visiting mom. The quality of the juice seems great and from my interaction with them the company seems great too. So if these flavours appeal to you I'd definitely recommend you check them out and to Adhock if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up, you make some great juice!!"
50,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: The Hype from Propaganda Eliquids via VapeNorth,12,7bdyrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/7bdyrm/honest_review_time_the_hype_from_propaganda/,2017-11-08 02:42:02,"Hey guys, Here's something that I picked up from the [VapeNorth](URL crew while at CVE. It's a line of juice from the US but it's being distributed up here via VapeNorth so I've got no issue doing a review of it. The line is called The Hype and it's from Propaganda Eliquids and with a name like that it's got a lot to live up to. Here are my honest thoughts on [The Hype from Propaganda Eliquids](URL The juices come in [nice boxes](URL and inside they come in 60ml dark coloured glass bottles with dark labels sporting [brightly coloured images of the flavours](URL on one side, the names and flavours listed across the front along with some basic info and all the good stuff we like to see in fine print. I think the bottles look sharp even though I'm not usually a fan of dark glass since it makes it a pain to see how much juice you've got left. The juices are all 70vg blends but on the bottle they are marked as VG+ and the set I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Blue Slushee](URL **(7/10)** **(Blue Slushee)** I think you guys know how I feel about most blue ras flavours so I'll admit I wasn't exactly excited to try this one but I've got to say I was at least a little bit surprised by it. Rather then that typical artificial blue raspberry flavour that so many use this one tastes a bit different. Maybe they are still using some of that blue ras flavouring but I taste quite a bit more from it, like actual raspberry that's a bit on the juicy side, there's also a tart or sour element to it. It's got a hint of citrus like lemonade or something like that in the mix. I'm not sure if it was the sour aspect but something in it has a slight dry feel to it and would make my mouth feel a bit dry at times but it wasn't unbearable or anything. Compared to many others it's a bit less artificial tasting but still it's not exactly a natural flavour. As much as I'm not a fan of blue ras this one definitely has some redeeming qualities and I could see plenty of blue ras fans digging it. It's not too sweet, not too tart but still packed with flavour. **Will I finish it?** I doubt it, it'll go t a friend who loves blue ras flavours. **Will I want more?** No, blue ras is generally a flavour I can live without. **[Cotton Candy](URL **(7.5/10)** **(Mixed Cotton Candy)** This is a flavour I chased after for almost a year when I first got in to vaping and never actually found one that I enjoyed. And while this Cotton Candy still isn't the perfection I was seeking it's probably one of the better ones that I've tried. It's very light, soft, almost fluffy feeling. It's got a light sweetness to it that doesn't just taste like ethyl maltol, maybe it's got a touch of strawberry or blueberry in there to give it a touch of flavour as well as sweetness but without making it taste fruity. Any added flavours though are light enough you can't really define them, they just add that little extra hint of something. And while this doesn't give me sugar lips it definitely leaves a faint sweetness in my mouth. Really it's hard to describe it's so light and gentle, inoffensive. I could see it as an ADV especially for folks who like very mild flavoured liquids. Essentially it's a cotton candy flavour that doesn't taste like a mouth full of chemicals which I definitely appreciate. **Will I finish it?** There's a good chance I might but it's not at the top of the list at the moment. **Will I want more?** If I manage to finish the bottle, maybe. **[Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Bar](URL **(9/10)** **(Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Bar)** This one is probably the most hyped out of the set and I've definitely seen it on social media before so it had the most to live up to. You guys remember [these Strawberry Shortcake dessert bars](URL They still make them and that's exactly what this is supposed to taste like. It does a pretty good job of imitating it but I don't feel it could ever replace the real thing. From it I get an interesting mix of light clean tasting strawberry cream and cake. More of a yellow cake then white and I also get a sort of cereal taste from it. Almost like a strawberry rice crispy treat sort of vibe and it's tasty! The strawberry is like I mentioned clean tasting, it doesn't exactly taste real but it doesn't taste too artificial either, just a light strawberry essence with a nice creamy feel. I'm not usually one for strawberry and cream sort of flavours but this has quite a bit more in the mix and it really helps to fill it out and make it a much more interesting flavour. It's lightly sweet but not slammed with sugar, it's thick and creamy with a nice mouth feel to it and it's well layered with flavour. Easily an all day sort of vape for me and one of the few strawberry cream flavours I can really get down with. **Will I finish it?** Yes, yes I will! **Will I want more?** I could see myself going for another bottle of this, even though I'm not usually a strawberry cream kind of guy. ---- Overall all I'll say The Hype is a tasty line, even though all three flavours aren't typically to my taste I found all three to be quite good for what they are. So do they live up to The Hype? I'll let you decide since as always taste is subjective and results will vary. Still though I think the line tastes like it's made with quality ingredients and plenty of care and attention. I think fans of any of the three iconic flavours will appreciate them for what they are. So to the folks at Propaganda and VapeNorth, thanks so much for setting me up with The Hype!! "
51,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: BDY Black Label from BDY Industries,13,70vgsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/70vgsn/honest_review_time_bdy_black_label_from_bdy/,2017-09-19 00:47:34,"Hey guys, Here's something I picked up from CVE Toronto from a wonderful company called [BDY Industries](URL Yes they're out of QC but they seem to be readily available outside of the Belle Province so I've no trouble sharing them with you. Their team set me up with pretty much everything they carried so there'll be plenty more reviews coming for them. Today I'm going to look at their main line which I believe is just called BDY Black Label. It's a very decadent set with some fairly mature profiles but I for one really enjoyed the lot. Produced by Bablito labs so there's no question about quality. Here are my honest thoughts one [BDY Black Label from BDY Industries](URL Four of the juices came in 30ml clear glass bottles with dropper tops sporting clean looking black labels to go with the name of the line while the Barrel edition of Dirty Chocolate came in a nice cylindrical tube and an opaque black glass bottle with dropper top. On the labels is a metallic image of a roaring bear along with the name of the flavour. Very classy and clean looking bottles. All the good stuff we like to see in fine print. I don't believe I saw the ratio listed but if I had to guess I'd say they were probably around a 70vg blend and the set I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the gorgeous bottles I got](URL and [a shot of the special Barrel edition](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL I'm trying something new with ratings, adding two big questions for each flavour. Let me know what you think! Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Knut](URL **(9/10)** **(Hazelnut flavored coffee layered by a sweet cream.)** Knut is exactly my kind of thing. It's a decadent mix of coffee, hazelnut and sweet cream. Vaping it reminds me of drinking coffee with some of those flavoured creamers, in particular a hazelnut cream. The coffee and the hazelnut are nearly homogeneous, blending perfectly together and making it hard to determine where one starts and the other ends. The coffee for me leans towards a dark roast with lots of deep notes, a touch acrid but really nice. I do get a very slight bitterness from the coffee but just a bit like you'd get from coffee anyway, I found it also has just a slight throat hit I which imagine is from all the rich flavours in the mix but it's mild enough it doesn't bother me. In fact it's smoothed out considerably with that touch of sweet cream which also adds a bit of sweetness and a nice round mouth feel. Really well balanced and makes for a great companion to a morning cup of joe. It might be a bit too rich for an all day sort of thing but as a morning wake up or after dinner treat it's been fantastic! **Will I finish it?** Absolutely! **Will I want more?** Yes, yes I will! **[Sacrifice](URL **(7.5/10)** **(The perfect light and crisp crust, lemony fragrant cream topped with a caramelized meringue.)** In the last year or two I discovered I really enjoy lemon flavours. Not all are created equally but most share some common elements. This one is straight up lemon meringue pie and I pick up nearly every element of the pie in this flavour. Up front I'm hit with a bright citrusy lemon curd that's tangy, almost sharp. For the most part it's quite nice but at times I found it had a slight soapy quality to it. It's accompanied by a rather bold pie crust flavour that I found gives it a touch of spice but also can give it a very slight dry feel. The meringue comes off fairly bright and sweet but not sugary, like it has a very slight zest but that could just be the lemon I'm tasting. I didn't really get much of a caramelized meringue, more of a light ribbon of caramel if anything. It's a rather nice take on lemon meringue pie but with that slight edge to it I found I wasn't reaching for it as much as I'd expected. **Will I finish it?** Eventually. **Will I want more?** It's nice but probably not. **[Shamrock](URL **(7)** **(A classic blend of coffee, irish whiskey and heavy cream.)** We're back to coffee with Shamrock but with a more mature twist to it. For me Shamrock is mainly a coffee with a light boozy aromatic Irish whiskey note that's creamy and rich. It's a nice grown up coffee flavour that isn't too overbearing with the addition of the booze. The cream I'm sure really helps smooth it over making it nice and enjoyable while giving it a bit more mouth feel. I think it's a perfect compliment to a glass of good whiskey or a similar after dinner drink. As much as that boozy characteristic isn't too overbearing it is pretty prominent so folks who don't like the taste of booze may want to avoid this one. I don't mind it myself but it's not something I'd reach for first thing in the morning either. Definitely an after dinner sort of thing for me and not something I could vape all day. **Will I finish it?** It might take a while. **Will I want more?** I can live without it. **[Dirty Chocolate](URL **(9/10)** **(An irresistible trio of chocolate, bourbon whiskey and toasted nuts.)** Here's another one from the set that hits all the spots for me. Don't be fooled by the name it's an absolutely delicious blend of chocolate, bourbon and nuts. The chocolate is dark and rich and reminds me of those cocoa covered truffle chocolates you might get on special occasions. It's followed by just a light touch of bourbon which adds that classic oak barrel whiskey sort of flavour. It's fairly light but definitely stands out, giving it plenty of oaky notes with just a slight boozy taste. Not quite as boozy as Shamrock this one goes great with my morning coffee. The toasted nuts however are somewhat lost on me. I'm sure they're in there adding to the richness of it but with a fairly strong chocolate and equally bold bourbon I don't pick much of them up at all and couldn't tell you what kind of nuts I'm tasting. Still it's not like they're missed in this decadent grown up treat that I've been enjoying pretty much any time of day! **Will I finish it?** Guaranteed! **Will I want more?** Yes please!! **[Dirty Chocolate - Barrel Edition](URL **(9.5/10)** **(Aged 3 months in liquor barrels then steeped 2 more months for maximum richness!)** I couldn't figure out which I liked better the original Dirty Chocolate or the Barrel Edition but in the end the Barrel Edition won out. The DC Barrel Edition incorporates all of the same elements as the original but then stuffs them in to actual liquor barrels for three months and then is steeped for an additional two and it really makes a difference. Does it taste the same as the original, no! Not even close. The barrel aging really calms down the sharper notes, rounding out any rough edges and making the entire thing a lot smoother, not that the original was harsh or rough in anyway. It's more like it flattens it a bit making the sharper elements of the flavour a bit more uniform. It comes off softer, a bit more delicate and refined but still rich as all get out. If anything I might get more of the oaky bourbon notes from it and the chocolate is a bit more subdued but it's essentially the same, just different. I found it pretty cool being able to try both the barrel edition and the regular and seeing just how much of a difference a bit of barrel aging can make. Dirty Chocolate Barrel Edition definitely takes the cake from this set, what an incredible flavour!! **Will I finish it?** Without question! **Will I want more?** Yup!! ---- Overall I've got to say so far I am mighty impressed with BDY and I've got a lot more from them to come. I'm not sure what it is about Quebec that seems to have so many talented mixologists haling from there but I hope it continues. I really can't say enough about this line and how tasty and well layered they all are. If any of these sound good to you I'd definitely have no trouble giving them my recommendation and to the incredible folks from BDY, thanks so much for setting me up with your stuff, I've truly been enjoying them!!"
52,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Tokyo by Ohmies Exclusive Eliquid,6,72d2b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/72d2b6/honest_one_shot_tokyo_by_ohmies_exclusive_eliquid/,2017-09-26 01:14:28,"Hey guys, When I was out in Edmonton for CVE I met with a new team of vendors from a British Columbian company called [Peer Distribution](URL or now possibly Peer Labs. I saw them again at CVE Toronto but I hadn't yet gotten to the review of what they set me up with in Edmonton so I didn't stop by the booth. Yes I still have some things to get to from Edmonton, I know it's been a while but life happens. One of the sets of juice they were showing in Edmonton caught my eye and they were kind enough to set me up with a bottle from the set. The line is called Ohmies and each flavour in the line is named after a major international city, they let me pick one from the line so of course I went with Tokyo. Here are my honest thoughts on [Tokyo from Ohmies Exclusive Eliquid](URL The juice comes in a nice orange cardboard box with a label to match. It's fairly modest being pretty much all orange with a bit of text and an image of a skyline. All the usual good stuff in fine print around the sides. Personally I think they look clean and classy. I didn't see the vg ratio listed but it's fairly thick so I'd guess 75vg or thereabouts and the bottle I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the box and bottle I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Tokyo](URL **(9/10)** (Matcha green tea flavored cream, covered on biscuit sticks.) Let me start by saying matcha can be a strong flavour and it's not going to be for everyone. I've tried several matcha flavours in the past but one was an ice cream and the other a tea flavour, this is my first based on matcha Pocky sticks. Yes I know there are others out there but I haven't had the chance to try them yet and I'm not even sure I need to now that I've tried Tokyo. Cracking open the bottle I catch the scent of cookies, almost like a creamy Oreo cookie kind of smell but that's not exactly what it tastes like. From it I get a really nice mix of cream, cookie and matcha. The cream gives it a nice mouth feel, making it nice and thick with a really pleasant sweetness while the cookie really helps fill out the flavour giving it a bit of a light biscuit cookie sort of taste. The matcha is actually quite light but that's sort of how it should be. Too much matcha can give it a really green sort of grassy taste instead of the more refined yet concentrated green tea taste that it should impart. Tokyo finds a really nice balance between the three elements giving you just enough of that green matcha to compliment the cookie and cream making for a nearly perfect rendition of a Pocky stick. I did find as I vaped it I would pick up more and more of the matcha but never so much that it became overbearing or grassy. All around a really nice flavour that I personally could vape all day!! **Will I finish it?** Yes!! **Will I want more?** Yes!! ---- From my interaction with the team and my experience with the juice I've got to say Peer Labs definitely has something worth checking out and I wouldn't have any issues recommending you do. They carry a variety of domestic and imported juice with a pretty wide selection so everyone should be able to find something that works for them. So Peer Labs if you happen to read this, thanks for setting me up with some Tokyo, I really enjoyed it!! Edit: questions"
53,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Creamery from Cloud Co. Vapor,13,72sx5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/72sx5n/honest_review_time_creamery_from_cloud_co_vapor/,2017-09-28 01:15:31,"Hey guys, Here's a set I've been anxious to get to. Something I picked up at CVE Toronto that went over really well with me. It's from a company called Cloud Co. Vapor out of Ottawa, Ontario. They're a new one for me but I believe they have been around for quite some time. The entire set is based on creamy ice cream flavours and from what I've tried they're delicious. Here are my honest thoughts on [Creamery from Cloud Co. Vapor](URL The sample set I got came in a mix of clear 30ml and 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottles. It looks like there are 6 flavours in the line but I only picked up three of them. The labels are mostly white with some really nice fanciful lettering on them with images of the flavour underneath. They're listed as Max VG and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the nice looking bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Butter Pecan](URL **(9.5/10)** **(A delightful frozen mix of roasted pecans, vanilla and creamy caramel.)** This was hands down my favorite of the three I received. It's a super smooth creamy nutty mix of pecans, vanilla and caramel. Warm buttery toasted pecan nuts are blended together with a nice rich sweet vanilla cream. It's a very rich flavour but still comes off light and delicious. The pecan tastes really authentic and even has a very slight bitterness like you'd get from the skin of a pecan. It's really smooth and creamy and it gets an extra bit of richness from the addition of the creamy caramel. A bit on the decadent side but I know plenty of people who will enjoy the rich nutty creaminess of it. One of those flavours that goes great with your morning coffee. Easily an all day vape for fans of nuts and cream and my personal fav from the set. **Will I finish it?** The only thing that saved me from emptying the bottle was I left it at a shop I was visiting. **Will I want more?** Already craving it!! **[Pistachio Ice Cream](URL **(9/10)** **(A creamy full flavored liquid with a unique smooth nutty pistachio finish!)** This one follows a similar vein as Butter Pecan but doesn't come off as sweet. It's a mix of cream and pistachio with a much more savoury feel. To me the nuts in it have a more roasted taste, not like a raw pistachio but more like a toasted pistachio nut flavour. It's full and thick with a deeper taste to the nuts then the Butter Pecan had. It feels fuller, thicker and a touch heavier but still has a similar nuts and cream sort of feel. Basically if Butter Pecan wasn't nutty enough for you this Pistachio Ice Cream should be. While there isn't any koolada or anything in it to make it cool, it does still have that nice thick creamy ice cream sort of vibe. Uber rich and very satisfying!! **Will I finish it?** Definitely!! **Will I want more?** Safe to say yes!! **[Lime Ice Cream](URL **(7.5/10)** **(A deliciously refreshing brightly flavored lime ice cream perfect for that summertime vape!)** Compared to the other two this is the lightest and brightest of the three. It might sound a bit weird but this reminds me of Green Freshie but with cream, almost like I sprinkled some of the green powder on top of a light vanilla ice cream. It has a nice tartness to it, it's almost sour from the bright lime but the cream makes it nice and smooth. It's not the typical lime flavour either as there isn't even a hint of that odd waxy taste I normally associate with lime, just a nice fresh tasting realistic lime. For an ice cream I found it really bright and refreshing, even a bit tangy and definitely one of the better lime flavours I've tried. **Will I finish it?** Probably not, only cause I have a friend I give most lime flavours to so he'll likely be getting this too. **Will I want more?** Not likely. ---- Overall I've got to say I was throughly satisfied with this set. Two of the three could easily be ADVs for me and even the lime flavour I found to be quite unique and tasty. Folks who like nutty creamy flavours will definitely want to check these out and if the rest of the line is anywhere close to these I'm sure they'll be spectacular as well. So to the folks at Cloud Co. Vapour thanks so much for setting me up with these for review. I've discovered a couple new favorites!!"

One of the newest lines is called [Tank Sauce](URL which I believe originates out of the US but is being distributed up here in Canada via VapeNorth. Since I've cracked them open I've been really enjoying the line. Here are my honest thoughts on [Tank Sauce via VapeNorth](URL The juices come in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla style bottles with really nice black or white metallic labels that vary just a bit by colour. I think they're well designed and look really nice. All the good stuff we like to see is in fine print around the sides. The juice is a 70vg blend and the set I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the cool looking bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Elephant Ear](URL **(8/10)** **(Based upon the classic carnival desert, a sugared cinnamon pastrie dough accompanied with whipped cream.)** I love Elephant ears, Frybread, Beaver tails or whatever you prefer to call fried dough, it's a Canadian festival staple so I was quite excited to try this flavour. From it I get a sort candy cinnamon, almost like red hots but not quite as strong, it's smothered in a nice thick cream with just the faintest hint of a dough flavour. Maybe I'm just imagining it as it is quite faint. To me it doesn't really scream elephant ears and almost tastes more like a nice rich cinnamon custard or cream sort of thing. What I feel like I'm missing is that greasy fried dough taste that I've tasted in a few other flavours. I'm sure some people won't miss it but to me, that's what gives a flavour that classic fried dough taste. Don't get me wrong it's still a really nice flavour especially if you like cinnamon, I'm just not sure I'd call it an elephant ear myself. If this were labeled a cinnamon custard I probably would have rated it just a tad higher. It's nice and flavourful and fans of cinnamon will really appreciate this one. **Will I finish it?** Yes I probably will. **Will I want more?** With so many cinnamon flavours out there, I can live without it. **[Lush](URL **(8.5/10)** **(Luscious ripe peaches and vanilla creams make up this savory vape.)** Peach season is just wrapping up, it's one of my favorite times of year. Fresh sweet juicy peaches are in abundance and events like the Winona Peach festival make getting your peach fix a fun and exciting time. Peach pies and cobblers, tarts and ice creams, it's just a fantastic time of year for peach lovers. Lush pays tribute to this seasonal treat nicely with a classic rendition of a peach inspired dessert, peaches and cream. This one starts super soft and creamy with a light but realistic peach flavour and not that typical candy or fuzzy peach taste. The vanilla cream is nice and fragrant and really coats the peach nicely without burying it. The peach is somewhat gentle, not super punchy or overbearing but really hangs in there giving it a nice authentic tasting realistic peach smothered in a rich vanilla cream. Cause of all that cream it's probably the softest flavour of the set but still flavourful and tasty. If you enjoy a bowl of fresh peaches and cream you'll probably enjoy this too! **Will I finish it?** Yes, it just might take a while. **Will I want more?** It's a definite possibility. **[Sensational](URL **(10/10)** **(A deep roasted mocha with hazelnut and caramelized creams.)** Who doesn't enjoy starting their day with a nice rich cup of coffee. My absolute favorite from the line and probably the most decadent. Sensational is an incredible blend of mocha(coffee and chocolate), hazelnut and caramel. For me I get a really rich creamy hazelnut with a nice light mocha finish. It's creamy, thick and lightly sweet but doesn't taste sweetened. That hazelnut has a nice rich toasted taste to it, really deep and nutty giving the whole thing a nice dark character. The mocha gives it a gentle coffee flavour on the end with little hints of chocolate throughout adding even more depth to the already rich coffee inspired flavour. And if it wasn't rich enough the caramel too adds to that depth, giving the whole thing a touch of sweetness but like the other flavours in a rich and creamy way. One of those flavours that just goes incredibly well with a cup of coffee but is equally enjoyable throughout the day. Exactly the sort of thing I gravitate to when I'm not doing reviews. **Will I finish it?** Absolutely!!! **Will I want more?** Absolutely!!! **[Fruit Chill](URL **(8/10)** **(A tart raspberry paired with an assortment of exotic fruits followed with a subtle hint of koolada. Light, clean and fresh!)** Fruit Chill is a really nice bright raspberry with a very red berry sort of flavour. I can't really pick out the other fruits mentioned in the description but it definitely feels fruity and filled out. If I had to guess I'd say there might be some cherry, maybe some strawberry or other reddish fruits in there as well. It does have a slight red Freshie sort of taste to it but only a touch, like it hits you in the corners of the mouth with it's twang. On the finish you get a nice little hit of koolada, no mint just a light cooling sensation which really helps make the flavour pop, giving it an almost crisp feel. It's sweet and fruity and reminds me quite a bit of a fruity breath mint like a Certs or something. For a guy who usually doesn't like obscure blends, this one definitely hits the spot. **Will I finish it?** I believe I will. **Will I want more?** It's nice enough but probably not. ---- Overall I've got to say this was a fantastic set. Each flavour from the line is well layered, flavourful and delicious. The juice itself tastes of quality with no harsh, chemical taste or anything like that from any of them. It's not often I get a set that I'm confident I'll finish, sure I might not want to re-up on a couple of them but they're fantastic flavours none the less. They definitely get a recommendation from me! And Tank Sauce and VapeNorth if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with this winning set!! Edit: pic link"
56,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Breakfast Time from Chteau Noir and Classic Ejuice,16,75hi0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/75hi0o/honest_review_time_breakfast_time_from_château/,2017-10-11 01:46:04,"Hey guys, Here's an interesting set I picked up at CVE Toronto. It's from the folks at [Chteau Noir](URL one of my favorite Canadian companies but also from the folks at [Classic Ejuice](URL another fantastic Canadian company. Obviously a collaboration of some sort it's based on a classic breakfast staple, toast with jam. I know there are other toast with jam flavours out there but I believe most are US based, these come from right here in Canada. Here are my honest thoughts on [Breakfast Time from Chteau Noir and Classic Ejuice](URL The juices come in clear 60ml chubby gorilla style bottles sporting colourful labels that are covered in jam and toast. [The bottles actually come in boxes](URL that mirror the design of the bottles. All the usual good stuff in fine print around the sides and on the back of the box. The liquids are 70vg blends and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the colourful bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Strawberry Peanut Butter Toast](URL **(8/10)** **(Buttered toast with peanut butter and Strawberry jam.)** One of my first ADVs was a Peanut butter and jam flavour but it didn't include any toast in the mix so I was quite excited to try this one out. It's a very rich mix of a very jammy strawberry flavour along with a fairly deep peanut butter but surprisingly I don't really pick up much of the toast or butter flavour. I might get a hint of something bakery like but only just a hint and if there is a buttery taste to it, that pretty much gets lost in the peanut butter, at least on me. That said, it's still a really nice full flavour that's fairly rich for what it is. I did find that after vaping on it for a while that the jam would sort of drop off leaving me with mostly a rather prominent peanut butter taste. Something about it reminds me quite a lot of at least one other PB&amp;J flavour but it's still nothing like the one that originally stole my heart. When I do taste the jam it has a really nice thick feel to it and it tastes a lot like the jam you get in the little packets that come with your toast when you order breakfast. The peanut butter has a slightly dark note to it, almost a toasted peanut butter sort of thing which can at times dominate the flavour. It's a bit on the rich side but for me it could use a touch more balance between the peanut butter and jam. **Will I finish it?** I'm sure I will. **Will I want more?** Very possible. **[Blackberry Peanut Butter Toast](URL **(9/10)** **(Buttered toast with peanut butter and blackberry jam.)** I love blackberries, if I had to chose I'd pick them over strawberries or raspberries any day so a blackberry jam with peanut butter on toast was something I just had to try. You'd almost think that since the descriptions were so similar that they'd just yank out the strawberry and replace it with blackberry but I don't believe that's the case. I found the peanut butter in this one was quite a bit tamer, like the Blackberry really has a chance to shine in this one. Unlike the strawberry jam one, the flavour of this jam kept on after sustained vaping. It doesn' seem to drop off like the other one and manages to keep a nicer balance with the peanut butter. The blackberry has a very sweet almost candy like taste to it and is similiar to other blackberry flavours I've tried where it reminds me of those little blackberry hard candies Grandmas always seem to keep around in a bowl. Again though, I'm not really picking up a buttered toast sort of vibe, more or less it's just a Blackberry jam with a slightly lighter peanut butter undertone which I enjoy just a little bit more then the strawberry. **Will I finish it?** Yes! **Will I want more?** I'm sure I could handle another bottle or two! ---- For me this was quite a bit different from the stuff I'm used to from Chteau Noir, however this was a collaboration with Classic Ejuice and it almost seems more in line with something they'd release. Either way I really enjoyed both of them and hope this is just the first of many collaborations to come. If you haven't tried either Chteau Noir or Classic Ejuice yet, I'd definitely recommend you check them out. Two great companies that make some really great juice. And Philippe if you happen to read this, thanks again for setting me up with some Breakfast time, it's really tasty stuff!!!"
57,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: M1 RDTA/RDA from Nicomore,16,75ptdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/75ptdy/honest_review_time_m1_rdtarda_from_nicomore/,2017-10-12 02:30:49,"Hey guys, It doesn't happen all that often but I won a contest on Facebook from a wonderful company out in Alberta called [Vape Horizon](URL I actually had a chance to meet them in person when I was attending CVE Edmonton and they threw a great little after party which I was also fortunate enough to be invited to. The person who reached out to me after I had won was hoping for a review out of the contest so maybe it was a bit of good fortune that I won. Either way I was happy to oblige them with a review. If you're wondering what I won, it's an RDA/RDTA from a fairly new company called [Nicomore](URL You might have seen their initial release which was [a subohm tank with flavour beads](URL that let you customize the flavour of your vape. Well their more recent release which I don't even see listed on their site or even on Vape Horizons is called the M1 and it's an RDA/RDTA that shares some similar design queues to their N1 release but completely forgoes the flavour bead concept. Here are my honest thoughts on the Nicomore M1 from Nicomore. **Package contents:** 1 x M1 x RDTA 1 x Outer cover of RDA 1 x RDA base 1 x Accessories 1 x Card 1 x Manual **Listed features and specs:** Size: 24.0mm x 49.5mm Capacity: 2.0 mL Material: Stainless Steel Thread: 510 Here's a link to [a full album of pics](URL *Please note, there's always a chance I missed something or forgot something from my notes, please don't hesitate to ask questions or point out anything I may have missed! ---- ##Packaging and contents: The RDTA/RDA comes in a rather [big black cardboard box](URL Everything inside is [protected by a thick black sponge insert](URL and it all arrived safe. Can't say for sure but [it looks like mine has been opened](URL as the accessory box was kind of mangled, there were finger prints on it and some minor scuff marks. Maybe the shop opened it up to take a look I'm not sure but at least it was all clean and in order. In the box you get the RDTA, an RDA base, an alternate top cap, an accessory box and an instruction card. [In the accessory box](URL you get a set of clapton coils and some spare orings. The kit is well laid out but they could have made the box just a bit smaller and still fit everything in nicely. ##The RDTA/RDA: Right away [this thing looks different](URL from it's octagonal shaped top cap to it's tool less clamp system, Nicomore is definitely trying some new things. It's a 24mm diameter atomizer that's made of SS but looks to be plated with gold or brass. Starting at the top it's got a very wide bore proprietary drip tip which I imagine is made of delrin but didn't see it listed anywhere. I personally am not a fan of proprietary drip tips but at least this one is nice and wide and comfortable to use. In the kit [you get two different top caps](URL one is adorned with a series of dots and lines which look a bit like Morse code written in an Asian language while the alternate cap is adorned with little crackling lines that look a bit like lightning. The caps are built identically it's just the design they bear that's different. What's interesting about these two caps is [they both come with a ceramic lining](URL which is meant to help reduce heat transfer through the cap. Aside from that they both perform the same job so it's really all about design choice. Airflow doesn't actually pass through the cap as there are no holes or slots cut in to them. Instead [air enters the RDTA through the gap](URL that is left between the cap and the base. It's essentially a hidden airflow system but in it's fully closed default state provides quite a bit of airflow, like a slightly restricted direct lung hit. You can increase the airflow by pulling the cap up but there's no way to close it anymore then the default. Personally I prefer a bit more control over the airflow unless the default is to my liking which tends to be a restricted direct lung hit. I think it would have been nicer if I could close it off even more for a more restricted hit, not MTL tight but tighter then it is now. [The kit also comes with two deck bases](URL the one that comes equipped makes it [an RDTA](URL with a 2ml reservoir in the base but it also includes just a standard [RDA base](URL which exchanges the reservoir for a considerably lower profile. The RDTA [base unscrews from the deck](URL for filling or swapping bases and is ringed with little window cutouts so you can see your liquid. As it only holds 2ml or so you'll be taking it on and off quite often. For RDTAs this isn't my favorite fill method but it works well enough so I can't really fault it. [Underneath the base](URL it's got a non-adjustable 510 pin surrounded by a bit of branding and their motto 'Vape Different, Indulge More'. ##The Deck: [The deck on this thing](URL is very different. It's dual coil only as there's no option included for single coils. The airflow feeds in from two holes, one on each side and comes up underneath the coils in [two wide cyclops style slots](URL The two posts have [nice wide post holes](URL and should fit some pretty big builds however the M1 does away with traditional clamping methods and instead offers a twist to tighten dual clamp system. Right in between the two posts is a little handle that you turn to tighten your clamps. That little handle controls a plastic block that raises or lowers depending on which direction you're turning it. When turned clockwise [that plastic block rises up](URL and clamps your leads in the posts. It works well enough with basic coil builds however it brings with it a few issues. Depending on how thick your wire is, [that handle might not align with the top of your posts](URL so it might jut out over top of your coils. It looks like it is shaped to accommodate this but it could impact flavour or vapour productions by blocking a bit of the path. Another issue which I ran in to right away is if you're making any adjustments and need to tighten your coil or move anything around, that little handle can get scorching hot and I've got the burnt fingertips to prove it. Because of this clamp system and the bottom airflow, it makes dripping from the top a big pain in the a$$. So I opted to use the RDTA base exclusively. I did try the rda base on for the pics but which base I chose to use for the review won't impact the flavour, vapour or anything like that. It just saved me from having to remove the top cap to drip. I also found that plastic block [doesn't rise up evenly](URL so often one side is clamped down tight while the other won't even bite the wire. I learned this the hard way when I tried installing some fused claptons and it absolutely refused to grab all of the wires no matter how hard I cranked it down and I even used pliers. It was pretty much after this that I gave up on it. I'm sure using regular wire builds will work much better but considering this thing has some pretty muted flavour you'll need a slightly beefier build to enjoy it. As for wicking, it's actually a breeze on this thing, I just treat it like any rdta, [cutting my cotton at an angle](URL and simply [tucking the tips in to the wells](URL **Likes:** *Looks neat *Build quality *Ceramic ring **Dislikes:** *Proprietary drip tip *Clamp system sucks *Airflow/Airflow adjustment *Flavour is weak/muted *Tank capacity is limited *Refill method *Bottom airflow and finger clamp means no dripping down the top *No single coil option ##Overall: I've got to say this thing looks pretty neat but beyond that it doesn't have a whole lot going for it. My personal list of dislikes is quite extensive and in the end I wasn't even able to use it the way I wanted. The flavour with the included coils was pretty muted, the airflow is barely controllable and because of the clamps building on it is just a nightmare. I think this one is pretty much a given. So as always the big questions: **Will I keep using this thing?** I've already parked it! **Would I recommend this thing?** I can't think of a scenario where I'd be comfortable recommending this thing, as it stands for me, it's a pass!"
58,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Yucatan from Ohmboyz Drip City,9,75xgwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/75xgwo/honest_one_shot_yucatan_from_ohmboyz_drip_city/,2017-10-13 01:49:22,"Hey guys, I'm a big fan of [Ohmboyz Drip City](URL they make really incredible juice and one of my all time favorite juices out there so when I was at CVE Toronto of course I was going to stop by. Not only did Alex the man behind Ohmboyz set me up with a bottle of my favorite juice but he also set me up with a sample of a new flavour they were launching which I'm quite happy to share my review of. The new flavour is quite a departure from their other stuff but quality and taste wise fits right in with the rest. Here are my honest thoughts on [Yucatan from Ohmboyz Drip City](URL The juice comes in a clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottle but the label I got on mine wasn't the final production version so it's changed a bit from the time I was given a bottle. The label I got was black with what I believe is an image similar to a Mayan sunstone or calendar. Whatever it is, it's very vibrant and colourful and I dig the look of it. I didn't see it listed but I imagine they're a 75vg blend like the rest of their lines and the bottle I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottle I got](URL but remember it's not the final version. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Yucatan](URL **(8.5/10)** (ECLECTIC MAYAN TROPICAL STORM DISASTER LEMONADE. A MAYHEM OF SWEET AND SOUR JUNGLE FRUITS, CUCUMBER AND LIMONCILLO.) Right off the bat you know this is going to be different, but not so different it's unfamiliar. On the first inhale I'm hit with a zesty hit of citrus which I assume is from the Limoncillo. It's like that spray that comes off a lemon or an orange when you peel it that fills the air with it's fresh zesty scent. It's a very authentic taste but it pretty quickly gets settled by a more down to earth almost flatter lemonade sort of taste. But it's not exactly your typical lemonade, it's got a sort of tropical flair to it with what I think might be a bit of guava which comes out in the mid notes. I can't really pick out the other jungle fruits but whatever they are they are fairly light in the mix letting the lemonade shine through. Maybe there's some kiwi or something like that but like I said it's pretty hard to pick out. The cucumber doesn't really come to the front either and is just barely noticeable, I sort of get a hint of it on the bottom end but what it does add is a nice crisp taste to the fruits in the mix, making them taste all that more fresh and authentic. I got to say, Ohmboyz managed to take something as common place as lemonade and made it just a little bit different from all the others I've tried. This would be an ideal vape on a hot summer day while enjoying an ice cold beverage out on the patio. Beautiful stuff!! **Will I finish it?** It's pretty much gone already!! **Will I want more?** Yes but I can probably wait until summer comes back around. ---- As I mentioned I'm a huge fan of Ohmboyz Drip City, they make Jabane, one of my favorite flavours in the world and continue to add even more incredible flavours to their lineup. If you haven't yet had the chance to try them out I really can't recommend them enough, they make some truly fantastic stuff. And Alex if you happen to read this, thank you once again for setting me up with your incredible juice!!"

Calling out vendors on this sub for shitty service, or shitty products is expected. However everyone has fuck ups sometimes. At least try to contact the Store before calling shit out like a day after your 'experience'. It used to be a funny meme with the fuckboy youtube guy with less than 10k subs, and he was ostracized for calling out Wicks and Wires because he posted about 10 seconds after he got off the bus. But really this sub is there for when you call them and they still fuck you around. IE Canvape lately is apparently shitty now, stay away from them as people have tried to contact them about their shit. However that it definitely appears that more posts are cropping up with people talking about so and so vendor and so and so problem, without actually contacting the fucking vendor. We're all adults here (and if your not, GTFO) and we've all had sub par experiences with buying shit for our everyday lives. But if you get the wrong stuff sent to you, Or a bad batch of juice, or maybe if you just didnt like how long it took to ship, at least contact the company first. Getting Juice from FOV in the wrong fucking bottles is not a good enough reason to Blast them. Getting ripped off by the latest Scam Juice company is a good enough reason to Blast them. Anyways, The last Few 'complaints' I've seen Ill post about just so theres a record here from someone who buys a lot of shit, from a lot of different people and companies. Dash Vapes -- No local retail locations, fantastic website and selection for american made juices, medium to higher pricing, fast shipping, very well packed. I used them when I first started vaping, found I didn't like their juices due to the nicotine being shit, stopped ordering from them. Made an offhand comment thanking god they changed nic and they sent me a care package after I confirmed my previous purchases to try the new stuff, and was very impressed at the quality. I never e-mailed or got in touch with them at the time because I had found other juices from other vendors I liked, that didn't make my throat feel like a Californian porn star. 180 smoke -- No retail locations nearby, Purchased from their booth at CVE when it was out west. Fantastic service, and good deals. Not a fan of their juice personally. Never contacted them as the juice was thrown in for free with the purchase of the hardware, who in their right mind is gonna complain about free shit even if they don't particularly like it? Canvape -- Purchased a LUX with a combo and a derringer clone. all came as described, timely. Wasn't super impressed but wasn't offput either. In closing, at the end of the day. Just please try to resolve issues first, if its big enough to make a post about in your mind, at least try to reach out to the company to get your problem fixed by them."
60,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: No. 26 from MEO eJuice,9,6uj0gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6uj0gq/honest_review_time_no_26_from_meo_ejuice/,2017-08-19 02:34:47,"Hey guys, I've been taking it easy lately but wanted to drop a review of something before the weekend that would be a perfect compliment to many people's weekend plans, that's if you're able to get a hold of some. It's a new addition to the RL Signature Series line by [MEO ejuice](URL or Mother Earth Organics if your'e not familiar with them. When I was at CVE I stopped by to see Rex the incredibly talented man behind the company. He set me up with a bottle of the new flavour and it doesn't fail to impress. He mentioned something about wanting to change the industry standards and help move things forward, after trying what he produced I'm pretty sure he's on to something. Here are my honest thoughts on No. 26 from MEO Ejuice. The juice comes in a clear glass 30ml bottle with a very modest understated beige label. I believe the subtle design is in anticipation of coming regulations but I could be wrong. It looks clean and classy. I'm not sure on the ratio and didn't see it listed anywhere but if I had to guess I'd say it was a 70vg blend. The bottles I got came in 3mg and here's [a shot of the lovely looking bottle](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[No. 26 Barrel aged Bourbon Cola](URL **(9/10)** (The second Signature Series flavor to be introduced, after a long awaited 18 month silence, we are TRULY HONORED to share with you our MOST PRIZED creation to date, we ACTUALLY age the Bourbon flavoring in Bourbon Caskets before MicroFiltering and curating our recipe.) As you can see from the description a lot of time and effort were put in to producing this flavour and it will only be available in small batches a few times a year. But after tasting it I can say without hesitation that it's well worth the effort! As soon as I crack the bottle I'm greeted with the distinct smell of Bourbon whiskey along with a sweet syrupy hint from the cola. It straight up smells like my father most of the time or a weekend of regret and pretty much tastes like it too,,, and it's incredible!!! MEO definitely gets a plus one for grown up flavours with this bad boy. I did get to try it at the Expo but after loading it up and giving it a proper taste it's got to be one of the most realistic whiskey and coke flavours I've tried, although admittedly I've only tried two at this point I believe but I'm intimately familiar with Bourbon and Coke. The smell and the taste of the Bourbon is 100% accurate and the only thing missing when you taste it is the sting of alcohol and shameful regret. All the nuances of the oak barrel Bourbon caskets have been captured in the flavouring. The cola on the other hand gives it a fairly sticky sweet taste like flat cola that's been sitting out for a bit, or sort of like a cola bottle candy without too much of the candy taste. All told it tastes like the last sip or two of a whiskey and coke, a bit watered down and a bit flat. While I'm sure the profile might not appeal to everyone it definitely appeals to me, my very first drink as a young'in was in fact whiskey and coke and has pretty much always been my drink of choice. No. 26 is one of those flavours that stirs up so many fond and some not so fond memories of growing up. The smell and taste of it are so realistic I'd probably recommend not vaping this while driving cause if you happen to get pulled over you'll have a hard time convincing the officer you weren't just drinking a big ol' glass of Bourbon and cola. For me as much as I enjoy it, it won't be an all day vape but an alternative or accompaniment to a nice after dinner drink which is exactly how I've been enjoying it. It's been a nice summer time treat for me and hopefully it's available soon as I'm almost out already!! ---- I've been a big fan of MEOs for quite some time, they make some really tasty stuff and No.26 is a beautiful new addition to the RL signature line, the RL referring to Rex's initials. I love the fact that Rex puts his name right on it and stands behind what he does. If you're into grown up flavours and enjoy a nice Bourbon and cola, I'd definitely recommend you check this out when it becomes available. And Rex you sexy mofo if you happen to read this, thanks as always for the hookup, you've absolutely nailed it with this one!!!"
61,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Charon TC 218 from Smoant,14,6v3i5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6v3i5t/honest_review_time_charon_tc_218_from_smoant/,2017-08-22 01:05:48,"Hey guys, Just after I dropped the [review of the Smoant Battlestar](URL the wonderful folks over at Smoant reached out about a review of some of their other products. Having been a fan since [the Knight v2](URL I was more then happy to oblige. Among the items sent over for review was the Smoant Charon TC 218 mod which I received in all black. While it's not exactly brand new to the market it's still new enough that they were still working on some companion software for the firmware upgradeable mod which just recently became available. Named for the Greek mythological boatman for the underworld I've been using The Charon for a few weeks now and even brought it with me to CVE Toronto. Having put it through it's paces I've honestly got very little to complain about on this one so here are my honest thoughts on the Charon TC 218 from Smoant. **Package contents:** 1X Smoant Charon TC 218 Mod 1X Usb data line 1X User Manual **Listed features:** 1. Size: 91mm(H)*25mm(W)*53mm(L) 2. Take 2 X 18650 battery 3. Material: Zinc alloy &amp; High quality leather 4. VW Mode power range: 1-218W 5. Temperature Control Mode support Ni200 Nickel, Titanium, Stainless Steel, Ni-chrome and TCR(Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity) 6. TC temperature range: 200-600?/ 100-300? 7. Support resistance low to 0.1ohm 8. Firmware Upgradable 9. Magnetic back cover, be easy to replace the battery 10. Can be charged through usb port 11. Weight(Without batteries): 195g 12. Low Resistance Protection 13. Over-time Protection 14. Reverse Polarity Protection 15. Overheating Protection 16. Color : Copper/ Golden/ Black/ Stainless Steel/ Hell's Angel/ Thor's Hammer/Brazing Skull/ Evil Wolf/ Camo colors Available Here's a link to [a full album of pics](URL *Please note, there's always a chance I missed something or forgot something from my notes, please don't hesitate to ask questions or point out anything I may have missed! ---- ##Packaging and contents: The mod comes in [a sort of brown cardboard box](URL with an image of the mod on the front. Aesthetically the design on the box looks a bit dated but I didn't want this thing for the box. Mine took a decent beating in transit but everything inside the box arrived safe and sound. [On the back of the box](URL it lists some of the features and also has an authenticity check in case you wanted to make sure it was authentic. [On the bottom side](URL of the box it lists all of the available colour options as well as the image options. [Inside](URL you really don't get much, not that you need much with it. [You get the mod, a usb cable](URL a manual, a warranty card, a warning card and a QC card and that's it no extras or other junk, just the things you need. ##The Mod: **Build quality and appearance:** The dual 18650 mod clearly [takes some styling notes from the LostVape Therion](URL series of mods but makes enough changes that it's not a direct ripoff of the original. Remember imitation is the highest form of flattery. The Charon TC 218 is made of zinc alloy with [a leather wrapped magnetic battery door](URL It's held on with four strong magnets. [The battery compartment](URL is well marked and easy to use and includes a ribbon for easily removing your batteries. Luckily it doesn't suffer from the same poorly designed battery compartment as the Therion series of mods. No ripping your wraps taking batteries out of this thing. Up top it's got [a very robust looking stainless steel 510 connection](URL with what looks like a gold plated spring loaded 510 center pin. I tried a number of attys on it and everything I threw at it sat pretty much flush. I say pretty much because the 510 rings sits up just a hair but it's pretty much unnoticeable unless you're looking for it. It's got to be one of the better 510s I've seen lately and will support atomizers up to 25mm without any overhang. There's [plenty of venting](URL with four small slots cutout on each side that are protected against dust and dirt by a fine mesh. The one I got was the black on black version which I think looks really nice. It comes in a variety of colours but if you don't like plain black like I do you can get one with an Angel on it or Thor's hammer, a blazing skull, an evil wolf or just some camo. I'm not usually a fan of big images or logos on my gear so I went with the plain black. On the face of the mod you've got [a very large round fire button](URL that's surrounded by a round rim. At first I was a bit leery of the extra large button but it grew on me really quickly and I appreciate that I can locate the button with ease even without looking at my device. It's nice and clicky and feels great when firing it. Just below the rotund fire button is the very bright oled screen. It's pretty much identical to the one on the Battlestar in regards to layout but I'm pretty sure it's just a tad brighter. Below the screen is the unique looking adjustment buttons that lend the 'Face' of the mod a somewhat exotic look. Ok, I'm Asian, I'll just say it, it's got Asian eyes, angry Asian eyes and Smoant even reproduced this look on their Battlestar RDA. Personally I got a kick out of the look of it but not sure how others may view it. Absolutely no rattle from any of the buttons. Just below the adjustment buttons is the micro usb port for both charging and firmware updates. I'm not sure of the rate but it does seem to charge rather quickly. [At the very bottom of the mod](URL there's just a tiny bit of branding and that's it, in fact it's the only banding on the device. Smoant kept the look nice and clean on this one. **Performance and functionality:** In regards to functions, [the mods screen](URL and menu are nearly identical to that of the Battlestar so I won't go in to too much detail. However it's sporting a new chip called the Ant 218 which adds a few new features as well as bumps up the power to 218w, up from the 200w of the Battlestar. The device supports resistances down to 0.1ohm and does temp control from 100-300 degrees Celsius. It also incorporates all of the typical safety features we come to expect like low resistance protection, over-time protection, reverse polarity and overheating protection. Like the Battlestar is supports [VW with TC options for Ni](URL [Ti, SS,](URL [NC and TCR](URL but there are also two new options that we didn't see on the Battlestar. The new options are [DVW and DTC](URL which refer to adjustable curves for variable wattage and temp control modes that the user is able to set themselves. However these two new options require you to download their companion software in order to adjust them which I've seen referred to as firmware however there isn't actually a firmware update for the device just the customization software that lets you adjust those two options DTC and DVW. At the moment it looks and feels a bit unfinished with the only functioning options being the curve adjustment tables. They basically look like graphs where you can plot the power or temp over the course of several seconds by moving sliders up and down. You get three mem slots for each option so you can setup three different profiles on the device. It's still in it's early stages so the software is still pretty limited and as of yet doesn't compare to the customization software for DNA, Gene or even Vaporesso. Right now it'll let you adjust the TC and Power curves and that's about it. It's also not formally available on their site yet and must be requested through their support line. The software does have a section for ROM updates so I'm hopeful a new firmware will be available soon. For the rest of the basics it's pretty much exactly like the Battlestar. It uses five clicks to turn it on and off, three clicks to get in to the menu, the +/- buttons let you cycle through the options while the fire button lets you select the options. Holding +/- at the same time lets you flip the screen and while in TC mode you can flip between temp and wattage by holding fire and + at the same time. I really don't have any complaints about the performance of the mod, it does what I ask of it and it does it well. Again I'm no DJLsb or P. Busardo but from all accounts the Ant board that runs this device works well and is pretty much accurate. However several other users have mentioned the device having fairly short battery life and it's been explained that the mod has a rather high voltage cutoff for the batteries, hopefully this will be addressed with a future update but with another mod already being released by Smoant I just hope support for this one doesn't get dropped. On the Battlestar after I posted the review a commenter pointed out an issue with idle battery drain that I managed to overlook, likely cause I charge my batteries regularly but an issue to be aware of none the less. With the Charon I have left it sitting for long periods and haven't really noticed any significant idle drain like I did with the Battlestar it's possible there is some but it doesn't appear to be as prominent as on the Battlestar so I'm not going to list it as an issue. One of the major benefits of the Charon over the Battlestar is the firmware updates and customization software but as I mentioned there currently aren't any updates available and the customization software looks like something I designed in M$ Visual Basic back in college. Luckily Smoant is very active in the community and takes community feedback in to account so I'm hoping development on the Charon and it's companion software keeps progressing. **Likes:** *Build quality *Performance *Customization software *Future firmware updates *Solid 510 *Affordable *Clean, minimal branding **Dislikes:** *No actual firmware update yet *Customization software is primitive *Can't adjust curves on the device ##Overall: [I love the look and feel of the mod](URL It performs really well and despite it's few minor drawbacks it's a full featured powerful device. It's more then affordable compared to some of the other mods in the same category and the fact that it's firmware upgradeable and has available companion software I'd say it's well worth the listed price. Sure a proper firmware update isn't yet available and the companion software is primitive but the device itself as it stands performs pretty much flawlessly without and Smoant appears to have a good presence in the vape community and seem eager to do things right. So as always the big questions: **Will I keep using this thing?** It's made it in to the regular rotation so I'd say it's safe to say yes this thing will be getting plenty of use out of me!! **Would I recommend this thing?** With the added features of the Charon over the Battlestar, the solid construction, affordable price and overall performance of the mod I'd have no trouble recommending it to anyone looking for a good dual 18650 device. And thanks /u/SmoantOfficial for setting me up with this fantastic mod for review, I've really been enjoying it!!"
62,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Sugoi from VapeStrong,11,6vlfk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6vlfk8/honest_review_time_sugoi_from_vapestrong/,2017-08-24 05:38:19,"Hey guys, When I was at CVE I got to meet the real Major Vapes, yes the real Major Vapes. Nearly three years ago when I picked the name majorvapes for my reddit account I had no idea that a Major Vapes already existed and didn't even think to look it up before I started using it here. Well for the past few years often when I met with new people they would say to me 'Hey, you're not Saby', eventually I came to realize that there was a company called VapeStrong from out west that has a juice line named Major Vapes run by a gentleman by the name of Saby. I had actually attempted to meet him at CVE Edmonton but didn't have the chance. But at CVE Toronto I was fortunate enough to finally meet the OG Major Vapes and shake his hand. We figured out he definitely had the name longer but he was very cool about me using it and was very warm and welcoming during my visit. Not only did I have the chance to meet him and try out his juice but he was generous enough to set me up with a whole bunch of liquids from his assorted lines. It'll probably take me a while to get through them all but I thought I'd start with a set that I got to try at the Expo that definitely caught my attention. Here are my honest thoughts on [Sugoi from VapeStrong](URL The set of three juices came in large 100ml clear Chubby Gorilla bottles. I'm pretty sure they are from a larger set of six but I believe these were the original three and were the ones they brought to the show. The labels on these are what caught my eye. They're half Japanese, sort of like me... The name of the line 'Sugoi' is a Japanese word which generally translates to 'Awesome' and a good portion of the label is also written in Japanese, they even had the price listed in Yen, kawaii ne! I inquired about the influence and apparently the owners wife is Japanese therefore the name. There's a line of Japanese text running across the label that loosely translates to 'Nicotine for the pleasure of sucking steam', lol, which I think kind of loses something in translation. The labels have a classic almost industrial look to them and I think they look fantastic. I didn't see the ratio listed but I'd guess they are around a 70vg blend and the set I picked up were all in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the badass looking bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Blue Power](URL **(7.5/10)** (Blue raspberry, description missing from site) I think you guys know how I feel about blue raspberry flavours, most of them just don't do anything for me but everyone seems to have one. With that in mind I've got to say right off the bat, Blue Power is pretty damn tasty for a Blue Raspberry flavour. It's full and juicy tasting compared to so many others I've tried. It's got a nice sweetness which gives it a sort of syrupy taste but it isn't overly sweet or cloying in any way. It's sort of in between a blue Freezie or a Pushpop for me, definitely an artificial sort of taste but one that doesn't remind me of medicine or any odd chemical taste, it's more of a candy kind of thing. Like most blue raspberry flavours though I can't really pick out any particular fruit flavour, like raspberry or even blueberry if it's in there but I do think I taste a hint of grape from time to time. It's not really tart or tangy and leans more towards syrupy sweet. All in all I think it's a fairly simple flavour but one that's done really well. Blue Ras fans will probably dig this one!! **[Orange Power](URL **(7/10)** (Orange, description missing from site) This line was really challenging for me, two of the three flavours I'm notorious for not liking but VapeStrong pretty much won me over on both accounts. Sure they're still not my top picks but I've got to say for two flavours I normally don't enjoy I found both of them to be very well done and they even managed to keep my interest, at least for a little while. Orange Power is like an orange soft drink or an Orange Creamsicle without the cream. Some of the older folks here probably remember the orange drink you'd get from McDonald's as a kid, a sort of watery artificial orange soft drink of sorts that was always popular with the kids. Orange Power manages to capture that taste in an eliquid and it brought me back to hotdog day in grade school when they'd have big coolers full of the orange stuff to pass out to the kids. As I mentioned it also reminds me a bit of the orange from a Creamsicle but without any of the cream and luckily it doesn't have that odd burnt plastic taste I normally get from Creamsicle flavours. It's not exactly a realistic orange flavour and doesn't have that realistic zest like you'd get from real citrus but it's a familiar orange taste all the same. Much like Blue Power it's fairly simple but fans of orange will probably appreciate this rendition of a classic orange flavour. **[Lemon Power](URL **(9.5/10)** ( - Wonderful power lemon pound cake) This was hands down my favorite flavour from the line and I'm thinking it's one of my new favorite lemon flavours out there. Like the other two it's fairly simple in it's profile but my gawd if it doesn't hit the spot. It's the perfect blend of bright lemon with just a touch of that classic pound cake flavour underneath. It's not super tart or anything and just reminds me of a nice light lemon cake with a gentle dusting of powdered sugar. Like someone took a lemon pound cake and squeezed all the juice out of it and put it in a bottle. The cake flavour like I mentioned is fairly gentle but the lemon really helps fill it in. It's not super tart or tangy for a citrus flavour, it's more like that soft lemon flavour you'd get from the curd of a Lemon Meringue pie or of course like a lemon pound cake. Although it still feels fairly straightforward I found it a touch more complex then the other two in the line but noticed there's a definite theme throughout. Lemon Power for me though easily wins this one!! ---- Overall I've got to say all three were well done, even though they're based on fairly simple flavours I can tell they're well made with quality ingredients. I've already gone through half of the Lemon Power and put a decent dent in the Blue Power and I rarely vape blue ras flavours. If you haven't heard of VapeStrong before I'd highly recommend you check them out. I've got a few more reviews coming for them so stay tuned for those in the future. And Saby if you happen to read this, you sir are an incredible man and thanks so much for setting me up with your fantastic juice!!"
63,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Dave's Finest Custards from Canada E-Clouds,11,6wjr15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6wjr15/honest_review_time_daves_finest_custards_from/,2017-08-29 00:32:59,"Hey guys, I always like to see vendors trying out new things, mixing things up from their usual offerings. While I was at CVE Toronto one of the requisite stops for me was the Canada E-Clouds booth, run by some of the most friendly folks in the industry. As it happened they were launching a new set of juices under a new banner called Dave's Finest Custards. Well being a fan of a good ol' custard I was more than happy to be set up with a set for review from Dave himself and I've got to say he did not disappoint. Here are my honest thoughts on [Dave's Finest Custards from Canada E-clouds](URL The two juices came in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla style bottles. The labels have an entirely new look from their regular line with a dark paisley background and gradient coloured lettering, they look classy and nice. All the usual stuff we like to see in fine print but I didn't see the ratio listed on the bottle or the site. I'd guess they were around a 70vg blend myself and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the sleek new bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Vanilla Sky](URL **(9/10)** (A savoury custard blend that is sure to dazzle your taste buds. A rich vanilla custard with undertones of rich toffee and brown sugar. A pleasant vanilla inhale with a rich custard filled exhale. Come join us in the Vanilla Sky.) I cut my teeth on custard flavours, one in particular gets credit for helping me quit but several others along the way have kept the cravings at bay for years now. There's something very comforting about a well done custard flavour. It's such a familiar yet varied flavour. I've tried countless versions myself and everyone has had something different to offer. Well Vanilla Sky is no different in that it's just different enough from all the others yet still so familiar and comforting that I found plenty to enjoy about it. It's got that classic smooth vanilla custard taste with plenty of layered mouth feel. I pick up little nuances of caramel or brown sugar floating among the rich vanilla custard mostly on the tail end. It's super soft and delicate but still packed with flavour. It's rich but not too eggy and the only real word that comes to mind when vaping it is smooth. While a vanilla custard sounds like such a simple thing it's obvious a lot of care went in to crafting this one and this is the sort of thing all day vapes are made of. Beautiful!! **[Smoky Vanilla Sky](URL **(9/10)** (For those looking for a full bodied Canadian tobacco, with a delectable vanilla custard undertone, this is the vape for you. The perfect pairing of both these flavours makes for a very smooth vape, satisfying your dessert and tobacco cravings.) I had a hard time picking which of the two I liked best so I figured why chose. They're both fantastic in their own way. Much like Vanilla Sky, Smoky Vanilla Sky is based on a classic vanilla custard flavour, however where it differs is the addition of a rich full bodied Canadian Tobacco. To me it tastes quite a bit like a sweet Virginia or even a mild burley with it's slightly fresh tobacco taste as opposed to dry. That sweet rich tobacco is layered with what I believe is a very similar Vanilla Sky custard base. Because the addition of the tobacco really changes the taste of the flavour it's hard to tell if they just took the Vanilla Sky and added some tobacco or if they tweaked it just a bit to accommodate the tobacco but whatever the case it's a very welcome addition. It's almost like an Ry4 but with a touch less of a caramel taste to it, like a light smooth vanilla tobacco blend and it works really well. I've always liked the mix of custard and tobacco, it really adds a nice savoury depth to the custard or a nice sweet touch to the tobacco, Smoky Vanilla Sky much like Vanilla Sky would make for a fantastic all day flavour especially for folks like me who enjoy a good custard tobacco blend!! ---- I can't say enough good things about Dave's Finest Custards, they're both extremely well done, full flavoured, comforting and delicious. They're also among some of the best things I've tried from Canada E-Clouds yet and hope it's a glimpse of things to come. If you haven't tried Canada E-Clouds before and you enjoy a good custard or tobacco flavour do yourself a favour and check these out!! And Dave and Dave if you happen to read this, great job on the new line and thanks as always for setting me up, you killed it with these beauties!! "
64,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Portuguese Custard Tarts from Nata Liquids,12,6wzfb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6wzfb8/honest_review_time_portuguese_custard_tarts_from/,2017-08-31 00:17:21,"Hey guys, For this one I got to give some credit to a fellow redditor for bringing it to my attention, when I was at CVE Toronto I'll admit I was a bit complacent and didn't make it around to all of the booths like I normally try to do. But /u/tsmashvapes suggested I make it over to at least one that I had managed to overlook and I'm so glad I did. They're a new company called Nata Liquids and at the expo they were launching their one and only flavour. You got to respect a company that launches with just one flavour, it generally shows they've taken the time to make one really great product and Nata doesn't disappoint. Here are my honest thoughts on [Portuguese Custard Tarts from Nata Liquids](URL The juice comes in a clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla style bottle. The clean white label sports an image of some delicious looking Portuguese Custard tarts and some cinnamon sticks with some very modest branding above it. All of the good stuff we like to see in fine print along the sides. The liquid is a 70vg blend and the bottle I picked up was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the tasty looking bottle I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Portuguese Custard Tarts](URL **(9/10)** (Enjoy the flavor of the traditional Portuguese custard tart. Pastis de nata is the sweet custard treat, Portugal is most famous for. A crispy pastry shell filled with vanilla custard brule and topped with cinnamon and caramelized sugar.) By now you guys probably know I dig a good custard and custard tarts whether Portuguese, Chinese or English are even better. Like a little pastry cup of creamy goodness, custard tarts are among my favorite desserts. So when /u/tsmashvapes stopped by to tell me there was a delicious Portuguese custard tart flavour at the Expo I just had to check it out. Nata liquids were just launching and their initial offering was just that, a delicious Portuguese Custard tart flavour. Ok so maybe it is just another custard flavour but it's one that has just a touch more to it. It starts with a nice light creamy vanilla accompanied by a dark almost bitter caramelized sugar sort of taste. It adds a touch of sweetness but as a whole it's not overly sweet or anything. I get just the lightest hints of a flaky pastry but it's a bit fleeting and comes out more as a bottom note. The whole thing is then topped off with a fairly generous sprinkling of cinnamon, the dry almost spicy kind but not like in a potpourri dry cinnamon stick sort of way, more like a gentle ground cinnamon dusting. It's fairly cinnamon forward but it doesn't completely overpower the other elements, it just sort of finishes them off and provides the final note. I wonder if it's actually a cinnamon cookie they used to give it that cinnamon and pastry taste. Personally I wouldn't have minded if the cinnamon was a just a little bit more subdued so you could enjoy more of the custard and pastry but as it stands it's a fantastic flavour. For a custard I'd say it's fairly sophisticated but I'm sure it won't alienate anyone interested in trying it and will even have a familiar feel to anyone that likes cinnamon custard or cookie flavours. ---- Overall I've got to hand it to Nata Liquids, they introduced themselves with a solid entry and I for one look forward to what else they might bring in the future. If you're into custards, desserts or cinnamon flavours this is one that's well worth checking out. And to the fine folks from Nata Liquids, thanks so much for setting me up with a bottle for review. It's a hell of a first flavour and I can't wait to see what you do next!!"
65,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: A selection from Umba Vape,11,6y7yqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6y7yqq/honest_review_time_a_selection_from_umba_vape/,2017-09-05 23:28:31,"Hey guys, Before I set out for CVE TO I was contacted by a US company called [Umba Vape](URL about a review of their stuff. Normally I avoid US based companies but they assured me they can get their juice across the border so I somewhat hesitantly agreed. One thing about Umba is they offer two types of nicotine, traditional USP freebase nicotine and something called WTAs which stands for Whole Tobacco Alkaloids. Basically the WTAs incorporate more of the stuff you'd find in natural tobacco to give a fuller more authentic experience. You might have caught /u/lampburglars review of Umbas the Blends line, he gives a very good explanation of the difference so I won't go in to it too much myself. Here are my honest thoughts on a selection from Umba vape. Not really wanting to do their whole line they sent over a small selection from their Blends line and one from their Tastemaker line. The Blends juices came in 30ml old school plastic squeeze bottles with needle tips and sport colourful labels with nice designs and all of the usual info we like to see. The Blends come in a 70vg blend and the ones I got used regular USP nicotine and came in 3mg. The bottle of Tastemaker I received came in a 30ml clear glass bottle with dropper top and bore a nice elegant design on the label. Tastemaker also come in a 70vg blend but with WTA nicotine also in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL I was sent. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- ##Tastemaker **[True](URL **(7.5/10)** **(Umba keeps things uncomplicated with its sole tobacco flavor. True has been perfected without compromise, making all other tobacco flavors redundant. True rules them all. Mix it up with a touch of The Blends to make your own flavoured tobacco to your taste.)** I love tobacco flavours, they make up a good portion of my advs and have been a huge help in fending off the cravings for the real thing. Tastemaker True I have to say is the absolute closest thing I've tasted to a real cigarette in all the years I've been vaping. It's so incredibly authentic I even get that hint of burnt cigarette or I hate to say it but dirty ashtray when vaping it. It might have something to do with the fact that this one is made with WTA nicotine so there's more elements of natural tobacco in there. The problem is, it's almost too authentic tasting and since I've given up on smoking I realize I don't like the taste of an actual burning cigarette anymore so much as I do all of the wonderful tobacco flavour variants on the market today. The first hit I took of this I was blown away, and felt like I was exhaling a cigarette, it even smells like a burning cigarette somehow but after a few more pulls I was pretty much done with that rather stinky walk down memory lane. This would be absolutely ideal for those just making the switch and looking for the most authentic tasting cigarette experience they can find with a vape but for those that have already made the switch like me, it might just be too real of an experience. ##The Blends **[Cartoons](URL **(8/10)** **(Feel like a kid again and take pleasure in the simple yumminess of fresh baked cookies and a tall glass of creamy chilled milk.)** I also love dessert flavours and milk and cookies is exactly the kind of thing I gravitate to so naturally I went for Cartoons first out of the set. From it I get an interesting mix of creamy milk and the taste of chocolate chip cookies. The milk picks up some of that chocolate flavour and almost comes off like chocolate milk. There's something about it that's just a tiny bit acrid, almost bitter but it's hard to put my finger on where it's coming from, it might be from the chocolate but like I said it's hard to tell. The cookie taste in it reminds me a lot of chocolate chip cookies, like the ones from President's Choice with semi-sweet chocolate chips but when vaping on it I found the cookie flavour would sort of drop off, often leaving me mostly with that creamy chocolate milk sort of taste and barely any of the actual cookie. Still I found it overall to be a rather nice rendition of Milk and Cookies and something I could enjoy all day or even as a treat. **[Suede](URL **(7/10)** **(Take a good dollop of smooth peanut butter, a generous smudge of vanilla bean and fold together with thick, heavy cream. Youve got that smooth, soft, luxurious Suede.)** Suede is an interesting blend of creamy peanut butter and vanilla bean and I'm not sure I've tasted anything quite like it before. The peanut butter is the main note in this and it's not that standard artificial tasting peanut butter but more of an authentic roasted peanut peanut butter taste like you'd get from some fresh made natural peanut butter. You know the kind your hippie friends give their kids where the oil constantly separates from the butter and they stir it up and act like that's normal. It's creamy with a slight sweetness to it, probably from the vanilla bean but it almost leans more towards a savoury flavour. Personally I wish this one had just a little bit more to it, since for me it's mostly peanut butter that I get and I think it could do with a shot of jam or something like that. Still anyone looking for an authentic peanut butter experience will likely dig this one. **[Five AM](URL **(5/10)** **(Full-bodied, dark-roasted coffee with a generous splash of cream and subtle dash of smooth bourbon. A coffee vape to start the day on a good note.)** Who doesn't enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning especially when it's got a shot of booze in it!? I sure as heck do so I was pretty excited to try this one. For me it starts off with a dark black almost instant coffee kind of taste with just a touch of cream. The cream doesn't really fill it out like others that I've tried, it almost sits along side it and it's fairly light on sweetness so it leans more towards a coffee with cream as opposed to cream and sugar. Then the bourbon comes in and for me I've got to say it kind of kills it. It gives it a rather boozy, oak barrel sort of taste which is authentic enough but for me it sort of takes over the coffee and cream a bit too much. I guess I'm more of a Coffee and Bailey's sort of guy as this one ended up not sitting all that well with me. I'm sure folks who enjoy a shot of bourbon in their morning coffee will appreciate this one but for me it's just a bit too strong. **[Bruises](URL **(7/10)** **(Crushed, pressed juicy berries in a fresh coulis paired with a crisp, crunchy crumble. Bursting with deep deliciousness.)** Bruises for me comes off as a nice mix of blueberry and blackberry. I also pick up little notes that remind me of black currant or maybe some raspberry. It's mostly focused around darker blue or black berries but I found I'd get hints of some red berries in it too like raspberry and maybe some strawberry for sweetness. It's blended well enough that it's really hard to pick out one berry from the next but as a whole it comes off really bright, sweet and fresh tasting and not too artificial for such a mystery blend. What I don't pick up is any of the crunchy crumble mentioned in the description, if it's there it's completely blown over by the berry coulis. Normally I can't stand generic berry mixes but this one I've got to say is quite tasty and pops with berry flavour even without the crunchy crumble. ---- Overall I've got to say I was pretty impressed by Umba Vapes. From the set I tried I think it's safe to say they're well blended and made with quality ingredients. I particularly appreciate the variety of options around nicotine that they offer and their prices even though American are very reasonable. So if you don't mind taking a chance with cross-border orders and you haven't given Umba vapes a try yet I wouldn't have any trouble recommending you check them out. And to the folks at Umba, thanks for setting me up with some samples for review, you make some tasty stuff!!"
66,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Cloud Compass,18,6yv6vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6yv6vi/honest_review_time_cloud_compass/,2017-09-09 00:43:28,"Hey guys, Wandering among the crowd at CVE Toronto was Matt from Cloud Compass and our very own /u/pornplaysmusic of Campbell Coil fame. Through a bit of a proxy, they very kindly set me up with a set of their juice to review. You guys have probably seen posts about Cloud Compass as they're not exactly new here on reddit but as of yet I don't think there have been too many reviews. So without further ado, here are my honest thoughts on a selection from Cloud Compass. All of the juices save one came in 60ml clear Chubby Gorilla style bottles. The labels are white with some very neat looking designs on them, each with a varying colour depending on the flavour I think. All of the fine print is on the label but some of it is a bit hard to read. The ratios vary from flavour to flavour but I believe the majority are max vg but I'll list what they are with the flavours. The set I got was a mix of 0mg and 3mg so I'll list that as well. Here's [a shot of the bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Bloody Orange Pulp Fiction](URL **(5/10)** **(This blend of citrus fruit has a distinct, sweet flavor that is crafted by blending the distinctly sharp citrus kick of blood orange with the gentle aromatics of golden ripe nectarine, accented by floral back notes straight from the Sahara and sweetened with a touch of confection perfection. 85vg 3mg)** I reviewed something very similar to this just recently with the biggest difference being sweetness. I can tell Cloud Compass doesn't use any additional sweetener and while I know many appreciate that, there are just as many who wouldn't mind things being a tiny bit sweeter. Bloody Orange Pulp Fiction has a simple artificial orange flavour like you'd get from an Orange Creamsicle but without any cream. It sort of reminds me of an orange soft drink but one that's a bit more watered down and less sweet. That fake orange flavour is a little bit tart but doesn't quite have the zest of the real thing. It's sort of a one note flavour and I personally don't get much out of it. I can't distinguish the blood orange from tangerine and don't pick up any Sahara florals. Fans of orange might enjoy it's simplicity but for me it's not quite enough. **[Blue Eyed Snitch](URL **(6.5/10)** **(Blue-Eyed Snitch showcases the tart and sour flavour of whitebark raspberries, blended into a refreshing iced beverage that is sure to bring you back great summertime memories, without the blinding neon blue colouring or toothache inducing sweetness that dominate most blue raspberry flavours on the market.. 82vg 3mg)** On the flavour card this one blatantly and somewhat boastfully compares itself to Blue Sky Bitch from Evaperated but without any of the colouring or heaps of sweetener but on their site they tone down the comparison to the iconic flavour just a bit and make reference to an exotic whitebark raspberry. I've never tried a whitebark raspberry and I'm not sure if that description is just an attempt to make blue raspberry sound more refined but I've definitely tried many things that are blue raspberry flavoured and I must say that's pretty much all this is. Is it similar to BSB? While it might share some obvious similarities the removal of the sweetener doesn't really do it a huge favour. At the end of the day it's a pretty common blue raspberry flavour and even though I'm not generally a fan of blue ras I can say this one isn't bad even without the toothache inducing sweetness. **[Cafe CH810N402](URL **(9/10)** **(Our richest flavour yet! Sweet caramel and devilish chocolate notes swirled together to accent a rich, bold espresso and delecately steamed milk to create a flavour with a multitude of delicious layers to wake up your palette. Named after the molecular makeup of caffeine, C8H10N4O2 is a flavour that is causing quite the stir among coffee lovers in the vape industry. Rich, creamy and just sweet enough to keep you coming back for more... this flavour is truly an elegantly elevated take on your morning cup 'o joe. 86vg 0mg)** This one came in a smaller unicorn sample bottle and had an entirely new looking label that was gold coloured and really stood out from the rest of the line. Not only did the label stand out but the flavour did too. I'm a huge fan of rich coffee flavours so when I picked this one up I wasn't much for putting it down. Compared to many of the others in the line, it feels fuller, more flavourful and a touch sweeter. The main upfront note is the espresso coffee but it's teamed up with notes of chocolate and milk but with all of those flavours swirling around I don't really pick up much of the caramel, maybe a hint of it as a bottom note but that's kind of where it stays. One thing that's a bit different is instead of cream they use steamed milk and it really changes the feel of it giving it a slight milky creaminess but without the thickness that usually comes with cream. Really rich and delicious this one will go well with a morning cup! **[Harambe's Bad Day](URL **(8/10)** **(Created in loving memory of everyone's favourite Silverback. The taste of freshly-picked, summer strawberries, blended flawlessly with the light and sweet flavour of exotic dragonfruit and finished off with a delectable dollop of fresh banana cream. Legend has is that this blend was the ADV of Harambe himself.. 86vg 0mg)** Banana flavours are so often hit or miss with me, often tasting like medicine or artificial candy. Harambe's Bad Day starts with a nice creamy banana that's somewhat in between real and artificial but it is quickly rolled in to a nice creamy dragon fruit with just a touch of strawberry on the end. It's almost like the description of it plays out backwards for me. Something about it reminds me of a strawberry banana yogurt my kids enjoy or a fresh smoothie made with a light cream. It's bright, fruity and flavourful with a nice creamy feel. This is another one that is a touch sweeter and a touch fuller then the others which I'm guessing comes from the flavours themselves as opposed to any added sweetener or anything. Great stuff and it's not often that I enjoy a banana flavour this much! **[Le-Malina-Ade](URL **(6/10)** **(Bring back those childhood memories of freshly-squeezed, thirst-quenching lemonade - you know, the one from the lemonade stand with the tall old-fashioned juice presses. We took that exact old fashionade lemonade flavour and combined it with the new-age twist of pured raspberries to create a refreshingly perfect blend of sweet and tart in our new Le-Malina-Ade, max VG premium blended e-liquid.. 87vg 0mg)** Le-Malina-Ade hits you right up front with a bright lemon-limeade with just a slight hint of realistic zest. It reminds me of a lemon water, easy on the sweetness but still rather refreshing. Like Harambe's it feels a bit fuller then the remaining flavours but still forgoes any real sweetness. The description mentions pured raspberries but if there's any in there it's completely lost on me, it might give it a slightly pink lemonade feel but I don't taste it as a separate element. In the description it calls itself a blend of sweet and tart but it really leans more towards the tart since like the others it doesn't include much sweetener. I found that bit of tartness and lack of sweetness can give it a slight dry feel. Personally I wouldn't have minded this one being just a touch sweeter to give it a bit more balance and help fill out the flavour a bit more. **[Metalberry Applecore](URL **(6/10)** **(Our broad fusion of extreme fuji apples and the melodic screams from the wildest berries available, won't make your ears bleed but is just the thing to induce a circle pit of delicious proportions.. Max VG 3mg)** Metalberry Applecore starts off with a very clean green Fuji apple taste, it's kind of hard to peg the berries in it but I'd probably guess raspberry or something similarly soft as I only get a touch of it. The whole thing comes off sort of like a semi tart apple and thankfully it doesn't give me any of that strong artificial green apple taste that I'm really not a fan of. It's very straightforward in it's profile and mainly focuses on the apple aspect of it which to me is actually quite nice. One thing I will note is much like Le-Malina-Ade with the lack of sweetness and the slight tartness from the apple it can come off a touch dry tasting. Nice enough for an apple flavour but like the others I wouldn't mind a bit more to it. **[Moo-Turd Milk](URL **(6/10)** **(Two scoops of devilishly delicious vanilla bean ice cream blanketed in an array of fresh strawberries and cream. Moo Turd Milk is truly a dessert flavour that even the die-hard fruit enthusiast will enjoy. Max VG 3mg)** I struggle with strawberry and cream flavours, I really do. There have been a select few that have won me over but in general I tend to avoid the vast sea of strawberry creams that seem to populate the vape market. From Moo Turd Milk which I was actually expecting to be a chocolate milk flavour, I get a very thin tasting strawberry milk. I find despite the addition of vanilla bean ice cream it's not really creamy and comes off thinner like milk accompanied by a fairly artificial strawberry taste. Even with that hit of strawberry it's not really sweet and even comes off a touch dry with very little mouth feel to it. I noticed a number of the flavours on their site are listed as Max VG and wonder if it has anything to do with the thinness of those particular flavours. While I do respect the fact that Matt avoids using sweeteners wherever possible I feel like it could be hurting some particular flavours as this is yet another one I wouldn't have minded being a touch sweeter. **[Purple Panda](URL **(6.5/10)** **(Since the dawn of vaping, grape-lovers have been considered a niche market, a dying breed. At Cloud Compass we refuse to accept that fact and let a beautiful breed die. Our arteries do not pump red, and my veins are not blue. Our blood, and heart, are purple through and through, You can taste the dedication in Purple Panda, the grapest grape you have ever vaped. Max VG 0mg)** Much like strawberry cream or blue raspberry, grape flavours are a fringe flavour for me. I do enjoy them from time to time but it's not something I generally seek out. Purple Panda to me comes off as a soft artificial purple grape flavour, not very sweet and it reminds me of Grape Kool-aid without a lot of sugar, sort of like it's been watered down. I feel like I occasionally pick up a bit of a powdery bubblegum in the mix but it sort of comes and goes. Not a whole lot to say about this one, it's a pretty basic artificial purple grape flavour that goes easy on the sweetener. Is it the grapest grape I've tried, I don't think so but for a grape flavour that isn't very sweet, it's not too bad. ---- Overall I've got to say Cloud Compass makes some pretty decent stuff, especially considering they keep the sweetener to an absolute minimum. The flavours are fairly straightforward and shouldn't alienate anyone with their selection. Personally I enjoy just a bit of sweetness to my daily's but I know plenty of people who will appreciate the lack of added sweeteners and the time put in to crafting them without. Anyone looking for juice that isn't slammed with sweetener would do well with these. So big thanks to Matt and company for setting me up with the line, you've got some great stuff there!!"
67,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: FL from FL Vapor,13,6zg1o7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6zg1o7/honest_review_time_flō_from_flō_vapor/,2017-09-12 01:20:48,"Hey guys, A while back I met with the guys from [VapeNorth](URL at my local b&amp;m, they very kindly set me up with a bunch of stuff to review. I had to put some of it on hold as it wasn't ready for release yet but after meeting with them again at CVE Toronto I was told they'd all be up and ready on their site. This set of juice I've actually had for a while, but like I said just didn't have the chance to post it. It's an American based company but it's being distributed up here in the Great White North by the good folks at VapeNorth so I don't have any trouble reviewing it. Here are my honest thoughts on FL from FL Vapor. The line comes in nice 60ml clear glass bottles with gorgeous bamboo dropper lids. These have to be some of the coolest looking bottles and tops I've seen yet. Maybe not the most practical but man do they look good. The labels have a rather modest look to them with a textured looking background, a simple logo and the name of the flavour. The line is 75vg and the set I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the gorgeous bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL I'm trying something new with ratings, adding two big questions for each flavour. This set was fantastic so might not be a good gauge but for future reviews it should be helpful. Let me know what you think! Description from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Nanato](URL **(8.5/10)** **(Homemade southern banana pudding layered with vanilla wafers and dollops of whipped cream.)** I'm not really a fan of banana flavours but when I gave Nanato a try I was pretty much a convert. It's like a super decadent bananas and cream sort of flavour. It tastes like real fresh slices of banana with a hint of spice like banana bread, all smothered in a rich whipped cream. The vanilla wafers I'm guessing are what gives it the banana bread sort of taste for me. It's really creamy and thick tasting, a bit on the sweet side but it has a nice velvety texture to it like a pudding. It reminds me a lot of a dessert one of my sisters makes called The Admiral's favorite, which is essentially bananas in whipped cream, drizzled with condensed milk in a graham or oreo cookie crust. It's been a while since I had it but it's immediately what came to mind when trying it. For a guy who normally doesn't enjoy banana flavours this one went over extremely well with me. Rich, decadent and delicious!! **Will I finish it?** Very likely! **Will I want more?** Probably! **[Stachioberry](URL **(9/10)** **(A lusciously full-bodied blend of pistachios and vanilla bean gelato garnished with sliced juicy strawberries.)** Strawberry and cream flavours aren't often my favorite thing but every once in a while something comes along that wins me over and with Stachioberry, I've definitely been won over. It's such a unique take on strawberry and cream that I think many people will really appreciate. Instead of just your run of the mill S&amp;C, Stachioberry adds a vanilla bean gelato and pistachios to the mix, that's right nuts in your strawberry cream and it couldn't be more welcome. No more boring sweet cream but a rich and decadent nutty pistachio vanilla bean gelato cream. The strawberries lean towards fresh, realistic strawberry while the vanilla bean adds that ice cream creaminess we're used to but it also has a beautiful nutty undertone to the whole thing from the pistachio. Such a wonderful rich and delicious take on strawberry and cream and a very welcome change for me. **Will I finish it?** Yes without a doubt!! **Will I want more?** Yes!! **[Rehydrate](URL **(9/10)** **(Refreshingly smooth blend of cranberry and cherry with a hint of honey and lemon lime. The invigorating combination effortlessly makes for a perfect all-day-vape.)** This whole line was pretty much an eye opener for me. Normally I gravitate towards dessert flavours and very few fruit flavours have kept my attention long enough to finish a bottle or make it in the regular rotation. Rehydrate after the first taste was a big wake up call to my taste buds and a new fruity favorite. It's an incredible blend of citrus fruits and berries that really pops with flavour. I get a bit of an almost powdery cherry sort of taste with a light refreshing lemon-lime backdrop. I don't really pick out the cranberry or the honey but it's lightly sweet with a nice hint of tartness. It leaves a really pleasant sweet taste on the lips but doesn't come off as overly sweetened like sugar lips, in fact it's very clean tasting and wasn't bad at all on the coils. It has a really soft feel to it with zero throat hit and makes for an excellent all day vape for me and I normally don't rock fruit flavours. **Will I finish it?** Guaranteed! **Will I want more?** I'd probably get the on-ice version first! **[Rehydrate-on-ice](URL **(9.5/10)** **(Refreshingly smooth blend of cranberry and cherry with a hint of honey and lemon lime on ice. The invigorating combination effortlessly makes for a perfect all-day-vape.)** I sort of flip flopped back and forth trying to figure out which I like better, the original Rehydrate or Rehydrate-on-ice and in the end the on-ice version won out and took first place for me from the line but only by a slim margin. It's packed with the same wonderful fruit flavours as the original but also has just the perfect hit of refreshing koolada. Not really a mint or menthol it's just a touch of that wonderful cooling sensation and it goes perfectly with the blend of fruit in Rehydrate, giving it an even more refreshing feel/taste. Not much else to say about this one as it's essentially the same as the original but with that extra shot of cool. **Will I finish it?** I'm on my second bottle already so yes I will. **Will I want more?** Again I'm on my second bottle and I'm not tired of it yet so yes I will! ---- Overall I've got to say I was throughly impressed with FL Vapor. Every one of their flavours was unique yet familiar, different but comforting. I really enjoyed the little twist they put on each one of them and would be hard pressed to find any complaints with them. Yes they are from the states but with a notable distributor in Canada I'd have no trouble giving them a recommendation. With such well thought out and formulated flavours it would be a shame not to check them out. So FL Vapor and VapeNorth if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with the line, I was very impressed with what I tasted!!"

He handed me an unlabeled bottle at CVE to test out and give my opinion. It almost fell through the cracks but Danny followed up to see what I thought and I dug it out of the pile that was CVE Toronto. I cracked the bottle open and it practically evaporated after that. Needless to say I am quite happy with the new flavour from Train Wreck.

It's an absolutely decadent blend of peanut butter, chocolate and buttery popcorn. If you've ever had some fancy pants specialty or gourmet popcorn you'll probably know what to expect from this. It's a very well layered flavour combining all three elements of rich chocolate, creamy peanut butter and buttery popcorn. The chocolate is rich but light, leaning more towards a milk chocolate drizzle while the peanut butter gives it a lot more body along with a nice nutty taste followed by the buttery undertone of fresh popcorn. The peanut butter is probably the most prominent flavour with the chocolate coming next and the popcorn just tipping it's toe in on the end. I love rich and decadent flavours and this one is a really nice addition to the list of favs. I found it goes great with a cold glass of milk or even with my morning coffee. It is fairly decadent so it might not be an ideal all day for many people but for others it's going to hit the spot again and again and again. Fantastic stuff!! **Will I finish it?** I'm on my second bottle of it already! **Will I want more?** Yup!! ---- Train Wreck makes some fantastic juices and it looks like they've been narrowing down their lines, focusing on just the best of the bunch.

I decided to snatch a few Joyetech Evic VTC minis/duals These are great mods for everyday carry or beater! Flash Arctic Fox on them, and you have most if not more features than a DNA board. The only problem with these mods is the 510. It is known to sometimes fail, just like on every other Joyetech/Wismec/Eleaf product, but at 24.99$ a pop, it's definitely worth it! This is in no way a SmoK type of fail! I personally grabbed a few for gifts and beater mods! Available at: URL &amp;nbsp; **New stuff in** Since it's been a while since I've made an update post, the list of new hardware can be a little long. As usual I took one of each for myself to test and provide feedback (gotta love R&amp;D right??!) * [Wotofo Serpent SMM RTA](URL Great atomiser! Good flavour but definitely not made for those who enjoy a restricted MTL like myself. I find the chamber is a little bit too big to provide good flavour for my style of vaping! If you DTL or enjoy unrestricted MTL, this device will definitely fit the bill! * [OBS Engine Nano](URL A very nice single coil flavour/cloud chasing setup. While the flavour is not intense, it is satisfying while plooming a room. I originally bought one at CVE Toronto and loaded it up with some SIC. Enjoyed enough to decide to carry it! * [YFTK Skyline RTA](URL My new baby! I can't believe I found a suitable replacement for my KFV4! The flavour on this RTA is on point. Easily the best flavour RTA of 2016! It's the RTA I used to test Pistachio Marzipan in its final stages! The only downsides from the Skyline is the filling mechanism and it leaks a tiny bit after refilling! But other than that I cannot recommend this RTA enough! * [YFTK Viper V2 RDA](URL The greatest flavour RDA ever made, but be ready to squonk every other hit! The flavour on this beats all other RDAs ever made, but the pain of squonking every 2 hits is PITA enough to grab an Armor instead! At 14mm, it also looks very odd on any squonking setup! * [SXK Armor RDA] (URL Speaking about this one again as I find it to be one of the best flavour RDA on the market atm. My current list of best flavour RDAs is Viper V2 &gt; Armor &gt; Narda &gt; Hadaly. Many other RDAs try to imitate their design/chamber, but always mess it up. Either the chamber is too big or the topcap does not properly condense the flavour! * [YFTK Solo RDA](URL Overhype RDA. Some people might like it, but it falls in the category explained in the armor section. Yet some people will enjoy it! * [SXK Flav RDA](URL One of the best 24mm Flavour RDAs. I consider it to be the 24mm equivalant of the Armor, with a bit less flavour! * [SXK Hussar](URL Great idea, great flavour, but in practise the RDTA ends up being average. You need to make sure you install the screw to lock the topcap, else you will mess up your wick! * [YFTK Soul S RDA](URL Interesting deck design. Didn't have a chance to try it yet so won't comment! * [YFTK Le Concorde RDA](URL Didn't have a chance to try it yet. Doesn't seem made to handle claptons, but we'll see! &amp;nbsp; **Sale** All right, so with the new hardware listed, here's what's on sale this week: * [Labour Day special is still on with a decrease](URL : 22$/60ml, or 40$/120ml packs.

70,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Huckleberry by Cloudfire,11,6o9qgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6o9qgr/honest_one_shot_huckleberry_by_cloudfire/,2017-07-20 02:45:41,"Hey guys, With CVE just a few day away I've had a number of things show up which are being launched at the expo. Just a few days ago something landed at my doorstep that I was quite pleased to see. Ryan Hjelm of Hjelm Vapor the makers of Cloudfire sent over a lovely care package which included a new flavour he's just released and should be available at CVE. He's also come out with new 75ml bottles for the existing line that are the same shape and design as his original bottles which he very generously included as well. I've already done [a review](URL of his original lineup so this one will be focused on the new addition. Here are my honest thoughts on Huckleberry from Cloudfire. The juice comes in these nifty rectangular bottles with offset tips that for me are super handy when dripping. They also work great for filling or whatever but when dripping that offset tip is pretty awesome. The entire line has undergone a makeover too with the new bigger 75ml bottles now sporting different patterns and colours, no longer do they rock the comic book inspired theme they originally carried. As much as I was a fan of the original artwork I think the new bottles and labels are a bit more mature and look fantastic! I believe the juice is Max VG and the bottle I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the gorgeous new bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from his FB page in brackets, no link available yet. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Huckleberry** **(8.5/10)** (A delicious and fresh take on an old classic. Mouth watering ripe berries baked into a light buttery crust with a sweet decadent whipped topping.) Huckleberry pie isn't exactly the most common of desserts these days. In fact I think I might have only had it a couple times in my entire life and can barely recall what it tastes like. But from my vague recollection it's not too far off from a blueberry pie with maybe just a bit more tartness. For sure it's the first huckleberry flavoured eliquid that I've tried so I don't have much to compare it with but I can definitely say it's really damn tasty. What I get from it is almost like a blend of berries in cream with an underlying bit of crust. From the berry taste I get some blueberry, maybe some black currant or black berry, possibly some raspberry but I also pick up some elements that remind me of peach or nectarine but that could be just my imagination. It's not like I pick these notes up distinctly though as the berry taste if pretty homogeneous and sort of blends together. That berry taste is fairly sweet like a pie filling would be and it's got a nice soft creaminess to it which I imagine is from the whipped cream topping. As for the pie crust, it's fairly light but tastes nice and buttery and comes out mostly on the bottom end for me. It's fairly gentle in the mix but definitely comes through to give the whole thing a lovely taste of pie. There's something very comforting about this flavour, just like a slice of homemade pie after a nice family dinner, really nice stuff!! ---- I'm already a big fan of Cloudfires. They make some incredible stuff so I was thrilled when this showed up at my door step. Ryan definitely knows what he's doing when it comes to mixing up flavours and this one I'd say is a very welcome addition to the line. If you haven't tried Cloudfire out before they get an absolutely solid recommendation from me. And Mr. Hjelm if you happen to read this, thanks so much for this bundle of joy, it was immensely appreciated!!"
71,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Decadence: Pistachio by The Vaporist,20,6ogy21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6ogy21/honest_one_shot_decadence_pistachio_by_the/,2017-07-21 01:26:44,"Hey guys, Ahead of CVE Toronto our very own Phil /u/TheVaporist has been quite busy producing some new flavours. You might have caught my review last week of the new Bargain Ejuice flavour Strawberry Ice Cream, well this week I'll be taking a look at a new Vaporist flavour called Decadence: Pistachio. While some of you may know that I'm friends with Phil, I assure you it will have absolutely no influence on my rating of this juice. Here are my honest thoughts on Decadence: Pistachio from The Vaporist. The juice comes in 60ml clear Chubby Gorilla bottles with a green label similar to their TOL line. It bears a white crown, as a symbol of decadence and fits in nicely with the existing lines. The juice is 80vg and the bottle I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the lovely new bottle](URL I received. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Decadence: Pistachio](URL **(10/10)** (The most delectable of Marzipan treats. Gently toasted pistachio nut crumble wrapped in a decadent pate d'amande. A delightfully sweet classic unlike any other. ) From what I understand Decadence: Pistachio is based on a classic marzipan treat which is filled with crumbled pistachio and looks something like [this](URL I don't know how common this stuff is but I've actually had the opportunity to try the treat in real life and I've got to say Phil has pretty much nailed it with this one. It's a rather sweet nutty treat that has quickly become one of my new favorite flavours. Upfront I'm greeted with a nice authentic tasting pistachio nut, it has a roasted taste to it, not like raw pistachio more like one that's been toasted and crumbled. It's followed by a sweet, creamy and smooth marzipan that definitely falls in the decadent category. The light taste of almond and sugar combine to give it that classic confectionery taste. The sweet taste of marzipan blends perfectly with the pistachio, really filling out the flavour without overshadowing that lovely pistachio filling. Yes it's a sweet flavour but it's not overly sweet or cloying in anyway and it's surprisingly easy on coils and cotton. I was fortunate enough to try this a little while back in it's early stages and it's really come a long way since then, from a concept to a finished product to one of my new ADVs. It's a somewhat light flavour, not overly complicated, but one that constantly leaves you wanting more. Exactly the kind of thing that I look for in an ADV!! ---- I can't imagine there are many folks on here who haven't yet tried The Vaporists juice but this right here is probably the best excuse one could have to put in an order with them. I've known Phil for a few years now and as much as I enjoyed his juices, they didn't really match my flavour profile so when he sent this over I pretty much swooned. It's probably my favorite thing from him yet next to Double Trouble. I really can't recommend this stuff enough, not only is it Phil's new adv it's quickly become one of mine as well. So Phil, I'm sure you're reading this, you've hit this one out of the park man, thanks for setting me up with this absolute gem!! Edit: ratio "

88,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: DPro RDA by Coilart,10,6pojd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6pojd1/honest_review_time_dpro_rda_by_coilart/,2017-07-27 00:50:30,"Hey guys, Coilart recently came out with a new RDA and were kind enough to send one over for review. If you happened to be at CVE you might have seen me walking around with it. It's called the Coilart DPro RDA and I've got very little to complain about with this one, looks like Coilart did a fantastic job with it. Here are my honest thoughts on the [DPro RDA by Coilart](URL **Package contents:** 1 X DPRO RDA 2 X Fused Clapton Coil(CoilART Handmade Coil) 2 X Cotton 1 X Accessories Bag **Listed specs and features:** 24mm Diameter 36mm Overall Height Creative Postless Deck 24K Golden Plated Extra Bottom Feeding Pin Creative Adjustable Flavor Airflow Goon Style Ultem Drip Tip PEEK insulator Stainless Steel, Black and Ultem Here's a link to [a full album of pics](URL *Please note, there's always a chance I missed something or forgot something from my notes, please don't hesitate to ask questions or point out anything I may have missed! ---- ##Packaging and contents: The RDA comes packed in a pretty standard Coilart box. The box has a sleeve over it and [on the front](URL is an image of the RDA while [on the back](URL it shows the list of contents as well as an authenticity check. Under the sleeve is the typical [black textured box](URL they tend to use and [inside you get](URL the DPro RDA, [a bag with some coils and cotton](URL a spares bag, a logo card and an [Allen key](URL Coilart were also kind enough to include an alternative black top cap which feels like it's made of aluminum as it's significantly lighter then the included SS cap. [In the spares bag](URL you get four spare grub screws, a BF pin and some spare orings. The inclusion of the BF pin is a big bonus for me! ##The RDA: I noticed the [DPro RDA](URL seems to take some queues from some well known atomizers, [the airflow](URL is reminiscent of an O-Atty from Odis design while the [postless deck](URL reminds me of something like the deck in the Dotmod RTA. Like the O-Atty the airflow channels that cut through the deck are angled down which should help with flavour as well as leaking if you over drip. The RDA itself is made of stainless steel and is 24mm in diameter and only 36mm tall. Build quality is impeccable and I couldn't find a single issue with the fit and finish of it. Starting at the top it's got an [extra thick ultem 810 drip tip](URL It's [quite chunky](URL but is comfortable to use and for an 810 drip tip I found [the bore is fairly narrow](URL It does make the tip rather thick but it should hold up really well to heat and wear. In the kit it came with a stainless steel top cap that has two [oval shaped airflow holes](URL one on each side. I found the amount of airflow was perfect for my tastes, at full open it gives a slightly restricted direct lung hit. The cap inside isn't really concave but I don't think flavour suffers much for it as there really isn't much space between the coils and your mouth. Coilart also tossed in [a black top cap](URL which looks to be anodized aluminum. Underneath the rda there is [a bit of branding](URL and a gold plated 510 center pin. It's non-adjustable as it's made to be replaced with the included BF pin if squonking is your thing. It is for me so I really appreciated them including one. The [510 pin also protrudes a good amount](URL so hybrid concerns shouldn't be an issue. [The deck is 24k gold plated](URL and looks gorgeous. It's split with [a peek insulator](URL to protect against heat. It's also quite easy to work with especially if you've ever worked on a postless deck, the trick is getting your leads the right length but the included coils(40/2x26 fused claptons) were already cut to just the right length so popping them in for me literally took less then a minute. [The grubs to tighten down your coils](URL live on the outside of the deck. A few minor adjustments and it was [looking pretty much perfect](URL I found I much preferred it in dual coil mode and got much better flavour from it that way. When trying it with just a single coil I noticed the flavour suffered a bit as it creates quite a bit of space between the air slots and the coil. One thing I noted about the deck was [the shallow juice well](URL The deck is pretty much flat and only goes down 3 millimeters or so from the edge of the deck and even less from the airflow slots. Not sure why they couldn't cut a few mils from the outer edges to create a bit more depth but as it stands I can get quite a bit of juice in there and haven't suffered any leaks. Wicking it is pretty much just like a regular rda and since there's no channels or anything to tuck your cotton in to I pretty much ran my cotton through my coils, cut it just at the outer edge of the deck and tucked them down on to the deck. **Likes:** *Build quality *Airflow *Flavour and vapour with the included coils *Size *810 drip tip *Gold plated deck *BF pin included *Easy to build and wick **Dislikes:** *Juice well is a bit shallow *Not ideal for single coil ##Overall: I've got to say I'm thoroughly impressed by [the DPro rda](URL it's essentially a 24mm flavour rda that incorporates quite a few features that I really enjoy, the deck is easy to build on, the airflow is pretty much perfect for me, the size and height are ideal, the 810 drip tip is nice and the gold plated deck is gorgeous. My listed dislikes are negligible and the overall experience I've had with it has been wonderful. So as always the big questions: **Will I keep using this thing?** It's one of my new favorite rdas and has made it in to the regular rotation so yes I will definitely keep using this thing. **Would I recommend this thing?** Considering I have almost nothing to complain about yes I would absolutely recommend this thing, it's a solid RDA all around and I think any good builder will appreciate it's construction. So thanks /u/CoilartOfficial for setting me up with this beauty, I've really been enjoying it!!"

CVE post + Sale will follow soon! &amp;nbsp; I hinted earlier that I have 'found' a new ADV to replace my beloved TOLA. It took a little while as I walked outside my comfort zone, but it was definitely worth it! I was able to get a label going right before CVE (might not be final though, I dislike the fonts). &amp;nbsp; I am happy and proud to present [**Decadence: Pistachio Marzipan**](URL &amp;nbsp; The official desciption is: The most delectable of Marzipan treats. Gently toasted pistachio nut crumble wrapped in a decadent pate d'amande. A delightfully sweet classic unlike any other. &amp;nbsp; Unofficial: It's based off a Syrian dessert called [Kaak Bi Loz](URL We usually simply call it Marzipan! It's nutty, creamy and sweet. If you enjoy dessert vapes, you will love it! &amp;nbsp; The response has been overwhelmingly positive at CVE! It's been added to the current sale items, and will be added to the packs before the end of the week! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Next up is a ""I'm not sure if it will be a limited release"" flavour. &amp;nbsp; I was toying around with the idea of a dark roast, but was unable to get satisfying results. I decided to try and swap the front and back notes of Double Trouble and the results were pretty amazing! I give you: **Double Trouble Drip Edition!** With this flavour, the coffee sits in the front. It is different from the original Double Trouble, while being very similar! Many people who disliked Double Trouble found the Drip Edition enjoyable! It's a Max VG flavour at ~85%VG (hence the Drip Edition) but can be used in a tank that can handle viscous liquids. It comes in a 60ml unicorn bottle (no box or keychain!). It's only available in 0, 1.5 and 3mg for now. It's not available as a standalone yet, but available in the packs for an extra (since I don't want to piss off stores that will carry it!) &amp;nbsp; That about sums it up for the new flavours!

94,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Lemon Grahams from DripSocial,17,6qoogi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6qoogi/honest_one_shot_lemon_grahams_from_dripsocial/,2017-08-01 00:16:01,"Hey guys, Among the many new things that I picked up at CVE Toronto a new flavour from the folks over at DripSocial made it's way in to my hands. They were kind enough to set me up with a new release they were launching at the expo and I'm so glad that they did. It's a follow up to their very popular Dragon Grahams and follows the same basic principal but is quite different in it's delivery. It's doesn't officially launch until August 11th so no link for now but it should be readily available once it does. Here are my honest thoughts on Lemon Grahams from [DripSocial](URL The juice comes in a clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottle with a label fairly similar to the original Dragon Grahams but with a lemon in the place of the Dragon Fruit image on the front. I love the design of the DS bottles and Lemon Grahams fits right in with the others. It's a max VG liquid and the one I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the lovely bottle](URL is came in. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Basic description in brackets but no link yet. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Lemon Grahams** **(9/10)** (Lemon cream, graham and brown sugar) Have you ever had a warm lemon tart in a graham cracker base cause Lemon Grahams presents you with exactly that. Imagine the lemon curd from a fresh baked lemon meringue pie but instead of the usual buttery pie crust we're all used to, it's wrapped in a delicious warm graham cracker crust instead. Lemon Grahams has such a familiar and comforting feeling to it I had trouble putting it down from the minute I opened it. The lemon curd or cream is up front, lightly tart, a touch sweet and has nice a sort of creaminess to it. It's bright and lemony but isn't too sour or biting for a lemon flavour and works really well with the graham cracker crust. The graham which mostly comes on the back end has a nice bakery taste to it without coming off scratchy or spicy like graham sometimes does. I did find when vaping it for longer periods that the lemon can sort of take over leaving little of the graham flavour behind when it does. I'd almost be upset but that lemon curd is so tasty and full I hardly notice the graham drop off. Since it's not out yet I had to hunt around for a description and in the ones I found they mention brown sugar and while I don't exactly taste brown sugar it is lightly sweet with a nice deep flavour to it but I didn't get that syrupy brown sugar taste from it like I'd expect. Easily one of my new favorite lemon flavours this one is a winner in my book! ---- I've yet to try something from DripSocial that I don't like, they've got the formula down for making good juice and they've got an amazing team to make it work. I really can't recommend them enough and Lemon Grahams is a fantastic new addition to their lineup and one of my new favorite lemon flavours. If you haven't tried them yet they definitely get my recommendation and DripSocial if you happen to be reading this, thanks so much for setting me up with Lemon Grahams, it's fantastic!!"
95,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,I think I have to quit,2,6rbw09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6rbw09/i_think_i_have_to_quit/,2017-08-03 22:17:31,"Good Morning/Afternoon if you are reading this. well the day has come where I may have to quit vaping. I'm super low on funds and the budget i have created doesn't even have the ability to fit juice. Wife and I are scrounging for money and only able to spend on necessities. I've had to sell a bunch of old stuff from my childhood just to keep us afloat. This is not a chartiy post so let's keep it happy! The only functional equipment i have left is a gx-350 with one set of 4 batteries +TFV8 (not using that not to save juice capacity) a half functioning Grpiv + Tsunami 24 and a Tsunami mech mod (which i don't really know how to build coils so the replaceable ones i'm using are doing okay.) once all the remaining drops of juice per bottle and these 4 60ml's of garbage juice run out. I am out and that is when i will quit vaping. It has been a great run from everyone, Thank you all for being great friends to me here and at CVE this past year! Hope to run into you all again!

96,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Battlestar RDA from Smoant,13,6rcpy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6rcpy6/honest_review_time_battlestar_rda_from_smoant/,2017-08-04 00:40:10,"Hey guys, Just after I dropped the [review of the Smoant Battlestar](URL the amazing folks over at Smoant reached out about a review of some of their other products. Having been a fan since [the Knight v2](URL I was more then happy to oblige. One of the things they sent over for review was the Battlestar RDA, I'm guessing it was meant to be a companion to the Battlestar Mod. It looks like it's made for a nice balance between flavour and clouds and I have been enjoying it quite a bit over the past couple weeks. Here are my honest thoughts on the Battlestar RDA from Smoant. **Package contents:** 1* Battlestar RDA 1* Screwdriver 4* Screws 4* Spare silicone o-rings **Listed features:** 1) Size: 24mm (Diameters) *22mm (Height) 2) Wide and deep deck, able to keep more liquid. 3) Bottom narrow and upper wide design to have more space. 4) 4 holes for coil 5) 2.5mm square design for coil hole, available for more pattern coil. 6) Dual Air flow with side oblique design to enforce the air direct towards the coil and enhance the flavour. 7) Ultem drip tip with heat resistant and prevent from lip gunk. 8) Black, purple, Stainless Steel, Brass color available. Here's a link to [a full album of pics](URL *Please note, there's always a chance I missed something or forgot something from my notes, please don't hesitate to ask questions or point out anything I may have missed! ---- ##Packaging and contents: The Battlestar RDA comes packed in [a little black box](URL with a sleeve sporting the typical Smoant colours of black and yellow. [The front of the box](URL bears an image of the RDA while [the back](URL has very little information and an authenticity check. On one of the sides it shows [the available colours](URL mine was the black version. [Inside the box](URL the rda is protected by a thick sponge insert and comes with just [a bag of spares](URL a QC card and nothing else. In the spares bag you get 4x orings, 4x grub screws and a little blue screwdriver. Not a whole lot in the box but everything you'd need to get started. ##The RDA: [The Battlestar RDA](URL is 24mm in diameter, just 22mm tall and feels very well made. At the top of the RDA is [an ultem wide bore 810 drip tip](URL The kit doesn't include any type of adapter so you'll be stuck using the included drip tip unless you have an adapter or 810 drip tip of your own. It's not really a complaint for me as I love 810 tips and have a decent selection of them to chose from but for others it might be an issue so I'll list it. The included tip has [a fairly deep groove cut in to it](URL to help it stay in place but unfortunately it actually causes the drip tip to sit loose in the top cap. It was loose enough I didn't want to use it so I swapped it out for [a beautiful VapeStash tip](URL I picked up at CVE. Oddly enough the included tip fits better in other 810 caps that I tried it on. I think it's that deep groove cut in to it that causes it to wobble. [The top cap of the RDA](URL has two airflow slots cut in to it, one on each side. They're shaped like trapezoids and are used as the airflow control on the cap by turning it to close off each slot. Since the top cap is one piece and only has two slots it's going to be dual coil only as no single coil adapter was included in the kit. I'm fine with this and actually prefer when an atty is dedicated dual or single and doesn't try to do both. For me at full open I get the perfect amount of resistance for a slightly restricted direct lung hit which is what I prefer. The cap also has a bit of styling with two eyes sort of cut in to the cap. They don't go all the way through, they're just for decoration and for a bit of a 'face' on the side of the cap. I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of the eyes but it's not like they affect the way it performs. On the very bottom of the rda is [a bit of branding](URL and [a gold plated 510 center pin](URL that protrudes enough that it would be safe to use with a hybrid. ##The Deck: [The deck on this thing is stunning](URL It's gold plated and reminiscent of something like the Twisted Messes v2 being a two post four hole affair but with wide 2.5mm square holes. It'll make mounting some thick wire builds a snap. The four post holes are all in a line without any offset so you'll need to bend your leads to make everything sit straight. I liked that the four holes provide various mounting options depending on how wide your coil is. I decided to pop in some fresh [Campbell coils](URL a beautiful set of [Framed staple coils](URL that I got from our very own /u/pornplaysmusic while at CVE and used just the two middle holes with my leads stacked and they went in smoothly without any issues. But if I had some wider coils I could chose to use the outer holes or a combination of the two. I think my one complaint about the deck is [the included flat head grub screws](URL I'd much prefer hex or even Phillips head grubs but as it stands the included flat heads worked fine, I just imagine they'll wear out quicker then other options would. On the base of the rda is [the side oblique airflow](URL basically there are two angled airflow grooves cut in to the sides of the base to match up with the slots on the top cap, this allows the air to come in low at an angle, hitting your coils from below for better coverage very similar to the Hobo Drifter rda. It's got a nice deep juice well and with the two post setup it's got a little spot between the posts so dripping down the top cap works well. Wicking this thing is just like any rda, [cut your wicks to length](URL and [tuck them down to the deck](URL **Likes:** *Gorgeous gold plated deck *Build quality(not including the tip) *Angled airflow *Good amount of airflow and great flavour *Easy to build and wick **Dislikes:** *Loose fitting wobbly drip tip *No drip tip adapter *Silly eyes on top cap *Flat head grubs ##Overall: I've got to say I quite enjoy using the Battlestar RDA. It incorporates some great features we've seen on other popular rdas and performs about as I'd expect. It's easy to work with and produces great flavour and vapour, depending on your build of course. The complaints I had with it are minor in comparison to the benefits it has and with the right setup, looks pretty nice. So as always the big questions: **Will I keep using this thing?** Absolutely, it's been a pleasure to work on and vape on and I don't seen any reason to retire it from my regular rotation. **Would I recommend this thing?** For the small complaints I had with it, I'd have no trouble recommending it to someone looking for a good easy to use dual coil rda. Also wanted to say thanks to /u/Smoant_Official for sending this little beauty along, I've really been enjoying it!!"
97,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Laflche from PGVG Labs,7,6rl0d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6rl0d1/honest_review_time_laflèche_from_pgvg_labs/,2017-08-05 01:00:06,"Hey guys, Among the many people I was looking forward to seeing at CVE Toronto was a gentleman by the name of Yan Laflche. Some of you might be familiar with him and his line or from Moonshiner Industries. I did a review of their stuff a while back and since then it appears Yan has branched off with his own signature line called simply Laflche now being produced by PGVG Labs. I'd actually had the chance to review one of the flavours along with the Moonshiner line but the new line has grown considerably since then. This one might be a bit gushy as Yans entire line is among some of my favorite liquids out there. The man is truly a talented mixologist. Here are my honest thoughts on [Laflche from PGVG Labs](URL The liquids used to come in 30ml glass bottles but like many lines has grown up and now comes in clear 60ml chubby gorilla style bottles. The labels are dark and have an old school gangster theme to go along with the flavour names. They look clean and classy with a red metallic sheen on some of the lettering. The line is 70vg and the set I got were in 0mg. Here's [a shot of the badass bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Cuzzin Vinny](URL **(9.5/10)** (Fresh out of the oven, warm melted white chocolate macadamia nut cookie.) Cuzzin Vinny is the newest addition to the line and if you ask me it fits right in with the others. Just like the description it's a rich white chocolate macadamia nut cookie flavour and it's really damn good. Up front I get a thick creamy white chocolate followed by a light but distinct macadamia nut all over top of a nice buttery cookie flavour. It's rich and smooth but still somewhat light like the namesake cookie tends to be. In some regards it reminds me a bit of a creamy white hot chocolate I get in my office once in a while that I've dipped a nutty biscotti in to. Surprisingly it isn't the first white chocolate macadamia nut cookie I've reviewed but I'd say it's even more authentic then my current favorite, if you Get my drift. Rich but light this one is all day material for me and it's been going incredibly fast. **[Don Pistacchio](URL **(9.5/10)** (Gently blended caramelized tobacco drizzled in a pistachio creme.) I honestly didn't realize this had tobacco in it until I read the description but after reading it what I've been tasting all along makes sense. I get a roasted pistachio flavour with a deep savory taste to it which I realized after was the caramelized tobacco. It gives it such a rich dark flavour without really tasting like tobacco, just sort of adding to the savory nature of the roasted pistachio nuts. It's a bit like a sweet dry Virginia type tobacco and it's really smooth too, the pistachio creme gives it a thick creamy quality that just coats your mouth with a sweet nutty savory flavour and dark notes of sweet caramel. I'm pretty sure this will go over well even with folks who aren't fans of tobaccos as it manages to find a good balance between a light savory tobacco and a sweet nutty cream. Despite the tobacco the pistachio still manages to be the center of attention coming out as the more dominant flavour in the mix. As a fan of both tobacco and nutty flavours, this one is just fantastic! **[Stugats](URL **(9.5/10)** (An exquisite blend of rich and mixed nuts.) I've reviewed this before and my opinion on it hasn't changed, in fact I think I've grown even more fond of it since then. It's a super decadent mix of nuts with a really deep roasted taste to it. I taste toasted peanuts, maybe some pistachio and hazelnut. The exact blend is a bit obscure but whatever it is, it's an incredible mix that works really well together. It's got a thick sort of creamy feel to it that makes the whole thing smooth and rich. It's probably my favorite creamy nut sort of flavour out there and goes really well with a morning coffee but is just as enjoyable anytime of day. Fans of nutty flavours will definitely want to check this one out especially if you like them rich and full. At it's core it's a fairly simple mixed nut flavour but boy does it check all of the boxes for me. ---- There's actually one more flavour from Laflche based on a canolli but I believe it's undergoing a rework for either the label or possibly the flavour. I've tried it already and I can assure you it's just as good if not better then the others. If I get the chance I'll drop a review for that as well in the future. If you haven't picked up on the vibe yet, I'm a huge fan of the Laflche line and really can't recommend them enough, especially for fans of rich nutty flavours as all of the flavours in the line seem to fit that description perfectly. Seriously do yourself a favour and check these out!! And Yan if you happen to read this, you sir are an incredible talent and I for one really appreciate what you've created with this line. Thank you so much for setting me up with them, they're honestly some of my favorite flavours out there!! edit: pic link"

99,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: GRP and MNG from Theory Labs,12,6se1dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6se1dm/honest_review_time_grp_and_mng_from_theory_labs/,2017-08-09 01:01:23,"Hey guys, I stopped by the Theory Labs booth while I was at CVE Toronto and met with one of the incredible folks behind their team. He was kind enough to furnish me with a new flavour they were releasing as well as one that I believe was released at CVE Edmonton. While the two flavours might be classified as simple or uncomplicated I've got to say that both are quite well done but needless to say this one might be a bit brief. Here are my honest thoughts on MNG and GRP from [Theory Labs](URL Both flavours come in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottles with fairly simple but colourful labels, each sporting it's name in white lettering across the front. The names are actually abbreviations for the flavours they represent. The line comes in 80vg and the set I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the two colourful bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description for MNG from site in brackets, no link or description for GRP yet. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[MNG](URL **(9/10)** (A delicious, fresh ripe juicy mango.) MNG short for Mango was the first flavour released in this line. Somehow I had missed it until this last expo but was quite happy to recently be handed a bottle. It's essentially a really fresh, juicy tasting mango flavour and that's about it. Don't get me wrong it might be simple in it's description but the flavour is fantastic. Imagine a fresh squeezed mango juice and that's pretty much what this one tastes like. I don't pick up any hints of peach or orange or anything like that, which seem the common additions in mango flavours these days. Instead it's just a straight up sweet and tangy recreation of the real thing and it's pretty much spot on. To me real mango has a nice thick tropical taste to it and MNG does a great job of recreating that thick pulpy mouth feel you get from the juice or the fruit. It's lightly sweet and has that familiar tartness like the real fruit has. All in all MNG is just a really nice refreshing tropical fruit flavour, uncomplicated and delicious!! **GRP** **(8/10)** (grape!) GRP if you haven't figured it out yet is short for grape and GRP is basically just that, a sweet purple grape flavour. While I was kind of hoping for a really authentic tasting natural grape flavour GRP delivers something a little bit different. It reminds me a lot of a purple sucker or lollipop, sweet, sort of syrupy and fairly artificial. It too has a simplicity to it but that doesn't mean it's a simple flavour. I've tasted countless grape flavours and many of them have a sickly medicine sort of taste or an odd dry artificial chemical taste. GRP has none of that. Sure it tastes like an artificial grape flavour but for me it doesn't have any of those unwanted characteristics. Instead, it tastes just like I've been sucking on a grape flavoured sucker and it couldn't get any more uncomplicated. Like a trip down memory lane back when grape was still the best flavoured lollipop MNG does grape and it does it well. Fans of grape flavours will definitely appreciate this one! ---- Overall for two straightforward flavours I've got to give Theory Labs some serious credit, they've managed to do both really well. Not everyone out there craves complex flavours, sometimes the classics are all we need and it's nice to see Theory Labs deliver. We still need companies that produce good flavours that don't alienate users with overly elaborate flavour descriptions and equally complex profiles. If you're looking for a good grape or mango flavour Theory Labs definitely gets my recommendation. And Farouk or Peter if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with some of your juice, you gentlemen make some incredible juice!!"
100,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Revival Vapor,13,6sm6ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6sm6ph/honest_review_time_revival_vapor/,2017-08-10 01:24:12,"Hey guys, Just before CVE Toronto a relatively new company called Revival out of Toronto reached out to me about a review. However it wasn't until CVE that I actually had a chance to pick up their juice. I met with one of their team very briefly but they set me up with a couple of their flavours and already I'm quite impressed with their stuff. Here are my honest thoughts on [Revival Vapor](URL Their line is comprised of three flavours but for some reason I only got two of them. They both come in clear chubby gorilla styled 60ml bottles. The labels are dark and sophisticated looking with a very modest amount of styling on them. I think they look fantastic! The line is 75vg and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the sharp looking bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Strike](URL **(9/10)** (A sweet and juicy mango that delivers a full and rich tropical experience.) I just dropped a review yesterday of a juice with a very similar flavour profile. It's basically a straight mango flavour but this one is ever so slightly different then the one from yesterday. Where the other had a distinct tartness, this one has a distinct tang. And like the one from yesterday it tastes just like a fresh squeezed glass of mango juice. I don't want to turn this in to a comparison so I'll just leave it there. Strike comes off super smooth, almost creamy with that nice thick mouth feel I often associate with mango flavours. Not only does Strike have a nice tang to it it's also fairly sweet. It doesn't taste sweetened mind you but it definitely has a sweeter edge along with that tangy mango taste. I almost want to say that there is some peach flavour in Strike as I pick up little elements which remind me of fuzzy peach but obviously with more of a mango focus instead of peach. Whether there is peach in it or not, it's a really nice representation of mango and I've been enjoying it quite a lot. I love tropical flavours like this, especially around this time of year so it's really nice to have some tasty options like this around. **[Core](URL **(9.5/10)** (Succulent guava bathed in drops of sweet nectar culminating in a rich explosion of flavours.) Core has a similar vibe to Strike but with a very different flavour profile. It too is a tropical tasting blend but instead of mango it focuses on guava and some other mystery fruits. It starts off with a nice light taste of guava or guava candy having a sweet almost cactus sort of taste, it's lightly sweet and a touch tart from the guava but it's followed by what tastes like soft apple or pear. I get a white flesh fruit sort of taste that's clean and light tasting. There's also something in it that gives it an almost floral taste but doesn't quite taste like flowers, possibly from the guava or the nectar but I'm not sure what else is in there. This one I've hardly put down since I picked it up, there's just something about it that I find really addictive. Super smooth and clean tasting Core definitely has all day potential for me and it's already made it through a day at work with me. Seriously, this stuff is heavenly!! ---- For a new company I've got to say Revival is killing it with these fruity flavours. Although I only tried two of the three I'm pretty sure it's safe to say the entire line will be fantastic. If you haven't heard of Revival before you're not alone, but I'd say they're well worth checking out. And Victor if you happen to be reading this, thanks for setting me up with these tasty tropical flavours, I really enjoyed them both!!"
101,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,[Question] BestGlycol Flavours??,1,6spwyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6spwyq/question_bestglycol_flavours/,2017-08-10 10:58:11,"So I went to the recent CVE and towards the end of the day I went around looking for concentrate booths. I came across a company called BestGlycol and ended up buying 4x30ml concentrate flavours at $5 a pop. The thing that drew me towards trying these is that they are pretty [colourful](URL (minus the clear one :P) Just now had the time to think about mixing something up. I went on to ELR and there is two out of the four flavours with recipes and it is one guy who just did single flavour mixes, only one has a description and it wasn't that great. I was told at the booth that they are extremely concentrated but that's about it. Only one thread from a year ago shows two people from here tried and had no success and one person suggesting they probably have alcohol and to let them breathe 48-72 hours. Just wanted to know if anyone else on here has tried this company and what they thought. Also I did a search on r/DIY_ejuice and found nothing there so I figured here might be a better shot seeing as how they are Montreal based and only ship to Canada. I'm kinda bummed out too because they sell these flavours on their site for $4/30ml (YES, cheaper than what I paid!) and $6/60ml, that's $1 more for another 30ml compared to what I paid! Like what? I'm so confused by this company and just hoping I can at least do something with these."
102,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Dr. Death's Juice Shop,10,6stx5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6stx5f/honest_review_time_dr_deaths_juice_shop/,2017-08-11 01:09:22,"Hey guys, Here's something that's local to me, in fact the gentleman who runs the company is from Hamilton, the city I'm from, Hammertown represent!! It's a juice line that's sold in a number of shops in my area so it's a bit of a wonder it's taken me this long to get my hands on some. Well Ed the man behind the line hit me up before CVE and set me up with a set of samples when I met with him at the expo. You might actually know him from vapers.tv where he does a regular show. Really great guy and his juice line is pretty darn good too! Here are my honest thoughts on Dr. Death's juice shop. The juice came in 30ml old school unicorn bottles. Personally I like these bottles, they're a lot easier to carry then the 60ml bottles that seem to be the norm these day and they make less of a mess. The labels however look like Halloween, they've got an orange background and some black splattered Halloween type of imagery over top. I guess it kind of goes with the name Dr. Death but some might think it's just a bit morbid for something that's supposed to be a lifesaving healthier alternative. The line comes in a 70vg blend and the set I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Blueburied Cheesecake](URL **(7/10)** (Blueberry Cheesecake) Blueburied Cheesecake if you haven't guessed is a blueberry cheesecake flavour which for me starts of with a light somewhat realistic blueberry upfront with a gentle graham cracker crust flavour under it. I don't get much sense of the actual cheesecake except maybe on the aftertaste where I get a lingering hint of actual blueberry cheesecake but while vaping it, it's mostly blueberry and graham. That aftertaste though is fantastic I just wish I got more of it upfront. It's not too sweet or anything but I do get a slight dry taste from it. The whole thing is fairly light considering it's representing a rich cheesecake flavour and I don't really get much cream or cheese out of it. Overall I'd say it's pleasant but felt like it could use just a bit more cheese in the cake. **[Key Lime Die](URL **(7.5/10)** (Key Lime Lemonade) You guys know how I feel about most lime flavours, they tend to have an odd waxy taste that I just can't get past. While this one does have a slight and I men slight hint of that waxy taste, I've got to admit Key Lime Die is pretty decent for a lime flavour. It's got a nice bright key lime flavour to it that's a bit tart and a bit tangy. No crust or anything as this one is a lime lemonade and not a pie like we often see. One thing I liked about it was the hint of bitterness I get from it, almost like the bitterness you get from the rind of a citrus fruit, it really adds to the realness of the flavour. It also has a nice sweetness to it but it's not sugary or overly sweet at all. It reminds me quite a bit of green Freshie or Limeade. Nice and bright and refreshing and for a guy who normally doesn't like lime flavours this one stood out from the line. **[Strawberry Scream](URL **(6/10)** (Strawberry Campino) Here's another flavour that doesn't often fair well by me. Mostly for the fact that strawberry cream flavours are a dime a dozen and not many among them really stand out. For me Strawberry Scream is a pretty typical strawberry cream, light on the sweetness and with a slightly dry taste to it. I often attribute that dry taste to whipped cream but this doesn't have a very creamy feel to it either. The strawberry which is rather light leans towards a realistic strawberry and I don't get a whole lot of cream which is sort of crucial in a Campino flavour. For me this leaned more towards a strawberry milk flavour since it didn't really have that thick almost buttery creaminess I associate with a creamy Campino. Oddly enough I found after it had been sitting in my dripper for a while it tasted it a bit better but still wasn't really something for me. **[Sugar Skulls](URL **(8/10)** (Sugar Cookie) This was hands down my favorite from the line and it's exactly how I like my all day vapes to be. Light on flavour but still well rounded, the kind of flavour that tends to leave you wanting more. From Sugar Skulls I get a light, sweet sugar cookie. Not an Italian cinnamon sugar cookie like we often see but more like a classic buttery icing covered sugar cookie. The kind you decorate with your kids around Christmas or Halloween or whenever really. I also get a hint of something like coconut, it's a bit fleeting but I swear I taste something almost fruity like that in there. Of the line, this one had the most staying power with me and just hits the proverbial spots. ---- Overall I've got to say Dr. Death's are a solid option, sure none of them really blew my mind but I didn't dislike any of them either. They all taste well made and I like the fact that they go easy on the sweetener. In speaking with Ed he mentioned that they're lab made by a reputable company so I don't have any concerns there either. So if you're in the area or want to check them out online I'd say they're well worth checking out. And Ed if you happen to read this, thank you sir for setting me up with these, you make some good stuff!!"
103,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Canel from Odis Design,7,6tupex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6tupex/honest_review_time_canelé_from_odis_design/,2017-08-16 01:09:30,"Hey guys, Most of us have heard of Odis design, they're the Canadian company that brought us the O-Atty and O-Genny and more recently the O-Atty 2 as well a number of high-end accessories and gear. Well it looks like they've jumped in to the ejuice market as well now having launched a new liquid at CVE Toronto. They teamed up with the DripSocial team for the event and once again DripSocial were kind enough to set me up with a sample of this delectable liquid. This one is a bit on the rich side but coming from Odis, I'm not all that surprised. Here are my honest thoughts on Canel from Odis Design. The sample I got came wrapped in a brown paper bag with a nice flavour card attached by some golden string. The juice itself comes in a clear 30ml glass bottle with a fairly modest label sporting a paisley background and the name Canel in cursive across the front. It's interesting how I've become so used to 60ml chubby bottles that a 30ml glass almost felt odd to me but Odis did a great job giving it a clean sophisticated look. The juice is max vg and the bottle I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bag](URL it came in and [a shot of the bottle and flavour card](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. I'd love to say I also tested it out in an O-Atty but hate to admit I don't own an authentic. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Basic description in brackets but no link yet. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Canel** **(9.5/10)** (A classic and delicate French pastry that delivers satisfaction for all lovers of rich and sweet desserts."" A Canel is a traditional French pastry made with vanilla and rum in the batter. It has a delicious custard filling and a thick caramelized crust.) During the expo I stopped by the Odis/DripSocial booth to check out some of the new things they were launching. I inquired about the new Canel flavour and was offered a tiny little sort of bell shaped sweet treat. I had never seen or tried anything like it before, it looked like a teeny tiny custard that was a touch overcooked, sort of like [this](URL Ok so it looked a bit odd and I was a bit hesitant to eat it but after popping it in my mouth I'll admit it was one of the most amazing treats I've ever eaten and is the name sake of the new flavour. So what does the juice taste like? Well it's a mix of light pastry, creamy vanilla custard, a hint of spice and a sweet caramelized brown sugar. The custard is light and smooth, not too eggy and more focused on the vanilla. I don't really taste any rum in the mix as the description suggests and I'd say it's not so much of a pastry as it is a custard flavour with a very delicate cinnamon or bakers spice to it. The caramelized brown sugar gives it a really sweet taste which sort of hits you in the back of the mouth coating it with a nice sugary taste. The sweetness and that bit of spice in it reminds me quite a bit of a particular cake flavour from MEO and has a similar effect on my coils and cotton but I ain't even mad. Canel definitely falls on the sweet side of things but it's meant to be a sweet custardy pastry so I'd say it's pretty accurate and for fans of sweet dessert flavours this is going to be one worth checking out. ---- Like most things from Odis design, I'd say Canel is a work of art. Sure it won't be for everyone with it's borderline excessive sweetness and even for me this one will be an occasional treat as opposed to a regular vape but oh man is it incredible! I haven't seen the listed price yet but if this is something that interests you and it's reasonably priced, I'd say it's well worth trying at least once. And to the folks from Odis as well as the DripSocial team, thanks so much for setting me up with this masterpiece!!"
104,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,"[Review] Vapor Junkie - Moon Mist, Seventeen, Rock Hard",9,6txu2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6txu2x/review_vapor_junkie_moon_mist_seventeen_rock_hard/,2017-08-16 08:46:04,"A couple of weeks ago I took advantage of [Vapor Junkie](URL post-CVE sale and ordered three flavors. I was pumped for Rock Hard after reading some earlier reviews, but to round out my order I got Moon Mist and Seventeen, too, the latter of which being a suggestion from someone else and not typically a profile I'd go for. They're all Max VG and I got them in 60mL and 3mg. All use CG bottles and have full-height labels. I actually quite like the labels: conveys all the necessary info while still being visually appealing. I vaped all three on a Hadaly at 40W with a 0.5ohm fused clapton on a Cuboid 150. Airflow wide open and DTL. **Rock Hard** - 7/10 Of all three, I was most pumped for RH but it ended up being my least favorite. On the nose it's a delightfully sweet and sometimes sour medley of fruity notes. Definitely smells like candy, so the description fits, but I found in tasting it that it was pretty far from how it smells, mostly in strength. It's still sweet and a touch sour, I definitely get some peach and a light kiwi note. A candy version of both which also fits the description, but it doesn't have that ""oomph"" the smell had. It's very true to its description: candy-fruit notes with a backing of sweetness, it just doesn't jump out to me as a particularly strong flavor. It's a medium-strength flavor: it could be stronger (for my tastes, anyways), but it's not super light as to get boring after a couple mL. Overall it's satisfying flavor; the taste agrees with me, just an extra punch would go an extra mile for me personally. If you have a sweet tooth, this should be on your radar for sure. **Moon Mist** - 8.5/10 Before ordering this I had no idea what Moon Mist was. Apparently it's an ice-cream mix of bubblegum, banana, and grape. Had I known what it was I'd have probably passed (generally not a fan of grape nor banana) but this flavor is immediately impressive, at least for subverting my expectations and being a standout flavor incorporating two notes I don't tend to enjoy. Right off the bat the banana is different from all I've tried before: it's more akin to a banana chip type banana than straight banana (which often taste like banana marshmallows). The banana is front and center with the sweet bubblegum mostly on the exhale. Grape is maybe hidden in here, I don't really detect it beyond a tannic whisper here and there. When I do get grape, it complements the rest really well, mostly mixing with the bubblegum to exacerbate the sharp sweetness of it. Overall this flavor is incredible for what it is: it's exactly what it needed to be and nothing more. Having not had the ice cream before, I can't tell if it's authentic or not (some Nova Scotian chime in please), but it seems like it fits perfectly. The flavor isn't super sweet and is very gentle on the coils and wick but I'll get on this later. The flavor strength is on point: it doesn't overwhelm but it's also not light at all, it's full flavored and I appreciate the blast of flavor it gives. **Seventeen** - 9.5/10 I don't generally like flavors that have ""rum"" in the description, but I get less of that than I do a rich sponge cake from Seventeen. It's got a delightful cream note and some caramel/brown sugar notes, maybe a little honey, too. It's as authentic as you can get to a sponge cake and it has a strong, potent flavor that lingers. If the flavor wasn't as stellar as it is I'd say it was a little too strong but honestly I can't get enough of this stuff. It's sweet and rich, pretty much perfect for any time of day. Once I finished with Seventeen and loaded up Moon Mist, I got a touch of banana bread for the first couple refills (I didn't rewick beforehand) which was a neat little bonus and got me to the idea that Seventeen would pair well with other notes as a baseline. I could see carrot complementing it well, maybe even apple to get an apple cake like taste. I feel like Seventeen would be versatile as a foundation for other flavors since it's a great replication of sponge cake. Again it was easy on the coils, just like the other two were. Seventeen is a satisfying cake flavor, something that's definitely ADV material. **Misc Thoughts** As I mentioned a couple of times, these were very gentle on the wicks and coil. I went through 55mL or so of Seventeen, 35mL or so of Moon Mist, and 15mL or so of Rock Hard without changing wicks beforehand and my wick is still going strong. It's tinged a little brown but still gives a satisfying vape. Coils are basically free of gunk, which is surprising since these flavors were all fairly sweet. Major kudos on accomplishing this feat! Shipping was very fast. I moved on the 1st and let them know via Facebook that if it wasn't going to arrive by then to have it shipped to my new address. It ended up getting there one day after shipping and a day before I moved in. It was nice to have a little box of goodies for me to dig into while I unpacked. I will say that I ordered two 60mLs of Rock Hard and only received one. I got in touch with VJ on August 1st through Facebook, sent an e-mail on August 4th, and then another Facebook message on August 12th; none of them getting a response (although I did get read receipts within 24hr). I'll cut them some slack: they probably had a very popular post-CVE sale, coupled with just getting off of CVE too, plus I have ample juice on hand already, but hopefully I hear from them soon. Overall I was very impressed with the small selection of VJ juices I had. I paid just under $70 for four (I guess three technically) 60mLs and they arrived fast. The flavors I chose complemented each other very well and of all three, Seventeen is a standout for me personally. If anyone was on the fence, their flavors are quite delicious and I totally suggest them."

It's a new release from the boys at VanGo vapes that I was happy to pick up at CVE Edmonton. From all of my past experiences with VanGo I've got to say this is pretty different from their other stuff and something that's just perfect for the warmer weather of summer. Here are my honest thoughts on [Canctus Jango](URL from VanGo Vapes. The juice comes in a clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottle with a mostly black label featuring a bevy of fruit and the name in bold colourful letters on the front. All of the usual good stuff we like to see in fine print along the sides. I believe the juice is a 70vg blend and the bottle I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the dark coloured bottle](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Cactus Jango](URL **(10/10)** (A throwback to our Cactus Jango from our classic line, we played with the flavours and made an even better flavour! It is a tropical medley of jackfruit and mango with hints of lychee, strawberry and cactus fruit.) I never tried their classic line or the original Cactus Jango but boy was I happy to get a hold of this. It's an absolutely wonderful juice that's jam packed with bright tropical flavour. Upfront I mainly get the very fresh taste of mango, it's so realistic it has that thick almost pulpy sort of taste I associate with the fresh tropical fruit. The mango pairs beautifully with the taste of Jackfruit which comes out somewhere in the middle for me. Jackfruit if you've never tried it is an exotic fruit that hails from Asia, I believe it's the largest tree-born fruit in the world and it's covered in a tough spiky exterior much like the famed Durian fruit. However it's got a very different texture and taste, not to mention smell. It's reminiscent of apple or pear and soft banana with a very slight tropical tart taste many compare to pineapple. It's a meaty fruit that's often a part of many Asian desserts and I found it adds a nice mild fruity mid note to the flavour. On the tail end is where I pick up the notes of cactus which gives it a sort of green botanical almost floral quality which really adds to the freshness of the flavour. I don't really pick up the strawberry on it's own but I assume it's in there adding to the sweetness of the flavour while the lychee just barely comes through but pairs well with the cactus and just adds to the slightly sweet tartness of it all. Altogether it's an incredible blend that lingers on the tongue leaving a wonderful fresh taste like I just had a sip of a delicious tropical mango cocktail. ---- I honestly can't say enough good things about VanGo and the gents who run the company. Just some of the nicest and clearly talented guys you'll meet in the business and always a welcome stop for me at any convention. I've got to say that Cactus Jango is one of the best things I've tried from them yet. So if you're in to tropical flavours and you've yet to give VanGo a try I highly recommend you do, they've literally got something for everyone! And to the amazing gents from VanGo, thank you guys once again, I always appreciate your stuff!! "
106,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Cookie Monster by Classic Ejuice,13,6iu6rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6iu6rb/honest_review_time_cookie_monster_by_classic/,2017-06-23 01:24:04,"Hey guys, When I was at CVE Edmonton I had the chance to speak with the good folks from [Classic Ejuice](URL They've got some really amazing stuff and after sampling a number of their liquids and being quite impressed they set me up with a few juices to review and I have to say they're some of my favorite things that I brought home from the expo. The set I'm reviewing today is two flavours from a line called Cookie Monster. Now I've been a fan of dessert flavours since I started vaping and cookies have always been a favorite for me, well I'm thrilled to say I've just added two more to my list of favs. Here are my honest thoughts on [Cookie Monster from Classic Ejuice](URL The two flavours come in nice cardboard boxes with a monster creeping out of the dark while inside are great big 100ml clear Chubby Gorilla style bottles with bright colourful labels that continue the theme of the boxes. They have a sort of fun and playful look to them which works with the name. Both liquids are 70vg blends and the ones i got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the boxes](URL and [the bottles I picked up](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Dragon Fruit](URL **(9.5/10)** (Prepare yourself for this creamy exotic dragon fruit graham cookie that will haunt your dreams for more!) Wait what? A Dragon Fruit cookie?! I know it sounds a bit odd but believe me this combination works and it works incredibly well. I can't even imagine the thinking process involved when this was created as it sounds like something that would never go together. But here they are, a delightful fresh sweet creamy dragon fruit flavour swirled together with an equally delightful graham cookie that just marries together perfectly. It's rich and creamy like a cookie should be but with the added touch of dragon fruit it's nice, creamy and fresh tasting as well. I remember trying this at the expo and having one of those moments when you try something entirely new for the first time, even then I wasn't too sure if I liked it but as I got to know it my god is it one of those things I never knew I needed in my life. The dragon fruit is a bit more upfront while the beautiful graham cookie settles in on the backend finishing it off just perfectly. It manages to satisfy both my fruity flavour cravings as well as my dessert flavour cravings at the same time. Easily an all day flavour for me and I imagine it would be for others too if they're daring enough to try this unique falvour combination. **[White Chocolate](URL **(10/10)** (This sugar cookie with a pinch of oatmeal is filled with irresistible melted white chocolate. It will give you GOOSEBUMPS!) I've tried a few other white chocolate cookie flavours and I've enjoyed most of them but I have to say this one might just be my new favorite! I've been vaping it for a week straight ever since I cracked it open and haven't gotten sick of it yet. It's an absolutely wonderful sweet creamy white chocolate cookie which reminds me an awful lot of a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie but without the nuts. It's got that yellow cookie taste, not just a simple sugar cookie or the golden brown cookie you get with chocolate chips but that yellow buttery cookie that surrounds the chips and nuts in a white chocolate macadamia cookie. I'm guessing it's that pinch of oatmeal that takes the typical sugar cookie flavour to the next level and then the whole thing is topped off with a super rich and creamy white chocolate that just sort of lingers on the tongue. I'm not sure if it's the white chocolate or the cookie but it has a nice underlying butteriness to it which I can't seem to get enough of. While it is a bit decadent and sweet this is one flavour I think any fan of cookie flavours will enjoy! ---- Overall I was extremely impressed by these two cookie flavours, the White Chocolate being my favorite of the two. Yeah I do tend to lean towards dessert flavours but I can't stress enough how well done these two flavours are. I actually picked up a couple other things from them as well and can't wait to get to those after the experience I had with these two. So if you haven't heard of Classic Ejuice before I'd highly recommend you check them out. They make some incredible stuff! And Classic if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with these beauties, I now have a new favorite cookie flavour!!"
107,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Wet E-Juice from VapeMall,10,6j2hvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6j2hvu/honest_review_time_wet_ejuice_from_vapemall/,2017-06-24 03:00:21,"Hey guys, Before I took off for CVE Edmonton [VapeMall](URL or /u/VapeMall made a brief appearance here on reddit to announce they'd be attending the convention with a couple of lines they distribute. If you haven't heard of them they are a Canadian Wholesale Distributor. I believe it was /u/evilklownz who pointed them in my direction and they very kindly offered up some samples for review if I were to stop by their booth, which I did of course. I'm not sure they actually knew who I was when I did but they were friendly enough and still set me up with samples. Here are my honest thoughts on Wet Ejuice from VapeMall. The juices come in bright orange 30ml glass bottles with matching orange dropper tops, the bottles aren't completely opaque so you can kind of see how much liquid you have left in them and if you ask me they just look really cool. The line is all 70vg and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL I picked up. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets, only wholesale links but a Google search should find them. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Dream](URL **(7/10)** (The dreamy flavour of a perfectly baked cinnamon roll with a Bavarian cream and vanilla swirl with a hint of caramel.) This was the one I was looking forward to the most but it didn't end up being my favorite from the line. It's a fairly standard cinnamon roll flavour with just a bit of a vanilla cream underneath. I don't really pick up much Bavarian cream, nor do I really get much caramel from it. The cinnamon is the strongest note in it and comes off kind of dry, like borderline pot pourri cinnamon stick kind of dry. It would probably be much more enjoyable for me if it didn't have that overlaying dryness to it. Even for a 70vg blend it felt a bit thin and definitely not sweet enough for my tastes considering it's meant to be a rich dessert flavour. If you like that dry cinnamon flavour and aren't a fan of sweeteners you might enjoy this one but for me it was pretty standard. **[Fresh](URL **(7.5/10)** (The freshest blend of exotic mango, papaya, and cantaloupe come together for the perfect mix of tropical fruit flavours.) Fresh is a mix of mango and papaya with just a hint of cantaloupe on the backend. The mango and papaya blend together in such as way as to become nearly homogeneous. It's a little bit tart, almost bitter which I'm guessing comes from the papaya or maybe the mango and the lack of any sweeteners. The cantaloupe just sort of adds a bit more complexity to it, sort of filling it out on the finish but not really popping out as an individual flavour. I found after vaping it for a while that it left a bit of a chemical aftertaste in my mouth, it wasn't unbearable but thought I should mention it. It definitely has a nice tropical taste to it and reminded me a bit of a blended fruit drink you might get on the beach of some fancy resort. Personally I would have liked it to be just a touch sweeter and filled out a bit more but as it stood it's a pretty nice flavour. **[All Day](URL **(7/10)** (A homey recipe of buttery graham cracker pie, filled with rich vanilla custard, topped with ripe raspberries.) This one starts with a rich creamy vanilla almost a whipped cream sort of thing with a somewhat powdery raspberry and just a very slight touch of a bakery taste. It kind of reminds me of another raspberry cream flavour I did a while back that tasted a lot like the filling from a raspberry passion flake but just a little bit different. This one is probably the sweetest of the bunch but even then it's not packed with sweeteners or anything. I did find that it had a slight floral almost perfumey quality to it from the raspberry but not enough to ruin it for me. I mainly get the raspberry and cream from this one but the buttery graham crust and rich vanilla custard are extremely light, nearly undetectable. Bottom line, it's mainly a raspberry and cream flavour for me. ---- One thing I noticed right away with all three flavours is there isn't much if any added sweeteners which I do appreciate but sometimes feel it's almost needed to really round out a flavour. Still I appreciate when a company makes efforts to not pound sugar in to their liquids and you can tell these were crafted as such. I know plenty of people who lean towards flavours just like these so if you're in to clean burning sweetener free flavours these would be worth checking out. And VapeMall if you happen to read this, thanks for setting me up with your juice, I really enjoyed trying them all out!!"

Sale is at the end of the post!** &amp;nbsp; I know it's been a while since I've given an update for The Vaporist! A lot of things have happened behind the scene! Everything is still not finished, but I am at a point where I can start presenting things :) &amp;nbsp; I feel like I am posting the release notes of a new software version! lol &amp;nbsp; So what's new? &amp;nbsp; **60ml/120ml bottles** I've decided to make the switch to 60/120ml chubby bottles only (besides the 10ml sampler pack). It was a hard decision to make, as it required some logistical changes, but I think it's worth it. The 60mls are normal chubbies, the 120mls are the same as BE (so no popping!) The reasoning behind the change was: * If properly stored, e-liquids can last 1+ year. * Tanks are guzzling more and more juice. * Simpler on the production end. * The 10ml sampler pack is still there to try the flavours. Pricing on the 60/120mls is 27.99$/52.99$. This is done to give me some leeway on sales/discounts (which are always occuring). &amp;nbsp; **New labels** With the new bottles come new labels! I've switched to 3x3 laminated labels! This means no more sticky labels! It adds an extra step for every label printed, but looks much better! All the High VG flavours have the new labels, while the high PG ones aren't all done. 60ml pic: URL 120ml pic: URL &amp;nbsp; **Coupon changes** No longer will you need to enter ""FREESHIP"" to get free shipping. Once your order qualifies for free shipping it will automatically be available in the shipping selection! &amp;nbsp; **Shipping Changes** I am bringing a few changes to the shipping structure and am finally offering shipping to the USA (yay)! These should not affect 90%+ of orders, as they are already above the threshold. The new Canadian shipping structure is as follows: * FREE SHIPPING on any order with 49.99$+ of E-liquid, **including Double Trouble**, excluding clearance liquids! * FREE SHIPPING on any order with a Starter Pack (even if less than 49.99$). * 5$ Discounted Shipping for any order with 1-49.98$ of E-liquid (NOT including Double Trouble or clearance liquids). * 10$ Ont/QC, 14$ rest of Canada for orders without any E-liquid. &amp;nbsp; For the USA, I had to take a different approach as the cost is ridiculous and I want signature/tracking for hardware: * FREE SHIPPING for E-liquid only orders of 60$+. * FREE SHIPPING for orders with 100$+ of E-liquid and any hardware. * Canada Post rates for orders with 50$ or less of hardware. * Xpresspost USA rate (with signature) for orders with 50$+ of hardware. &amp;nbsp; **New flavour(s)!** The new flavour should be released very shortly. I am waiting on some concentrates to begin production. I've been throwing hints right and left about it. Some people even got to try it ;) It's not a fruity flavour! I went out of my comfort zone and made myself a new ADV to replace my beloved TOLA (only took 2 years)! It should be released before CVE Toronto. You can also expect 1 more TVP Flavour in the lineup by then, and a 4th flavour for Bargain E-juice :) &amp;nbsp; **New hardware** I didn't have a chance to try everything that came in, but I got a few goodies in! * [Istick Pico &amp; Nautilus 2 Complete Starter Kit](URL This kit contains an Istick Pico, an Aspire Nautilus 2 tank, an HG LG2 or Samnsung 30Q battery (depending on availability) and 2x60mls. * [SXK Armor RDA](URL This RDA is an amazing flavour chaser!

109,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Mighell's Finest,8,6k1us7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6k1us7/honest_review_time_mighells_finest/,2017-06-29 02:51:04,"Hey guys, Recently a gentleman by the name of Miguel Guillemette reached out to me about a review of his juice line. If the name doesn't sound familiar, he's actually the man behind the original flavours from El Vaporo. I don't know a whole about that situation but I do know he makes some damn fine juice. This review is actually a sort of preview as they aren't officially being released until CVE Toronto next month. However I'm told they soft launched and should be available in select shops in Quebec, Montreal, Toronto and Windsor maybe as early as next week. Here are my honest thoughts on Mighell's Finest. I actually received a set of three flavours and an extra sort of standalone limited edition flavour. The set of three had dark coloured labels with just the image of a horned devil looking back at you. The standalone flavour had a similar theme sporting a devil but was much more colourful and also sported some images of fruit. I believe the liquids are all 66.6%vg(lol) and the ones I received were in 3mg. Here's a shot of [the set of three bottles](URL and [the one off bottle](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from Miguel in brackets, no links atm but a Google search might find them. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- ##Mighell's Finest **Lillith** **(9/10)** (A harmonious medley of tropical fruit that will bring you to a warm and happy place only to cool you off with a slight minty exhale that will leave you wanting more.) Lillith is a beautiful tropical fruit blend with just the perfect amount of mint on the exhale to really give it a nice fresh finish without actually turning into a minty menthol flavour. The fruit blend in it is a bit hard to distinguish but it's super tasty despite being just a bit obscure. To me it tastes like a blend of peach, mango, maybe some apricot and possibly a bit of strawberry for sweetness. Again it's kind of hard to tell but it definitely has a nice tropical vibe and that added bit of mint really does wonders for it, giving it a really nice fresh feel. I personally love that little minty addition, it does a lot for the flavour, giving it a tropical mojito-esque sort of taste. Of the four flavours sent two were tropical, this and No. 3 and I have to say I was hard pressed deciding which I liked best between the two. At the end of the day they're both fantastic with Lillith having a slightly more grown up and fresh flavour thanks to the mint. **Succubus** **(9/10)** (This enchantress has been Brought back from the underworld by popular demand, this strawberry and cream is like no other. This is the result of a year of hard work and dedication to make sure it would set a standard among it's peers.) You guys know how I feel about most strawberry and cream flavours, they're pretty much a dime a dozen so they really need to stand out for me to enjoy them. Well Succubus was actually a pleasant little surprise for me. It's a really nice mix of candy and fresh strawberry with a rich and creamy undertone. For me it's that creamy aspect that helps set it apart. It's nice and thick and it may even have a hint of yogurt in there as I tasted just a touch of that creamy sour taste I usually get with yogurt flavours. It's nice and sweet but not cloying, giving the strawberries an almost syrupy quality, like strawberries softened in sugar or a strawberry compote. Even though it's fairly sweet it has a nice fresh taste to it and it tended to linger on the lips in a rather satisfying way. I think the year long effort put in to this flavour has paid off cause even though I don't tend to reach for strawberry and cream flavours this one has been going pretty fast. **Bellial** **(9/10)** (Yourself morning cereal the way you like them. This bowl of flaky cereals has just the prefect balance of sugar, milk and heavy cream.) Bellial is a super rich, creamy corn flake cereal flavour that's a bit on the decadent side. The corn flavour is very forward, it's sweet and full and has a really nice toasted taste to it. It's so corny it reminds me just a bit of some popcorn flavours I've tried and even has a touch of that buttery quality they often have. Some of that butteriness could be coming from the heavy cream as it really does have a nice thick milky/creamy feel to it that just coats the whole thing. Having cream in there as opposed to just a bit of milk really thickens up the mix adding to that decadent side I was referring to. As rich as this one is, it's not so over the top that I can't vape it for long periods and in fact it's been coming with me to work and making it through the day. I can't say this one will be for everyone but cereal lovers who aren't stuck on Fruit Loops will likely enjoy the Mig-Hell out of this one as it really packs in that sweet corn flake cereal flavour. ##Sinfully Decadent **No. 3** **(10/10)** (Tropical fruit chewy gummies.) This one was my surprise favorite of the bunch, it's not often I rate a fruit flavour so high but this one just hit the proverbial spot. It's an absolutely wonderful mix of watermelon, pineapple, maybe some mango or even guava as it has a really nice almost green tartness to it that really makes it taste fresh. There's just a hint of citrus in it which also helps brighten it up and make it pop. It's described as a tropical fruit gummy but I don't actually taste much of a gummy taste, maybe a bit more of a candy taste but for me the gummy isn't really coming through. I wonder if it's the pineapple that adds it but it's quite well blended that it's a bit hard to tell. One thing I should mention is this is the standalone flavour and it's only available in limited quantity as in 1000 bottles of it were produced. I actually had a bottle of No. 2 and was sad to find out it was a limited run. While it does feel kind of cool and exclusive, when I fall in love with something I'd like to know that I can pick it up again when it runs out and this stuff I just don't want to run out of, it's that good. ---- That tag line of Sinfully Decadent couldn't be more accurate and I honestly can't say enough good things about this line. Every one of them was fantastic, well layered, full flavoured and delicious. Miguel has already proven his ability with the El Vaporo line and just reaffirms his talents with Mighell's Finest. Hopefully once CVE Toronto rolls around these will be more widely available. But if you have the chance to try them I'd highly recommend you do. And Miguel, if you happen to read this, you sir are an amazing talent!! Thanks for setting me up with your sinfully delicious juice!! Oh and if you're curious about what No. 2 was, it was a hazelnut(nuttela) ice cream cake and it's even better than it sounds!!"

111,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: 3 Baccos from PGVG Labs,11,6lmwlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6lmwlh/honest_review_time_3_baccos_from_pgvg_labs/,2017-07-07 02:30:04,"Hey guys, I really enjoy tobacco flavours so when I stopped by the PGVG labs booth at CVE Edmonton and saw they were launching a new tobacco line I was very excited so after I quickly tried them out I picked up the set of three specifically for this review. I've done a few other reviews of their stuff and have always enjoyed them, these tobacco flavours were no exception. Here are my honest thoughts on [3 Baccos from PGVG Labs](URL The set of three juices came in nice cardboard boxes with some really cool images of a bearded skull which sort of mimics the company logo. The juices themselves came in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottles with labels that mirror the boxes. The three flavours come in a 70vg blend and the ones I grabbed were all 3mg. Here's [a shot of the boxes](URL and [a shot of the bottles](URL One cool thing with the boxes is if you line them up the right way they [form a full image](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Bogota](URL **(9/10)** (Bogota is a prestige tobacco/cigar with a small touch of coffee from straight from Colombia. A perfect morning blend) The first one I reached for in the set was Bogota, I love rich complex tobacco blends so the addition of some Colombian coffee in this one really drew me in. It starts off with a very light clean tasting tobacco that's a bit on the sweet side, like it has an almost syrupy taste to it. It calms down a bit as you vape it though. The coffee addition is fairly subtle and light, not nearly as dark and complex as I had anticipated but like the description leans towards a smooth Columbian coffee. The flavour of the tobacco is sweet but light, almost more like a Brightleaf or Burley then a dark cured tobacco. For a darker tobacco blend I did find it a bit sweet but I imagine a lot of people just making their way in to tobacco flavours would probably appreciate that sweetness as it helps tone down the sometimes overbearing taste of a fresh tobacco. Personally I would have liked a touch more coffee in it but as it stands it's a really nice blend that could easily make for an all day vape. **[Manila](URL **(8.5/10)** (Manila is a well balanced and aromatic cigarillo featuring an Asian style vanilla.) This one has a distinctly darker tone to it, the tobacco leaning more towards a Corojo or maybe a Criollo tobacco, the kinds of dark tobacco you usually find in good Cuban cigars or cigarillos. Yet as much as the tobacco gives it a slightly darker feel the rather aromatic vanilla lightens it up a touch giving it an almost floral quality. That floral touch that the vanilla imparts calms down quite a bit though after the first few hits leaving you mostly with that sweet dark tobacco on the bottom end and lingering notes of bright vanilla. The whole thing is rather authentic tasting if not a bit on the sweet side which seems to come along with that vanilla. Again I could see this one going over very well especially with newer vapers just getting in to tobaccos who enjoy a good vanilla flavour as well. **[Havana](URL **(9.5/10)** (Havana is a tobacco/cigar with a hint of sweet tenderness. This juice will carry you in the clouds.) This one to me is pretty much a straight Habana tobacco flavour with maybe just a touch of something else in it. I kept picking up little fruity notes like sweet red apple or a similar yet mild fruit but couldn't nail anything down. This one too has a sweetness to it but not a sugary sweet, it's more like a nice dry sweet leaf Virginia tobacco sweetness that blends in perfectly with the darker tobacco notes. Back when I still smoked I would often enjoy a good cigar, usually when a friend returned from a trip to Cuba or something like that and since I started vaping I haven't found too many cigar flavours that really hit the spot. This one does just that with it's pretty much spot on recreation of a classic Cuban cigar and not much more. It's not too dark and not too sweet, just right as far as I'm concerned. After I cracked this one open I didn't set it down until it had a considerable dent in it! ---- All three flavours are well crafted and well layered, sure they were a touch sweet but I enjoyed them none the less. Tobacco flavours aren't an easy thing to pull off but they've managed to do it and do it well. I did find for cigar influenced flavours that all three were a touch on the lighter side but that might have been why they worked so well for me with at least two of them making for great all day vapes. So if you haven't given PGVG Labs a try I'd highly recommend you check them out and PGVG if you happen to be reading this, thanks for making some incredible juice!"
112,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Amour by VanGo Vapes,10,6mufsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6mufsu/honest_one_shot_amour_by_vango_vapes/,2017-07-13 00:55:07,"Hey guys, Plenty of stuff has been rolling in with CVE just around the corner. One thing that arrived fairly recently that I was eager to get to was a new juice from the boys over at VanGo. They've sent a few other things I've yet to get to but this one has been getting lots of attention from me over the past few days so I wanted to get to it before it's gone. It appears to be a flavour from a new line called Galleria but as of yet it's not listed on their site so I'm pretty sure it'll be launching at CVE. VanGo are sort of known for their numerous lines with numerous flavours but more recently they've been dropping some one offs so I'm not entirely sure if that's the case with this one. But after trying it, I'm kind of hoping it'll be the first in an entirely new line. Enough speculation, here are my honest thoughts on [Amour by VanGo Vapes](URL The juice comes in a 60ml clear Chubby Gorilla bottle with a dark coloured label with the image of a flower or something in the background with some raspberries floating around the edges. The name Amour is scrawled across the front with the tag line 'Fall in love again' below it. On the label it says the ratio is 100%Vg and the bottles I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottle](URL I was sent. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the bottle in brackets, no link available yet. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Amour** **(9/10)** (Passionate creamy yogurt with succulent raspberry notes) You don't need to speak much French to know Amour means love and this flavour has definitely been getting some love from me with it's incredible blend of sweet raspberry and rich creamy yogurt. I've made reference to it before but this raspberry flavour with a bit of cream reminds me quite a bit of a raspberry passion flake but with this one it has a distinct dash of yogurt in the mix making it just a bit different from the others that I've tried. The cream is thick and it only has the lightest touch of yogurt which mostly comes out on the back end. I get a standard yogurt flavour, not like a dry Greek yogurt but more like the classic yogurt taste but without the yak taste to it that's put me off so many others. It adds just the right amount of sour to the creamy flavour that it doesn't really become tart and doesn't wear on me too quickly. I've had no trouble taking it to work with me and going all day on it so I'm sure others won't either. I got to say there's something almost sensual about the flavour, it's rich, creamy, sweet and delicious and lingers on the tongue after vaping it. Generally speaking I'm not usually a fan of yogurt flavours but this one makes the cut with it's nice balance between sweet raspberry and creamy sour yogurt. Really lovely stuff!! ---- I've been a big fan of VanGos for quite some time and they are constantly coming out with new and amazing lines which I always appreciate. They literally have something for everyone with their numerous lines and vast number of flavours. If you haven't given VanGo Vapes a try yet they definitely get my recommendation and I can't wait to see what they bring out next! So VanGo if you happen to read this, thanks again guys for everything, you guys are seriously awesome!!"
113,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Strawberry Ice Cream from Bargain Ejuice,16,6n1eg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6n1eg9/honest_review_time_strawberry_ice_cream_from/,2017-07-13 22:50:37,"Hey guys, We all know and love our man Phil /u/TheVaporist and fairly recently we found out he's one of the guys behind Bargain Ejuice. Some of you may even know that I'm sort of bros with Phil as I've been known to help out at his booths at the Expos(I will be again at CVE TO, come say hi!!). Well some of you may even suspect that being friends may impact how I might rate the juices he creates, rest assured being friends with me comes with no such benefits or any for that matter. You know I don't tend to hold back and if you're a friend I won't even sugar coat it. Well I'm happy to say he recently sent over a new flavour that he's launching for Bargain Ejuice for me to check out and I've got to admit I've really been digging it. Here are my honest thoughts on [Strawberry Ice Cream from Bargain Ejuice](URL The juice comes in BEs clear 120ml chubby styled bottles that are meant to be a slightly improved version of the standard Chubby Gorilla bottles. So far it's been working well without any issues so I'm happy with it. The label is still the basic label we see on all of the BE flavours but with Strawberry Ice Cream written on it. The juice is Max VG and the bottle I was sent is in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottle](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Strawberry IceCream](URL **(9/10)** (Strawberry Ice Cream) Most of you know I'm not really a fan of strawberry and cream flavours, they're practically a dime a dozen and usually have very little to distinguish them. So when Phil told me he was sending me over a new Strawberry and Cream, let's just say I was a little less then excited. It arrived in the mail and I may or may not have left it sitting for a day or two before I bothered to open it, the excitement of yet another Strawberry and Cream flavour was hardly enough to motivate me to even break the seal. When I did though, oh man was I wrong about it being just another Strawberry and Cream and I've been pretty much vaping on it ever since. It's a really authentic if not a touch sweet tasting Strawberry flavour that's complimented by a nice rich, thick cream. The strawberry being the more forward flavour in the mix tastes a bit like a compote or jam. The flavour as a whole really reminds me of a pink strawberry ice cream dotted with big chunks of frozen strawberry just like you'd get from the local creamery. This stuff is smooth, sweet, creamy and delicious. While there isn't any koolada or anything in there to cool it off it does still have a nice summery feel to it making it a perfect treat for the warm days ahead. As I mentioned it is a bit on the sweet side but that sweetness really works with the flavour, pretty sure it's what gives the strawberry that rich jammy sort of quality. As far as I'm concerned Strawberry Ice Cream is a great new addition and will fit right in with the current BE lineup!! ---- I'm pretty sure Phil has been working on this one for quite a while, taking his time to make it just right.

118,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Northern Nectar,13,6cockw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6cockw/honest_review_time_northern_nectar/,2017-05-23 02:36:43,"Hey guys, Here's something that I've been wanting to get to for some time but because of some missed connections and bad timing it hasn't been until now that' I've had the chance. It's a set from our very own /u/eoszlak or Eddie as many of us know him. Even though he's fairly local to me I didn't actually get the chance to meet him until CVE Edmonton, half way across the country. Well I'm happy to say Eddie is a stand up guy and it was an absolute pleasure to finally make his acquaintance. Not only that but he's set me up with a full line of his juice for review. So without further ado, here are my honest thoughts on [Northern Nectar](URL The line comes in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottles with clean white labels that sport some honey comb along with the company logo and an image of what the flavour represents. Their flavour names are pretty self-explanatory but it's always nice when you know what you're reaching for. Plenty of other information on the labels and of course everything we like to see. The line is all 70vg and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's a shot of the rather wholesome looking bottles. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Grape Apple](URL **(7/10)** (A slap of delicious grape in the face, undertones of apple only to compliment the delicious grape flavors.) Grape apple or Grapple seems a popular combination of late, I don't know if that came about with the invention of the modified and trademarked fruit but it's been interesting trying all of the different takes on it. This one is a rather simple grape flavour with a very light taste of apple on the bottom end. It's so light I can't really tell if it's red or green but since I don't really get that distinct green apple taste I'm guessing it's some type of soft red apple. The grape flavour reminds me of a lot of the grape pop flavours I've tried, sort of an artificial purple grape flavour and not so much a realistic fresh grape. To me the whole thing leans more toward a regular grape flavour with a bit of added fruitiness and doesn't have that typical sweet and tart balance I've tasted with some of the other Grapple flavours out there. Nothing about this grapple flavour really stands out but at the same time it's not bad in anyway, just more grape then grape apple to me. **[Twisted Pear](URL **(6/10)** (Hard Candy; Tart Pear with a sweet twist of Dragon Fruit and Kiwi.) This is the only one that didn't really win me over. It's a mix of tart pear, kiwi and a touch of dragon fruit. The typical creaminess of the dragon fruit is nearly lost in the tartness of the pear and kiwi. The thing that didn't really agree with me in this one is a slight bit of perfume. There's a quality to it that's almost floral that I just didn't really enjoy. I don't really pick up on the hard candy quality that the description mentioned either just a light mix of pear and kiwi. The pear though is light and sweet something like a fresh bartlett pear, while the kiwi more or less adds it's typical touch of tartness but doesn't really stand out on it's own. Overall it'd be quite a fresh flavour but I personally couldn't get past that note of perfume. **[Peachee Cream](URL **(7/10)** (Peachy goodness with a touch of Lychee and just enough cream to make it a terrific ADV.) Peachee Cream starts off with the taste of fuzzy peach candy but without so much of the fuzziness, if that makes sense. It's got a distinct tartness to it for a peach flavour which I relate to the addition of the lychee. It's almost as if lychee gives it a slightly more realistic peach flavour without really taking over. The cream is a light addition, so light I barely pick it up. I'm getting more of just a clean peach and lychee taste then I do a creamy peach blend. Personally I would have liked this one to be a bit more creamy but as it stands it's quite clean and refreshing. Much like the Grape Apple this one didn't really move me but there wasn't anything particularly bad about it either. **[Strawberry Cream](URL **(8.5/10)** (This is the juice that got me into mixing, a small collection of creams compliments the subtle delicious taste of Strawberries.) This is where things really started to pick up for me in the line. Strawberry and cream flavours have never really been my thing but there have been a few that I've enjoyed. This one just made the list. It's a really nice mix of mostly fresh tasting sweet strawberry and rich cream. There might be a touch of a vanilla in there as well adding to the complexity of the richly layered cream. Something about it just seems to lay on the tongue and it has quite a bit more flavour then the others so far. It's essentially just a strawberry and cream flavour so I'm not sure what else I could add but it's one of the better ones that I've tried recently. Sweet and sort of fresh, rich and creamy this would be a strawberry and cream worth checking out. **[Watermelon Kiwi Cream](URL **(8/10)** (Sweet Watermelon complimented with Kiwi with a hint of cream on the exhale, the Watermelon gets stronger with time.) I personally really enjoy watermelon flavours especially when the warmer weather hits. This one hits you right up front with a nice sweet and bright tasting watermelon. The melon is fairly artificial but the touch of kiwi takes it towards the realistic adding a nice bit of tartness that sort of mimics the rind of a fresh piece of the summer time treat. This one too is fairly creamy compared to Peachee which gives the flavour a much fuller body. The watermelon as I mentioned is sort of artificial, with an almost candy like tone to it but it works well with that added touch of kiwi. The layer of cream really helps to take out any sharp points that the kiwi may add while thickening up the flavour as a whole. It's smooth and creamy and rather refreshing and should make for a really nice summer time treat. **[Pomegranate Ice Cream](URL **(9/10)** (I wanted to do something very different for a change, the name says it all with this. No graham cracker crust, just delicious juicy, tart pomegranate on the inhale over a layered vanilla bean ice cream on the exhale that makes you feel like you just walked out of the ice cream shop.) I don't think I've ever tried pomegranate ice cream but I'm a big fan of pomegranate and grenadine the syrup made from the pomegranate fruit. This falls somewhere in between fresh pomegranate and grenadine with it's rich sweet red tasting fruitiness and it's nice thick vanilla bean ice cream. The taste of the pomegranate is bright and red, slightly tart and almost syrupy in nature. The vanilla bean really adds a nice rich complexity to it giving it a thicker feel then any of the other creams from the line. I could actually vape vanilla bean ice cream on it's own but the addition of the slightly sweet, slightly tart pomegranate adds a really nice touch to it and makes the whole thing taste a lot fresher then just regular old vanilla ice cream. Lovely stuff!! **[Lychee Ice cream](URL **(9.5/10)** (This one took me awhile to nail down, it's similar to the Pomegranate Ice Cream except with Lychee, sweet Lychee on the inhale and a layered Vanilla Bean Ice Cream on the exhale.) To me this one was the standout flavour of the line and just a really nice lychee flavour in general. Take that same rich vanilla bean ice cream and top it with some fresh chunks of lychee and it's pretty much what you get with this. Being Asian I grew up eating lychee, which was almost always in the form of some dessert. Most of them were types of gelatin or fresh fruit desserts but occasionally I'd get something like lychee ice cream and it was almost always delicious. This reminds me so much of a particular creamy frozen lychee treat I ate as a child, it's like a trip down memory lane and it's absolutely amazing!! It's the perfect balance of sweet and tart balanced by a rich vanilla bean cream. It's thick and full tasting much like the Pomegranate but the lychee gives it a completely different feel. While lychee can sometimes be a bit too tart or almost bitter the vanilla bean ice cream makes sure it all comes out smooth. It's like an exotic ice cream and I've been gobbling it up! Hands down my favorite from the line and one of my new favorite lychee flavours!! ---- All around I have to say Northern Nectar makes some pretty damn fine juice. Sure a couple of them didn't exactly win me over but the majority of them I quite enjoyed. One thing I can say is they all have a nice clean feel to them without much if any added sweeteners. Definitely a few standouts in the line and I wouldn't have any trouble recommending you give our man Eddie a shot if you haven't already!! And Eddie, if you're reading this, thanks again man for setting me up with these, I really ejoyed trying them all out!"
119,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Illusions Vapor,22,6e8tmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6e8tmy/honest_review_time_illusions_vapor/,2017-05-31 03:31:58,"Hey guys, Here's something I've been sitting on for way too long. It's a set I picked up at CVE Ottawa and for some reason I just haven't gotten around to it. It's actually two lines with the original line being three flavours and a Chapter II containing another three flavours. If you haven't already guessed, I'm talking about Illusions Vapor. I was fortunate enough to be setup with both the originals and the Chapter II flavours so here are my honest thoughts on [Illusions Vapor](URL The juices comes in opaque white 30ml glass bottles. Each one sports a different image and name on the label and they look amazingly clean and nice. All the good stuff in fine print along the sides. I'm not the biggest fan of opaque bottles but these are just beautiful. The line is 80vg and the set I picked up are all in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Leaving descriptions out for this one as they won't be needed. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Taste of the Gods](URL **(8.5/10)** (Experience the sweet exotic taste of Black Currant, infused with coconut and finished off with a hint of fresh juicy pineapple sorbet. Delicate and refreshing.) Taste of the Gods starts off with a nice authentic tasting black currant up front, I don't get a ton of the coconut mentioned but it is there and the whole thing finishes off with a really nice and refreshing pineapple note. One thing I'm going to say about each and every one of these is they are very true to their descriptions, what they say they taste like, they actually taste like. This one has a nice refreshing sort of tropical fruity slant that's lightly tart and tasty even with the darker feel of the black currant. It's a bit sweet but not in a added sweetener kind of way more like sweet from the taste of the fruits in the mix. The black currant sort of gives it some depth while that pineapple sorbet finish is what gives it most of that sweetness. All around a very nice and refreshing fruit mix where each flavour can be easily picked out. **[Holy Grail](URL **(9/10)** (Indulge in the aroma of a fresh warm blueberry waffle drizzled with rich silky maple syrup and butter. Simply irresistible and delicious.) This one was one of my favorites from the line, it's an interesting mix of blueberries and syrup with a nice pancake/waffle sort of taste. It's nice and sweet from the blueberries and syrup while that waffle flavour really helps to fill it out. I don't really pick up much of the butter but it has a nice almost creamy feel to it so I'm guessing it helps add to the creaminess of it. It's very rich with the blueberry coming out mostly at the top and the heavier syrupy notes coming out at the bottom. I've tried quite a few flavours that try to mix fruit with pancakes or whatever and this is one of the best concoctions that I've tried. It does feel a bit heavier then the others but I attribute it to the syrup and waffle aspect and it's not so heavy that I can't enjoy it all day. Amazing stuff!! **[Crimson](URL **(9/10)** (Treat yourself to velvety smooth yogurt topped off with a dash of freshly picked sweet ripe strawberries. Incredibly rich and silky.) Uh-oh another strawberry and cream!? No, not this time. It's a wonderful mix of fresh sweet strawberry and a nice silky smooth yogurt. It's rich and thick like a Greek yogurt but doesn't have too much of that dry taste that often comes with it. With the advent of Greek yogurt flavours I'll admit I've really come around to them. They have a much more authentic taste then the yogurt flavours of yesteryears. This one I had a hard time putting down and it reminded me of a particular peach yogurt flavour that I love but with strawberries in the place of peach. Creamy and smooth with a light sweetness from the strawberry this one is absolutely amazing and all day vape material for me. **[Medusa](URL **(8.5/10)** (A captivating and indulgent baked pineapple upside down cake with a warm toffee glaze.) Who doesn't love a nice warm pineapple upside down cake fresh from the oven? This is a fantastic recreation of the classic dessert with a somewhat pineapple candy flavour nestled in a classic coffee cake blanket. I pick up elements of brown sugar, butter and toffee. Just like those coffee cakes mom used to buy when special guests were coming over. But it's a pineapple upside downcake so it also has a nice layer of warm baked pineapple to it. For me the pineapple does taste a bit like pineapple gummy candy but the other elements really help to keep it in line and not turn it in to an artificial candy like flavour. Really nice and inviting this one is one of the richer flavours from the line with a very comforting feel. Dessert lovers and fans of pineapple will probably dig this one!! **[Spellbound](URL **(8/10)** (A mesmerizing blend of juicy nectarine lightly sweetened with refreshing sugar cane juice.) This one takes a turn from the others. Something about it just sets it apart, not in a good or bad way, just different. It could be that it's a much simpler flavour without the complexity that the majority of them seem to have. It's a sort of mild nectarine flavour that's a touch tart and a touch sweet. It's got a real fresh fruit taste to it compared to the others that seem to be layered desserts and such. If you don't know what a nectarine is, it's a lot like a peach without the fur that has a slightly milder taste. Spellbound basically fresh squeezes one in to a bottle for your enjoyment and as much as I enjoyed it I almost felt it was out of place in this line. Still a very nice flavour and fans of nectarines finally have a flavour of their own. **[Messiah](URL **(9.5/10)** (A virtuously refreshing watermelon infusion with sweet blueberry and pear undertones.) I absolutely love these kinds of flavours. It's a bright and refreshing fruity mix of watermelon, blueberry and pear. The watermelon comes out at the front, really sweet, crisp and clean tasting with a nice fresh blueberry after note with just a touch of soft sweet pear. What I really love about these kinds of mixes is being able to individually taste all of the main notes. The watermelon while almost artificial tasting is clean and sweet tasting, while the blueberries are a bit heavier almost jammy with sweetness and the pear is soft and sweet, like a pear tends to be. While I'll admit it is a bit on the sweet side the refreshing nature of it makes it just so pleasant to vape. This is exactly the kind of thing I gravitate to as the weather warms up but unfortunately it's already gone. Pretty much a perfect summertime vape for me! ---- It's not very often that an entire line does so well by me. I've talked to plenty of people and pretty much anyone that's tried Illusions will agree it's top notch stuff. Each flavour is well layered, well crafted and tastes of quality. I'm sure plenty of you have already tried them at this point but if you haven't I'd definitely recommend you check them out if you have the chance! Illusions Vapor if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with the line, they're all amazing!!!"

121,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,My Experience at CVE Edmonton,16,6f4xaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6f4xaf/my_experience_at_cve_edmonton/,2017-06-04 11:55:32,"Hola chicas! I exclaim. The two older women behind the counter didnt seem more-than-excited to see me. Two tickets to paradise, please actually no, just one. I said it combined with a nervous chuckle. They looked at each other, the one further away seemed to roll her eyes while picking up the phone and looking away I noticed she didnt press any buttons. Where are you going? She asks, a hint of condescension in her voice. Edmonton. Family? Canadian Vape Expo. Oh. You ever tried vaping before? No, thatll be $47.50 I handed her my money and she handed me a printed slip. I smiled nervously at her until she too picked up a phone and nodded back. Edmonton. Were almost there. Can you believe it? A guy a few rows behind me on the bus exclaimed finally, somebody matching my level of excitement. I didnt know who he was talking to, but I took the aisle seat and looked back at him. I cant wait are you headed to the vape expo? The what? I noticed he was covered in dirt. The Canadian Vape Expo, are you going? You know that shit is bad for you, eh? He said as he opened his raggedy backpack and took out a black cylinder. After opening it, he put the contents of the cylinder around the bottom of his lip. Thats actually just a myth sold to you by the big tobacco companies, theyre trying to kill the whole industry I responded confidently proud of myself for it. Uh, sure they are, kid. He smirked at me sardonically while opening the empty bottle beside him. While putting the bottle down he spat a small reservoir of decrepit black goo into it. Whatever I thought to myself, this guy isnt going to bring me down, not on CVE weekend. I put my headphones on and starting bumping to some dank electronic dance music. With a nudge on my shoulder, I heard the words wake up, were in Edmonton. I looked at the fat lady in her uniform, she and I were the only people left on the bus. Do you know where CVE is? I asked. What? She replied. Feeling down about my last encounter, I gathered my things and walked off of the bus. Outside and around the terminal, the rude guy I had met on the bus was standing there calmly smoking a cigarette and it had gotten kind of dark out. Feeling sorta nervous, I crossed the street. After pulling out my phone, I ordered an Uber. Blowing some sick rips from my vape I checked back to see if the rude-dirty guy saw me, but he was already gone. My Uber driver was a sorta-uppity-sorta-good-looking type of girl, I saw her and the nerves that had come and gone hit me again my palms were sweaty. After a silent car ride and a few Tswift songs later, we finally arrived at the hotel I had been planning to stay at. After I left the girls car I pulled my phone out and called the guy who I met off Reddit and who had agreed to split a hotel room with me. Hey Matt, I just got here. mmm *click*. It sounded like he was trying to say a word that started with m before we got disconnected. I checked my phone and it was on 4%. With my rollerbag I walked into the lobby of the hotel. From seemingly nowhere, someone popped out from the right the second I walked through the doors. Hey, he said, I realized from his pictures that it was Matt. What the hell, howd you get here so fast? I asked. Uhhh, I dont remember. How was the bus? Terrible, I need a shower, I feel dirty. Thats gross. What is? I asked Uhh, I dont know, nevermind. He handed me a key to the room and left. Hey, whats our room number? I asked as he walked out through the doors. He didnt even turn around, he just walked away. Okay I muttered to myself as I walked to the receptionist. Hey! how can I help you? The receptionist asked me with a sincere-looking smile on her face. She was stunning, young gorgeous blond hair and my nerves hit me again palms sweating. The person Im sharing a room with... he ga...gave me a key to the room but he didnt tell me what number was. You mean Matt? Her smile became wider. Sweetheart, It says your room number right here on the card, she pointed to the numbers that were right there in front of my face. Uh...thanks... I never walked away from something quicker in my life. Opening the door to our room I began anticipating the horrors that would be there waiting for me, I really didnt know what to expect. When I got in I noticed all the lights were off, all of them except for the lamp in the corner of the room... and there was a black suitcase by the end of one of the beds. I didnt turn on any lights, as I didnt know where the lightswitch was, I just walked over towards the lamp. On the table the lamp was on... was the best looking vape gear I had ever seen in my life. He had these weird gold wires twisted in fantastic ways, an assortment of tanks and mods, and about 15 or so 30ml bottles of vape juice... all with different labels and colors. It seemed like I had died and went to some sort of vapers paradise. There were scissors and tweezers, cottons and atomizers, colors ranging from blacks to golds to blues and purples Ill never forget the sight it was... beautiful. I get out of the shower and get dressed, after brushing my teeth I walked out of the bathroom. Matt was sitting there under the lamp, the rest of the lights were still all off. There was tons of smoke and tons of bright-colored sparks coming off of whatever plugged-in tool he was using, it looked like a hot glue gun. The room smelled like something was definitely burning. What are you doing, dude? Youre going to burn down the hotel. Huh? Relax. He spoke without even turning towards me. I got a little curious, so I walked over to get a better look. What ARE you doing anyway? I asked. Working on my baby. I looked closer to see what he was doing, and I had never seen a setup quite like that before. He had spiral wires going vertically in S and Z patterns from post to post 6 of them. The people in the room next to us will complain, can we at least open a window or something before the smoke detectors go off and we get kicked out? NO! he shouted. No. Why? I sorta chuckled because of how ridiculous this trip was getting. Ruins it. Okay, lol. Oh my god, I just said lol out loud... well, there goes my weekend. He slowly turned towards me with his dark eyes wide open, like he had just seen a ghost. You wanna try it? He asks me. At first, I was conflicted. NO! I said to myself, wait, that was in his voice. Nevermind. Fuck it. Fuck yes I do. That thing looks insane I tell him. He puts on a pair of oven mitts, squeezing the wires he had been working on. After screwing the tank onto some generic looking mod he pours some juice into it. What kind of juice is that? I ask. Its called whalapalooza. Is it good? He turns around slowly to look at me again. Yes. After filling, he points the mod at me like it was a gun. He cocks the invisible cocking mechanism and says bang bang as he simulates the would-be recoil-like effects. I take a short draw from it, squeezing the firing mechanism. As the vapour hits my lungs, I feel a strong irritation deep in the back of my eyes, tears slowly trickle out from them as I cough and exhale. I turn away from Matt and look at the mod, it reads 40 watts. How was it? He asks, I turn around back to him after wiping my eyes. Its okay, I usually vape at 150 watts, so this is a little weaker than Im used to. Hmm, he mutters, as he nods his head seemingly in agreement. It worked. It kinda tasted like if Werther's originals and watermelons had a baby, I said. Mhm. But it was good, after an awkward pause. Wanna go to a bar that all the vendors go to? He asks me. Mmmmm.. sure. So we left. As we exited the elevator the receptionist ran towards us reaching her top speed and slaps Matt square on his face. I was actually impressed. I told you to call me? Why didnt you call me? She was hysterical. Screaming a bunch of incomprehensible obscenities at him. I dont know he replies. A man comes out from behind a door around the receptionist desk and pulls her away from him... dragging her back to the room with him. Matt seemed completely unbothered completely indifferent to the whole situation. As we walked out from the hotel I turned to him. So, why didnt you call her? I slightly chuckle underneath my breath. I dont know, he says quietly. As we opened the door to the bar, a huge waft of smoke came crashing down onto my face, like I had just gotten hit by lightning. Its almost as though we entered into another dimension or something, it was so odd. When I got hit by that brick of smoke, I instantly got light-headed, I forget where we even were. Matt! I heard from across the bar, I couldnt even see that far ahead and had no idea how he saw us. Walking in, it seemed like every single person at the bar was taking a drag from their vapes at the exact same time, and everyone seemed to be looking at us. I didnt know if they were looking at him or me, but it made me uncomfortable. Ill be right back I turned to say to him, in a tone designed to defeat the music playing in the background. He nodded and I made my way to the bathroom. The light in the bathroom was swaying like it was in the wind, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a man lying on the floor he had a mod in his mouth. Are you alright dude? I asked him no response. He exhaled a cloud of smoke whilst laying on the floor. I went over to the sink and splashed some cold water on my face. Wha the man on the floor muttered. What? Water? You want water? Are you alright man? Whala. What, Whalapalooza? Youve tried it? Whalapalooza he said as he exhaled another cloud of smoke. The light from the swaying fixture meant I could only see the smoke or the man when it was rocked in his direction. His face changed expressions every time the light got back to him. At first he showed indifference, then he smiled, then it was a full-on tooth-filled grin as he began laughing hysterically and repeating the word whalapalooza over and over. He was staring straight at the ceiling. As the light swung to reveal him, not only did his expressions change, but he went from a lying position, to a sitting one. Then I noticed he was in a crouching position. And then he was standing. And then he was staring at me. Then he was right in front of me with a gigantic shit-eating grin on his face. Teeth were missing out of his mouth, his rotten breath was hitting me square on the nose, and the dirt-filled curly hairs on his head shook with tremors. Tropical-storm-like droplets of sweat dripped from his hair, splashing down onto the broken bathroom tiles beneath us. He was looking down at the tiles and then back up, laughing hysterically at the splashy droplets of his own sweat. WHALAPALOOZA -- HA. HA. HAAAAHAAAA---HAAAHAA. I ran out from the bathroom and got hit again by the monstrous cloud of smoke. The walls began bleeding to the floor. The beige painted walls were melting, getting all over my new shoes, and the whites were being revealed behind it. Confused and terrified I hurried to the bar, as I entered everyone was sitting there and staring at me. An uproarious laughter began as everyone took their mods out and began pointing them at me. HAHAHAHAH!! even the bartender was into it. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG they all simulated the effects of recoil. HAHAHAHAHA!!!! *thump* Darkness after I fell to the floor. How was it? Matt asks. Best fucking juice I ever tried "
122,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Squarez by Switch Vapor House,12,6fe914,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6fe914/honest_one_shot_squarez_by_switch_vapor_house/,2017-06-05 23:46:16,"Hey guys, When I was a CVE Edmonton I had the chance to meet some companies that were entirely new for me. One of them was called Switch Vapor House out of Beaumont, Alberta. At the show they were showcasing a new flavour and it was pretty much something I just had to have. Fortunately I was able to pick up a bottle for review so here are my honest thoughts on Squarez by Switch Vapor House. The juice came in a 60ml clear Chubby Gorilla style bottle but on their site it looks like it used to come in clear 60ml glass bottles. The label has a sort of wholesome feel to it with a geometric square on the front. I had a look around but couldn't find the ratio listed but gaging by it's consistency I'd say it's probably a 70vg or thereabouts. The juice I picked up was in 3mg and here's a shot of [the bottle I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Squarez](URL **(9/10)** (Simply the best Rice Crispy square with a little twist available in Canada.) I've tried quite a few rice crispy treat flavoured vapes and I do have a few favorites and while I'm not sure I would say that Squarez is the best in Canada I will say it's squarely made my list of favs. I'm pretty sure everyone is familiar with the taste of the classic homemade treat, marshmallow and butter melted together with puffed rice cereal, formed in to a slab that's cut in to squares and enjoyed by pretty much everyone. This is a fantastic rendition of one of those gooey sweet treats. I get a nice rice cereal flavour upfront followed by a sweet soft marshmallow on the back end. This one is definitely cereal forward with the sweetness really coming around more on the tail end. I find it has a really soft feel compared to some of the other crispy treat flavours out there but it works well in this. No more irritating the roof of your mouth eating too many of these treats. In the description it mentions a little twist but I couldn't really pick out anything 'extra' in the mix. I might get a little bit of a vanilla sort of thing but that could just be the marshmallow playing tricks on me. Once I cracked this one open I had trouble setting it down and I was even taking it to work. As far as I'm concerned this stuff is all day vape material, at least for me. Now if I could just find it locally.. ---- Switch Vapor House has a real hit with this one, if you're in to cereal or dessert vapes Squarez is definitely worth checking out. I for one really enjoyed it! If you haven't heard of or had a chance to try anything from Switch Vapor House I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them. And SVH if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with Squarez, it's fantastic!!!"

One of the gents from the SOAK Eliquid team who was also participating in the Handcheck International thing set me up with a bottle of a new as of yet unreleased flavour. It's something that I don't believe I've yet seen in the world of eliquids but it's been done really well and I definitely enjoyed it. Here are my honest thoughts on [The Lf from SOAK Eliquids](URL The juice comes in a clear 30ml glass bottle with a dropper top with a red and white label that sort of reminds me of old carnival style packaging, like the box you'd get your popcorn in. Looking around I wasn't able to find the ratio listed but I'd guess it's a 70vg blend based on it's viscosity. I really like the look of the label and thought it really stood out with it's nice clean colours. All of the good stuff we usually like to see in fine print around the sides. The bottles I got was 3mg and here's [a shot of the nice bottle](URL I picked up. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from the site in brackets, no link for this one yet. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **The Lf** **(9.5/10)** (Creamy Bread Pudding with Raisins and a Pinch of Spice) I'm pretty sure this is the first bread pudding flavour I've tried and I have to say it's pretty darn tasty. Upfront I get a nice sweet eggy creamy vanilla custard that has a lovely bready taste to it. On the very tail end I get the essence of raisin and a touch of spice. I say essence because it's mostly and aftertaste but I definitely taste something in it which reminds me of sweet sun dried raisins or even raisin bread. The spice is very subtle and hard to nail down, it might be just the slightest hint of cinnamon, it just sort of adds to the bready baked quality of the pudding but almost gets lost in the sweet creamy custard. There's something extremely familiar about this while at the same time it's entirely new for me. Having a British wife I've eaten my share of bread pudding and I've got to say it's hitting a lot of spots for me. With that custard and bready taste and that little hint of raisin in there, it's a fantastically rich and decadent dessert flavour that doesn't come off too heavy either. Most of my friends who have tried it agree it's mostly a custard flavour but it's got just enough extra in it to set it apart. Really lovely stuff!! ---- Some of you may remember I had a bit of a mixed experience with SOAK but I assure you they do make good juice and Lf just might be my favorite thing from them yet. Unfortunately I see that it's not available just yet on their site but should be coming soon. So if you love a good bread pudding or rich custard flavour, I'd definitely suggest you check them out. And to the gents from SOAK if you happen to be reading this, thanks so much for setting me up with Lf, it's beautiful!!"
124,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Eye of Horus,12,6gt8ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6gt8ri/honest_review_time_eye_of_horus/,2017-06-13 02:19:20,"Hey guys, When I was at CVE Edmonton I stopped by the LK Vape booth to grab a G.O.A.T mod with matching Unholy RDA, it was on for an amazing deal so I just had to get one. While I was there I met with a very friendly guy named Eric who also happened to have his own eliquid line called Eye of Horus. After introducing myself he very kindly set me up with a couple of bottles of juice which I must say I was quite impressed with. Yes they're based out of Quebec but a quick Google search found it available in several shops as well as online. I may be mixing up the line name with the company name but I believe the company is Eye of Horus and the juice is from the Pharaoh's Reserve line but I could be mistaken. Either way here are my honest thoughts on [Eye of Horus eliquids](URL Both flavours came in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottles with dark labels dotted with Egyptian symbols, including the Eye of Horus, a pyramid on one and an Ankh on the other. All of the usual good stuff we like to see in fine print along the sides. Both flavours are 75vg blends and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Morningstar](URL **(8.5/10)** (A field berry infusion mixed with an aromatic tea! ) I've been a big fan of tea flavours for sometime and this one is no exception. Morningstar is an interesting mix of a sweet, sort of creamy, sort of candy-like berry mix with a lovely light Earl Grey Tea finish. The tea flavour itself almost gets buried in the mix but the bright bergamot pokes through giving the whole thing a nice light citrusy taste. It's so unlike any other tea blend I've tried with the tea just giving a bit of support to the rather nice berry blend as opposed to being the star of the show. If I had to pick the berry blend apart I'd say it's a fairly typical mix of raspberry, blueberry and possibly strawberry. It's kind of hard to tell as it's a fairly homogeneous blend but it ends up working really well with the tea flavour and that kick of bergamot you get from it. Maybe it's just me but I found it has a really fresh and clean sort of taste to it and reminds me just a bit of fresh clean linens in an English bed and breakfast or something like that. Just really fresh and fragrant with a nice clean feel. A really nice alternative to often heavy and rich coffee flavours. **[Morriahwind](URL **(9.5/10)** (A silky vanilla gelato topped with torrefied pistachios. ) This one really hit the spot for me. It's an absolutely decadent mix of sweet creamy vanilla gelato mixed with a rich deep pistachio flavour. The description mentions the pistachios are torrefied which as far as I understand means roasted. That torrefaction really gives it a deeper darker nutty taste which for me practically dominates the flavour. But that's not a complaint. I love creamy nutty flavours which is likely why this one does so well by me. That thick classic creamy vanilla flavour compliments the dark roasted pistachio nuts just perfectly, wrapping it up in a smooth delicately sweet gelato blanket. Fans of rich desserts and lovers of nuts and cream flavours will definitely dig this one. I'll admit that this one can have a tiny bit of a throat hit which I'm guessing comes from the pistachio which I find can sometimes have a dry almost scratchy feel to it, it's hardly noticeable but it definitely has more of a hit then Morningstar. It's not nearly enough to put me off even in the slightest but thought it should be mentioned. I've particularly been enjoying this one with my morning coffee which pairs perfectly almost like they were meant to be. Really fantastic stuff!! ---- So Eye of Horus was a new one for me but I have to say I've really enjoyed both flavours from the line. It really seems like many of Canada's best mixologists hail from Quebec and Eric with his Eye of Horus is squarely among them. So if you haven't heard of or given Eye of Horus a try I'd have no trouble recommending you do. And Monsieur Eric, if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with these treats, you sir make some damn fine juice!! Edit: links"
125,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Fearless by Chteau Noir,11,6hfxm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6hfxm9/honest_review_time_fearless_by_château_noir/,2017-06-16 02:02:04,"Hey guys, When I was at CVE Edmonton I made sure to stop by the Chteau Noir booth, one of my favorite Canadian Companies out there. They make some of my all time favorite [coffee](URL and [tobacco](URL flavours so I was very pleased when they showed me a new line they were releasing called Fearless. Monsieur Quenneville himself set me up with a set and also took the time to take a pic with me. Really great guy!! Here are my honest thoughts on Fearless from [Chteau Noir](URL The two flavours came in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottles with rather colourfull labels sporting stylized images of women's faces. All of the usual info we like to see in fine print, these bottles have a pretty interesting look to them. Both flavours were a 70vg blend and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the rather exotic looking bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Description from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Delusion](URL **(8.5/10)** (Fruity Mango Powder Dip) I tend to dig mango flavours but this one to me was a bit,,, delusional. I actually get more of a sweet yellow pear flavour, like a Bartlett pear or maybe even a bit of a candy apple flavour. The mango is rather subdued and I barely taste it, if at all most of the time. When I do taste it it's on the bottom end and like I said it's subtle. It does have a distinctly candy feel to it but for me it's almost more of a hard candy sort of thing as opposed to a powder candy. That aspect actually reminds me of a particular Hard Candy flavour you might be familiar with, a different flavour entirely but that boiled sweet candy flavour is reminiscent. I believe this is the first fruity flavour that I've reviewed from Chteau Noir and while I don't think it quite matches the description I actually really enjoyed it. While personally I would have liked a bit more mango out of it I think this one will still go over very well with fruity candy fans. It's bright, sweet and flavourful and would make for a fantastic summer time vape! **[Temptress](URL **(9.5/10)** (Triple Caramel Gelato French Custard) Chteau Noir has a knack for making the most incredible rich and complex desserts, coffee and tobacco flavours and Temptress is a perfect example of their skills. While it might be a bit more modest then some of their other offerings I though it was a perfect addition to their repertoire. It's a super rich and creamy classic French vanilla custard that's been absolutely jam packed with deep dark and smooth caramel. I give custard flavours credit for getting me off the smokes so I might be a bit biased when it comes to rich custardy desserts but oh man is this a decadent treat. It's the perfect balance between a classic eggy vanilla custard flavour and sweet dark buttery caramel in an extra creamy base. Definitely one of those guilty pleasure vapes but one that I could get down with all day long. While I suppose it could be called just a simple caramel custard it's one that's been done really really well and mine is just about gone! ---- So if you're in to decadent, rich desserts, coffee, tobacco or even fruity flavours I'd definitely recommend you give Chteau Noir a shot. They are among the best at what they do and they have never let me down with any of their offerings. I honestly can't recommend these guys enough! And Monsieur Quenneville if you happen to read this, thank you so much for setting me up once again with your absolutely incredible juice!!"

127,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Equinox: Prima by True Northern,22,66hu5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/66hu5b/honest_review_time_equinox_prima_by_true_northern/,2017-04-20 23:56:34,"Hey guys, One of the people I was looking forward to meeting most at CVE Edmonton was our very own /u/frock_donghammer, the better looking or at least taller half of [the amazing team](URL that makes up True Northern(sorry Allan). True Northern if you haven't heard of them before are a company from Calgary, Alberta that make some of the most amazing blends of realistic fruits and other various botanicals I've ever tried, seriously top of the list stuff. Well I'm happy to say I wasn't let down in the least, the man and his mustache are as wondrous as his liquids. At the Edmonton Vape Expo they were launching a couple of new flavours in a new line called Equinox: Prima. He was gracious enough to bequeath me a set so here are my honest thoughts on Equinox: Prima by True Northern. The two flavours came in 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottles in nice cardboard boxes sporting a neat geometric pattern overlaying a beautiful mountain range. The labels on the bottles pretty much mirror the design on the boxes and do a good job evoking a sense of the great white north. True Northern really has an eye for design and only seem to get better with every release. Another thing True Northern does right is adding a flavour description on all of their bottles, this especially helps when the names of the flavours don't clearly denote what it is, can we say handy! Both liquids are max vg and state 80 percent minimum on the labels. The set I got was 3mg and here are [a few nice shots of the boxes and bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from the labels in brackets, links weren't available so will update when they are. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **The Shield** **(10/10)** (Inspired by the Canadian Wilderness. This flavour conjures the natural beauty of the Canadian Shield, including the regions berries. The inhale is so reminiscent of a forest environment that each taste is a palpable experience like being in the great outdoors.) I was almost at a loss for words with this one. If you've ever taken a walk in the woods in Northern Ontario on a crisp spring morning you might get an idea of what this tastes like. It's an absolutely incredible recreation of the smells and tastes of the Canadian Shield. For those who live to the far east or west or even outside of Canada that may not be familiar with [The Canadian Shield](URL there's a large area of Canada where the landscape noticeably changes as you head north nicknamed the Canadian Shield. The main characteristic being a thick layer of Precambrian rock that erupts from the earth significantly changing the appearance of the landscape. For many of us here in Southern Ontario it signifies cottage country which comes along with a vast array of sensory experiences, many of which involve our senses of smell and taste. Fresh picked wild blueberries and raspberries are sold in abundance along the long stretches of highway carving through the densely wooded north country, often a requisite stop on the way up to the cottage especially during berry season. The deciduous forests of the south give way to hardier trees like black spruce, jack pine and birch. With these changes in flora come some incredible smells that until now I thought could only be experienced by a visit to the Shield Regions of Canada. Without even talking about the liquid I've already eluded to a number of flavours that this juice evokes. It's an incredible mix of forest berries like blueberry and raspberry, I think I even pick up notes of blackberry and maybe wild strawberry along with some woodsy aromatic notes like Juniper or Cedar, perhaps a touch of light pine. It was hinted that there may even be some tobacco in it and if I had to guess, it might be just the lightest touch of a cherry tobacco, adding even more rich fruity complexity to a rather evocative flavour without it tasting at all like tobacco. I've been vaping this pretty steadily since I picked it up at the expo and I feel as though I've identified a hundred different notes in it but at the same time I can't even decide on one. It's just one of those things you have to try for yourself to understand. When asked by friends what it tastes like the only fair response I can give is.. nature! I had joked with the donghammer that it's so beautiful the review should be a poem or something and he said ""DO EET!"", not sure I could've done the entire thing in verse but here goes... As dawn alights and the world awakes In the wooded vales of the land of lakes Morning steps gently through the dew laden wood It's nourishing sunlight kisses all that is good The bountiful forests and all they should yield Come alive in the spring on the Canadian Shield Juniper and Spruce and the taste of fresh berry A True Northern delight that all shops should carry **Siegla** **(9/10)** (A staple of Icelandic culture for over a millennia. Called Skyr in it's native Iceland, the dessert consists of a deliciously sour and smooth yogurt with a decadent naturally sweet field berry jam topping. Served with an extra dollop of sweet cream.) I've never tried the Icelandic dessert Skyr so I don't think I can elaborate quite as well as I did with Shield and it's definitely not getting it's own poem but I've tried plenty of yogurt and plenty of yogurt flavoured vapes to know when something is good. This one has a distinct focus on the cultured yogurt taste which is somewhere between the slightly dry taste of Greek yogurt and the thick almost buttery butyric taste of a classic yogurt vape. It's rich and full without being overbearing and heavy. When yogurt flavours first hit the scene I'll admit I really wasn't a fan, it wasn't until much later that the formulas started to change and the taste of the yogurt itself became a bit more agreeable that I finally came around to them. The decadent mixture of yogurt and sweet cream in this is definitely on the agreeable side for me but it's the berries that are a bit of a mystery. It's one of those berry blends that I have trouble picking apart but for some reason it works fairly well in this. The thick, almost sour taste of the yogurt really compliments the lighter more vibrant flavours of the berries, almost cradling them with it's thick embrace. Again I can't really tell what berries they are but it's most likely some sort of a mix of blueberry, blackberry and raspberry, the most common field berries. I'm notorious for not liking generic berry mixes but in some things it just works and this is one of them. In fact the berry jam isn't even the main focus in this and when talking to the donghammer he mentioned that he really worked hard on the actual yogurt taste which as far as I'm concerned paid off. ---- So what can I say about True Northern!? Not only is /u/Frock_donghammer one of us but they hold the title, at least with me, for the best, most realistic yet different and intriguing fruit flavours I have yet to try. Seriously the stuff they make is almost on a different level from most of the stuff I review. I might even need to revisit my review scale cause of them. Not only do I recommend but I urge you to check these guys out, they are just that good. So a huge thanks to the boys from True Northern, it's juices like these that help renew my resolve to try all the best liquids of Canada. "

Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Pink Soda](URL **(8/10)** (A sparkling splash of fruits, accented with delectable notes of vanilla and cream in pure pink soda perfection.) When I first tried this at CVE I thought it was a fairly simple pink soda flavour so it wasn't until I really got to spend some time with it that I started noticing all of the little nuances in the flavour. If you haven't guessed it already it's Chills take on cream soda and while I won't say that it tastes 100% exactly like a cream soda, it's pretty darn close to the type of cream soda that I enjoy. After all there are endless variations of cream soda, one of the more popular being pink cream soda. It's one of those flavours that's almost impossible to describe because it has very little to compare it to, I mean it's not exactly a natural flavour. However just like the venerable cream soda flavour this has been constructed with a mix of fruit, cream and vanilla. I'm almost positive there's some orange creamsicle flavour in this as I pick up that same sort of plasticky note I get from the creamy aspect of creamsicle flavours, just the tiniest bit though. There's also just a hint of a brighter citrus, maybe grapefruit or maybe it's just the orange from that creamsicle again, but it's kind of hard to tell since the creamy vanilla aspect sort of washes it all over, smoothing it out and giving it a nice kick of pink sweetness. Something about it makes it taste pink, maybe there's some cotton candy in it to give it that bit of pink sweetness but I can't say for sure. I know this stuff has been making the rounds and I saw plenty of posts on social media about it after CVE, I think it's pretty unanimous, this stuff is pretty dang tasty. ---- I've really enjoyed the stuff I've tried from Chill. All of their liquids are packed with flavour and if you'll pardon the pun they just pop! So if you like pink cream soda I'd say this stuff is definitely worth checking out. Also NYX if you happen to be reading this, thanks so much for setting me up with this. I've had an absolute blast trying all of these Chill flavours!! "
131,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Panda Shake from Milkshake Liquids,10,69178b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/69178b/honest_one_shot_panda_shake_from_milkshake_liquids/,2017-05-04 01:55:56,"Hey guys, Here's another one shot of a somewhat newer flavour also sent over from [NYX Ecigs](URL but this one has a bit of a story behind it. While I was at CVE Edmonton, Milkshake Liquids who I've [reviewed a couple of flavours](URL for before in the past had a booth there with the same folks from Chill and a few others. Since my last review Milkshake Liquids have added three new flavours to their line and I stopped by to check them out. All three of the new flavours were fantastic but I was getting low on funds so I didn't pick up the set. On the last day of the expo I was really craving one of the new flavours so I popped by their booth again to pick up a bottle. Unfortunately they had sold out the day before. I thanked them anyway and went on my way. About a half an hour later, while I was standing around listening to some of the speakers on stage the same gentleman from the Milkshake Liquids booth approached me. He presented me with an open bottle of the flavour I had tried to buy as well as a little sample pack of the line. Colour me impressed! Not only did he remember me and find me in the crowd but he generously offered up one of their tester bottles which was practically full. I was floored, but it didn't end there. About a week ago NYX who happens to carry Milkshake Liquids in Canada contacted me about doing a review of the new Chill flavour I posted this morning as well as a new tobacco line and while I was talking to them, they mentioned that the rep for Milkshake Liquids felt bad they didn't have a full bottle to sell me and wanted to send one over for free as an apology. Again, absolutely floored! These folks went above and beyond, found me in a crowd and tracked me down through one of their clients and not only that, their liquids are absolutely amazing!!!! So enough story, here are my honest thoughts on [Panda Shake from Milkshake Liquids](URL The juice comes in glass 60ml bottles that have an opaque white coating. They look great and match the theme of the line but it's hard to see what's left in the bottle. The label has a metallic sheen and sports a picture of a milkshake in a sea of milk and cookies that resemble Oreos. All of the labels in the line have followed the same design and usually sport a colour representative of the flavour. Well on this one it's sort of a black and white look which does a good job of evoking the classic cookie colours as well as relating back to the name Panda Shake. The juice is a 70vg blend and the bottle I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the lovely bottle](URL I received. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Panda Shake](URL **(10/10)** (Bits of cream filled chocolate cookies thrown into a creamy, vanilla milkshake) If you've been following my reviews you might know I absolutely love Oreo cookie flavours, that doesn't mean I like them all though. I've tried quite a few and while I do have my favorites there have been a few that haven't quite made the cut. Well Panda Shake I'm happy to say hits all of the spots for me, all of them! It's a wonderful mix of thick creamy vanilla milkshake blended with little bits of delectable Oreo cookies. The vanilla milkshake aspect of it is so thick and creamy you can practically feel how thick it is on your tongue. Yet even though it's so thick and rich it's still somehow light like you'd expect a frothy milkshake to be. Add in just a touch of some authentic tasting Oreo cookie and I'm pretty much in heaven. Yes it's a bit on the sweet side but it's not so sweet that I can't vape it all day long and believe me I have been. I often find chocolate flavours can have a bit of throat hit to them but there is absolutely nothing harsh about this. The cookie aspect is actually quite mild, not smack you in the face with a strong chocolatey flavour but more like a nice light chocolate cookie finish that definitely tastes like the classic treat. From start to finish it's such a smooth creamy experience that I hardly want to put it down. I'm sure I could go on and on about how rich, smooth and creamy it is but I think you get the point. ---- Just like the other flavours I've tried from Milkshake Liquids I really really enjoyed this one. I was already a huge fan after trying the first couple flavours from them and this is just the icing on the cake. I can't tell you enough how much I enjoy their flavours, every one I've tried has been amazing, super rich and creamy just like a milkshake should be. If you like rich creamy milkshake flavour these are an absolute must try!! Seriously good stuff!!! So Milkshake Liquids and NYX, if you happen to be reading this, you guys are awesome and I can't thank you enough for setting me up once again with some of your amazing amazing juice!!"
132,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Druga RDA by Augvape,14,697hwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/697hwz/honest_review_time_druga_rda_by_augvape/,2017-05-04 23:30:35,"Hey guys, [Augvape](URL a company who makes a couple of my all time favorite rtas(see [merlin](URL and [merlin mini](URL reached out recently and set me up with a couple of new things to review. One of which is the Druga rda. While I do tend to be more about the flavour there are plenty of times I like to play around with some fun builds and rip a few clouds and the Druga is just the type of rda I like when it comes to doing just so. Now I don't always have time to work on fancy builds myself with work and kids and reviews so it's really nice when you get the chance to check out some incredibly well made coils from guys like /u/saddlehorseblues. Well it just so happens that I ran in to the dapper gentleman himself while attending CVE Edmonton and he was kindly enough to furnish me with a few sets of his incredibly beautiful and perfectly fashioned coils. I thought it would be the perfect time to show them off while giving my honest thoughts on the [Druga rda by Augvape](URL **Package contents:** 1x Druga RDA 1x Hex key 1x Delrin Drip Tip 1x Ultem Drip Tip 1x 510 Drip adapter 1x BF Pin 4x Replacement oring **Listed features:**  SS 304  24 mm Diameter  810 Drip tip  24K Gold Plated Deck  Clamp Snag System  Come with Ultem Drip Tip And Derlin Drip Tip  Come With Gold Plated Brass Pin And SS Squonk Pin Here's a link to a [full album of pics](URL ---- ##Packaging and contents: I really dig the packaging that Augvape has been using. [Cardboard tubes](URL with minimalist printing on the outside and [sponge lined](URL to protect the contents, brilliant! While they don't really stack all that well they look great, do a good job of protecting [the contents](URL and are mostly cardboard so a bit less impact on the environment. Who am I kidding, [they just look really cool](URL In the tube you get the the rda, a hex key, an ultem extra wide chuff tip, a delrin wide bore drip tip, a standard 510 drip tip adapter, some spare orings and a bottom feed pin for squonking. A really nice little set of extras I would say. ##The RDA: Starting at the top with the selection of drip tip options, it comes pre-loaded with the extra wide [ultem chuff tip](URL It's a bit on the short side but I personally found it quite comfortable and preferred it over the included [delrin drip tip](URL It has Druga stamped into it and personally I think it looks sweet. Partially because I like to keep things short. However since it is so short it's not going to do all that much for heat transfer since your lips are essentially millimeters from your coils. The delrin wide bore tip is probably a bit more comfortable in some regards but everyone's preference will vary, that's why it's nice that they basically cover all the options by throwing in a standard 510 drip tip adapter. That means even if you don't like the ultem or the delrin options you can basically use any of your favorite standard 510 drip tips. Did I mention that the ultem and delrin drip tips are 810, meaning they're the same size as your standard Goon or Kennedy drip tips, nice. The body of the rda is 24mm in diameter and 35mm tall, made of 304 stainless steel with the deck completely plated in 24k gold. It feels really well made with nice tight tolerances and if you ask me it looks absolutely gorgeous with it's gold plated deck. The outer barrel has [two cyclops style side airflow slots](URL that sit just above the rim of the deck so even if you build your coils fairly low the air should still be hitting your coils from an angle just below them. This is my preferred style of airflow, at least on an rda as most top airflow options mute the flavour and bottom airflow rdas can often be a leak hazard. The inner barrel or air flow control cap can be turned to adjust your airflow but only has two slots cut in to it meaning this rda is pretty much dual coil only. That is unless you build in between the posts or block off one of the slots with something. The afc is a bit on the tight side but loosens up once a bit of juice builds up in there, I'm not really the type to constantly adjust my air flow so I actually like it nice and tight. [The cap is also concave](URL on the inside so it should help concentrate the flavour. As for the orings that hold the cap on, they're perfect, just the right amount of tension to hold the cap on even when a bit wet. At the very bottom of the rda is [a barely protruding non-adjustable center pin](URL they don't list what it's made of but it's pretty shiny so I'd guess brass. There's also [a bit of branding](URL with an engraving that says 'By Vapehouse and Augvape' hinting at a collaboration but I'm not sure who or which Vapehouse it refers to. Another plus for this kit is the included gold plated brass BF pin. If you like squonking this is a nice little bonus and since it's two post like I mentioned above it's pretty much perfect for it. ##The deck: Taking off the cap we see [the gorgeous 24k gold plated deck](URL It's two post with a big gap in the middle which so happens to be my favorite setup for an rda. Why is that you ask? Because when dripping this design leaves a nice big gap in the middle that you can just dump your juice in to which then spreads out nice and evenly to your cotton whereas a three post, quad post or any other type that has a post running right across the middle, doesn't spread the juice as well when dripping down the tip and can even lead to a chance of hot spitback with juice building up between the coil and the post. Most of my favorite rdas are two post like the Druga so that's a big plus for me. With a [nice deep juice well and the two post setup](URL it's been completely spit free for me. The posts on this deck are one of the things that set it apart, or rather the clamping system which Augvape has dubbed the CSS or Clamp Snag System. Each post is basically [like a big screw that's been cut down the middle of the threads](URL and you lay your wire in those grooves and screw on a nut that clamps your wires down. So far it seems solid and it's pretty handy being able to screw them on by hand and then tighten them down with a screwdriver after. However that brings up one little detail that kind of bugged me. The Philips head grooves aren't actual Philips head grooves, it's more like [two straight flat lines that make a cross](URL A Philips head dips in the middle to accept the point of the driver, this is flat inside more suited to a flat head screw driver. Which brings up another point, there wasn't a flat head driver included only a hex key. In order to remove the positive pin to install the BF pin you would also need a flat head. Luckily a flat head is probably the most common driver in anyone's household but it could still potentially leave someone in a pinch if they didn't happen to have one the right size. I think they should have made the clamp nuts hex instead of faux Philips and that would solve at least one these issues. As I've already eluded to, as long as you have a good flat head screwdriver building on this thing is a dream, of course I've only run two builds in it, some 26g fused claptons when I first got it and this set of [staggered framed staples from Saddlehorse Blues](URL that I used for the review pics. [They fit absolutely perfectly](URL in to the post channels so you'll be able to fit some pretty nice big builds in this thing but that's basically what it was built for. [Wicking it](URL is pretty standard, just like you would most any rda. It's a builders dream with the extra wide post holes, easy screw clamps, gold plated deck, did I mention the gold plated deck? Cause it's gorgeous! Like Instagram material gorgeous! **Likes:** *Looks and build quality *Gorgeous gold plated deck *Drip tip options *Two post *Gold plated deck *Airflow and flavour *Nice and short **Dislikes:** *Clamp nuts aren't real Philips head *No flat head screwdriver included ---- ##Overall: I know looks and certain features on any atomizer can be subjective. Everyone has their preferences but the Druga has quite a few of the things I look for in an rda and if you notice, I had to really nit pick for the cons list. The pros of this thing far outweigh the cons, at least for me. Overall I think it's a well made and well designed dripper that will fit right in with my rotation. Also doesn't hurt that I think it's gorgeous! So as always, the big questions: **Will I keep using this thing?** Absolutely! I've been loving it and paired with a nice set of Saddlehorse Blues coils it's been an absolute dream to run. It's got everything I need and look for in a dripper and it delivers it in a nice gold plated package! **Would I recommend this thing?** Without hesitation! Granted it's not going to be for everyone but any builder who likes nice wide posts, side airflow, a deep juice well, BF Pin etc. is going to love this!! "
133,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: The Hype from Definitive x Cloudfire,7,69f193,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/69f193/honest_one_shot_the_hype_from_definitive_x/,2017-05-06 00:34:02,"Hey guys, Here's a one shot that's been getting lots of attention on Social Media. The team behind this particular juice is actually a collaboration between two well known figures in the Canadian vape community. I'm talking about Mark Nicholson of Definitive Coil fame and Ryan Hjelm the man behind Cloudfire and Hjelm Vapor. It had to be one of the most successful social media campaigns that I've seen in the industry in recent times bringing plenty of attention to their lovechild project before it even hit the shops. I was fortunate enough to be set up with a bottle at CVE Edmonton so here are my honest thoughts on The Hype by Definitive x Cloudfire. The juice comes in a dark coloured 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottle. The label is basically no frills being mostly plain white with just a bit of black text on it. All of the good stuff we like to see in fine print. I looked around and couldn't find the ratio listed but it's fairly thick and if I had to guess I'd say it's a 70vg blend or thereabouts. Here's a shot of [the much hyped bottle of The Hype](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Official description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[The Hype](URL **(9/10)** (Deep fried watermelon) Even though as a reviewer I get to try a lot of different juices it's not all that often I come across something that's truly different. This stuff is defnitely different. How would I describe it? Well the description does a pretty good job of it, it's deep fried watermelon. It's a rather unusual mix of juicy watermelon and a deep fried dough. I've never actually tried a piece of deep fried watermelon but I know [it's a thing](URL at county fairs and festivals across the country. I'm pretty sure this liquid is about as close as you'll get to the real thing without actually eating it. The watermelon is like I mentioned juicy, it's bright and flavourful without tasting too artificial or anything. That watermelon is accompanied by a rich fried dough flavour which I'm pretty sure I've tasted something similar before but couldn't quite place my finger on it. It kind of reminds me a bit of the crust flavour that often accompanies a pie, like a watermelon pie!? The juice is nice and sweet and tends to leave a sweet taste on the tongue but it's not like vaping pure sugar or anything. I'm a big fan of a good watermelon flavour and this just kicks it up a notch with the added complexity of the fried dough. Sure it's a bit unusual so I could imagine tastes will be split on this one but I'll admit I've really been enjoying it. One thing I did notice with it is that the fried dough flavour tends to get a bit overpowered by the watermelon but the watermelon should probably be the dominant flavour in this anyway. It's not like it drops off completely though, it just sort of sits in the corner while the watermelon takes center stage. I'd imagine this will make for a really nice summer time treat and I can't tell you how nice it is to try something that's so different but so good. ---- I was already a big fan of Cloudfire and The Hype just re-enforces how talented I think these two gentleman are. Hopefully we get to see more interesting collaborations out of this dynamic duo cause I for one really enjoyed The Hype. If you guys haven't already tried The Hype or Cloudfire for that matter I'd highly recommend you check them out. So Mark and Ryan if you happen to be reading this, thanks so much for setting me up with a bottle of this stuff and for going out on a limb with something a bit different from the mainstream offerings, you guys killed it!

134,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Thrill-Ya from Prime Liquids,6,69g0xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/69g0xb/honest_one_shot_thrillya_from_prime_liquids/,2017-05-06 03:16:59,"Hey guys, Last one shot of the week but still more to come. Here's something from [Prime Liquids](URL that I picked up at CVE. I have yet to do a line review for Prime but I picked up a sample set from them as well so look for the review of that in the coming weeks. This one shot flavour however I just had to have, it's basically nostalgia in a bottle for me. I don't want to spoil it before the review so here are my honest thoughts on a new flavour from Prime Liquids. The juice comes in a clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottle. The label is mostly purple with some yellow text and a picture of an exploding volcano. It manages to evoke the style of the namesake liquid without giving too many cues to the copyright hounds. All of the good stuff we like to see is on the bottle in fine print. The liquid is labeled as Max VG and the bottle I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the colourful bottle](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Description from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Thrill-Ya](URL **(9/10)** (Bringing back a timeless classic, this is a unique flavour experience you won't find anywhere else.) If you're somewhere around my age and grew up in Canada, chances are you're familiar with this particular flavour. It's based on a chewing gum that was notorious for having rather polarizing opinions on whether it was good or bad. It's called Thrills or as many preferred to call it Soap Gum. Yes it's that purple gum many of us either loved or hated as a child. Originally made by the O-pee-Chee company surprisingly it's still around after being bought out by Nestle in the 80s and now seems to be made in Spain and imported by the Tootsie Roll company. But enough of the history lesson, what does this stuff taste like!? Well it tastes exactly like the gum and I mean exactly. So what does the gum taste like!? It's based on rose water but if you ask nearly anyone it tastes like soap and that's where it gets it's reputation. People who've tried it are pretty much divided in to two camps, either love it or hate it. I mean it tastes just like soap and even says so on the gums package. I'm pretty sure some kids have even been threatened with it when caught swearing by their mothers. However I personally fell square in the love it camp, I even happened to have a pack laying around which I tossed in to the pic. I know in the eliquid flavour world we often say things taste just like what they represent and for the most part they can or are the closest approximations we can have in vape form but this legit tastes like I just finished chewing a piece of soap gum. It's smooth, almost creamy, a touch sweet and oh so soapy. If you haven't already tried the gum it would be very hard to describe the taste but the closest I could compare it to would be rose water, soap and sugar. Sounds weird but it's amazing!! ---- If you're unsure whether you'd like something like this I'd definitely suggest you try and find the gum before committing to a full bottle of this cause I can already tell you, you'll either love it or hate it. Me personally, I'm loving it and it totally brings me back to my childhood. I'm still not sure if originally I would buy it to just freak my friends out but in the end I ended up loving it. So Prime Liquids if you happen to be reading this, thanks so much for the slice of nostalgia, you guys absolutely nailed it with this!!"
135,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Tobacco Land by VanGo Vapes,14,6a5jrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6a5jrj/honest_review_time_tobacco_land_by_vango_vapes/,2017-05-09 23:57:14,"Hey guys, Like the majority of us I smoked for many years before I took up vaping. Twenty six years to be exact, so I thoroughly loved tobacco in it's many forms. When I first made the switch, vaping was just starting to take off like we know it now. At the time it was quite difficult to find a decent tobacco flavour beyond the standard ry4 or dare I say it ry4 double. Well things have come a long way since then. In fact it's more rare for me to find a tobacco flavour I don't like then one I do. This set I've been sitting on since CVE Ottawa and I really wish I hadn't waited so long to crack it open. It's from the amazing guys at [VanGo Vapes](URL and it's called [Tobacco Land](URL A full line of absolutely wonderful and varied tobacco flavours. Here are my honest thoughts on Tobacco Land from VanGo Vapes. The juices come in clear 30ml glass bottles with droppers with a couple of them being in 30ml clear plastic squeeze bottles. The labels are nice and shiny with interesting little pics on them, not quite related to the flavours but fitting with the theme. The names are somewhat pirate related if I'm not mistaken and the VanGo logo gives the Tobacco Land brand little devils horns, cute. All the good stuff we like to see along the sides and in fine print. The liquids are all 75vg blends and the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the sweet looking bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets and there's quite a few of them so I'll try and keep them relatively brief. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Anarchy](URL **(7/10)** (A rich, black Cavendish tobacco leaf e-juice together with a generous amount of Sweet Cherry which will generate a room-aroma second to none. The robust flavor blend is reminiscent of pipes being filled with rich cherry tobaccos of yesterday.) If you don't know what [Black Cavendish](URL is, it's basically a curing technique that brings out the sweetness in a tobacco through the use of pressure, heat and often added flavourings. It's usually made from blends of Virginia and Burley and used primarily for pipe tobacco. I only mention it because it's used quite a bit throughout the line. Anarchy starts with a rich dark leaf pipe tobacco type flavour with a fairly strong kick of sweet floral black cherry. This is almost more reminiscent of a Cherry Shisha tobacco, with it's strong hit of cherry and almost floral finish. For me it's just a bit too perfumey and floral but I'm pretty sure some former Shisha smokers might dig this. It's actually my least favorite from the line but it's still quite nice just the cherry is not really my thing when it comes to tobacco. **[Captain](URL **(9.5/10)** (Black and golden Virginia tobacco e-juice lightly infused with a rich and smoky dark chocolate, and a creamy, sweet caramel as an after note. The combination is rich and soothing making it an excellent evening vape.) Captain is a really interesting mix of a sweet Virginia tobacco and a rich dark chocolate. The mix sounds a bit odd but it actually works really well. The tobacco adds an almost spicy complexity to the chocolate while the chocolate gives the tobacco a nice rich sweetness. The chocolate is dark like cocoa and reminds me a bit of a creamy chocolate truffle since there's a nice overall creaminess to it. I don't really taste the caramel in it though, I'm pretty sure the dark chocolate covers it up. It probably just adds to the depth and sweetness of the flavour overall. It's so rich, smooth, chocolaty, creamy and oh so good. It's one of the more dessert oriented ones from the line but it's not too heavy cause the tobacco kind of lightens the whole thing up. A bit on the decadent side, this was one really stood out from the line! **[Gold](URL **(10/10)** (The standard for tobacco lovers everywhere. A traditional bright Virginia blend with a hint of Black Cavendish finished off with aromas of honey and a hint after note of vanilla.) Sometimes it's nice when a tobacco blend let's the tobacco be the star of the show. Gold is a nice light sweet Virginia blend with some darker mid notes from the Black Cavendish and only the gentlest non tobacco bottom notes. It's almost creamy with it's gentle honey and vanilla finish. The honey adds a sort of delicate sweet floral touch without being perfumey while the Black Cavendish gives the typically light Virginia an even deeper sweeter earthy flavour. Super smooth with a delicately sweet finish this is exactly my kind of tobacco mix. It has a nice authentic tobacco flavour without feeling overly complicated. All of the additions in this are just little nuances that enhance and don't get in the way of what is mostly a classic sweet Virginia blend. Beautiful stuff!! **[Pirate](URL **(9/10)** (An earthy, rich blend of Cavendish leaves matured in Oak Sherry Barrels. The deep oak after tones leave an almost citrus-orange after taste which is a perfect ending for the true tobacco connoisseur. ) Pirate brings the Cavendish forward a bit with it's darker leaf taste, but I'm almost positive there's still some Virginia in the mix as well. It has some nice oaky bottom notes from the Sherry Barrels and a light sweetness. It's quite similar to Gold with it's addition of Black Cavendish responsible for those rich sweet mid notes but in this that aspect is stepped up just a bit. While I don't really taste that citrus-orange taste mentioned in the description I do get a sort of bright zest from it. This is another one that focuses on the tobacco without all the extra complications and folks who like the darker tobacco flavours should definitely check this one out! **[Scurvy](URL **(8/10)** (Toasted black Perque tobacco e-juice infused with delicate notes of wild berries, black currant and blackberries. The cooler notes allow a subtly sweet berry flavor to come through and the after notes of the berries leave a woodsy taste that is simply delicious.) I've never tried toasted black [Perique](URL tobacco but apparently it's known for it's strong, powerful and fruity aromas which makes perfect sense in this blend. It's a blend of a very light clean tasting tobacco flavour with a bright kick of berry. Probably the lightest actual tobacco flavour in the line it's almost more of a berry flavour with a touch of tobacco to add some spice and complexity. Really lovely but almost doesn't fit with the line. The berry mix is a bit hard to pick apart but it does lean toward the darker berries, blackberry and black currants like the description suggests. Nice and clean this one is rather refreshing for a tobacco flavour and kind of reminds me of a berry tea flavour if that makes sense. Definitely different and I quite enjoyed it. **[Silk](URL **(8/10)** (Virginias best broad leaf tobacco with a dominant creamy note that is a wonderfully smooth and light flavor. A creamy end note creates a buttery sweet after taste that will leave you wanting more.) With this one I get a crisp broad leaf sort of tobacco that's quite sweet followed by a creamy buttery taste. Almost like a Cigar flavoured custard but very buttery. Usually I'm not a fan of the dark fresh broad leaf type of tobacco flavours and I'll admit the first few hits of this I wasn't too sure but the super creamy finish kind of won me over. I couldn't place my finger on it at first but I'd tasted the buttery aspect before, in popcorn flavours, so it might even lend it a sort of buttered popcorn taste if you've ever tasted a popcorn flavoured eliquid before. I was really taken by it at first but it sort of wore on me pretty quickly. Interesting and different but a bit too much butter for me to make it a regular thing. **[Surrender](URL **(9/10)** (An invigorating blend of black Cavendish tobacco leaf e-juice lightly infused with a hint of vanilla and a touch of mint. The mild and lightly fragrant back notes of a cool menthol creates a taste that you will surrender to time and time again.) The name Surrender is fitting, just one hit of this and I was instantly reminded of my older sister or my Mom and their Kool menthol cigs, it's like it wanted to take me back to the 80s with every hit. It tastes an awful lot like smoking a menthol cigarette, at least as far as I can remember. It's a nice rich mix of a sweet Virginia and Black Cavendish with just the right amount of menthol. But it's not just menthol, it's almost more like a creamy peppermint with it's smooth vanilla mint finish. Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me with this one but I swear it tastes a bit more like a smoked cigarette then a fresh one. One of the best menthol tobacco flavours I've tried. It manages to balance the menthol and the tobacco just right. **[Vendetta](URL **(9.5/10)** (A mild blend of aged Virginia and Cavendish tobacco e-juice lightly infused with an exceptional, vanilla bean layer of sweetness. Vendetta has a unique aroma, a smooth superior flavor and a distinct tasting experience.) Absolutely beautiful mix of a sweet Virginia and Cavendish blend with a wonderful smooth vanilla bean finish. It's like they got half way to an ry4 and said ""you know this is pretty awesome"" and just stopped there. I say it's like an ry4 but it's lighter without the caramel to give it the darker complexity we're used to. This seems to work with just a beautiful creamy vanilla bean finish mixing perfectly with the lighter sweeter nature of a classic Virginia blend. The Black Cavendish is pulled back a bit or at least the darker notes are disguised by the smooth vanilla but I'm pretty sure it's still adding to the overall sweetness of the amazing tobacco vanilla blend. This was another favorite from the line, just beautiful!! ---- For the tobacco lovers out there, I can't tell you enough how much I enjoyed this line. The entire set is so well crafted and chock full of variety that I'm sure whatever your tobacco flavour preference you could find one you love in the line. The boys at VanGo Vapes have been absolutely amazing to me and I owe them a bit of an apology for taking so long to get around to this set. I was absolutely blown away at how wonderful each and every one of these flavours are and I sincerely regret taking so long to get to them. Sure a couple of them aren't really my style but they're wonderful all the same. If you like tobacco flavours or even if you're not sure and want to try some out I would highly highly recommend you check these out, amazing stuff!! And to the gentlemen from VanGo, if you happen to read this, thank you guys so much for setting me up with this absolutely incredible line. You and your juice are awesome!!!"

I'm hoping with the new back end I can program these types of sales easier. The same REDDIT discount code will apply to the new website (15% off single bottles, 10% off combo packs) If you're in Toronto, make sure to come out and see us at CVE in a few months. We had a blast in Edmonton and I spent more than I'd like to admit getting liquored with some of you guys and stroking /u/Frock_Donghammer 's beautiful 'stash. I imagine we'll have an even larger turn out at some of the bars in Toronto. EDIT: I almost forgot about the new contest. Jesus. Been a long month. Uhh... Post what you think this ejuice is and I'll pick 3 people to win a 120ml of it + another ejuice of their choosing. Winners will be chosen when the site does launch. So tomorrow, the next day, Monday?

137,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Smooth-E Juice from Theravape,9,6ako1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6ako1w/honest_review_time_smoothe_juice_from_theravape/,2017-05-12 01:03:33,"Hey guys, Before I went to CVE Edmonton the wonderful folks from Theravape hit me up about a review of a new line they were dropping. It's based around frozen smoothie flavours and it's called Smooth-E Juice. Maybe a little on the nose if you ask me, but I definitely had fun trying them out, here are my honest thoughts on [Smooth-E Juice from Theravape](URL The set of three flavours come in 60ml clear Chubby Gorilla bottles with bright colourful labels that have a very wholesome sort of feel to them. Each one sports a picture of what the flavour is based on. All the good stuff we like to see in fine print around the sides. The line is 70vg and the ones I got were 3mg. Here's [a shot of the smooth looking bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Brazzberry](URL **(7/10)** (Blue Raspberry lovers are in for a treat with this cool and refreshing smoothie juice. Perfected for your enjoyment, even the hottest day won't slow you down.) This one was perhaps my least favorite of the line but even so it was still nice enough. It's a pretty typical blue raspberry flavour with just a touch of koolada added to give it that nice cooling sensation, not minty, just cool. Being that I'm not really a fan of blue raspberry flavours I might have been a bit biased against this one but it didn't exactly blow me away in any regard. Like I said it's pretty typical of a blue raspberry flavour but at least it's a nice one. It's full and sweet without any odd chemical taste to it and I personally really enjoyed the nice little kick of cool they added. Will it make it in to my regular rotation, likely not but fans of blue raspberry flavours will probably want to check this one out. **[OJango](URL **(7.5/10)** (It only takes two to tango, but four is more fun with OJango. Chill out with this tropical blend of orange and mango with undertones of guava and pineapple.) This one is definitely a bit more interesting. It's a nice mix of orange and mango with a bit more of a tropical punch to it with the addition of some guava and pineapple. I can pick up a little bit of the guava, but for me at least, the pineapple gets kind of lost. Where this one goes just a little bit wrong for me is I believe they used orange Creamsicle in it to give it that smoothie creaminess as I pick up just a hint of a plasticky taste I normally associate with Orange Creamsicle. It's just a hint though and doesn't really take over the flavour for me but thought I should mention it anyway. Ojango also has that little extra kick of koolada to give it that cooling sensation, it's fairly subtle in this one but it's there. Orange and mango seems to be a popular blend in the industry but I don't know if I've tried one with a creamy and cooling kick. I found with this that the mango tended to come out a bit more then the creamy orange which actually worked out great for me since I'm not much of a fan of that aspect. Smooth, tropical and creamy, this one will be nice with summer just around the corner! **[TKOhurt](URL **(8.5/10)** (Black and blue berries have a showdown in silky smooth yogurt to deliver a flavour knockout! The subtle cooling effect should help with the bruising...) This one was hands down my favorite of the line and the one I put the biggest dent in so far. Normally I don't even go for yogurt flavours but this one just hit the spot for me. It's a lovely mix of blueberry and blackberry mixed in with a traditional yogurt base and of course it's got just a hint of koolada to impart that gentle cooling sensation. The yogurt is nice and creamy without a really strong sour taste which is normally what puts me off of yogurts. I found I got a bit more blueberry then I did blackberry from it but I definitely pick up notes of both. The blueberry comes across a bit jammy and sweet just like you'd find in a tub of yogurt while the cooling effect in this gives the yogurt mix a really nice fresh taste. It keeps the flavour nice and bright despite being a rich and creamy yogurt flavour. Of the three this one had the most staying power with me and I found the creamy berry yogurt mix worked really well with that dash of koolada. ---- Overall I thought these were nicely done, made with the same quality I've come to expect from Theravape. Sure they didn't all work for me but taste is subjective and I'm sure plenty of others will enjoy them just the same. If you like smooth creamy flavours and enjoy a nice kick of koolada you'll definitely want to give these a try. So Theravape if you happen to be reading this, thanks a bunch for setting me up with these I definitely enjoyed trying them!"

139,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Charles Dinsmore and Dinsmore Reserve by Fu Man Brews,12,6bpblm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6bpblm/honest_review_time_charles_dinsmore_and_dinsmore/,2017-05-18 01:15:42,"Hey guys, The good folks over at VBI have been wonderful to me, often sending over new things for me to review. Well when I was at CVE Edmonton I had the chance to meet with Kha, the incredible man behind the [Fu Man Brews line](URL I reviewed a few months back. I always appreciate having a chance to speak with the mixologist of a line and when I did he had asked me if I'd ever tried his Charles Dinsmore line which at the time I hadn't yet had the chance. Well he assured me he'd set me up with some to review and sure enough about a week or so later they arrived at my door. I'm a huge tobacco fan so I was more than excited at the chance to check them out. Here are my honest thoughts on [Charles Dinsmore by Fu Man Brews](URL ---- Apparently there's a legend associated with the name Charles Dinsmore but my Google searches only found [a Canadian Hockey player](URL by the same name, still I thought it would be pertinent to include the story. **The Legend** Washed up on the southern shores of Japan, Charles Dinsmore - a British importer/exporter - survived his journey by trading his secrets of Turkish Tobacco with the locals for the secret fishing and farming techniques used by pre-war Okinawa townsfolk. The village and Dinsmore celebrated the trade with vanilla bourbons and toasted almonds into the wee hours of dawn. ---- The two bottles I received really couldn't be more different with one being opaque black glass and the other being clear glass. The labels too are quite different with the original Charles Dinsmore flavour following the same theme as the Fu Man Brews line, sort of pink with some lovely Asian styling while the Reserve version has a more subdued black label with yellow/gold kanji/text. Personally I think both bottles are beautifully done but I kind of prefer the clear glass and black label of the Reserve version. Both liquids are 50vg blends and the set of two I received were both 3mg. Here's [a shot of the two lovely bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. These were also tested in a Kayfun v5 mini with a 0.65ohm 38/28g clapton(sorry no pics). Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Charles Dinsmore](URL **(9/10)** (Known for their distinguished flavors, the makers of for Fu Man Brews have combined the flavor of Turkish tobacco with vanillas, bourbon, and toasted almonds to create Charles Dinsmore. Delectable tobacco flavour for mature tastebuds!) Charles Dinsmore uses a rich Turkish tobacco base but there's elements of it that remind me of a dark Cavendish or a sweet burley tobacco. It's dark and sweet and almost has a bit of spice from the fresh Turkish tobacco flavour. Turkish tobacco if you're not all that familiar with it is what an American Camel cigarette is derived from. It's more flavourful and aromatic compared to your typical Virginia blend, also a personal favorite of mine. I noticed too there's something almost floral in it that reminds me a bit of the perfume you'd get from something like a rose but it doesn't taste like a flower at all, it's almost more of a sensation. Blended in with the Turkish tobacco is a very nice sweet bourbon and light nutty flavour. The bourbon is a bit more pronounced then the almond but I still taste both elements. The vanilla aspect of it sort of comes in at the end where I pick up little bottom notes of a sweet fragrant vanilla. I wonder if maybe the vanilla was lending itself to that almost floral quality I mentioned above but can't really say for sure. Don't get me wrong it's not perfumey or floral in that sense but there's definitely something there. All in all I really enjoyed this flavour, like the description suggests it's a bit on the mature side but that's exactly how I like them. I think this will pair very nicely with a glass of Bourbon or a nice cocktail. Beautiful stuff!! **[Dinsmore Reserve](URL **(9.5/10)** (For those looking to go the extra mile, the Dinsmore Reserve is the original Charles Dinsmore E-liquid double casked in French oak and American white oak, with subtle hints of pastries and coconut for a vape experience like no other. ) Dinsmore Reserve builds squarely on the phenomenal foundation that the original Charles Dinsmore laid down. It's got the same sort of rich Turkish tobacco base with elements of vanilla, nuts and bourbon but adds even more layers of complexity with deeper notes of oak, pastries and some coconut. It's not just the same flavour done twice but it is double casked in French Oak and American white Oak which I'm guessing adds the deeper richer notes of oak to it. Whenever I hear double casked or double barreled I now think of [this story](URL from our own /u/eMixologies, not saying this is the case with Dinsmore reserve but I can't help but think about it when I hear the term. Other elements that peak out of Reserve are the pastry and coconut. The pastry for me is kind of hard to pick out but I'm guessing it adds to the richness of the flavour. If I had to guess I'd say it's maybe a touch of graham cracker or a buttery crust that they've added but again I had a hard time picking it out with so much else going on. The coconut however is quite easy to distinguish as it adds that typical almost creamy coconut flavour mostly on the backend but it definitely stands out and livens up the flavour. If you liked Charles Dinsmore you'll probably love Dinsmore Reserve as it just adds even more to enjoy to an already amazing tobacco blend. ---- I've been vaping both of these for the past week or so, mostly in a kayfun and I have to say they're some of the nicest, cleanest tobacco flavours I've tried. I know I've reviewed a slew of good tobacco flavours lately but they're all so different and amazing that any tobacco lover should definitely take the time to check them out and these are right at the top of that list. However because of the higher pg ratio, they may not appeal to everyone but I know a lot of the higher ohm, lower wattage mouth to lung crowd will definitely dig them. So to Kha and the wonderful folks over at VBI, thanks so much for sending these delights my way, they're both absolutely beautiful!! "
140,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Vape Evasion,12,6c7gog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/6c7gog/honest_review_time_vape_evasion/,2017-05-20 10:22:57,"Hey guys, Here's a line that I've really been enjoying. It's from a company out of Quebec called [Vape Evasion](URL I already know what you're thinking, 'but major it's in Quebec I can't get it here..' well I'm happy to say it is available through the awesome guys at [VapeNorth](URL no not our boys at VaporNorth, VapeNorth. A local distributor that happened to set me up with a few of them a while back and I managed to pick up the rest when I was at CVE Edmonton, direct from the incredible Vape Evasion team themselves. It's a pretty varied line but there was definitely a few standouts for me. Here are my honest thoughts on [Vape Evasion](URL The six flavours come in clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla style bottles. The labels are somewhat varied but are all nice and clean looking with the majority of them being quite bright and colourful. The line is all 70vg and the ones I picked up were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the line up](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36ni80) build from our very own /u/SaddlehorseBlues, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the fresh build](URL Descriptions from the site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Creamy Bubble Cone](URL **(9/10)** (A freshly made cone with bubblegum flavored ice cream A richness filled all day vape.) I loved bubblegum ice cream as a kid, probably cause I was almost never allowed to have it, #tigermom, I still enjoy it to this day with it's sweet creamy almost cotton candy-like taste with chunks of weird powdery bubble gum dotted throughout. This one actually does a pretty good job of tasting just like the forbidden flavour of my youth with it's rich sweet creamy bubble gum ice cream flavour but it doesn't stop there. They also threw in a fresh made cone that compliments the creamy ice cream nicely. It's like a nice warm sugar cone with that dark almost syrupy quality to it. Super creamy this one has a nice thick quality to it and kind of hits you in the corner of the mouth with it's creamy sweetness. Nice and tasty although a bit artificial tasting but then again that's what I loved about the real thing. **[Nostalgia](URL **(8.5/10)** (A creamy scoop of strawberry ice cream sprinkled with fruity pebbles cereal , sitting on top of a crunchy cone .) This one is a different take on cereal and ice cream altogether. To me it tastes like a sweet mix of fruity pebbles and fruit loops on top of a nice scoop of strawberry ice cream. There's a slight kick of citrus to it which makes me think there's fruit loops in it but the fruity pebbles is pretty obvious. If you grew up on Saturday morning cartoons and sugary cereals this is definitely nostalgic af. At first I just got the taste of fruity pebbles and fruit loops, it's almost like they're battling it out for attention, I didn't even realize at first that the underlying cream was in fact strawberry ice cream, but after the cereal sort of had it's moment in the spotlight the strawberry ice cream really crept out to let me know it was there. I actually noticed it more after setting it down for a moment and coming back to it. It's such and interesting mix that actually works quite well and both cereal and ice cream fans should really dig this. **[Trinity](URL **(8.5/10)** (A delectable blend of peach , papaya and coconut creating an excellent marriage of flavors for a kick back &amp; relax fruit vape) With Trinity right up front I get a nice sweet fuzzy peach followed by a very authentic tasting papaya. The papaya tastes so real it's almost pulpy while the peach is very much a fuzzy peach candy kind of flavour. The coconut comes in on the end and is a bit on the light side but really gives it a nice tropical sort of vibe completing the trinity so to speak. The whole thing has a very fresh fruit taste even with the bit of candy from the peach, it just kind of works and doesn't seem out of place. One thing I really like about Vape Evasion's fruit flavours is they're nicely layered with all of the key components being easy to distinguish. Really bright, fresh and authentic tasting this one will be for the tropical fruit lovers,, although I don't really consider peach a tropical fruit. **[Splash](URL **(9/10)** (strawberry kiwi with a splash of sweet goodness . A sweet and fruity all day vape.) I almost disregarded this one completely. The first few hits had a bit of a chemical taste to it but once I got past it, oh man. It ended up being one of my favorites from the line. It's a really sweet strawberry mixed with a light tart kiwi. It's sweet and tangy and really coats your mouth with flavour. I think the chemical taste I get from it actually comes from the pg peeking out, I've never really been a fan. But this is one of those flavours that it's kind of worth it for. Just the right balance of sweet and tart, sort of fresh sort of artificial but oh so addictive. Once I got going on this one I hardly put it down. Even though it really hits you in the mouth with flavour it tastes really clean while leaving a nice sweet fruity aftertaste on your tongue. I gotta say it's pretty rare for me to dig a basic fruity flavour so much but there's just something about it that I can't seem to get enough of. **[Splash on Ice](URL **(9/10)** (Splash on Ice takes the original Splash formula of sweet Strawberry and Kiwi and adds an ice cold exhale. The perfect combination for those hot summer days.) There really isn't a whole lot to say about this one, it's Splash with a shot of koolada. It's not minty like menthol or creamy like peppermint or anything like that, it just has for me the perfect amount of cool that I mostly get on the exhale. It works perfectly on flavours like Splash adding an extra little kick of freshness. It works so well in fact I really can't decide if I like the original or the on ice version better. I've been flip flopping between the two and I got to say I like them just the same, they're both fruity and fantastic. One thing about this one which might seem weird but I really liked was it reminded me of a Japanese plum flavoured gum that I loved as a kid. One of those flavours you just have to try for yourself. If you like nice bright fruit flavours with a kick of cool, this one hits the spot for me! **[Pistacholli](URL **(10/10)** (Light , fried dough gently wrapping itself around sweet , creamy ricotta filling and lightly dusted with traditional pistachios . A european classic that is soon to be your own unique favorite.) Hands down my absolute favorite of the bunch, one of my favorite new flavours in recent times and I've already gone through several bottles of this by the time I got around to reviewing the line. It's an absolutely incredible mix of sweet thick cream wrapped in a light spicy fried dough with just a touch of pistachio and powdered sugar. The cream is thick like a ricotta filling should be and the fried pastry dough with it's hint of spiciness is bang on. It might be a bit of a guilty pleasure kind of flavour since it almost seems too decadent but believe you me, I can vape this stuff all day long. It's one of the richer Cannoli flavours I've tried and tastes just like a real Cannoli should with the added touch of pistachio nuts and a nice sweet powdered sugar sort of taste. Unbelievably good stuff and a must try for dessert lovers. ---- Overall I gotta say I was mighty impressed with the line. Each one is jam packed with flavour and really well layered. Sure some of them are a bit on the sweet side but even so for the most part they were fairly decent on my coils. If any of these sound appealing to you I'd have no trouble recommending you check them out, some really great stuff here. And Abby and Jay if either of you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with these, such an incredible lineup!!"
141,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Smthen by Adrenochrome Labs,13,60o9ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/60o9ly/honest_review_time_smüthen_by_adrenochrome_labs/,2017-03-22 02:34:54,"Hey guys, Here's something I probably should have gotten to a little sooner. It's a fairly new line made by [Adrenochrome labs](URL that won best in show at CVE Ottawa called [Smthen](URL You might have heard of Adrenochrome before from their Fogging Awesome line or maybe Vice Cream. Well I was fortunate enough to be setup with a set of samples for review so here are my honest thoughts on Smthen by Adrenochrome Labs. The samples came packed in a [nice cardboard box](URL in little 10ml clear glass bottles. [Nicely presented](URL with their names and flavour profiles on the inside of the lid, they clearly have a sense of humour as shown by the little [message hidden underneath the bottles](URL The liquids are all listed as max vg and the set of samples I got was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL themselves. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Apps](URL **(9/10)** (Apple, Peach and Pear Smoothie Mixed With Vanilla Yogurt) A few years back I was really in to pear flavours but haven't really picked any up in the last little while so this was a pretty pleasant surprise when I cracked it open. It's a really nice smooth blend of apple and pear with a nice dab of vanilla cream to smooth the whole thing over. The peach in it seemed to be a minor player as I could hardly pick any of it up. Probably one of the more subtle mixes in the line it's really hard to tell where one flavour starts and the other ends but I did tend to get a bit more pear on the back end. It has an almost borderline floral quality to it but it's not enough to put me off and as I mentioned the cream really smoothes everything over, or Smthens it. Maybe it's the fact that the flavours in this one are a bit more mild but I felt like Apps was one of the more creamy flavours in the bunch. Nice and smooth!! **[Mango Slam](URL **(8/10)** (Mangos and Guava With A Hint Of Strawberry Blended Into A Smoothie) This one is much more thick then the others and I'm pretty sure it's the mango that does it. It's a thicker fruit and tends to give things a much thicker mouth feel. The guava however sort of cuts the thickness of the mango and brightens it up just a bit and possibly adds a touch of tartness. I can't really taste the strawberry in it but it's hardly missed. This to me is really a more tropical blend that has a nice thick creamy body to it. Something about it really reminds me of a mango lassi with the thick mango and rich yogurt all blended together in a smooth and creamy drink. One thing about this flavour is it has a slightly muddled flavour to it and it's a bit less bright the some of the others. But what it lacks in pop it makes up for in mouth feel and as I mentioned this one has a nice rich, thick mouth feel to it. **[Original](URL **(10/10)** (A Blend Of Orange, Strawberry and Banana Smoothie... Yum!) For some reason this reminds me so much of Orange Julius. Are they still around? It's probably been 20 years since I've had one but I still remember the sweet creamy taste of a fresh Orange Julius and even though this has strawberry and banana in it I mainly taste the creamy orange. Orange Julius if you're not familiar with it is a drink made from fresh oranges, ice, sweetener, milk, powdered egg whites and vanilla. It's an American chain franchise and was pretty much a staple in most 1980's food courts. Googling them now shows there are still a handful of locations open but I myself haven't seen one in years. If you've read some of my reviews you'll know I'm not usually a fan of creamy orange(Creamsicle) flavours as most of them tend to taste like burnt plastic well I'm more then happy to say this creamy orange mix does not. Rather then use the same Creamsicle orange flavour it's like they opted to use their own fresh orange flavour and mix it with banana to get that smooth creaminess just right. I can honestly see why this was named best in show at CVE and is now one of my favorite orange flavours!! **[Pineapple Passion](URL **(9/10)** (Pineapple Passion Fruit With Frozen Yogurt) From this one I get more pineapple then I do passion fruit, I get a sort of creamy sweet pineapple flavour. The passion fruit hardly comes through and I also don't get much of a yogurt taste from it. It's more like a super smooth and creamy pineapple gummy flavour with a touch of vanilla. Personally I really dig pineapple flavours and it's kind of nice to get one that doesn't have cinnamon in it like so many others from last year. I also appreciate the smooth creaminess of it which makes it easier to vape for long periods and takes away any bite you might possibly get from the fruit flavours in it. I'll admit it's rather a simple flavour but it just really works, at least for me. The frozen yogurt description made me think there might be some koolada or something in it but as far as I could tell there wasn't anything like that in it. Just a smooth creamy, sweet pineapple flavour that really hits the spot for me. **[Tropical Twister](URL **(8/10)** (Pineapple, Guava, Lychee and Strawberry Twisted Into A Smoothie) This one stands out because it's likely the most exotic of the bunch. Right away you get a fairly strong punch of lychee which kind of takes over the whole thing. I don't really taste much the strawberry but I do get hints of the pineapple sort of blended with the lychee. The guava also sort of takes a back seat and if anything it just helps to prop up the tartness of the lychee. I'm a huge lychee fan and this one does something really nice with it, toning it down with a nice smooth creaminess. It's still the major note in it though so this one will be mostly for fans of lychee however those who enjoy a taste of the exotic may also really enjoy this. Not sure why they've included strawberry in most of these flavours since it seemed to get lost in pretty much all of them, at least for me. It's possible it's just being used to kick up the sweetness but the flavour seems oddly absent. ---- These have to be some of the smoothest freshest tasting juices I've had in a while. All of them have very authentic tasting fruit flavours but are smoothed over with either cream or yogurt. These were getting a lot of attention at the tail end of last year and it's not hard to see why. If like me you miss summer after that long drawn out winter we just got through these might just be a nice little pickup with their bright summery flavour before the nice weather actually hits. If you've never tried Smthen I'd have no trouble recommending you go and check them out. And Adrenochrome labs if you happen to read this, thanks for setting me up with these incredible delights, I truly enjoyed trying them out!!"
142,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Currency by Premium Labs,11,612kjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/612kjd/honest_review_time_currency_by_premium_labs/,2017-03-24 02:34:20,"Hey guys, While I was at CVE Ottawa I met a gentleman from [Premium Labs](URL who set me up with several sample sets for review. This is the first of those sets and it's called [Currency](URL The line has a rather interesting theme to it with each flavour being named for a type of currency from all over the world. I've been a fan of Premium Labs stuff for quite some time and was rather pleased with this fairly new addition, I believe it dropped toward the end of last year. Here are my honest thoughts on Currency from Premium Labs. The little sample set I received came in a [neat little cardboard box](URL with all of the [flavours listed on the back](URL The bottles were only 5ml so it was a bit of a challenge formulating an opinion but from what I could taste I quite enjoyed them. The bottles are dark glass with dropper tops and the labels have a pretty cool look to them. The entire line is 75vg and the set I received were all 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets, link to the line above. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Pound** **(9/10)** (Mocha vanilla wafer crisp) Pound is a smooth creamy vanilla cream with just a touch of a mocha coffee flavour to it. I say a touch because it's a very mild addition considering mocha's such a strong flavour. For a rich dessert it's a fairly mild sort of flavour, pretty much a vanilla custard with a light mocha aspect. It's nice and smooth, a touch sweet and very creamy. The description mentioned a wafer crisp but I don't really pick up much of a bakery taste to it at all but I'm not complaining either. I'm sure vanilla and custard fans will really enjoy this one, I know I did!! **Euro** **(10/10)** (Pistachio Biscotti creme brulee) I've been really enjoying rich flavours that center around nuts and this one just made the list. It's a really nice pistachio cream with a hint of spice. I taste lingering notes of burnt sugar and caramel all floating in a nutty sort of thick creamy vanilla custard. This one has a darker feel to it, I'm assuming it's from the creme brulee which gives it a really nice depth you wouldn't get from a standard vanilla custard. The pistachio is very upfront giving the whole thing a very nutty taste but there's also a sort of cookie/bakery note which gives it that touch of spice. For me this is pretty much what I look for in a rich dessert type vape and the 5ml I had didn't last past the initial tasting. Beautiful stuff!! **Rupee** **(8.5/10)** (Mango Lassi) It's rare that I go for Indian food and not order a mango lassi. A lassi is sort of a staple of a good Indian meal, at least for me. If you've never tried a lassi, it's basically like a thick milkshake made from yogurt, water, spices and quite often fruit, like mango. A mango lassi is thick, rich, creamy, fruity and refreshing and Rupee does a pretty fantastic job of emulating the traditional treat. I pretty much get a sweet creamy light mango and yogurt lassi flavour that's smooth and delicious. The yogurt in it is really nice too, it's not too sour and doesn't taste off in anyway like so many yogurt flavour do for me. It is a touch sweet but I didn't mind it while testing it out and vaping it reminded me of finishing off a tall glass of mango lassi after a nice Indian meal. Very well balanced and one of the better mango lassi flavours I've tried! **Yen** **(9/10)** (Pineapple Melon Lychee Smoothie) You guys know I love lychee right? Well it seems I've had a string of good ones come my way lately. Here's yet another one that I quite enjoyed. It's a solid blend of lychee and pineapple and for once the lychee doesn't overpower the other elements in it, at least not all of them. Well I don't really taste much of the melon in it but I'm definitely tasting a nice mix of pineapple and lychee. It's a touch creamy too which helps to tone down any sharp or perfumey notes you might get from the lychee. Like the others, it's lightly sweet, a bit creamy and very smooth. One of the more refreshing flavours in the line and I quite enjoyed it. **Dollar** **(9.5/10)** (Cookie dough ice cream) Not sure what kind of cookie dough this is supposed to be but I mainly get a sweet creamy Oreo cookie sort of thing. It's definitely on the sweet side but really nice and tasty. Like the others have been it's super smooth and creamy but not sure I'd call it a cookie dough but it definitely tastes like a creamy ice cream cookie flavour. It does have a bit of a custard feel to it, maybe they're using a vanilla custard or cream to give it the ice cream creaminess, I'm not sure but it's definitely thick feeling. I'm a huge fan of cookie flavours and this one just hits all the spots. It's rich, it's sweet, it's got depth, it's creamy, it's smooth, basically all the things I look for in an adv. I ripped through the 5ml I got before I even started taking notes so it's pretty safe to say I enjoyed it. ---- All around very high marks and I have to say Premium Labs makes some really great stuff. I know some people don't really care for the sweetness of them but for the most part they are a very popular brand for a reason. I definitely enjoyed this Currency line and have enjoyed several of their other lines in the past so I'm really looking forward to getting to the rest of the samples they set me up with. If you haven't tried Premium Labs yet I highly recommend you do and Premium Labs if you happen to be reading this, thanks again for setting me up with the line, their absolute money!! "
143,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Origins by Moshi,11,62m00i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/62m00i/honest_review_time_origins_by_moshi/,2017-04-01 02:50:43,"Hey guys, At CVE Ottawa [Moshi](URL was launching a new line called [Origins](URL and I was fortunate enough to pick up a set for review. I'm sure most of you have heard of Moshi, they're out of Toronto and as far as I understand now, they are part of [Vape Brands International](URL but are still busy making juice. Here are my honest thoughts on Origins by Moshi. The juices come packed in nice [dark coloured cardboard boxes](URL that reflect the same design on the bottle. The bottles themselves are elegant looking with images of a recognizably iconic cityscape sprawled across them. The bottles are dark coloured glass which I always say look really nice but aren't very practical as you can't see how much liquid is left in the bottle. The line is all 80vg and the set I picked up were in 3mg. Here's a shot of the [beautifully done bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Weston Road Aloe](URL **(7/10)** (Sooth your woes with this refreshing aloe vape that hits the perfect balance to make it a great all day vape.) From this one I get a soft gentle aloe or cactus kind of flavour, like super soft. It's very smooth and mild and reminds me a bit of a soft pear flavour but one that's a bit more green tasting. It's delicately sweet but the flavour in it is really gentle, almost subtle really. I'd like to say it's full of various notes of this and that but really it has a sort of monotone taste to it. Don't get me wrong, the flavour is quite nice but it's rather one dimensional in this. It's very inoffensive so I'm sure plenty of people will enjoy it especially fans of aloe or cactus flavours but for me it's a bit too flat and for a rather exotic flavour it managed to come off just a bit bland. Almost like they're playing it safe with an exotic flavour. Nice enough but sort of lacks any pop. **[Candy Apple Bling](URL **(9/10)** (Caramel and candy apple hooking up and making beautiful things happen.) They seem so continue the trend of light and smooth with this one as it too has that super soft light taste and feel to it. I realize these are all 80vg which plays in to the smoothness of them but even then the flavours aren't exactly popping. I get a lightly sweet red apple with a very slight candy edge to it. Very mild and very soft like the last one. I get little hints of caramel, but just hints that sort of blend in with the delicate red candy apple flavour to give you a just touch of caramel apple. It's one of the lightest most delicate tasting caramel apple flavours I've ever tried and I felt I was really reaching to taste some of the elements in it. The flavour for me is almost fleeting, I mean it's definitely there just oh so light and delicate. It might sound odd but these are often the kind of flavours I enjoy for all day vapes, not specifically candy/caramel apple but those light almost fleeting flavours. They're not overbearing in any way but have just enough flavour to keep you going back for more. Delicate, delightful and definitely my favorite from the line. **[High for Kiwi](URL **(8/10)** (A palate awakening burst of kiwi and pomegranate that leave you feeling just right.) This one might be the brighter more vibrant one of the bunch with a nice mix of sweet and tart kiwi and a gentle pomegranate but even then it still has a soft, smooth almost muted feel to it just not as much as the other two. Ok so muted probably isn't the right word but these all feel very safe, like nothing in particular jumps out which may potentially offend a not so adventurous palate. As much as I can somewhat taste both of the main elements neither of them were really competing for the spotlight. I suppose I tended to get more of the pomegranate on the back end with the kiwi sort of pushing through in the front but it's like they are evenly paired, neither one really outshining the other. It's lightly sweet with just the tiniest bit of tartness from the kiwi and the pomegranate gives it a bit more of a red taste which definitely gives it just a bit more depth. I think it's an interesting blend but I really wouldn't mind it being punched up a bit cause as it stands it's quite mild. ---- All around I'll say this stuff plays it safe. What do I mean by safe? Each flavour is mild and smooth without a lot of crazy exotic standout flavours that may alienate someone tasting them. I mean even the ones that are supposed to be a bit more exotic, i.e. the kiwi, pomegranate, aloe have a very subdued and safe feel to them. Nothing in them is harsh or offensive and they each have that soft, smooth feel I tried to describe. These would be perfect for those folks who don't have the most adventurous palates but want to try something a bit different. One thing I can say is they all taste well crafted with quality ingredients as I would expect from Moshi. So if you haven't had a chance to check these out yet, I'd have no trouble recommending you do!! Huge thanks Moshi for setting me up with these!!!"
144,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Mountain Oak Vapors,13,637ce9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/637ce9/honest_review_time_mountain_oak_vapors/,2017-04-04 01:06:00,"Hey guys, Here's something from the US that's making it's way to Canada that I thought would make for an interesting review. It's a juice line that's made by one of the industry's top vape celebs Dimitris Agrafiotis otherwise known as [the Vapingreek](URL aka [Phil Busardo's](URL main squeeze. It's made by his company [Mountain Oak Vapors](URL out of Tennessee but is now being distributed all the way up here in Canada. I've seen announcements all over the place that's it's coming to Canada and it's finally starting to become available in various shops. I found the line at [VapeVapeVape](URL Here are my honest thoughts on a selection from Mountain Oak Vapors. The set it made up of a variety of flavours from several of their lines but they come together in a set in 60ml chubby gorilla bottles. The labels have a unified look to them but still depict the original images from each flavour. The line is all 70vg and the ones I picked up were 3mg. The labels have a sort of utilitarian look to them, maybe related to impending regulations but they still manage to look nice. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Red Drop](URL **(7/10)** (Red Drop is a Mountain Oak Vapors take on a Raspberry Limeade type flavor. This is a tart &amp; sour limeade with a healthy splash of raspberry, the combination makes for a refreshingly flavorful vape! If you love drinking limeades, don't miss out on this! It is sure tickle your taste buds and satisfy your flavor cravings. Red Drop has been our best seller since the day it was released, find out why today.) This one was probably my least favorite of the line but even then it was still pretty decent. It's a raspberry limeade flavour with a good punch of lime up front and a flush of red on the back end. I found the raspberry component of it is quite mild and doesn't really come to the front but just gives the whole thing a nice sort of hint of red. For a tart flavour it has a rather soft feel to it and unfortunately the lime gives me a bit of that waxy flavour I'm not a fan of. It's not too sweet nor is it all that sour, for me it's just a soft lime flavour with a dash of raspberry. There's nothing particularly bad about this I just kind of expected a bit more punch out of a tangy limeade flavour, well that and I'm not a fan of the waxy flavour. I understand there's a newer lime flavouring out there that doesn't really have that waxy flavour and I'd love to see it used in this. **[The Harvey](URL **(8.5/10)** (The Harvey is an all new E-Liquid from Mountain Oak Vapors. Inspired by National Comedian and Radio Talk show Host Jerry Harvey, The Jerry Harvey is a complex and delicious blend of dark, oak barrel aged bourbon, toasted coconut, and brown sugar balanced by authentic Bavarian sweet cream. ) This stuff is a beautiful blend of bourbon, brown sugar, coconut and Bavarian cream. Right off the hop I get really rich notes of bourbon and brown sugar with a gentle creamy sweetness that sort of lingers on the lips. The toasted coconut is fairly upfront and mixes really well with the oaky notes of the bourbon. The brown sugar gives it a bit more of that dark sweetness while the Bavarian cream smooths the whole thing over taking any edges off the sharper flavours and giving it a light creamy feel. It has a very realistic boozy quality to it that I really enjoyed and it's definitely one of the more mature flavours from the line. It's fairly strong with a deep bold flavour and I'm pretty sure fans of rich alcoholic flavours are going to love this one. **[White Lotus](URL **(8/10)** (White lotus is a velvety blend of tropical fruits and cream that will leave you floating in an island breeze. This line of e-liquid was produced in collaboration between Vintage Vapors and Mountain Oak Vapors. We have come together to bring you the quality and knowledge from two great e-liquid companies.) White Lotus is a nice fruity tropical mix of papaya, apricot and nectarine. For me I mainly get the papaya and apricot mix with the nectarine sort of coming in on the back end, almost leaving an orangy aftertaste of it. It's one of the fruitier and maybe sweeter flavours from the line. The papaya lends to that tropical taste but I find it also gives it a sort of thickness, like the way a glass of papaya juice has that thick feel to it so does this flavour. You can definitely taste the apricot in it but it's almost like it's just there to brighten up the papaya and not really shine too much on it's own. Overall a really nicely done tropical blend but not something I'm really drawn to either. **[Rangler](URL **(10/10)** (Rangler is an all new Smooth Tobacco Flavored E-Liquid from Mountain Oak Vapors. We started with a light touch of the traditional RY4 Flavors of Caramel and Vanilla and added a hint of Hazelnut. Rangler is a High VG E-Liquid which means that it contains at least 70% VG to deliver maximum vapor with every puff! ) This is a smooth full bodied tobacco with a nice nutty sweetness to it. It's basically a classic RY4 with nice rich caramel notes and a good shot of hazelnut. The tobacco flavour is more of a light dry tobacco and doesn't give that wet soggy tobacco taste that I can't stand. For a tobacco flavour it's a bit on the sweeter side which I'm sure comes from the RY4 and caramel components of it. No complaints from me though as I tend to prefer them that way. It's incredibly smooth and full of flavour and I had a real hard time putting this one down to go on to the next. It reminds me just a bit of my all time favorite tobacco flavour NX and is a new favorite to add to the list of really well done tobacco flavours. Rich nutty tobacco fans should really check this one out!! **[Mojit-Ohh](URL **(8/10)** (Mojit-Ohh The perfect leafy, mint flavor with a sweet strawberry kiss.) This one smacks you right in the mouth with a bright fresh mint flavour that's fairly strong, almost a spearmint type of mint. It's complimented with a rather light, sweet strawberry flavour. The mint definitely takes the lead in this one but doesn't completely take over. The strawberry like I mentioned is light and I kind of wish it had a bit more punch to it. As it is it's sort of like a watered down strawberry drink with a strong hit of mint. It's a nice strawberry though, it doesn't taste too artificial or too jammy, more like a strawberry water or aqua fresca kind of thing. It's a fairly simple blend and for a mojito flavour I quite enjoyed it. With all that mint, this one is super refreshing and will be a great summer time vape for the warmer days ahead. ---- Overall I have to say these were really well done, they cover a decent range of profiles and I'm sure most anyone could find something among them that they'd enjoy. I'll admit I was a little hesitant to review the line being that [I'm a big fan of Dimitris](URL but they didn't disappoint and I even found a new favorite tobacco in the line. I'm hoping to bump in to him and Phil at CVE Edmonton this week cause it just wouldn't be an expo without them. And Mr. Agrafiotis if you happen to read this, thank you for bringing your lovely juice north of the border, I for one really appreciate it!!"

147,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Watt's Up V1&amp;2 by River City Vapes,15,63enc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/63enc8/honest_review_time_watts_up_v12_by_river_city/,2017-04-05 01:05:30,"Hey guys, Maybe it's because CVE Edmonton is coming up but I've had quite a few vendors reach out to me recently to send stuff over for review. Among them is one of the presenting sponsors of the expo [River City Vapes](URL and former vape reviewer [Gaslight Vapes](URL aka Dave Gaslight Billey. If I'm not mistaken the liquids he sent over for review are his own creations and with several years of experience not only vaping but reviewing I'm pretty sure he's got a good grip on what works and what doesn't. Here are my honest thoughts on Watt's Up and Watt's Up V2. The two sets I received came in 30ml squishy plastic bottles with the long thin tips. While they don't exactly look premium they're actually among my favorite bottles to use cause they're nice and soft and the tips fit just about anything. The labels vary from one set to the other with the older Watt's up line sporting mostly white labels with a spirographic bit of art along with the name of the flavour while the newer Watt's Up V2 labels are basically all white with the name of the flavour in a stylized bubble font. I wonder if impending regulations may have a role in the design strategy but they're clean and simple and do the job so no complaints here. The original line is available in a few different ratios but I believe the ones I got were max vg like the V2 line and all of them had 3mg nic. I'm also told none of the liquids contain any extra sweeteners as well they're all Diacetyl and AP free. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL I received. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Watt's Up** **[Bad attytude](URL **(8/10)** (Boston banana cream dessert) I was pretty excited to try this one cause I'm a big fan of Boston cream pies but when I cracked it open I found it wasn't quite what I was expecting. To me this ends up as more of a banana cream pie as opposed to Boston Cream pie as I don't quite pick up any chocolate from it. I get a sweet creamy banana with a bit of a banana candy note to it. It's super smooth and almost thick tasting and finishes with a nice little touch of spice. It really reminds me of a banana cream pie with a nice graham crust. Even though these don't have any added sweetener it's still a touch sweet which I'm guessing comes from a bit of candy banana or something like that in it. Very smooth and creamy and it has quite a thick mouth feel to it. Even though it didn't have the chocolate I was hoping for it was still quite tasty and probably one of the better banana flavours I've tried lately. **[Ramped Up](URL **(8/10)** (Freshly baked peanut butter cookie) With two kids peanut butter cookies are very popular around my house so I quite enjoyed this one, but it's not exactly your typical peanut butter cookie. It's like a mix of rich creamy peanut butter with an Italian cinnamon sugar cookie base. While I wouldn't say it exactly captures the essence of a classic peanut butter cookie it definitely hits the spot with it's unique blend of spice and nuts. Actually it's pretty different from any cookie flavour that I've tried but still has some really familiar elements. Most likely because of the cinnamon cookie it has just a touch of that dryness you often get with cinnamon, not enough to bother me but thought it should be mentioned. Of all the flavours in the two lines, this is the only one that I wouldn't have minded being just a touch sweeter, but like I said as it is, it's still darn tasty!! **[18-6-fiddy](URL **(10/10)** (A double chocolate chunk cookie) This stuff is absolutely incredible and it might be the closest thing I've tasted to a proper chocolate chip cookie yet. It reminds me a lot of the [Decadent Chocolate Chip Cookies from President's Choice](URL that my kids and I both enjoy. It even manages to give you a bit of that semi-sweet chocolate flavour of the chips with a rich fresh baked cookie flavour underneath. It's lightly sweet and really smooth, almost creamy and absolutely delicious. After trying this one out it came straight to work with me which for me is rather high praise as I only tend to take my absolute favs to work. While I do love cookie flavours, most of the ones I have really loved have been Oreo or cinnamon, this one is like a classic chocolate chip cookie and I couldn't be any happier with it. Definitely makes the list of top cookie flavours for me. **Watt's Up V2** **[Patty](URL **(8/10)** (Peppermint Patty. Just like you remember.) I've tried quite a few chocolate mint flavours in the past year and I'm pretty sure they're all cut from the same cloth, or rather the same flavouring. I don't really think you could mess this one up, it's just chocolate and mint and it tastes pretty much exactly like a York Peppermint Patty or an After Eight Dinner mint. Crisp and minty, smooth and creamy with a nice dark chocolate middle. Wait what? Isn't the chocolate on the outside? Not in this, I get the creamy mint up front with the smooth dark chocolate coming out on the finish. I'm pretty sure I've tasted at least a couple others just like it but it's kind of become one of those staple flavours and RCV does it very well!! **[Larry](URL **(9/10)** (A refreshing Cherry Lime rickey) When Dave contacted me he mentioned he was curious to see how his Cherry Lime flavour stacked up against a Cherry Lime flavour that I recently reviewed [here](URL on reddit. While I don't think it's going to take the title from The Hardest I'll definitely give it a very close second. It's really beautifully done and honestly it does't quite compare to the other flavour as it's a bit closer to a Lime Rickey then it is to a limeade like The Hardest. Larry has a really nice lime up front with a sweet cherry mid note and a little something reminiscent of an alcoholic drink on the bottom end that I can't quite pin down. The cherry seems a touch sweeter and almost syrupy compared to The Hardest giving it an entirely different feel. It's not really waxy at all like so many lime flavours are for me. It's a bit tart but not biting, a bit sweet but doesn't taste sweetened, it's just a really beautifully done lime rickey or about as close to one as I've tasted! **[Jane](URL **(9/10)** (Vanilla. Plain Jane vanilla.) I started vaping on vanilla custards and they're what got me off the smokes so even though this might be touted as a plain Jane vanilla that description hardly does it justice. It's a beautifully done classic vanilla pudding or custard that's light, smooth, creamy and sweet. It's not over complicated with layers and layers of flavours and ten kinds of vanilla, no it's just a pretty plain and simple vanilla vanilla but one that's done pretty much perfectly. Nothing unusual or extreme with this one and for me it's all day vape material. Light on the palate but still packed with flavour, one of those flavours that would be really hard to get bored of and pretty much a staple with new and old vapers. ---- All around very high marks for Watt's Up V1 &amp; 2 and I have to say I was quite impressed. I'm pretty sure Dave's experience with juice has helped make these what they are and I for one really enjoyed them. They all seem carefully crafted and the fact that none of them depend on sweeteners to make them tasty is even that more impressive. From what I understand they're currently only available through their website and through [902 Vapes](URL in PEI, but hopefully we'll start to see these make their way in to other shops. And Dave if you happen to read this, huge thanks brother for setting me up with these. You sir make some damn fine juice!! See you in a few days!!!"

149,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Quest by eVape,7,63mkox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/63mkox/honest_review_time_quest_by_evape/,2017-04-06 02:23:31,"Hey guys, With CVE Edmonton starting this week I've been busy trying to clear out some of the stuff I got from CVE Ottawa. One of the sets I've been eager to get to is from a company called [eVape](URL They've been around for quite a while but it was only at CVE Ottawa that I first saw them. I may be mistaken but I believe they were just launching their own line of juice called [Quest](URL I was fortunate enough to pick up a set and I'm quite happy I did. Here are my honest thoughts on Quest by eVape. The liquids come in dark brown glass bottles with mostly brown labels that evoke a sort of Safari kind of vibe. As much as I really dug the bottles and matching label design they're one of those lines that have obscure names which don't say much about the flavour and with no image or text on the bottle to denote what they are you'll have to remember which one is which. Kind of a pain but nothing we haven't seen before. Aside from that, all the usual stuff we like to see in fine print. The line is actually 60vg which they claims is to support the widest array of devices and as much as I'm not a fan of many higher pg juice I have to say these were all really nice without that typical pg twang I can't stand. The set I picked up were all 3mg and here's [a fancy pants shot of the bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Velocity](URL **(9/10)** (Experience a truly sour, yet sweet vape, combined with just enough of a lime undertone to compliment the flavour. This is a must try vape that is sure to please. ) For fans of bright tart sour flavours this one is pretty unique and just might be worth checking out. It's like a mix of sweet, sour, candy and then lime. It really smacks you in the mouth with it's sweet and sour tang yet as bright and tart as it is it's not sharp or biting. It's a bit on the sweet side but that sweetness compliments the punch of sour you get from it really well. The lime doesn't have that waxy taste I don't like at all or at least it's being covered up by the punch of sweet and sour. As much as lime is one of the few actual named flavours in it, it's not the primary note I pick up. It's more like the sweet and sour come first with a touch of lime on the end. It's probably something like malic acid and sweetener that's giving it the sweet sour taste but the lime keeps it from being just another candy type of flavour. This one is definitely different but so dang tasty!! **[Everest](URL **(7/10)** (A strong and sharp menthol vape perfectly complimented by a smooth peppermint exhale. This vape provides a sharp and satisfying throat hit. A great liquid for menthol lovers! ..) This one is like an icy blast of minty freshness, like vaping straight Chiclets or white Tic Tacs. I think I get a bit of vanilla in there with the peppermint but then it's just straight menthol. I could smell this one long before I even opened the bottle and knew that it was going to be strong. I'll admit, I'm not a huge fan of plain minty menthol so this one isn't exactly for me but it definitely gets points for it's accuracy. Simple and straightforward, not much to talk about here. Folks who enjoy a good strong menthol flavour will probably enjoy this or you know, if you have a bad cold or something this would probably help!! **[Karma](URL **(8/10)** (This is an intriguing variety of sweet fruit and ripe berries infused with a noticeable kiwi undertone. A strong sweet flavour that is sure to be a favorite amongst fruit lovers. ) I spent a lot of time with this one, trying to pick out the fruits and berries in it but all I could come up with was apricot, maybe some raspberry and some tart kiwi on the back end. It's a really interesting mix that's a bit tropical but also a bit familiar. It's fairly sweet but not super bright, it's almost like a fruit juice as opposed to a fresh fruit taste, like a bunch of fruits mashed together in to a juicy blend. It reminds me a bit of a tropical punch but not like the typical red artificial ones most people are used to, more like those fresh made ones you get at a brunch/buffet made with a mix of real fresh fruit. Juicy, refreshing and for a mystery blend of fruit I quite enjoyed this one but it's also one of those blends I find hard to describe. **[Climax](URL **(7/10)** (This sophisticated flavour is dominated by an incredibly accurate strawberry and complimented with cream, custard and hints of vanilla and marshmallow. A smooth yet satisfying throat hit makes for a fantastic all day vape. ) I'm a bit picky when it comes to strawberry cream flavours, might have something to do with the fact that I've probably tried hundreds of them at this point. This one isn't too bad but didn't completely win me over either. It's a fairly sweet and very slightly perfumey tasting strawberry flavour with a light vanilla cream almost custardy finish. I taste a touch of the marshmallow in the aftertaste but it's not very distinct in the mix. Again it might be the higher pg but it has a rather thin feel to it for a creamy flavour and it sort of left me with a slight chemical taste on the tongue and a bit of a kick in the throat, just slight though. The strawberry flavour although leaning towards realistic was a bit too strong and perfumey for me and I kind of wish the two flavours were inversed, as in more cream and less strawberry. For me personally I'm not sure that I could vape this one all day but I'm sure fans of strawberry cream flavours will dig it. **[Discovery](URL **(9/10)** (A bold blend of aromatic tobacco complimented by subtle sweet tones with a hint of spice. Designed to satisfy those switching from smoking tobacco and vapers who love tobacco e-liquids. The sharp and satisfying throat hit gives this flavour a unique and enjoyable character. ) This is a very bold tobacco and much less sweet then Epiphany which is also a tobacco flavour from the line. The tobacco has a fresher taste to it but not quite that wet taste I don't care for. It has a very slight bite to it, like it's almost sharp but very enjoyable. I'm not sure what spice it is they refer to in the description but I'm pretty sure it's lending itself to that bit of bite. I found that sharper edge kind of calms down after vaping on it for a while and gives over to a very nice light sweetness. It's pretty mature for a tobacco flavour but being a fan of tobaccos I quite enjoyed it and I could imagine people fresh off the smokes will dig this one for it's slight kick and very true to life tobacco taste. **[Epiphany](URL **(8.5/10)** (A smooth tobacco blend with a noticeable sweet dessert undertone. A popular choice for tobacco enthusiasts. ) Compared to Discovery this is a much sweeter RY4 type of tobacco, almost too sweet. It's very caramel forward with the darker sweeter notes coming out up front and a soft light dry tobacco trailing on the end. In fact I hardly get much of a tobacco at all and really find it's almost more of a dessert flavour then it is a tobacco. But the tobacco is there it's just a fairly mild addition to the flavour and gets somewhat buried under all that caramel and sweetness. I know when I first got in to tobacco flavours these were the kinds of tobaccos I gravitated to but as my tastes matured I started seeking out tobaccos that were a bit less sweet. Still my favorite tobacco flavour though is essentially an RY4 type of flavour so I definitely appreciate this one I just enjoyed Discovery a tiny bit more. **[Tranquility](URL **(10/10)** (A baked cookie blend with hints of chocolate, vanilla, caramel and butterscotch. This vape has an amazing after taste, and fills the room with the smell of freshly baked cookies. ) I love cookie flavours so when I read the description of this one I had to try it first. It did not disappoint! I will say it doesn't taste exactly like any cookie I can particularly identify but it definitely tastes like cookies. A creamy, sweet, caramel and chocolate cookie that's a bit creamy and chock full of flavour. It's got little notes of everything in the description, chocolate, vanilla, caramel and even a touch of butterscotch on the tail end. I found some of the notes sort of come and go with the caramel and vanilla having the most staying power. The chocolate is fairly light but still pokes through from time to time. The smell of this one is just fantastic and even the wife commented on how good it smelled when vaping it. Most likely it's just the 40pg in it but it has just the slightest and I mean slightest bit of a throat hit. Not enough to put me off in anyway and I barely put this one down after opening it. Fans of rich bakery type dessert flavours will really dig this one!! ---- In the 'mission statement' for this line they mention it was designed from the ground up to stand out and set the benchmark for ""Premium"", while that's a pretty bold statement I have to say they did a pretty fantastic job of it. Does it actually set the benchmark for premium? Probably not but these are definitely what I'd consider premium crafted flavours. Each and every one is well layered and well conceived with plenty of little nuances to enjoy. All of the flavours were nice and smooth and even though the line is only 60vg I never got that weird twang I get from higher pg liquids. So if you haven't given them a try yet, I'd have no trouble recommending you do. Looks like they'll be at CVE Edmonton so if you're attending it'll be a good chance to try them out. And Evape, if you happen to be reading this, thanks so much for setting me up with these, they really are fantastic!!"
150,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,We are launching our new line Prima: Spring Equinox at CVE Edmonton!,5,63nc3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/63nc3m/we_are_launching_our_new_line_prima_spring/,2017-04-06 04:15:48,"Hey guys! Milan here from True Northern! I wanted to let you guys know that we are going to be launching our new line Prima: Spring Equinox at CVE! If you have tried our lines before, you are probably familiar with our unique approach to profiles. If you have never had the chance, we strive to produce creative and authentic profiles and Prima is no exception. We have worked long and hard to develop these blends and we really hope you love them as much as we do. There are two flavours in the line **The Shield** : An ode to the fresh forest air of Ontario and the great Canadian Shield, with forest berries. I shit you not it tastes like nature. **Siegla** : An authentic take on the sour sweetness of thick and creamy Icelandic yogurt with field berry jam. [Here's a teaser of the line branding and a deeper look at the two flavours!](URL [Here's some glamour shots of the boxes, they come in 60ml bottles](URL I am so looking forward to meeting the bunch of you folks headed to Edmonton for CVE this week! It's gonna be an absolute blast! TLDR : True Northern has new shit, come to booth #419 at CVE and try a vape that tastes like nature."

Hope everybody is doing well! We've got some FFS we wanna talk about (Fancy French Stuff), so let's get to it! &amp;amp;nbsp; This trade show, we won't be attending CVE (as an exhibitor), but rather to lend a hand to another brand we are bringing in Canada, as well as to personally walk the show and just enjoy it! &amp;amp;nbsp; During my last vape trade show in NYC (VapEvent Brooklyn), I had the great pleasure to meet Claude Henaux, a French designer of high end mini mech mods that are real pieces of art! Claude is known France-wide and in Europe for his innovative, unique and high end artisanal expertise. &amp;amp;nbsp; The highest quality leathers in the world is what's being used to make these. We're talking alligator leather wrapped ecigs, lizard skin, STINGRAY leather, 50 shades of gold (plated), diamonds in some of them. They are the most aesthetically pleasing ecigs I've had the pleasure to lay eyes on. All hand crafted in France by skilled artisans, Claude Henaux Paris' products are basically the ''Rolls Royce of vaping'', as mentioned by french vaping bloggers &amp;amp; reviewers. &amp;amp;nbsp; Claude's passion for high end then translated into a Beautiful lineup of e-liquids. 12 flavors, 60 VG, Mouth-to-lung optimized (but phenomenal on a dripper too!), and so I would like to invite you guys to visit us at CVE and try this beautiful lineup that puts a lot of ejuices to shame! (mine included, haha). &amp;amp;nbsp; Claude does not use ANY american-made flavoring, purely European (and hard to find) extracts. Pair this with one of the best German engineered VG and no sweeteners/colourings, we can promise you you're in for a treat! &amp;amp;nbsp; Flavor profiles are not too simple, and not overly complex either. Simply perfectly balanced, original blends, that pop in the mouth and roll off the tongue and nostrils as a velvety cloud of pure awesomeness. The 100% Euro add an extra layer of ivenevertastedthisbeforeness. &amp;amp;nbsp; There's some interesting flavors in the tea range that taste ultra authentic (basically the best teas I've ever vaped), some solid tobaccos (some with hints of wood and leather, wink wink /u/majorvapes), and some unusual mixes such as cucumber+citrus, lime cookie, blackcurrant mint, etc. &amp;amp;nbsp; The 30ml's will retail soon in Canadian shops for 24$, and we'll be running a buy-2-get-1-free promotion for the show. With 12 flavors to choose from, it's almost guaranteed you'll find something you like. &amp;amp;nbsp; Oh, and fun fact: the original price of these (in Europe) is 24 Euros. This translates to pretty much 35 CAD for a 30ml haha. But Claude is a smart man, and so we've adapted it to better fit the Canadian market by simply switching out the Euro sign for a dollar sign, leaving the number untouched at 24. &amp;amp;nbsp; Overall, a phenomenal and interestingly unique vaping experience. I know the pricey 30ml stuff isn't our forte here in CECR, but I can assure you this stuff is worth trying, and the craftsmanship of the mods themselves is a breathtaking sight! &amp;amp;nbsp; We hope to see you all there, and be able to put some faces on the reddit usernames of Western Canada! &amp;amp;nbsp; The eMixologies &amp;amp; Claude Henaux Team"

155,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Fuman's CVE perspective for those who couldnt make it,13,64ja4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/64ja4w/fumans_cve_perspective_for_those_who_couldnt_make/,2017-04-10 22:30:12,"OK, so im making a post about my experiences with CVE since like a lot of folks, I just could never make it out to toronto or out east at all for an expo like this. So maybe i can share my experiences with some folks out there on what it was like. Its a little daunting at first, but luckily I met /u/EvilKlownz early on and we toured the show pretty much together for a lot of it. I found it really helps to have a friend with you when you talk with most vendors, especially most vendors not active on reddit. Theyre much more open to actually talking about juices and it feeling more like a trade show, versus ""hey this is our juice, try it on our pico and vote for us best in show thanks, 60ml is 20 bucks"" which i heard too many times to count. Second, seek out the reddit vendors immediately, We used the vapor junkie booth as a sort of base of operations so we could meet up with other redditors there, and go get food together, or just take a break from walking or what have you. the VJ guys are fucking awesome and special props to /u/baggedmilk and /u/aepko for being super cool with some of us more introverted online types. Also, jon 100% reminds me of the white guy in half baked (for reference URL ) Dont buy any juice right away. theres going to be LOTS of opportunity to buy juice. I could only make it saturday so I couldnt wait till blowout sunday, I picked what I Paid for very carefully, since i love grape juices, I couldve picked up a whole shitload, But the problem is the grapes coming out now are all starting to taste the same. Im sure this is a problem for a lot of different flavors as people order from the same flavor companies. Try stuff that normally wouldnt be in your profiles, or even style of vaping. E-Mixologies has brought his claude henaux line with the man himself to the event, and even tho I am not a generally an MTL vapor, and deff not a tobacco vapor, His line surprised the shit out of me enough to buy an entire 12 bottle setup. And we had some fun between evil, and e-mix himself, we decided to try sub-ohming his polar menthol vape and it was surprisingly fantastic at 51w, it almost killed e-mix at 80w tho but was very fun to watch. Also pay special attention to new companies or juices from companies you like. True Northern is a company I have heard very little about, But the single best flavor profile I tried at the show, (and I did end up buying a bottle, and will need to buy more bottles soon) Was 'the Shield' Im not going to review it cause thats not my thing, but its fucking good. if you like berries, and dont want another fucking x-berry and cream vape, you will love this juice. Also /u/Frock_Donghammer has probably the most boss mustache of all time. Hardware was not very well shown at the expo at all. I didnt see any chinese manufacturers at all. some high end mech mods, Rogue was there. again not really my thing. I would've liked to see wismec/joyetech, smok, aspire make a presence and peddle their hardware, since thats what I love to collect personally. I did find 180 smoke to have the best price on the hardware I was looking for, which was several AL85 kits, For the guys I work with, I felt this would be the best and most affordable way for hookah smokers to make the switch (they of course asked me to pick them up something for them prior to going). and that was about it, Deffinately bring a backpack of some sort to carry everything around in and water is a must, but a lot of vendors do have water at their booths and will offer it if looks like you could use it. I do want to special shout out /u/corycher /u/majorvapes /u/TheVaporist /u/Saddlehorseblues /u/eoszlak and the guys at PG Vapor in BC if they ever get on the reddits. It was fantastic meeting you all, and I feel like I could hang out and chat and just have a great time with you all making jokes and talking about different random stuff.

It turned out to be so much more than that. I got a huge chance to meet, hang out and really get to know some of the people and vendors that are a big part of our little section of Reddit. That made the show for me. Talking to the vendors that are regulars on here really showed me how lucky we are to have them as part of our community. The after the show shenanigans was the real fun. Most of the vendors I met that are not part of Reddit were hit an miss. There were a lot of pitch men who cared more about sales and unlike most of the vendors there, they had no passion for what they made, it was more about making money. When I spoke to True Norther, Vjuice, Norther Nectar and SaddleHorseBlues There was true passion in what they are about. That is why they will get my business every time. There were some celebrity vendors who were there in incognito mode. Phil The Vaporist. Nothing like I expected at all. A great man, and a better human being than I will ever be. So approachable and funny as fuck. MajorVapes. A real chill guy and he is just the nicest guy. He goated me to book CVE Toronto. He will regret that...... Fumanchuaeon. Great guy, had a blast walking the show with him. DO NOT challenge him to a vape-off. You will lose and lose badly. SaddleHorseblues. Husband and wife team. They are both the kindest and generous people I have ever met. They both help set up Vapor junkies booth and supplied the coils for the testers. That speaks about who they are as people. PG Vapor. 2 guys that are super nice and have passion for what they do. I wish them success and will hit them up when I am in town. TL:DR. There were some great deals on juice and hardware ( $6 25r and 30Q) and if you have a chance to go to Toronto, do it, you won't regret it. Edit: didn't bring up Vapor Junkie as everyone knows how awesome they are on here.. It was amazing how many people walked up to Aepko and acknowledge his role on Reddit. Aepko was also very kind to me and the rest of the guys. "

And it's going to be long. For those of you I didn't meet, my name is Milan, and I am the graphic designer and mixologist for a small company out of Calgary, Alberta called True Northern. We decided to scrounge up every bit of cash we could, spend a ton of money on a booth and printing for CVE. We were terrified. While people love us for our inventive and creative complex mixtures, we had serious doubts about trying to even push into a larger market than we were already in, and had no idea how we would be received. We have never been to an expo, let alone really too far out of Calgary. I am an anxious mess and really struggle talking to new people, and I had to play a sales person this weekend which is something I'm not used to. But every single one of you I met, made this one of the most memorable weekends of my young life this far. And I wanted to thank all of you from the deepest part of my heart to the very tips of my immaculately waxed moustache. First off probably the dudes I annoyed the most this weekend as I spent every free moment at their booth, my main men and yer favourites, /u/aepko and /u/baggedmilk . Alex put this whole thing into perspective for me. Not only is he one of the most down to earth people and easy to talk to folks I've ever met, but I shit you not this guy has done nothing but help guide me all weekend. As a young business that is just now starting to grow, we've been flying blind and his guidance and mentor ship will be critical in us moving forward. I can't thank this guy enough for everything he has taught me. Nick is my fucking dude. Hes best friend materiel, dope as folk get. /u/majorvapes &amp; /u/thevaporist it was an absolute pleasure to meet the two of you, especially at the same time! Major, I truly hope you enjoy the new flavours, I look forward to hearing your thoughts, we worked hard on the authenticity and I know you appreciated that, and I thank you for the support!!! Phil, my man, we will be seeing you at Toronto, hopefully with a double booth! /u/evilklownz , /u/fumanchuaeon, /u/Corycher and /u/totalicon it was such a pleasure meeting you guys. Some of the most unique and lovely people I have ever met. I never expected to get the response I did from you fellows, and I can't thank you enough for putting up with my obnoxious pitches hahaha. If I missed anyone let me know, because I want to personally thank you for your love and support with our wacky bullshit, and I hope our juices put a smile on your face :) Edit: Fuck me, my dude /u/vendetta44, absolutely killer flavours! I didn't even know you were from Calgary, we gotta bro out and mix sometime! And /u/totalicon it was awesome meeting you too! Big love to everyone. You've all made my life a little richer. Milan "

164,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Tempest E-juice,12,65vvla,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/65vvla/honest_review_time_tempest_ejuice/,2017-04-18 00:30:53,"Hey guys, Just before I left for CVE a package arrived from [Tempest Ejuice](URL A new kid on the block here that just [recently introduced themselves](URL They reached out for a review and even though I have a mountain of stuff from CVE to get to, they were in line first. Looking at their site and their offerings I was sort of expecting yet another budget ejuice line with pretty standard offerings but was actually quite impressed with what I received. So here are my honest thoughts on Tempest Ejuice. The samples I received came in little 10ml clear plastic sample bottles with simple black labels and white child proof caps. No fine print on these but to be fair real estate is limited on these little tiny labels. The PG/VG ratios vary but they list them out rather specifically on their site so I'll mention them with their descriptions. The set I received was in 3mg and here's [a shot of the bottle](URL I received. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Churros](URL **(7.5/10)** (Your favourite south of the border treat. Churros captures a perfect balance between cinnamon, brown sugar and creamy pastry. If you're looking for an all day vape, that even Trump can't hate, youve found it. 80vg) I've tried a lot of churro and cinnamon sugar flavours and I must say this one is just a little bit different. It seems it focuses much more on the fried dough aspect of a churro then it does the cinnamon sugar part. It's a pretty rich tasting fried dough with a brown sugar almost syrupy sweetness to it and just a very light dusting of cinnamon which I pick up on the tail end. Something about it is very familiar but I can't quite place my finger on it and it sort of reminds me of an SZ flavour but which one eludes me. I found it starts off quite rich and nice but sort of goes a bit flat after a while and I'm not able to pick out much after the first few minutes. It's still very pleasant though and rich dessert lovers will should really dig it. It's not sharp or dry from the cinnamon as it's such a light component. I thought it was pretty decent and for a cinnamon sugar flavour it's definitely a bit different from the norm. **[Grapple](URL **(9/10)** (Tired of fruit flavours that substitute sweetener for great taste? Grapple provides the balance with a candied grape and authentic apple flavour. Quit killing your coils with all that sugar, and start enjoying grapple instead. 79vg) I honestly wasn't really expecting to like this one but it took me by surprise and ended up being probably my favorite from the line. It's a nice mix of grape candy with a sweet red apple undertone. It leaves a nice apple juice and grape candy flavour on the tongue without tasting super artificial or chemical laden. Ok so it's not like it's using authentic fresh tasting fruit flavours and it doesn't exactly mimic the legendary Grapple fruit but what it does use just seems to work, at least for me. A [Grapple](URL if you've never tried one is an apple that actually tastes like a grape, a concord grape. It's not the first cross over fruit to exist either and much like cotton candy grapes I'm not sure of the sorcery or science involved in making one fruit taste like another but whatever, I'm in!! This obviously can't look like one thing and taste like another since it's an eliquid so instead it blends the two flavours into a unique yet tasty mix. I must say, they did a commendable job and I definitely enjoyed it!! **[Lemon Pound Cake](URL **(9/10)** (This juice puts the emphasis where it should be. Rich cake flavour makes way for an awesome sweet lemon finish. Lemon pound cake like your mom used to make, not your mother-in-law's. 85vg) Right away this one hits me with a really nice authentic tasting lemon pound cake flavour. I can even taste a drizzle of glaze on top of it. It took me back to the days when my mom would bake pound cake and my brother and I would fight over the first piece when it was still warm out of the oven, lemon being one of my favorite types of pound cake. It's got a nice soft lemon tang with an undeniable cake flavour that pretty much perfectly emulates a fresh baked pound cake. I did find the cake aspect would sometimes drop off just the tiniest bit leaving me with an almost spicy sort of warm lemon flavour but then it would come right back and smack me in the mouth. Smooth and tasty this one doesn't have any bite to it or anything from the lemon and it's got just the right amount of sweetness to it. **[Mixed Berry](URL **(6/10)** (Quit over-thinking it. Strawberry, blueberry and raspberry make up this collection. Natural fruit flavour, sweet and tart. That's it - simple. 80vg) Most of you know I'm not the biggest fan of mixed berry flavours mostly for the fact you usually can't pick out many of the individual flavours in them. This one isn't really an exception, it's a mix of strawberry, blueberry and raspberry. Upfront I get a strong smell of strawberry but mostly taste the blueberry mixed with raspberry. When vaping it, the strawberry somehow just isn't very distinct. The wife however smelled it when I was vaping it and thought it was a bit too strong and all she could smell was strawberry. The strawberry might just be adding to the bit of sweetness it has and I do get little hints of it but as an individual flavour it gets a bit overtaken. It's got a bit of tartness to it but it also has a slight dryness to it which makes it a bit artificial tasting. I mean it's a nice enough mix but nothing about it really draws me to it. The mixed berry flavours I tend to like will most often have something about them that stands out and this one is pretty much a homogeneous blend. **[Pink Lemonade](URL **(8.5/10)** (A refreshing glass of raspberry lemonade. The sweet and sour lemon with a tart raspberry twist, a simple but perfect combination. 75.5vg) I get a touch of the same sort of raspberry I got from the mixed berry but with a lot more tartness from the lemon, it's also quite sweet and leaves a lingering sweetness on the lips. It's super bright and refreshing and reminds me of drinking a glass of pink raspberry lemonade with plenty of sugar in it. You know when you go to the fair and they have those lemonade stands where they squeeze a half a lemon in to a cup with about a half cup of sugar and some icy water. It reminds me of that but with a pink twist. This is one of the sweeter and brighter lemonade flavours I've tried and I have to say it's pretty damn tasty. Yes I do have a bit of a sweet tooth so it could just be the sweetness of it that appeals to me but it's also rather authentic tasting without any harshness or nasty chemical aftertaste. Super refreshing and just in time for summer!! **[Vanilla Pudding](URL **(8/10)** (Smooth and creamy vanilla with a hint of spice. A shot of bourbon for good measure. if you love dessert juice, give this a shot. 68vg) This one is pretty much a plain and simple vanilla pudding but just a tad different then the norm. As simple as it is it's surprisingly decent. The vanilla in it is what sets it apart. It's an almost spicy vanilla, a bit more fragrant then the typical vanilla custard. A while back some family traveled to Jamaica and brought my wife and I back some Jamaican vanilla extracts. They had the same sort of exotic vanilla flavour as this does, a touch floral but not perfumey and just a little bit different from the artificial vanilla extracts most of us are used to. The shot of bourbon adds a touch of rich complexity to it but doesn't overtake the simplicity of the flavour nor does it really turn it into an adult flavour, it's still mainly a vanilla pudding. I was weened on custard flavours and don't mind something that's simple so long as it's done well and I must say this is done pretty darn well!! ---- As I mentioned above I was quite impressed with the line, every one of them seem well crafted, packed with flavour and made with quality ingredients. Looking at their pricing I'd say they should do quite well and if you haven't heard of them or given them a chance yet they've definitely won me over and I'd have no trouble recommending you check them out. So Tempest, big thanks for sending me out these samples for review and welcome to the community. I think you'll do just fine here!!"
165,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Drippers Paradise from Maddog,7,663gq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/663gq4/honest_review_time_drippers_paradise_from_maddog/,2017-04-19 01:18:52,"Hey guys, When I was at CVE Edmonton I met with the folks from [Maddog Juice](URL I had actually picked up some stuff from them at CVE Ottawa that I still have yet to get to. We had a funny moment together where they remembered setting me up with samples at the last expo and were extremely good sports about the delay. In fact they set me up with a new line that they were just launching at the show and even suggested I get to them first. As a matter of fact they just posted them on their website today!! Well since I had yet to get to the original samples they set me up with I happily bumped them to the top of the list, so here are my honest thoughts on [Drippers Paradise](URL by Maddog Juice. The set of ""samples"" they set me up with were huge 140ml bottles with some cool Mexican day of the dead sort of imagery on the labels. They came in neat angled boxes that mirrored the design of the bottles but with a bit more information on them like full flavour descriptions. All the good stuff we like to see in fine print along the sides. The juices are all 80vg, nice and thick and meant for dripping. The set I received were all 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL and [the boxes](URL they came in. Also included in each box were a free set of Dog Coils, the ones I got were all 32/26g claptons which I assume are made from Kanthal. Here's [a shot of the coils](URL from the box. Testing was done mostly in a Kryten rda with a dual fused clapton build(38/2x26lvni80), 5/6 wraps on a 3mm coming out around 0.20 ohms and running between 80-120w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Snake Eyes](URL **(9/10)** (The sun is down, the waves are all you hear and you're ready to kick back for a little island night cap; white grape and fresh strawberries drizzled with a cranberry/apple/pomegranate coulee. Take vaping to a whole new level with Snake Eyes) Right away this one hits me with a punchy white grape that has a nice bit of tartness to it almost like a lychee flavour might have. Notes of soft red apple with a strawberry sweetness sort of settle on the tongue. Like I said the tartness reminds me a bit of lychee, almost bitter but there's also a sort of red quality to it I imagine from the cranberry and pomegranate. Such an interesting blend, this one really focuses on a mix of sweet and tart and manages a really nice balance between the two. And when I say tart I don't really mean sour, it's more like the tartness of fresh cranberry and not so much an acidic citrus tartness if that makes sense. Bright and delicious and absolutely packed with flavour for such a thick liquid I'm starting to see where the name comes from. **[Twisted Blue](URL **(8/10)** (Every inhale brings you different notes, if your pallet is looking for complexity in an all day vape, you're found your match; Twisted blueberries, prickly cactus &amp; a drop of lime, mixed together with a field berry jam. Twisted Blue is taste bud paradise for the not so easy to please.) Fans of blueberry will dig this, it starts with a nice thick blueberry jam sort of thing with the slightest touch of green from the cactus. I also get a hint of lime which just helps to brighten up the cactus aspect, just a touch. It's almost like that touch of green makes the berries taste more authentic, like fresh berries with the leave and stems still on. Blueberry can often have a floral or perfumey aspect to it and this manages to settle it with all the other layers of flavour. Super smooth and tasty and like I said just thick with flavour. Probably the only thing I can't really pick out is the field berry jam as it sort of blends with the blueberry and just lends itself to that jammy quality. Yet as jam packed as this one is, I felt it was a bit more flat then the other two, could be the lime which along with that waxy aspect can also sort of flatten a juice with an almost creamy feel but it's hard to tell. Mind you I don't get any waxy taste from it and if it's there it's buried under all the flavour they pack in to these but it does sort of get just a bit of that flat feeling. Still really nice and with a profile some might find a bit more familiar. **[Forbidden Fruit](URL **(9.5/10)** (The ultimate sun drenched cocktail; sweet peaches &amp; ripe pears soaked in a pineapple/kiwi juice with a kiss of citrus, close your eyes and with every vape savour the flavour of Forbidden Fruit!) This one is probably my favorite of the line, it's just a bit brighter and a bit more tropical with it's mix of peach and pear, with a light touch of pineapple, kiwi and citrus on the end. The peach is upfront and nice and sweet while the pear gives it that sort of soft feel. The pineapple, citrus and kiwi are just gentles notes but still gives it a nice light tartness mostly on the exhale. I found the kiwi or the citrus sort of cuts the candy aspect that the pineapple can often have and makes it taste a bit more like a fresh pineapple as opposed to a candy. It's nice and sweet but not like sugary sweet, more like fruity sweet if you know what I mean. Normally I'm not a big fan of fruity mixes but these are so packed with bright fruity flavour and nearly all of the notes are distinct which makes vaping them an interesting experience with different flavours coming to the front at different times. ---- For juice that's meant for dripping these are absolutely packed with flavour and not your typical thick almost flavourless high vg offerings. When I first tried them at the show I knew right away that I was going to enjoy them. I'm not even usually a fan of fruity mixes but there was something about these that just popped and I had to have them. They're bright and refreshing without any harshness or chemical tastes and just like the name says a Drippers Paradise. If you've never tried anything from Maddog Ejuice and you like to drip bright fruity flavours, these would definitely be worth checking out!! So huge thanks to the Maddog Ejuice team for setting me up with these, they're simply fantastic!!! edit: forgot the Dog coils"
166,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,"Honest review time: Phase II, Mr. O and M. Theriault by Chteau Noir",11,5vjrx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5vjrx8/honest_review_time_phase_ii_mr_o_and_m_theriault/,2017-02-23 03:51:11,"Hey guys, Here's something I've been pretty excited to get to. One of my favorite companies in Canada, [Chteau Noir Labs](URL was at CVE and were kind enough to set me up with some samples of their new line as well as a couple of their existing flavours. You might remember them from [my review of their Vintage Roasts line](URL which still stands as probably my favorite coffee line in Canada. Well with their new line they sure as heck don't disappoint. Here are my honest thoughts on Mr. O, Marc Theriault Gold and the new Phase II line. The bottles vary between the three with Mr. O coming in a 30ml clear glass bottle, Marc Theriault in a 30ml amber bottle and the three samples of Phase II in little 10ml amber bottles. All of them have a very nice clean labels that are very mature with their motifs and as far as I'm concerned look great. They are all high vg with Marc Theriault being 77.7vg, Phase II being 80vg and I'm not sure on Mr. O but I believe it too is around 80vg. All of the juices I picked up are 3mg. Here's a look at the [bottle of Mr. O](URL Here's [a shot of Marc Theriault](URL and here's [a shot of Phase II](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Description in brackets, links for where I could find them. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Mr. O](URL (Milky Cream Cookie) **(10/10)** Last year I was pretty much obsessed with Oreo cookie flavours. I had tried quite a few, found some great ones and some not so great ones. So when I had the chance to pick up a bottle of this at the expo I jumped on it and boy am I glad I did. It's pretty much the perfect balance of Oreo cookies and cream. It has a rather thick feel to it and just coats your mouth with it's rich cookie flavour. It's so nice and smooth and really nails that sweet chocolate cookie with creamy filling so many of us know and love. Some of the other Oreo flavours I've tried end up with a slight harshness but this one is just oh so creamy and smooth and if I could I would vape this all day! Maybe it's not the most complex but man does it hit he spot!! **[Marc Theriault - Gold](URL (Butter Rolled Custard Tobacco) **(10/10)** This is one of my top three favorite tobacco flavours to date. It's super smooth, rich, almost creamy and reminds me a lot of the smell of a freshly opened pack of cigarettes without that gross wet pack of cigarettes taste so many tobacco flavours tend to have. It's not cluttered up with all kinds of other flavours either like we often see which keeps it nice and simple yet still unbelievably deep and complex. It's also a lot lighter of a tobacco then some of the ones I'm used to and doesn't get overbearing after vaping on it for a while. It has a nice sweetness to it but not like a sugary sweetness, more like the sweetness of a good fresh tobacco but still more in the dry cut tobacco sort of range. I believe this flavour was created/named in commemoration of a lost friend and if you ask me it is one absolutely beautiful tribute. **Phase II** **[Divine Cream](URL (Creamy madascar vanilla bean, wafe topped with deep fried peanuts.) **(10/10)** This one starts with a nice smooth rich creamy vanilla and finishes with a lightly nutty peanut flavour. Folks who love creamy vanilla flavours are going to be mad for this one. It's pretty much a vanilla custard with maybe a slight lean towards cream as opposed to custard. If you've ever tried their Vintage Roasts line, these seem to have a lot in common with them, just as rich and decadent but without the coffee notes of the Vintage line. I'm personally a sucker for a good vanilla custard and this hits all of the notes for me and was the first of the three to vanish. As rich and complex as it is it's quite simple being mainly a creamy vanilla flavour. The nutty aspect is somewhat subtle but still noticeable if not a bit buried under all that cream. This one was my favorite from the new line and I didn't put down until it was pretty much gone. **[Forsaken Touch](URL (Freshly baked pecan cookie with Italian cream custard.) **(9/10)** Taking a slight turn for the even richer, this one has an almost buttery toasted pecan flavour with a rich cream and dark notes like molasses or brown sugar. It's really full and rich, thick and custardy. I pick up little elements of a cinnamon sugar cookie which I'm guessing is where the molasses flavour comes from but it's it's been softened up by a good dollop of creamy custard. Again this one reminds me of one of the Vintage Roast flavour but without the coffee undertones and I hardly miss them. Basically this one is like a nice sugar cookie crumbled over a rich creamy custard with some toasted pecans sprinkled on top and it's pretty much as decadent as it sounds. **[Reborn Spirit](URL (Sweet caramel, hazelnut, mocha and vanilla whipped cream.) **(9/10)** Here's another one that has some rich dark notes like creamy burnt sugar caramel. I get little nutty undertones throughout from the hazelnut with a bit of a mocha flavour on the backend. Oddly enough it reminds me of a popcorn flavour with a slight hit of coffee. Again super rich like the others and maybe even a tad darker in flavour. It's like they took the richest flavours caramel, hazelnut and mocha and smoothed them all together with the vanilla whipped cream. The cream makes it all smooth and creamy but doesn't take away from that deep richness imparted by the caramel and mocha. Really this one could probably be added to the Vintage Roasts line and no one would bat an eye. As far as I'm concerned Chteau Noir does wonders with coffee flavours and this is no exception. ---- This Phase II really nails the rich thick dessert flavours with the same quality I've come to expect from Chteau Noir and probably my only complaint is that they didn't come in bigger bottles. Both Mr. O and Marc Theriault also scored huge with me and are among some of my favorite liquids out there. Now Chteau Noir is one of those companies that uses the term premium a lot but they're one of the few companies I feel can justify their claim. Everything I've tried from them so far has been absolutely incredible and among some of my favorites liquids in all of Canada. I genuinely can't recommend them enough. Sure they're not the cheapest and they may only be one of those juices you grab as a treat but we all deserve it once in a while. So Chteau Noir if you're reading this, a huge thank you for yet again making some of the best eliquids I have ever tried!!! "
167,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Six Liquids,11,5whg52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5whg52/honest_review_time_six_liquids/,2017-02-28 02:51:19,"Hey guys, [SixLiquids](URL is a Toronto based company that I had the chance to meet with at CVE Ottawa. They had a flavour that really interested me and when approached they offered me a great deal on a couple of flavours which was hard to pass up. However as much as I don't like to use the term bait and switch that's essentially what happened. Here are my honest thoughts on a couple flavours from Six Liquids. I got one 120ml chubby Gorilla bottle at a nice discount and they were kind enough to toss in a 60ml chubby of another flavour. The labels are bright, clean with nice images that depict the flavours. I believe both flavours are 70vg and I picked them up in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL I picked up. Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[ReoKrisp](URL (Oreo cookies and rice crispy's) **(4/10)** This was the flavour that lured me in. I was on the hunt last year for Oreo cookie flavours so when I rolled up on the Six Liquids booth at CVE this one really caught my eye. It's a blend of Oreo cookies and Rice Crispy's, two of my all time favorite treats, also two of my favorite eliquid flavours so to see them combined in to one in what I could only imagine would be absolute heaven in my mouth, I pretty much had to have it. I approached the booth and the gentlemen offered up a tester, I took a pull and cough cough, 'it tastes burnt!' I said. The gentleman made an apology and offered a drop for my finger suggesting it's the best way to test it. I normally don't like to finger test but I held out my finger, received a drop and put it to my tongue. 'Oh wow!!' it was like liquid Oreo gold and I was pretty much sold. I asked how much, he offered a really good deal on a 120ml and I mentioned I would probably do a review of it, at that point he tossed me the bottle of Frolli-pop as well. Really great deal so I was happy. Fast forward to my return home and it was one of the first bottles I cracked open. Loaded up a favorite dripper and bam, cough cough, this is some of the harshest liquid I've ever tried consuming. Maybe it's still fresh I said so I parked it for a few weeks but when returning to it I experienced the exact same harshness. It almost seems the chocolate in it gives it a really strong lung kick. The flavour isn't actually half bad but the liquid itself is pretty much unbearable. Luckily I had a number of sub tanks sent over for review so I loaded up a Pollux tank and it's been pretty much living in there ever since. At least in a sub tank it knocks down the lung hit enough that I can vape it but even then it's still quite harsh so it's definitely not an all day type of thing for me. As I mentioned the flavour isn't that bad, it's mostly an Oreo cookie flavour with a bit more body. I don't really taste the Rice Crispy aspect of it as it's overtaken by that stronger Oreo flavour and the overall harshness kind of kills it. In case you're wondering I tried it out in a few other setups but a sub tank seems to make it the most bearable. Too bad as I would really have enjoyed this were it smooth. So lesson learned, good taste on the finger does not equate to a good vaping experience. **[Frolli-pop](URL (Blackberry and honeydew) **(9/10)** I was so glad they tossed this in to sweeten the already great deal and after trying the ReoKrisp I was relieved that I still got something out of the deal I could vape. Not only could I vape it but it was fantastic. In a complete contrast to ReoKrisp, Frolli-Pop is a really nice light, smooth and refreshing blend of Blackberry and honeydew without any harshness to it at all. It's primarily a blackberry flavour with just the gentlest back notes of honeydew and on their site they mention the honeydew is used more to smoothen it out[insert ReoKrisp needing honeydew joke here] on the tail end of the exhale. I'm a big fan of blackberry flavours so it's nice when I find a really good one where the blackberry is pretty much the main focus. It's also more like real blackberries and not like a blackberry candy I've seen in so many others. Yes it has some honeydew in it but like I said it's not exactly a starring role. So if you like blackberry but don't like honeydew this would still be worth trying as you hardly taste the green melon aspect of it. Full of flavour but nice and smooth, this one was definitely the winner of the two for me. ---- I was really hoping that after a bit of steeping the ReoKrisp would calm down a bit but unfortunately it never did. Who knows, maybe it was a production issue but I likely won't be picking up another bottle to find out. The Frolli-Pop though was pretty damn good and I'd have no trouble recommending you check it out. Also it looks like they've added a couple new flavours since CVE and if they're anything like Frolli-Pop they may well be worth looking into. So Six Liquids if you happen to read this, thanks for setting me up with such a sweet deal, I really enjoyed Frolli-Pop, unfortunately I just couldn't enjoy ReoKrisp."

After meeting one of the owners they set me up with a set for review. However when composing the actual review I've had a bit of trouble figuring out the actual company name but the two flavours I picked up go by '[Let's get Tropical](URL and 'Let's get baked'. I believe they are formerly That Good Vape Co. but I could be wrong and details were a bit hard to come by. I see them listed as 'by Drip Social' but they're not listed on the Drip Social site anymore. Either way, I've been really enjoying them so here are my honest thoughts on 'Let's get baked' and 'Let's get Tropical'. Both flavours are 70vg and came in 60ml chubby gorilla bottles. I picked mine up in 3mg. The labels are a bit different from one another and do a good job conveying the flavour of the liquid. The tropical flavour has a picture of a pineapple on it while the baked has a picture of a white chocolate pistachio cookie on it, so you know what you're getting when you grab it. They're nice and clean and have all the info we like to see on there. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Let's get Tropical](URL (A sweet-cinnamon and brown sugar glazed pineapple, tossed on the grill and cooked to perfection!) **(9/10)** Last year we saw a number of pineapple cinnamon flavours drop, I've checked out at least three myself and this one in my opinion is among one of the better ones but I gotta say it's just a little bit different from the others I've tried. From it I mainly get a nice pineapple gummy candy sort of flavour with a bit more oomph to it. That oomph being the cinnamon and brown sugar glaze on top of the pineapple. The cinnamon is super light, without any bite at all while the brown sugar just sort of adds to the sweetness and gives it a bit of darkness/depth. I'll admit, it's a very mild addition but definitely adds to what could have been just a basic pineapple gummy candy. Mind you I don't think it was supposed to be a gummy candy type of flavour but that's mainly what I'm getting. Vaping it, it's nice and smooth and full of flavour. It's a little bit sweet with a bit of tang to it and has an almost juicy feel about it. It does have a rather artificial taste but I've been associating it with pineapple candy so it's kind of what I'd expect. Personally I wouldn't have minded this being a bit truer to a fresh pineapple and for the cinnamon to be kicked up just a notch to be more in line with the description but as it stands it's still very enjoyable. **[Let's get Baked](URL (A delicious white chocolate and pistachio cookie. The perfect vape for the winter months.) **(9/10)** Going a completely different direction from Let's get Tropical, Let's get Baked is based on a white chocolate and pistachio cookie. I actually thought it was a macadamia nut cookie when I had first tried it but after reading the description realized it's pistachio, I'm sure it wouldn't have made a huge difference but it's to be noted. What I do get from this delectable treat is a really nice almost creamy white chocolate that's very rich, almost thick, it's followed closely by a nice baked cookie flavour that has a light nutty back end. I really found this one was affected by higher wattages and actually preferred to run it a bit higher then usual to bring out more of the white chocolate and nuts. The whole thing has a very nice soft, almost creamy feel to it, sort of delicate like a white chocolate cookie would be. The bakery aspect is sort of blended with the nutty flavour which is almost secondary to the white chocolate. It's hard to explain how soft this stuff is, like nothing in the juice kicks you in the mouth, it's so gentle and mild you could vape it all day. I should add if you don't like light flavours this one probably won't be for you but it's exactly the sort of thing I look for in ADVs and this one has been hitting the spot! ---- Overall I have to say I was very impressed by both flavours, they both taste like quality made juice. No harshness, odd chemical notes or anything like that. Just nicely balanced and rather unique flavours. If you haven't tried either of these yet I'd definitely recommend you do, they're fantastic. And to the folks from Let's get Tropical/Baked if you happen to be reading this, thank you very much for setting me up with these beauties!!"
170,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Simple and Classy by LKVape,8,5y8xuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5y8xuw/honest_review_time_simple_and_classy_by_lkvape/,2017-03-09 03:39:06,"Hey guys, Here's a line that I picked up at CVE Ottawa. It's made by a Quebec based company called [LK Vape](URL Their main shop I believe is located in Blainville and when I had the chance to meet with them, they happily set me up with some samples for review. Because of Law 44 finding them may be a challenge but it looks like they're available through [CarrackVape](URL I thought the line was quite well done. Here are my thoughts on [Simple and Classy](URL The set I recieved came in 30ml clear plastic bottles with nice Simple and Classy labels. All of the liquids are 70vg and the ones I tested were all 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL I received. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Elektra](URL (A revivifying mix of watermelon candy and grape soda. An e-liquid that will bring you back to your childhood.) **(8/10)** I'll admit, I almost shrugged this one off but really came around to it the more I vaped it. It's like a light mix of watermelon and grape candy that has a distinct powdery sort of essence to it. It really reminds me of [Tart and Tinys](URL from my childhood. Not the candy coated ones but [the original powdery pellets](URL of sugary goodness. This juice is sweet but not in a syrupy kind of way, like I mentioned it's more like a dry powdery candy sort of sweetness with just a bit of fruitiness and a slight tang. Normally I don't gravitate towards the candy flavours but I have to say I quite enjoyed this one but mostly because of the little dose of nostalgia. If you've never tried Tart and Tinys they're a lot like SweeTarts but in a smaller sort of pill shaped format. **[Five-O](URL (A perfectly balanced mix of wildberries that is smooth and refreshing.) **(5/10)** This is a pretty much the typical berry blend that I'm not really a fan of. It's probably a mix of raspberry, blueberry, maybe some strawberry but because it's so blended I can't really distinguish one from the other. It's got a bit of a sweetness to it and it's fairly artificial tasting like it doesn't taste particularly fresh or realistic and really more reminds me of a generic berry air freshener or something like that. Don't get me wrong it doesn't taste like a mouthful of chemicals it's just too generic of a blend to really stand out. I'm sure folks who enjoy berry blends will like this but this one is definitely not for me. **[Kapu](URL (Capucin monks classic, a skilfully made capuccino. Not too bitter, but creamy and soft. The perfect coffee topped with a hint of cinnamon.) **(9/10)** Kapu is a delicious dark coffee/cappuccino flavour with a really nice creaminess to it. It's got a hint of a dry cinnamon, like you might get from a dusting on top of your cappuccino or latte. The creaminess of it is really nice and makes the whole thing rather smooth with no bitterness from the coffee and no bite from the cinnamon. I really dig coffee flavoured vapes and this one was a very happy addition to the list of favs. It really focuses on the rich darkness of the cappuccino but adds just enough cream to make sure it's not overbearing. It's also not overcomplicated with the dash of cinnamon being the only real additional flavour unlike so many coffee flavours out there. This one definitely caters to those who love the taste of a rich dark cappuccino coffee without too much extra stuff on top. **[Peach Sparkle](URL (A delicious combination of peaches and raspberries, topped with a touch of champagne. The end result gives a fresh summer vibe to this e-liquid.) **(6/10)** I've got mixed feelings on this one. While I'll admit it's quite accurate in it's description there's something about it that just doesn't sit right with me. I get a light almost delicate peach flavour with a slight boozy edge to it. It kind of hits me in the back of the mouth/throat with just a tiny bit of harshness. It really reminds me of a sparkling alcoholic drink my wife might order at a fancy brunch or something. It's got a summery refreshing feel to it but I also get a slight chemical taste to it from that champagne note. I'll admit that boozy note it's got gives it a borderline fermented fruit kind of thing which unfortunately wears on me really quickly. It's not like it tastes rotten or anything but that boozy note definitely gives it a strong edge. Not something I would normally gravitate to but fans of alcoholic flavours may want to check this one out. **[Roasted Gold](URL (Premium Virginia tobacco, roasted and slightly torrefied. A precise and balanced blend, resulting in a classic smooth taste with a hint of caramel.) **(9/10)** I love tobacco flavours and this one is a really nice rich dark tobacco blend and a new fav to add to the list. You can practically taste the roasted aspect of the Virginia tobacco which gives it a much deeper darker flavour then your typical flue-cured tobaccos. It's ever so lightly sweet with the caramel just adding to that dark sweetness on the tail end. This one definitely leans towards a dark Virginia blend and reminds me a lot of the smell of dark roasted tobacco leaves. There's not a whole lot of other crap in it either to complicate it, it's mainly just that rich dark roasted tobacco flavour and of course that hint of caramel. All around super smooth, packed with flavour and a really nice accompaniment with my morning coffee! **[Tocado](URL (A coarse and sweet-but-not-too-sweet tobacco with a little note of fresh mint.) **(8/10)** I was all set to not like this cause I'm not really a fan of mint but then I tried it and I have to say it's pretty damn good. It's a really nice sweet tobacco flavour much lighter then Roasted Gold which reminds me more of a light American or Turkish blend. It's paired with a rather fresh tasting mint flavour and while the description says just a little note of fresh mint I found it pretty much takes over the flavour, it doesn't however ruin it. It actually pairs up quite nicely with the lighter drier tobacco flavour and it's not like a menthol tobacco it's more like a loose leaf tobacco and real mint. I actually have a bit of an aversion to mint but this one does it in such a way that it didn't really wear on me and I actually found it a rather nice addition that just freshens the whole thing up. **Tahiti** (No link or description for this one) **(8.5/10)** This one was tasted blind as I couldn't find a description for it when I was tasting them but it's fairly obvious what it leans towards. It's a tropical fruit blend and from it I pick up notes of mango, maybe some peach, possibly papaya, and some sort of citrus. It's kind of hard to pick out all the notes cause it's like a fruit punch with all kinds of tropical fruit mixed together. I almost find the mango or papaya in it gives it a sort of thickness to it sort of like how a mango or papaya juice is thick, so is this flavour. Don't get me wrong it's still very refreshing and somewhat light but the flavours in there are a bit on the heavy side. To me it's almost like an orange coloured tropical drink and not a bright red one. Like the flavours I get from it are more typically orange then red if that makes sense. All around bright and refreshing with a nice tropical vibe! ---- Overall I have to say I quite enjoyed these. The liquids are all,,, dare I say it,, Simple and Classy with a nice mix of flavours. They taste like they're made with quality ingredients with a lot of thought and care put in to the blends. Sure a couple of them didn't work for me but we all know taste is subjective. So LK Vapes if you happen to read this, huge thanks for setting me up with these lovely liquids and I look forward to seeing more from you in the future!!"
171,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: It's Bar! by Vape It Up!,14,5ygdyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5ygdyv/honest_review_time_its_bar_by_vape_it_up/,2017-03-10 04:30:33,"Hey guys, A little while back I covered some stuff from [Vape It Up](URL It was sort of a mixed bag of flavours but after posting [the review](URL they reached out and sent over the rest of the ones I didn't get to try. I was very impressed with their stuff so I was more then happy to try the rest. Here are my honest thoughts on the complete It's Bar line from Vape It Up! The juices comes in 30ml unicorn bottles with bright colourful labels, each one sporting a stylized pic of the actual flavour. I think the labels look great and really pop but still have all the serious stuff in fine print. I believe the liquids are about 70vg or thereabouts as I couldn't find the exact ratio listed. The set I was sent were all 3mg. Here is [a shot of the bottles](URL I received. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Description aren't needed as the names pretty much say it all. Also a cool thing about their site is each flavour actually has a recipe associated with it. I haven't had a chance to try them yet but they sounds delicious and if they're anything like the liquids they'd be well worth the effort. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Lemon Meringue Pie bar](URL **(9/10)** (Copy pasted from original review) This one was getting quite a bit of attention at CVE and I totally can see why, it's an authentic tasting Lemon Meringue pie flavour. I found the meringue especially popped in this one and gave it a nice soft yet sweet flavour that complimented the lemon. The lemon curd flavour is nice and mild, not too strong or overpowering and lets the other flavours come through. Often not an easy task with strong flavours like lemon but they've managed to balance it just right for me. It is a bit on the sweet side but I don't mind that personally. There's just a hint of a bakery flavour in there but mainly I get the lemon curd and the meringue and it's absolutely fantastic. I'm not sure it will knock out my favorite lemon meringue flavour but it's really damn close. **[Ginger Bread with Banana Cream](URL **(8/10)** Gingerbread cookies were always a treat for me growing up. My mom never really baked them so I'd only get them once in a while from like a bake sale or something like that. Something about the balance of sweet and spice always drew me in and of course what kid can resist the sugary icing that usually adorned them. I can't tell you how different this juice is from pretty much anything I've tried. It's like a ginger bread cookie smothered in a rich banana cream. The banana flavour itself isn't really a huge player in this but more the creamy aspect of it. Really smoothing over the potentially biting ginger of the ginger bread which if you ask me is one of the more realistic ginger bread flavours I've tried. The banana cream really takes any edge off the ginger and gives the whole thing a very rich mouth feel, seriously it's like thick. Not sure that I could vape this one all day long but it's definitely a nice after dinner sort of vape for me. **[Strawberry Shortcake Bar](URL **(10/10)** Growing up at home we always had a strawberry patch that ran along the side of the house. I remember waking up on Saturday mornings and heading outside with my brother and a bowl to collect them. In the afternoon the house would be filled with the smell of fresh baked shortcakes and after dinner the whole family would feast on what I would consider a traditional summer time treat. This is quite likely the best strawberry shortcake flavour I've come across. I've tried a few other berry cake flavours that were similar but this one definitely sets itself apart. It hits you right off the bat with a nice rich, sweet, almost jammy strawberry, then follows up with an equally rich shortcake flavour. That shortcake flavour adds quite a bit of depth to it and really ups the richness of the flavour. The cake aspect is almost like a yellow cake crossed with a sugar cookie, it's decadent and rich and really gives you a sense of a shortcake covered in strawberries and dripping with whipped cream. Hands down my absolute favorite from the line and possibly my new favorite strawberry flavour all around. ---- I've said it before and I'll say it again, Vape It Up makes some really great juice. If you like classic sweet dessert flavours you're going to love this line!! Pretty much everything I've tried from Vape It Up has been spectacular, yes they are a bit sweet but who doesn't enjoy a little sweetness in their life. Can't recommend these guys enough! Vape It Up if you happen to be reading this, thank you so much for sending me these beauties, I really really enjoyed them!!! Stay tuned for a review of another line from Vape It Up,, Tom Foolery's!!"
172,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Zest by VapeLoft and Aeris by Aerisvapor,15,5z5w6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5z5w6h/honest_review_time_zest_by_vapeloft_and_aeris_by/,2017-03-14 03:16:19,"Hey guys, Here's something that showed up just last week but it's also something from CVE Ottawa. When I was there I had the chance to meet a very nice gentleman named Anton from [VapeLoft](URL we chatted for a bit and he mentioned contacting him at a later time for some samples for review. Well I got a bit overwhelmed and neglected to touch base again with Anton when out of the blue he reached out to me. After a bit of back and forth he sent over their line called [Zest](URL along with another set of liquids that they recently picked up called [Aeris](URL Here are my honest thoughts on Zest and Aeris sent over from VapeLoft. Zest comes in 60ml chubby gorilla bottles with really nice bright white labels with colourful names and logos while Aeris comes in 30ml clear glass bottles with nearly clear labels with clean modest logos on them. Both are really nice with a very clean look to them. Both sets I received are 70vg blends and came with 3mg nic. Here's a shot of [the bottles of Zest](URL and here's a look at [the bottles of Aeris](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Zest** **[The Classic](URL (The classic combination of sweet lemonade and a hint of lime. This lip-puckering e-juice sets the standard for all lemonade vapes.) **(8.5/10)** For fans of really authentic tasting zesty fruit flavours these are absolutely incredible. The Classic is a nice mix of lemon, lime and orange. Super bright and tart it kind of grabs you in the cheeks. It's not overly sweet but absolutely packs in the tangy flavour. It's got a real fruit taste too, not like sweet candy or sugary artificial flavours but authentic tasting bright zesty flavours. I mean the name of the line is called Zest so it would be a real travesty if they were bland in any way. And when they say zest they mean it. All three have that zing that we associate with the peel of an orange, the spray that hits you when peeling a grapefruit or that tart cheek squeaking tang of a lemon slice. The Classic takes all of that and shoves it in a bottle and I can't really imagine a more refreshing outcome!! It's like a lemon-limeade with a squirt of orange. One of the most authentic tasting orange citrus flavours I've tried yet and an absolute delight!! **[Sun Kissed](URL (Sun Kissed combines 4 citrus fruits with bright, authentic tasting strawberries.) **(9/10)** This one is my absolute favorite of the bunch. It starts with a nice realistic fresh strawberry mixed with a bright orange citrus blend. The strawberry kind of pokes in and out with little notes of it here and there. Again another super fresh and delicious flavour but the citrus isn't as sharp as The Original which I actually appreciate for longer term vaping. I just found the strong zest started to wear on me pretty quickly but this one was much easier for me to stick with. One incredible thing about all three of these flavours is I don't taste any heavy sweeteners or strong artificial flavours. No strong chemical tastes or anything like that, instead it's almost as if they used fresh squeezed fruit to make them, absolutely delicious! The strawberry flavour in this is so fresh it reminds me of fresh picked strawberries and the punch it gets from the citrus just ups the freshness factor. The citrus blend for me leans more towards orange then it does lemon or lime which normally I would think an odd mix but in this it just really works! **[Beach Bum](URL (A peach so real, so refreshing, you'll think it came straight from the orchard. Add lemonade and orange juice, and you've got yourself an all day vape.) **(8/10)** This one was probably my least favorite of the line and it was still pretty amazing. It's an interesting mix of peach, orange and lemonade. The peach is upfront and has a deeper flavour then the bright orange or lemonade and really helps to tone down the whole thing, giving it an almost muddled kind of feel. It's a bit less tart for it which I kind of appreciate, much like the Sun Kissed I can vape it for longer without tiring of the strong citrus. But it's that citrus that really separates this line from just about any others I've tried. It's such an authentic zesty citrus, packed with a ton of flavour that's so tangy it makes your mouth water. In this one they take that signature zestiness and apply it to fresh peaches. Almost like a peach lemonade if that sort of thing even exists. No fuzzy peach flavour here, just real tasting fresh peach with that underlying citrus punch!! Fantastic!! ---- **Aeris** **[Magna](URL (Superior in taste but no longer on supermarket shelves, Sun- crest Peach is the legendary embodiment of a juicy heirloom peach. While rare and unique, its distinct tangy notes perfectly accent the exotic White Mangosteen, a tropical fruit used for its creamy undertone of lychee vanilla, seamlessly rounding out Magnas deep sweet strawberry exhale. ) **(5/10)** This is a mix of light peach, mangosteen and strawberry. The main notes that I pick up are the peach and a tart tangy note which I'm guessing is from the mangosteen. Mangosteen if you've never tried it is a rather unique fruit, almost impossible to describe it's a mix of sweet and tart not too far off from lychee but different in it's own unique way. The peach while leaning towards a realistic one is rather thin and the mangosteen is somewhat fleeting. The strawberry too is virtually lost in this blend but I feel like I pick up some light notes of it in the aftertaste. It's a bit harsh and thin feeling with a slight chemical kind of taste that sort of hits me in the back of the throat. I found it wore on me really quickly and didn't exactly scream fresh fruit flavours to me. Very artificial tasting it was a stark contrast to the Zest flavours. This one is definitely not for me. **[Lush](URL (Known to be sweeter than its common supermarket cousin, the rare grape-sized Actinidia Arguta Kiwi was chosen for this recipe on its ability to soften and sweeten honeydews top notes. Paired with a smooth bodied vanilla, and a light crisp cucumber base, weve got one of the most refreshing flavors to ever hit the market.) **(8/10)** This mix is much more up my alley then Magna. It's a light and refreshing blend of kiwi, honeydew, cucumber and vanilla. I mainly get the honeydew cucumber blend with just a bit of tart kiwi and it's all cut with a lightly sweet vanilla. The vanilla doesn't make it creamy, doesn't thicken it up or smooth it out much but just sort of adds a nice bit of complexity to it. I sort of get little ribbons of it throughout, all mixed in with the various notes of fruit. One thing I will say is the flavour feels a bit thin and a bit artificial but not nearly as bad as magna. It's actually like a thinner version of a flavour I recently fell in love with that was also a melon and cucumber blend. Really summery and refreshing I can definitely vape this one with ease!! ---- The name Zest couldn't be more apt for these zesty fresh delights. There aren't many companies out there that manage to nail down refreshing, realistic citrus flavours like these guys. If you're into fresh tangy fruit flavours you'll definitely want to check these beauties out. As for Aeris, I do quite enjoy Lush but Magna definitely isn't for me, maybe some others out there will appreciate it but for me it's basically a pass. So VapeLoft if you happen to be reading this, thank you very much for reaching out and setting me up with your incredible line of zesty flavours. I really enjoyed checking them out!!"
173,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Seduction by MakeMeJuice,9,5zd21g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5zd21g/honest_review_time_seduction_by_makemejuice/,2017-03-15 03:15:12,"Hey guys, Here's another one from CVE Ottawa. While I was there I met with a very lovely and dare I say it very attractive young lady named Jasmine Lee who happened to be the owner of a company called [MakeMeJuice](URL She introduced me to a new line she was launching called [Seduction](URL and offered up a set for review. After giving several of them a try I very happily accepted. She also tossed me a bottle from her Black Series which was a tobacco so I'll include that here as well. Here are my honest thoughts on Seduction by MakeMeJuice. The juices comes in 30ml clear glass bottles with dropper tops. The labels bear three silhouettes of ladies and have a sort of retro Playboy sort of look to them. The whole line is based on the concept of seduction so the labels, the names and even the flavours have a sort of sexy playful kind of feel, not too unlike the owner of the company ;) They also came in a nice sponge lined black box emblazoned with the company logo and a tag line on the inside which asks the question ""Who hits it dry?"", umm lol. The Black Series flavour also came in a clear glass 30ml bottle with a modest black label and had it's own protective cardboard tube. The Seduction line is max vg while the Black Series is 60vg and the set I got were 0mg and the Black Series flavour was 3mg. Here's a look at [the Seduction bottles](URL and a look at [the Black Series bottle](URL Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Descriptions from site in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Seduction** **[Berry Sensual](URL (A tasty mouthful of the most succulent, freshest... BERRIES!! Tsk tsk where was your mind?) **(8/10)** Normally I don't rate generic berry blends too high but this one I have to say was quite inviting. From what I can tell it's a nice mix of blueberry, raspberry, strawberry maybe some blackberry. It's hard to tell exactly what the mix is but it's nice. While it doesn't taste like medicine or air freshener, something about it does remind me of the smell of those fruity smelling lip balms the girls all wore in high school. It's got a nice light sweetness to it without feeling like it's loaded with sweetener and for a mystery berry blend I actually enjoyed it. **[Forbidden Frost](URL (A perfect union of watermelon and green apple. Careful the menthol bites... But you like that don't you?) **(6/10)** This one was just too strong for me. While I do enjoy a good menthol flavour this one takes it to another level. The description wasn't lying when it said the menthol bites, it's so strong it's borderline Vicks VapoRub. It pretty much buries the light green apple and watermelon blend. You do taste the fruit but like I said it's buried under an avalanche of frosty menthol. The green apple is probably the lightest flavour in it as I tended to pick up more of the watermelon but even then it was like fighting through a snow storm to taste it. Personally I would have enjoyed it more if the menthol was toned down a bit but I'll bet strong menthol lovers will dig this. **[Rendezvous](URL (Reminiscent of the old school root beer float. From the drive through you brought your first date to... Before whatever came next in the car) **(5/10)** After the first hit of this I was all set to dig it but then the anise or black licorice flavour really crept up and it was about all I could taste after that. But like I said that first hit was pretty damn tasty. It reminded me of those soda flavoured bottle cap candies, specifically the root beer ones. It even has a bit of that powdery sort of feel to it very reminiscent of those hard powder candies I enjoyed as a kid. Unfortunately I really don't like the taste of anise, especially if it's really strong and in this it's pretty prominent. It just takes over the flavour a bit too much for me to really enjoy it. **[The Sweet Spot](URL (Ever wondered what it tastes like? Strawberry watermelon bubble gum. With just enough sweetness to make you say ""O"") **(9/10)** I get a light strawberry and watermelon blend that's very clear and clean tasting. I get distinct notes of both and they taste very fresh and real and sort of linger on the tongue. I don't really get a bubblegum vibe from it though. To me it's more like an aqua fresca sort of thing, very crisp and fresh tasting. The fruit having an almost watery characteristic to it. None of the flavours are super strong or perfumey, it's just nice and smooth with a light sweetness. Maybe it's the lack of nicotine in these samples but this one in particular has such a nice clean taste to it with no harshness or kick. This one will be absolutely perfect for a hot sunny day!! **[Threesome](URL (You may not get one in real life, but you can have this party of ripe pears, juicy melons and luscious berries in your mouth) **(8/10)** From this one I get a sweet mix of pear, watermelon, maybe some honeydew but I'm not really sure of the berry. Maybe raspberry and a bit of strawberry if I had to venture a guess. Unlike The Sweet Spot this one has a bit more of an artificial flavour to it that's a bit more sweet but still quite tasty. It's not quite as succinct as The Sweet Spot either with the fruit and berries being a bit harder to distinguish from one another. I think you know how I feel about generic berry blends, I'd prefer if I can pick out what I'm tasting but sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. In this it works just fine and probably lends itself to the fullness of the flavour. I dig it, just not as much as The Sweet Spot. ---- **Black Series** **[Tobacco Royale](URL (A savory tobacco with slight hints of sweetness brought together with the most luxurious cuban end notes. This blend did not come easy, as it took countless variations to bring this flavour to you. 60vg) **(7.5/10)** This flavour starts off like a light blond tobacco that's a bit sharp and a bit sweet with some darker bottom notes like you'd get from a rich Cuban cigar. It's got a very fresh cut tobacco taste, almost green and has a bit of bite to it. I enjoy me a good tobacco flavour and this one is nice enough but it's got a bit of that wet tobacco taste that I really don't enjoy. I much prefer a drier tobacco flavour as that wet feeling can sometimes make me feel a bit queasy. Fortunately this didn't have that affect on me but I can still taste that wet tobacco. It also feels fairly thin for a tobacco flavour with such deep notes, that might be just the higher pg but even in a kayfun it felt a bit lacking. I would have liked a bit more mouth feel to it myself but never the less it's still quite enjoyable. ---- Sure a couple of these didn't really work for me but I have to say overall I quite enjoyed them. I also enjoyed the playful nature of the line which was pretty much a reflection of the personality of the owner, at least from what I gathered meeting her. These definitely lean towards the fruity flavours which I know plenty of folks will appreciate. So if you haven't given MakeMeJuice a try and you dig fruity flavours I'd have no trouble recommending you check them out and Jasmine if you happen to read this, thank you for setting me up with your lovely juices, I really had fun checking them out!!"

175,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Puffs from M.E.O ejuice,11,5p5hxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5p5hxx/honest_one_shot_puffs_from_meo_ejuice/,2017-01-21 05:05:45,"Hey guys, Here's something from [M.E.O](URL that I was fortunate enough to pick up at CVE Ottawa. Rex the main man behind M.E.O set me up with a bottle. Not only is he an amazing guy but he makes some really incredible juice. This newer addition is a little bit different from the stuff I'm used to seeing from M.E.O but it's a nice change. Apparently it's still in limited release and only available in a select few shops but if you're lucky enough to find it, I think it's worth checking out. Here are my honest thoughts on Puffs by M.E.O. It comes in a clear 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottle and has a rather cute label on it. Pretty sure I heard when it's officially released it will have plain packaging to comply with future regulations. I'm not sure of the ratio but it seems rather thick so I'm guessing at least 70vg. The sample I got was 3mg, here's a look at the rather [cute looking bottle](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Puffs](URL (Chocolate coated Raspberry Marshmallow Puff) You know those cookies that are chocolate coated, marshmallow with a bit of jam on a little wafer? This is meant to be an approximation of those but I mainly get only two things from it, raspberry and marshmallow. I honestly don't get a sense of the chocolate at all and I've had a couple friends try it as well and neither of them tasted any sort of chocolate in it either. Maybe I'm losing it but it's just not there for me. The raspberry I get is a lot like a raspberry jam or filling like you'd get in one of those cookies. It's smothered in a nice sweet marshmallow that almost makes it creamy but not quite, like it's softens it up giving it a sort of powdery essence. One thing I need to call out is it can have a bit of a throat hit to it, especially at higher wattages. But in a mellow build it stays reasonably smooth and enjoyable. As much as I enjoyed the flavour of this, it tended to wear on my pretty quickly. Might be because of that slight kick to it but never the less I still found it interesting and enjoyable. Fans of raspberry will likely really appreciate this!! **(8/10)** ---- Like I said, M.E.O makes some really amazing stuff and this is a welcome new addition to the line. While it's not my favorite that they make I still really enjoyed it. If you haven't tried anything from M.E.O yet you're doing yourself a disservice, I really can't recommend these guys enough, they make quite a few of my all time favorite liquids. So huge thanks to Rex, you sir make some very fine juice!!"
176,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Juice Brothers Co.,11,5pxhhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5pxhhn/honest_review_time_juice_brothers_co/,2017-01-25 04:39:36,"Hey guys, Here's some stuff from a company out of Winnipeg I had the chance to meet at CVE. I've actually never heard of them before and I'm really sorry I haven't cause they make some incredible stuff. The company is called [Juice Brothers Co.](URL and they set me up with some juice from several of their lines. Here are my honest thoughts on Juice Brothers Co. The juice all came in 60ml clear Chubby Gorilla bottles. The labels varied from line to line but they were all clean and nicely done. I believe they are all 70vg but I might be mistaken on some of them. All of the ones I picked up were in 3mg. Here are some [some pics of the various bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **5M** **[Holy Crepes](URL (Maple syrup, pancakes, brandy, orange.) This one is a slightly different take on the old pancake flavour. It's got a lot of familiar notes like maple syrup and pancake with maybe just the slightest hint of cinnamon. But where it differs from nearly every other one I've tried out there is the addition of the brandy and orange. The orange especially helps cut the rich thickness of the flavour but luckily it's subtle enough that it doesn't become a main player but still plays a significant part. The crepes and syrup are still up front with a nice little grown up kick from the brandy. It's really a pretty amazing flavour and I was all set to love it but I found it has a bit too much of a throat kick for me to enjoy it for long. Aside from that though it's a pretty spectacular flavour and a nice grown up twist on a breakfast classic. **(8/10)** **[Lemonnoli](URL (A lemon tart cannoli.) Take a sweet lemon tart and mash it together with a creamy cannoli and this is pretty much what you'll get. Ok so I don't get a strong sense of the tart or crust part in this but it's not really missed either. It's like a really nice, light, creamy, smooth and sweet lemon cream. The lemon isn't biting or overpowering, instead it's nice and soft and makes the whole thing rather bright. It's not a super complex flavour but that doesn't mean it's not good. I found it's mostly just sweet lemon and cream but I've been enjoying none the less. **(8/10)** ---- **Funk-E-Joose** **[Galactic Lime](URL (A refreshing and delicious lime sorbet) Ok so most of you know I'm not a big fan of lime flavours because of that weird waxy aspect I tend to get, maybe that's just a personal issue but with this one it hasn't really come up. I get a really fresh sort of lime flavour but it's also sort of reminiscent of green Koolaid or Freshie or something like that. After vaping on it for a while I also think there's something else in it to give it that real fresh taste, maybe some cactus, aloe or something. I can't quite place my finger on it but it's a nice addition that really makes it pop with freshness. This one is primarily about the lime flavour but if you like a really bright fresh sweet lime this might be just the thing for you. **(7/10)** ---- **Cloud Barista** **[Almond Biscotti](URL (Wonderfully spiced, mouth watering Biscotti topped with decadent almonds!) This one is light and delicate but is still full of flavour. It's essentially a light nutty almond cookie flavour that's smooth and rich. There is a hint of a spice to it but not one I can easily place. It's delicately sweet and not overbearing in anyway. I really enjoyed this one a lot and managed to clear most of the bottle in about a day. But I'm at a bit of a loss to describe it cause it's so light and delicate and the flavours sort of blend together. Essentially I get two main notes from it, a light cookie and a gentle nuttiness but it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. But what more would you need in a nice almond biscotti. Absolutely lovely!! **(9/10)** **[White Chocolate Mocha](URL (Perfectly blended espresso and ""Melt in your mouth"" white chocolate!) This one is rich! It's a mix of white chocolate and a gentle espresso flavour. It reminds me a lot of a cup of hot chocolate with a little bit extra. It's creamy, sweet and rich with flavour. The white chocolate kind of hits you first, all creamy and sweet and then you get a nice finish of espresso. I enjoy a good coffee flavour and this I must say is a really nice one. Definitely one of the richer ones from JB and one of my favs from the bunch. I let a friend try it and he was pretty much head over heels for it too. All around a really nice flavour and it pairs nicely with the almond biscotti. **(9.5/10)** ---- **Hello my name is:** **[Hello my name is: Carol Cake](URL (Carot Cake) This is so different from the other carrot cake flavours I've tried and man is it ever good. It reminds me a lot of a fresh baked carrot cake without a lot of spice or frosting. You know how a good carrot cake is nice and juicy well this is too in that same carroty way. It's much less sweet and more focused on the taste of the actual cake, which I sure appreciate. Don't get me wrong it's still a bit sweet but it's a much lighter more refined sweet, like that you'd get from carrots in a cake. It's sort of rare to find a rich cake flavour that isn't all about the icing and I for one dig it! **(8/10)** **[Hello my name is: Kenny Cannoli](URL (Cannoli) Ok, saving the best for last, this right now is my favorite cannoli flavour out there to date. It has a nice rich thick creaminess to it with a subtle pastry note that lingers throughout and just a light dusting of powdered sugar. It's mostly about the sweet thick ricotta cream filling though. It's a super simple flavour but one that packs a serious punch and I just could not get enough of it. It's a lot more balanced then other cannoli flavours I've tried and seems to highlight the notes I most enjoy, that sweet cream, powdered sugar and vanilla. Again, not a super complex flavour with lots of little subtleties but one that is done perfectly!! A new fav for me!! **(10/10)** ---- I really don't know how long Juice Brothers Co. has been around but I'm kind of sad it's taken me this long to discover them. All of the juices that I tried tasted of quality and the flavours are just fantastic. All around high marks from me and a glowing recommendation for you to try them!! If you're like me and you've never heard of them before I highly recommend you check them out!! edit: links and formatting"
177,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Mille Feuille by Mr. Pastry,13,5q45ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5q45ny/honest_one_shot_mille_feuille_by_mr_pastry/,2017-01-26 03:32:11,"Hey guys, Here's something a bit different that I got from the same folks who distribute [3 Monkeys](URL [Drip Fuel](URL and [VapLab](URL It's based off of a delicious French Pastry called the [Mille-Feuille](URL which the Drip Direct team were handing out samples of at CVE, yum!! It's one of those things that you just need to try for yourself. Well the wonderful Drip Direct folks remembered me from last time and set me up with a bottle of my own. Here are my honest thoughts on [Mille Feuille by Mr. Pastry](URL It comes in a 60ml clear Chubby Gorilla bottle with a nice bright and colourful label with the name of the liquid and an image of the delicate treat in the background. It's a 75vg mix and the bottle I picked up was in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottle](URL I received. Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Mille Feuille](URL (Traditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry and two layers of creme patissiere. The top is glazed with icing or fondant in alternating white and brown stripes.) The description for this one was pretty much borrowed from the Wikipedia page but it couldn't be more accurate and neither could the liquid. It's an absolutely amazing blend of light pastry, creamy vanilla and icing. I had tried the dessert before but having been able to try one fresh side by side with the liquid was pretty awesome considering they pretty much nailed it. Right off the hop you get a nice light bakery/pastry flavour that's smothered in a smooth rich vanilla cream. It's almost got a hint of spice from that pastry but it's really subtle and blends right in with that rich cream. All of that is finished off with a really nice sweet icing, just like in the picture. I was amazed at how accurately they managed to capture the little nuances of the dessert in the liquid and ended up finishing up the bottle pretty quickly. It's like the dessert flavour I didn't know I needed. Just incredible!! **(10/10)** ---- So if you like desserts and especially creamy French pastries you're probably going to love this!! I know I did. While I'm pretty sure Drip Direct are out of QC a quick Google search found plenty of places to pick it up online. Drip Direct if you happen to read this, you guys have nailed it once again. Thanks a bunch for setting me up with this incredible treat!! "
178,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: NicBuzz Eliquide,6,5qbfgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5qbfgm/honest_review_time_nicbuzz_eliquide/,2017-01-27 04:19:46,"Hey guys, This one might just be for the folks in QC, at least until it can be made available to the rest of us. It's a big set I picked up from CVE from a couple of really great guys. They're a company called Nic Buzz Eliquide, yes they're out of QC so picking them up will be a challenge for non QC residents but well worth it if you can get your hands on it. Here are my honest thoughts on [NBEliquide](URL I essentially got three sets, two of which came in 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottles with the third set coming in clear 30ml glass bottles. The [#Popjuice](URL bottles have a sort of vintage pin-up girl theme to them while the [Happy Boat](URL ones sport a little stylized origami boat. The other three I'm not sure if they are a set but one has a pic of [a girl blowing a bubble gum bubble](URL another sports [an Owl while the third shows a guy shredding a guitar](URL I particularly like the Happy Boat theme, it's clean and well, cute. I believe the Happy Boat and #popjuice are all 70vg or there about, Purple and Night are 80vg and the ones I got were all in 3mg. Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets, sorry no links cause of stupid Law 44. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **#Popjuice** **Zaza** (Discrete and mysterious, its fragrance filled with exquisite exotic fruits, apricots and ripe pears, will delight you) This one has a somewhat familiar taste to it. Maybe it's the apricot but I feel like I've tasted something similar to this in the past. I had originally tasted these ones blind and in my notes I had written nectarine, apricot and apple which wasn't too far off. After reading the description the pear really made sense and I can taste it on the back end quite a bit. It's gentle and sweet, almost simple in it's approach mainly the apricot upfront with the pear on the back end. A nice blend that isn't overly complex but still quite nice. **(7/10)** **Alie** (Divine and spicy, its very sweet fragrance of juicy pomegranate with a breeze of dragon fruit and berries, will take you on a whirlwind of creaminess/smoothness) This one starts off with a nice smooth dragon fruit that has an almost candy like flavour to it with just a touch of red from the pomegranate or maybe the berries. It's got an almost creamy feel to it which I'm guessing comes from the dragon fruit. It's very fresh tasting, almost like it's got a hint of cactus or aloe to it. Another somewhat familiar taste but I think the addition of the pomegranate and berries really makes this different from any other I've tried. Very fruity and refreshing!! **(8/10)** **Sacha** (Temptress and delicious, its fresh scent of berries with mixed lychee along with a sweet touch and a floral hint, will become your ecstasy.) I think this is my favorite out of the #Popjuice line but I might be a bit biased cause I love lychee. It's something I grew up eating a lot of, #asianupbringing. This is a lovely mix of berry and lychee, I don't really get the floral hint but I do get just a touch of mint or something like that which really makes it pop with freshness. It's really bright and tasty and reminds me a lot of a mixed bowl of fruit, asian style. I'm thinking it might be a love it or hate it type of thing because not everyone can handle lychee. If you've never tried lychee before it's a weird spikey nut looking thing with a soft fleshy inside sort of like a grape that's really sweet but it's also got a weird sort of bitter ear waxy type of flavour to it. It's a very distinct flavour but one that I really enjoy!! Don't worry this one doesn't really taste like ear wax but it does have a hint of that bitterness. Maybe I'm weird but I dig it!! **(9/10)** **Lola** (Explosive and tempermental, its rather sweet fragrance or delicious citrus, mango and refreshing peach, will intoxicate your taste buds.) I'm guessing there's a bit of orange creamsicle in this cause right away I get hit with a bit of that weird burnt plastic taste I normally associate with creamsicle flavours. But it died down really quickly and turned in to a nice mango peach blend. I swear it seems you can't have one without the other, at least in most of the peach or mango flavours I've tried. It's a bit creamy and a bit sweet and once I got past that plastic taste it actually started to grow on me. It too has a nice freshness to it, not sure if it's a dash of mint or something but it's a nice touch to liven it up. Another nice refreshing fruit flavour!! **(7.5/10)** ---- **Happy Boat** **Necky's** (Creamy and rich assemblage of small fruits and ripe nectarines) These Happy Boat flavours came with a flavour card so I didn't have to try them blind but for this one I again wrote down apricot and nectarine but this time in a nice cream. It's like a creamy dessert type of flavour, almost like a fruit custard or something. It's creamy, nice and sweet, fruity and light and all around pleasant. I was recently at a work event and they were serving fresh fruit tarts and I have to say this kind of took me back to those. Not sure that there's any kind of bakery/crust in there but the fruity custard aspect is pretty damn good!! **(8/10)** **Brodyz** (Fried pastry stuffed with a hint of chocolate and covered with a peanut crumble) This one I was probably looking forward to the most based on the description but surprisingly it wasn't my favorite of the Happy Boat bunch. It's an interesting mix of an almost milky chocolate, almost a cocoa or hot chocolate kind of thing with a smooth peanut flavour all over it. While I didn't actually get a good sense of the fried pastry you do get something a bit more then just chocolate and peanut. Sort of hard to put my finger on it but it was still really nice. After the first few hits I started to lose the chocolate and mostly tasted the peanut but it was nice, smooth lightly sweet and pleasant. **(8.5/10)** **Horck** (Refreshing honeydew melon and cucumber smoothie covered with a slightly spicy whipped cream) Ok so this was hands down my favorite from the line and my favorite from NBELiquide. It's a crazy good mix of honeydew and cucumber. I know that sounds a bit odd but it works, like it really really works. The whole thing is sort of smoothed over with what they say is a lightly spiced whipped cream although I didn't really find it spicy at all. Maybe there's a drop of mint/menthol or something in there as it has a really nice fresh feel to it but nothing to me comes across as spicy. The honeydew and the cucumber as bright as those flavours are are almost muddled, like the description says it's a smoothie, so they've been blended together and then softened with the cream. Such a unique take on a fresh flavour and I for one am blown away!! Will definitely need more of this!! **(10/10)** ---- **The others** **Purple** (Grape mixed with cranberries, Apricots with a anise base) I was a bit worried about this one before I tried it as I can't stand anise, luckily it's a super subtle aspect of this flavour. I mainly get an almost tart grape taste, I'm guessing the cranberry plays a significant role there. The apricot to me gets kind of lost in this one but I'm sure it's helping to punch up the fruitiness of the flavour. It's like a grape flavour that's a bit more bright and refreshing then your typical grape. I almost get something between a candy grape and a grape juice with a little bit of tartness. I personally was hoping for a bit more grape out of it but it was still quite nice. **(7/10)** **Night** (A mysterious mix of mysterious fruits and flavours.) This one worked for me a lot better then the Purple. I get a nice rich mix of red and dark berries like raspberry, cherry and blackberry. But I can't really pick any one berry out on it's own. It has a nice bright fresh vibe to it and despite being one of those indistinct berry mixes that I tend to despise I really enjoyed it. It's like a sweet, dark berry juice, reminiscent of something like [Ribena](URL My wife is British so my kids and I are pretty familiar with the dark berry concentrate. Just a really nice deep dark berry flavour!! **(9/10)** **Fruity Juice** (Juicy Fruit gum) I've tried a few Juicy Fruit gum flavours before, but this one is probably the closest I've found to the real thing. Yes it does have a very artificial flavour to it but then again so does the real thing. Like the real thing you can't really tell what fruit it is you're tasting, it's just a juicy mix of fruity flavours. Usually with eliquid flavours like this there's a very strong chemical taste to them or they might be a bit harsh but with this one I found it quite pleasant in both regards and finished off the bottle in just a couple of days. For a guy who doesn't normally vape candy/gum flavours I really got in to this one! It's sort of hard to describe but if you've ever tasted Juicy Fruit you'll pretty much know what to expect. **(9/10)** ---- Unfortunately as I mentioned above these seem to be available in QC only, for the time being at least, I did check with them and they let me know G2K in Ottawa should carry them but they don't seem to have an online shop and I'm no where near Ottawa. Bit of a shame as I could really use some more of that Horck, it's absolutely amazing!! But if you happen to be in QC or Ottawa I would definitely recommend you give them a try if you're able, some really well made stuff here!!! So huge thanks to the gents from NBELiquide you guys make some fantastic juice!!"
179,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Vape Stash Drips,13,5slt6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5slt6z/honest_review_time_vape_stash_drips/,2017-02-08 01:55:49,"Hey guys, Do you know who makes juice?? Do you know who makes some really good juice? Our very own /u/vapestashtips that's who. Not only does he make some really [awesome hand turned drip tips](URL but he's been making some really great juice lately too. When I was at CVE he set me up with a set of them but before I could get around to them, he sent me a few more along with a very purdy custom drip tip!! Here are my honest thoughts on [Vape Stash Drips](URL All of the liquids came in 30ml translucent plastic bottles with the older style blunt tips. Those tips might be an issue if you're primarily using tanks but I tend to drip more then tank so they worked just fine for me. The bottles all have similar labels sporting a mustachioed character that's winking. Nice and clean and no complaints here. All of the liquids I received were 75vg and 3mg nic. Here's a look at [the cheeky bottles I received](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Bhangra](URL **(8/10)** (Warm up with a hot mug of Bhangra, a chai inspired menagerie of sweet cream and spice. Anise, cloves, cinnamon, black pepper and allspice blend together for a distinctly smooth flavour.) I dig me a good cup of Chai and this while just a tiny bit different manages to capture all the wonderful nuances of a good cup of the classic spiced tea. I pick up some strong notes of cinnamon, cloves and maybe just a hint of anise. A bit less pronounced are the black pepper and the allspice and I also don't get much of a black tea flavour from it. Where a lot of chai flavours can go wrong is that dreaded dry potpourri flavour that sometimes overtakes a juice but in this he's added some sweet cream which really helps round it out and smooth it over making it pretty much a perfect cup. Ok so it leans a bit more towards a chai tea latte but I think that rendition of chai is a little more approachable for western palates. I personally wouldn't have minded it being just a touch sweeter but either way I found it pretty much spot on and one of the best Chai tea flavours I've tried yet. Just lovely!! **[Maca](URL **(7.5/10)** (Sweet desiccated coconut atop a dark sugar cookie. Maca is your morning or afternoon tea biscuit in delicious vapeable form.) Not one to do things the same as everyone else, here's something a little different. It's essentially a coconut sugar cookie. For me it starts off with a nice light coconut flavour, a dry coconut almost a bit more like toasted coconut not so much the fresh stuff. Then it rolls in to a lightly sweet sugar cookie that's sort of heavy on the molasses. My Canadian side comes from the east coast so I practically have molasses in my blood and this cookie pretty much hit the proverbial spot. But it all sort of draws to a close there as I found the flavour was a bit fleeting, light, almost too soft. A few hits in and it started to fade for me. Don't get me wrong it was really nice and pleasant while it lasted, I just wished it had a bit more staying power. **[Orange Crunch](URL **(6/10)** (A mnage  trois of orange, hazelnut, and.popped corn. Dont be afraid to hop in bed with these guys, its a sweet and savoury experience unlike any other. Scandalous!) Ok this one is different, like really different. It starts off sort of like Orange Crush or something like that but then it gets a bit creamy and a bit nutty, almost buttery but then back to orange. I do get just a tiny bit of that burnt plastic taste I normally get from Orange Creamsicle flavours but it's barely there. At first I didn't think I could like something like this then it starts to grow on you and the more I vaped it the more I didn't think it was so weird. Still I don't think it's something that will work it's way in to my daily rotation but I have to say for something so different it was somewhat enjoyable. **[Blerrberry](URL **(8.5/10)** (Unleash your inner British Hipster with this harmonious blend of traditional Earl Grey tea steeped with blueberries and then stirred with a little cream.) My wife is British, I don't think that makes me an expert on tea but I have a pretty good relationship with it, the wife too I guess. This is one of the better tea flavours that I've tried and it's just one of three amazing tea flavours from Stash. This one starts off with a very light blueberry flavour backed with a nice strong tea. The blueberry like I mention is light and reminds me a bit of Vitaminwater or something like that, sort of just the essence of blueberry but it's still quite distinct. The tea on the other hand is quite strong, not so much the actual tea flavour but the bergamot in the tea flavour. It can be just a tiny bit sharp not enough to put me off but it is a major player in this. The thing with this is the tea and the bergamot are so real you almost feel like you just set down a cup. Absolutely amazing!!! **[Knoberry](URL **(9/10)** (A classic, well steeped earl grey tea thats great on its own or mixed.) So just as Blerrberry was blueberry Knoberry is no berry. It's just a straight cup of Earl Grey tea and man is it beautiful. Just like Blerrberry the Earl Grey tea flavour is pretty much perfect, it once again has that sharp taste of bergamot but what's a cup of EG without it. This flavour does away with any of the extra additions and cuts straight to the tea, some might appreciate that more while others like to fru fru up their tea. I personally enjoy a good straight cup of tea and this provides just that. Again one of the best renditions of a tea flavour I've tried but again that bergamot can be just a little bit sharp. It wasn't enough to put me off it's just one of those things that needs to be called out. If you like a good cup of tea Earl Grey, more specifically that bergamot oil that accompanies it you're going to love this. Like the description mentioned it would be great mixed as well but I haven't yet tried mixing, I've just been enjoying it straight!! **[Blekberry](URL **(10/10)** (A light and sweet blackberry infused tea.) I'm not sure why but this one was hands down my favorite of the bunch. The black berry in it reminds me of those [little individually wrapped hard candies](URL that come in different flavours, the blackberry ones being my favorite. It's like a mix of a sweet blackberry over that same Earl Grey tea base but it sort of tones it down a touch. Like that sharp bergamot is not so sharp in this one allowing the blackberry to shine through a bit more. I actually like blueberries more than I like blackberries but in the battle of the three teas the blackberry wins it for me. It's quite simple and really doesn't change much from the other two other then the accent fruit but man does this one work for me. I barely put this one down, just a lovely flavour!! ---- So not only does /u/vapestashtips make some really nice drip tips but his juice like I said is pretty amazing as well. These do sort of lean towards more mature tastes but I for one appreciate them. The teas especially are fantastic and if you've been looking for really authentic tasting Earl Grey tea flavours look no further!! I realized I forgot to grab pics of the tips I've got so I'll update my post later this evening.

180,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Kreme from City Vapes,7,5ug2p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5ug2p5/honest_review_time_kreme_from_city_vapes/,2017-02-17 03:34:25,"Hey guys, Here's something I picked up at CVE Ottawa from a company called [City Vapes](URL who after a rather funny conversation fixed me up with a set of a new line called [Kreme](URL a line based on creamy fruit flavours. Out of Vancouver the company has been around since 2012 and has a few other lines they produce, [The Gurtz](URL a yogurt line having been launched the year prior I believe. Typically when I vape fruity flavours I tend to prefer the ones with a bit of cream or something extra in them so these fared very well with me. Here are my honest thoughts on Kreme from City Vapes. The set of four came in clear glass bottles with nice bright blue labels each with a picture depicting the flavour inside. The set I got came in 3mg. I'm not exactly sure of the pg/vg ratio but they're reasonably thick so probably around 70vg. Here's a shot of the [blue labeled bottles](URL I got. Testing was done mostly in a Hadaly clone with a three core alien(3x28/36lvni80) build, 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.29 ohms and running between 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's some [shots of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Strawberry Swirl](URL **(7/10)** (Fresh out of the field strawberries with a natural sweetness, are the perfect pairing to go with dairy cream.) Ok so most of you know how I feel about strawberry cream flavours, I'm pretty much over them at this point. However this one is quite nice and reminds me a lot of a creamy Campino candy but with a slightly fresher taste. The cream is thick an rich, almost yogurty but nice and smooth and doesn't wear on me like so many others can. The strawberry is a little sweet and sort of candy-like but as I mentioned, something in there gives it a bit of a fresh taste which sets it apart from so many others. For a strawberry cream it's pretty good but definitely not my favorite from the line. **[Blueberry Splash](URL **(8/10)** (Freshly picked blueberries with a slight hint of tart and accompanied by the freshest cream on the planet.) In this one the cream feels a bit lighter then the strawberry one but is still really rich, it comes along with a fairly real fresh blueberry taste. It reminds me a lot of a bowl of blueberries in cream, something I often enjoy during the summer when fresh berries are abundant. I found with this one I really got a good sense of the cream and it tastes a lot like a nice thick heavy cream. Don't get me wrong it's still rather gentle and lightly sweet but that cream is quite thick and rich. Again it's so rich and thick it's borderline yogurt but doesn't quite get that slightly sour taste yogurts usually have and as I mentioned it felt just a tad lighter then the strawberry one. If you like creamy fruit vapes these definitely deliver on the cream. **[Grand Mango](URL **(9/10)** (Rich and sweet mango bursting with a tropical goodness and sitting on top of a creamy base of milky perfection.) This one is quite different from the first two, it's much more tropical and just a touch lighter feeling. I get a really nice mango flavour up front with a smooth creaminess throughout. The cream is more of a back note in this one and not super thick or yogurty like a Mango Lassi. I swear I almost taste coconut in it and it really reminds me of a creamy tropical drink, not too far off from a Pina Colada with it's tropical tang and underlying cream. I've tried quite a few mango flavours and I have to say I've really been enjoying this one, it's sort of light and summery and doesn't wear on me too quickly like some of the more straight up mango flavours can. **[Hi-Chews](URL **(10/10)** (A glorious fruit medley comes alive when paired with a light cream.) Ok so again, my asian heritage may have an influence here but ho-lee crap is this stuff tasty. As soon as I crack the bottle I'm greeted with the familiar smell of [Hi-Chew candy](URL not exactly a specific flavour but that sort of familiar smell of the candy itself. Hi-Chew if you're not familiar with it is like the Japanese equivalent of Starburst. Sure they're a bit different but it's essentially a chewy fruity candy with probably the biggest differences being flavours and maybe a bit textural as the Hi-Chew is comprised of two layers, an inner and outer layer. Like I said this flavour is very reminiscent of the base flavour of Hi-Chew and not say a specific flavour like Grape(my fav) or apple if that makes sense. It still has a fruity flavour but it's sort of a mix, maybe a bit of grape or pineapple, maybe apple it's sort of hard to tell but whatever it is it evokes the sense of a Hi-Chew. They're really not all that uncommon anymore and if your local variety store is run by asians, which let's face it it probably is, chances are you've tried/seen them before. This one is probably the least creamy of the bunch and focuses more on that candy taste which smacked me in the face from the first drops on my coils. When vaping it, the overall flavour is surprisingly light and soft but still distinct and sort of lingers on your tongue afterwards. For me this was pretty much an instant win!! ---- City Vapes was a new one for me and I have to say I was overall very impressed. All four flavours were nice and creamy yet still quite different from each other with their fruity focus. For me there was definitely an order of preference but I'd still say all four of them are fantastic and I'd have no trouble recommending them to anyone who enjoys creamy fruity vapes. And to the folks from City Vapes, if you happen to read this, thanks so much for setting me up with these, you did an incredible job on them and I look forward to seeing what you guys come out with next!!"
181,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Eden by Vaporus,9,5jr8rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5jr8rc/honest_review_time_eden_by_vaporus/,2016-12-23 02:51:03,"Hey guys, Here's another new one from [Vaporus](URL that I picked up at CVE Ottawa, it's a line from their newest mixologist Monsieur Alex Beaucage and it's called [Eden](URL I had a chance to speak with Alex about the line and he tells me it was inspired by his long time girlfriend. She wanted something with delicate fruits without any custards or desserts added, something unique and sweet that she could enjoy in a tank all day long. Alex a former professional cook like many good mixologists seem to be spent a year and a half crafting these intriguing flavours for his esteemed significant other. If you ask me, it was time well spent and I love a good back story. Here are my honest thoughts on Eden. The set of three comes in [nice cardboard boxes](URL with a motif that kind of reminds me of a box of perfume, clean and classy. The 30ml bottles are clear fogged glass with labels that continue the nice motif of the boxes. The line is all 75vg and the ones I got were 3mg. Here's a look at [the lovely bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL I also tried them out in a Serpent mini with a similar build. Descriptions in brackets, sorry no links again cause of stupid law 44. You can still get them if you know where to look. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Naiad Silk** (Mango, Blueberry, Taro, Bubble Tea) With this one I smell blueberry right away but I mostly taste a nice sweet smooth taro with little hints of mango. I don't really get a good sense of a bubble tea per say but it does have a nice milky quality to it. Taro isn't exactly a common flavour, but being Asian I grew up with it. It's like a purple sweet potato that Asian cultures love to use in desserts. It's not for everyone I'm sure but I love it. This I have to say is one of the better taro flavours that I've tried, it even emulates that creamy almost starchy quality of the purple delight. At the same time it remains light and fruity with those touches of blueberry and mango. Gently sweet and oh so delicate!! **(9/10)** **Nymph Pearls** (Wild Berries, Super Fruit, Smoothie) All three of these flavours have a light, almost ethereal feel to them. I won't say feminine but definitely delicate and refined. This one is subtle all around, I get a hint of something like a berry crunch but so much more delicate and light, almost fleeting. I get little hints of berries and a sort of candy flavour. A powdery candy like Sweetarts or those Valentine heart candies per a friend of mine. It doesn't come off as powdery though, just gently sweet. I honestly had a real hard time putting down any notes for this one. It's smooth and lightly creamy with a very subtle berry blend flavour. Probably what angels vape. **(9/10)** **Aether Springs** (Apple, Grape, Aloe) This one to me is probably the most bright and fruity of the bunch, it's a mix of sweet red apple with a light sort of candy grape flavour. The aloe is very subtle and sort of blends in with the apple making it all the more refreshing. That grape though does tend to take over as the dominant flavour but you still get hints of the apple. Yet it still manages to be really light and delicate, I don't think I've ever used the words light and delicate so much in a review. Seriously if you asked me what they vaped in heaven it would probably be these. Everything about these is so soft and gentle but still full of flavour. **(9/10)** ---- Looks like Vaporus picked the right man for the job. All three of these are intricate, well crafted and absolutely lovely. As I've mentioned they all have a common feel to them, light, delicate, almost ethereal but again still flavourful and delicious. I'm sure Alex's SO must have been very happy with the results of his 1.5 years endeavour. So huge thanks to Alex and the wonderful folks from Vaporus for setting me up with these delights, I really enjoyed them! If you haven't given Eden or Vaporus a try yet I highly recommend you do!! Edit: forgot to mention Alex is also the man behind e-apothecary!! "
182,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: A selection from Vapeitup,16,5llb6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5llb6v/honest_review_time_a_selection_from_vapeitup/,2017-01-03 00:46:37,"Hey guys, I had the chance to meet some of the wonderful folks from [Vapeitup](URL when I was at CVE and they set me up with a few of their flavours for review. It's my first time trying their stuff and I have to say I was extremely impressed with what I tasted. It looks like I got at least one from each of their three main lines. Here are my honest thoughts on Vapeitup! Three of the four flavours I received came in 30ml unicorn bottles while the fourth arrived in a clear glass bottle with a dropper top. The labels are all bright and colourful with the exception of the Tom Foolery's one, it's a bit more subdued but still nice. They all seem to have the stuff we like to see in fine print. I couldn't find ratios but I'm guessing 70vg or higher as they all seem reasonably thick. The ones I got were all 3mg. Here's a look at [the bottles I received](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[It's Bar! - Lemon Meringue Pie Bar](URL (Lemon Meringue Pie Bar) This one was getting quite a bit of attention at CVE and I totally can see why, it's an authentic tasting Lemon Meringue pie flavour. I found the meringue especially popped in this one and gave it a nice soft yet sweet flavour that complimented the lemon. The lemon curd flavour is nice and mild, not too strong or overpowering and lets the other flavours come through. Often not an easy task with strong flavours like lemon but they've managed to balance it just right for me. It is a bit on the sweet side but I don't mind that personally. There's just a hint of a bakery flavour in there but mainly I get the lemon curd and the meringue and it's absolutely fantastic. I'm not sure it will knock out my favorite lemon meringue flavour but it's really damn close. **(9/10)** ---- **[Cookie Jar - Peanut Butter Cookie](URL (Rich, sweet and nutty cookie vape) These cookie flavours are definitely on the sweeter side, yes they will gunk up your coils and cotton but not nearly as quick as I was expecting. This peanut butter cookie might be one of the tastiest peanut butter flavours I've ever tried. I literally opened it and didn't put it down until it was empty. As I mentioned it's pretty sweet but it's not cloying in anyway. I mainly get a nice smooth peanut butter cookie flavour that's almost creamy. If you've ever made peanut butter cookies you know there's not much too them, just peanut butter, sugar and an egg. Well there isn't much more to this one either, it's mainly peanut butter and sugar but man is it good. For folks who like rich sweet nutty flavours, this one will be right up your alley. **(10/10)** **[Cookie Jar - Coconut Macaroon](URL (Full bodied coconut macaroon cookie) This one reminds me a bit of the Lemon Meringue bar but substituting the lemon for coconut. I get a lot of meringue up front with just the gentlest bit of coconut on the back end. It definitely reminds me of a macaroon with that strong meringue taste. Ok so maybe strong isn't the best word but it is rich with meringue. The coconut as I mentioned is quite light, I personally enjoy coconut and wouldn't have minded it being a bit more punched up but as it stands it's still quite delightful. It's also another one that's borderline creamy. It's reasonably light and I must say it's kind of nice to see a cookie flavour that tries something a little bit different. After ripping through the Peanut butter cookie, this didn't last long either. **(9.5/10)** ---- **[Tom Foolery - The Murphy Game](URL (This Fuzzy Peach style candy vape brings a wonderful almost realistic peach to a candy vape) With this I was pretty much expecting yet another fuzzy peach flavour but was pleasantly surprised to see it's got a little more to it then that. They've kicked up the peach flavour with a more realistic peach and maybe even a tad more. I swear I'm getting a little apricot or something like that in there as well to really freshen it up. It's like a fuzzy peach mashed together with a real peach. It's a nice change from the fairly standard fuzzy peach flavours that I've come across. It's a candy flavour so yes it's a bit on the sweet side but it's not bad at all and I'm sure the candy lovers out there will really dig this one. I don't normally gravitate to candy flavours but I put a pretty sizable dent in this one trying it out. **(8/10)** ---- All around very high marks for Vape It Up. They all seemed well made and well conceived. Sure some of them were a bit on the sweeter side but let's be honest, a lot of us do enjoy the sweeter flavours. I had a look at their other flavours and oh boy do they sound good, if they're anything at all like these I'm sure they'll be amazing too. If you haven't had a chance to try out Vape It Up, I highly recommend you do. And Vape It Up if you happen to be reading this, you guys make some really incredible juice, thanks again for letting me give them a try!!"
183,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Greek Sweets Elixirs,11,5m065c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5m065c/honest_review_time_greek_sweets_elixirs/,2017-01-05 03:46:55,"Hey guys, While at CVE I had the opportunity to meet Maria, the incredible woman behind [The Ecig Flavourium](URL She had recently launched her own line of eliquids based on traditional Greek treats called [Greek Sweets eLixirs](URL and Maria was sweet enough to set me up with a set for review. Here are my honest thoughts on Greek Sweets eLixirs. The set of two came in a [nice little cardboard box](URL along with a [recipe card](URL with an explanation of the delicacies the flavours represent. The bottles are 60ml and the line is 70vg. The ones I picked up were 3mg. Here's a look at [the lovely bottles](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Descriptions in brackets, no links as I believe they are only available in shop at the moment. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Peaches &amp; Greek Yogurt** (Peaches &amp; Greek Yogurt ) It seems in the last few months I went from never having tried a peach yogurt flavour to having tried quite a few of them. Some have been quite good and some not so much. This one squarely falls in the quite good category with a really nice balance of sweet fresh peach with a tart and creamy yogurt. The peach is very upfront, it's a little sweet and tastes more like a fresh peach then a candy or fuzzy peach. Ok maybe not fresh peach fresh as it kind of reminded me of canned peaches in a syrup. That sweet peach is floated in a creamy tangy Greek yogurt flavour. I wasn't a fan of most yogurt flavours until more recently when the Greek yogurts started making the rounds. It's much more realistic then the stuff that used to pass for a yogurt and just works much better for me. It's quite bold with none of that odd barfy taste from the yogurts of yesteryear and with that nice fresh hit of peach it's quite tasty. One thing I should mention though is it can have a tiny bit of a throat hit to it but that's pretty common with a lot of peach flavours I've tried and what it does have is minimal. **(8.5/10)** **Loukoumades** (deep fried donut ball drenched in sweet honey with a sprinkle of walnuts and cinnamon) This one will be for the folks who love honey. While I was at CVE the Ecig Flavourium folks were handing out little boxes of these [Loukoumades](URL donuts and man were they delicious. This liquid captures the essence of those little delectable treats perfectly with a nice light donut flavour that's absolutely smothered in a sweet and delicate honey syrup. The donut flavour is mild and almost acts like a carrier for that sweet sweet honey syrup. I tend to get that donut upfront and then it's all sweet honey from there. It does have a slight and I mean slight floral tinge to it but it's reminiscent of that same floral vibe you get from local honey, just lovely! I also get a light hint of cinnamon but I tend to associate that with donuts. I didn't however get a good sense of the walnuts but between that sweet sweet honey and that light hit of donut it wasn't really missed. I love trying new things and it might be because I love honey but this has been a really welcome treat. Rich and sweet yet delicate and light, just an all around lovely flavour!! **(10/10)** ---- Both of these flavours are well conceived, well made and just as lovely as Maria herself. While it may be difficult for some folks to get their hands on these since I can't seem to find them available online anywhere for those who can I'd say it'd be well worth checking them out. So huge thanks to Maria and the folks over at The Ecig Flavorium for letting me try these, I really enjoyed them both!!"
184,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Lee's Aged Bourbon Custard,16,5mej8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5mej8t/honest_one_shot_lees_aged_bourbon_custard/,2017-01-07 03:36:43,"Hey guys, Some of you may remember a review I did for [Malt Liquid](URL or a [house line](URL from a B&amp;M local to me called [TheVaporBar](URL Well when I was at CVE they launched a new liquid that is quite different from the other stuff they've done. As far as I understand it's a standalone flavour and I for one have been enjoying it quite a bit. Here are my honest thoughts on [Lee's Aged Bourbon Custard](URL It comes in a 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottle and is one of the few juices I've tried that claims to be 100% vg. It's mighty thick so I don't doubt it. It's got a very interesting design on the label with all the usual good info printed along the side. I believe Matt one of the owners has a background in graphic design and it really shows with [this new bottle](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Lee's Aged Bourbon Custard](URL (A subtle but sweet traditional British custard dressed with hints of dulce du leche, Graham Cracker, and topped off with a splash of bourbon.) Right away I have to say this is quite different from any other custard that I've tried but at the same time it has some really familiar elements to it. It's really soft and smooth and upfront I get a nice delicate lightly sweet vanilla custard but like the description says it's subtle. It blends nicely with the bit of Dulce du Leche that I also get but again in a very subtle sort of way. It's almost like it gives you that custardy feel without a whole lot of the typical vanilla custard flavour. I don't really get a sense of the graham cracker or the treacle(seen in other descriptions) but maybe that's the caramel like vibe I was getting from the Dulce du Leche but again that aspect is fairly light so it's kind of hard to tell. The whole thing is then finished off with a rich hit of aged bourbon. Ok so maybe it's not exactly like a hit of bourbon, it's more like a nice accent of oak barrel that normally accompanies a good aged bourbon. I've tasted something similar in liquids that claim to be barrel aged but none of them were quite like this and as far as I know Lee's wasn't barrel aged. Sure the whole concept of barrel aging might be a bit pretentious but if you've ever tried a good eliquid that has been you'll know it can definitely have an impact on the flavour. Lee's manages it without the added time in a barrel and as far as I'm concerned, it's not needed! It captures that oaky finish pretty much perfectly without the added time or expense. I'm sure this one won't be for everyone as it's a rather mature taste but I pretty much smashed though a bottle in no time. One of those flavours you just need to try for yourself!! **(9/10)** ---- So far I've been a big fan of the stuff the folks from The VaporBar have been producing. Not only do they run an amazing shop they make some really fantastic juice. It's pretty obvious they listen to their customers and have a solid grasp on what's good out there. I should probably mention their juice is not produced in house, it's made by a well known and established eliquid manufacturer as is the rest of their stuff. If you haven't tried Lee's, Malt Liquid or TheVaporBar house line for that matter I highly recommend you do and if you're in the Dundas area you should definitely go and check them out, they're really incredible people. So huge thanks to Matt and Coco once again for setting me up with some of their incredible juice, you guys are the best!!"

And what a welcome addition it was!! Here are my honest thoughts on Train Wreck e-Juice. The original set came in 30ml clear glass bottles with some rather interesting and colourful labels. Each label has a sort of stylized image of the flavour in the background with the TW logo and flavour name plastered over top. It's always nice when you can get an idea of the flavour without having to guess the name. The new flavour came in a 60ml Chubby Gorilla bottle and has a darker much more sophisticated theme that kind of reminds me of the Louis Vuitton pattern. All of TWs flavours come in 70vg and the ones I got were all 3mg.

Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Banana Hammock](URL (Summer is here and nothing says summer like rocking the Banana Hammock. This is not your ""Average"" Banana Custard. This is the biggest baddest Banana Experience you will find! So strap this on your unit and walk around with a STRUT on. Two Banana, Two Custards Nuff said Bro.) I vaped a lot of banana flavours when I first made the switch a few years back but I haven't really given them much attention since then so this one was sort of a nice little throwback for me. It reminds me a lot of a banana milk. I've got two kids at home so banana milks are a pretty regular thing around my house. So simple yet so yummy, just banana, milk, ice and a dash of sugar. Just like the banana milk Banana Hammock is a nice soft, very lightly sweet banana in a light cream or milk. It's really close to a fresh banana and not that candy banana or amoxicillin like taste that people either love or hate. It's really smooth and light but still nice and flavourful. This one totally won me over,,,, despite the name. **(9/10)** **[Bask-o-Berry](URL (Mixed field berries like the Chef prescribed for a bright sunny day. Infused with cream and a distinct taste of strawberry, raspberry and blueberry. This is a juice for people who like to high five and smile!) This one didn't quite win me over, it's got that blended berry mix that I'm not usually a big fan of. I found it just a bit underwhelming. Despite the description I was having a hard time picking out the individual flavours in this one. I do get a very berry vibe but not as distinct as I'd like it. The cream softens it up and smooths it out a bit but I wasn't getting a very strong sense of it either. I also got a touch of that waxy note I associate with lime flavours but I didn't see any citrus flavours listed. Don't get me wrong, this one is not bad at all it's just not really for me. **(6/10)** **[Fuzzy Melon Berries](URL (A taste explosion of EPIC portions! This aromatic blend of sweet Watermelon, irresistible Peach, and a taste of Strawberry is an absolute treat for the senses. Think of a refreshing burst of fruit that you have always wanted! Your friends will be begging to try your fuzzy melon berries.) This one was much more distinct then the Bask-o-Berry and right off the bat I get a really nice blend of watermelon and almost a mixed berry kind of thing. I had tasted these all blind without looking at the descriptions and for this one I wrote down watermelon, raspberry and peach as the main notes which was pretty close. I really didn't get much of a strawberry as it's sort of buried in the blend. The peach I think is more of a fuzzy peach flavour then a natural peach but it works well in this mix and probably add to the sweetness. As much as I'm not usually a fan of mixed berry flavours I am a fan of melon flavours and this one was particularly nice, bright and refreshing. When Danny sent over the new addition he also included a 60ml of this tasty treat!! **(9/10)** **[Loonatic](URL (This blend of fruity cereal goodness and milk will challenge senses. Strong bold flavours stand alone and balance each other with a milky finish. Follow your bros, cuz they are already doing it! Keep a eye out it goes fast!) Unfortunately I'm about done with Fruit Loops flavours. I've tried literally dozens of them. They all seem to come from the same place, using the same flavourings with almost nothing extra to distinguish themselves. At least these days most of them have sorted out that overbearing citrus issue. This to me is just another standard fruit loops flavour. It's a bit light and not super milky or creamy, no strong citrus and not harsh or anything. Really it's not bad in anyway it just fails to excite me. **(7/10)** **[Monster Pie](URL (The ultimate Lemon Meringue treat with hints of Tangerine and Buttery Graham cracker crust. Inhale a toasted meringue and exhale a bright tangerine sweetness , oh wait ..whats that? You want more?) At first I thought this was going to be a lime flavour and was expecting that waxy taste I normally get from them. I couldn't have been more wrong. I get a nice smooth and creamy meringue with a very light lemony citrus. Like the description says you get a bit of a tangerine on the exhale but the graham crust was a bit too light for me to really pick out. This last year I've really come around to citrus flavours and this one is a pretty nice addition to the list. For a citrus flavour it's not too sharp as the cream really makes it nice and smooth, almost soft. It's like a nice creamy lemon meringue pie with a kick of tangerine!! **(8/10)** **[Sticky Nana](URL (A rich tantalizing BANANA SPLIT ICE CREAM SUNDAY topped with everyone favourite sweet caramel and fresh ripe strawberries this is the ultimate dessert with no guilt. Get some, its really good! You have been warned!) So this one is a bit odd to me. I barely get anything from the description but what I do get I quite enjoy. What I mostly get from this is a smooth creamy caramel flavour and well that's about it. I don't really get the banana, the strawberries or much of an ice cream but I'm totally cool with that. To me it's sort of like a caramel custard with a very slight fruitiness to it which I'm guessing is that banana and strawberry. It's super smooth and light, creamy with some nice rich caramel notes and like I said just a hint of some kind of fruit. The main note I'm getting though is a really nice, smooth, deep caramel. It reminds me of those little square caramel wrapped in cellophane you buy at the Bulk Barn or wherever. Really it's one of the better renditions of a caramel that I've tried I just wish the rest of it was coming through for me. Either way I still quite enjoyed this one!! **(8.5/10)** **[Tropic Thunder](URL (Do you wish you were on a vacation savoring Acai berry and smashing dragon fruit into a tropical island vape? This blend of exotic fruits, complimented with a pairing of Bavarian Cream will relax your mind and prepare you for a tropical storm. The real question is, would you wanna be trapped in paradise with this vape?) This is another one where my notes were quite far off from the actual description. I found it was a lot like Monster Pie but almost like a softer version, not quite as bright. It's interesting and kind of grows on you the more you vape it but definitely wasn't my favorite out of the bunch. It's got a bit of that waxy lime aspect I'm not the biggest fan of and I swear I was getting a touch of mint in there as well. I really wasn't getting the Acai or dragon fruit but at the same time I was having a real hard time identifying what fruits were in there. It does have a nice smooth creaminess to it which I'm sure is from the Bavarian cream. Nice enough, it just doesn't work well for me. **(6/10)** ---- **[Ripper Sauce](URL (Tantalize your tastebuds with slow toasted almond with rich nutty undertones, that can only be paired with natures own sweetener, fresh, golden honey!) This is the new addition to the line and oh boy was I happy to receive this one. Honey seems to be popping up all over and this is just one of three really incredible honey flavours I've tried in the past month. Sure if you don't like honey this might not work for you but I'm pretty much in love. The first thing I get from it is a slightly floral almost perfumey honey flavour. Don't get me wrong, it's not floral or perfumey in a bad way, instead it's extremely close to what a natural wild flower honey tastes like. My wife brought home some honey powder once and this reminds me so much of the way it tastes, just heavenly. The toasted almond almost gets lost in the sea of golden honey but you still get a nice rich nutty undertone to the whole thing. Really the honey is the star of the show in this one and it couldn't be more welcome. It's a rather simple flavour but it's absolutely divine!! **(10/10)** ---- I almost wished these were bad so I could make a joke about them being a train wreck but they were pretty much anything but. Sure a few of them didn't quite work for me but overall I have to say I was quite pleased. They taste like quality made juice, nothing harsh or gross and the flavours are all well conceived. Danny is not only a really great guy but he makes some fantastic juice. If you haven't had the chance to try them out yet I'd highly recommend you give Train Wreck a shot. So huge thanks to Danny for setting me up with these and especially for that Ripper Sauce, just beautiful!! "
186,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: OhmBoyz Drip City,15,5oj5k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5oj5k6/honest_review_time_ohmboyz_drip_city/,2017-01-18 03:53:01,"Hey guys, I had the chance to meet Alex the man who founded the OhmBoyz Drip City mod club while I was at CVE Ottawa 2016. Last year he had teamed up with a talented mixer to create a line of juice that I think is pretty amazing. You can read a bit more about their story on their site. He kindly set me up with a set of his juices and a new release at the time which might just be the best thing I've ever vaped. Here are my honest thoughts on [OhmBoyz Drip City](URL The liquids come in clear 30ml glass bottles with child safe dropper tops. The labels have a pretty cool sort of cloud bro motif and all look pretty similar except the newest addition, it sports a beautiful golden Sphinx on it's label that really stands out from the crowd. The vg ratio varies between 75 and 80vg so I'll list it with the description. I picked mine up in 3mg. Here's a look at [the set of ODC bottles](URL I got as well as [the new flavour Jabane](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets, they are from Quebec but are available if you look around. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Smur's Squirt](URL (Lured by the magic Smurs Squirt, this delectable blueberry acai drizzling fog, levitates our Balkan yogurt above the clouds. 75vg) Well I don't know what a Smur is or a Smur's squirt is but this blueberry yogurt is fantastic. I get a nice sweet, bright blueberry flavour that sort of reminds me of the blueberry filling in a pie. It's accompanied by just the lightest hint of creamy tangy yogurt. It maintains a light feel to it while still being full of flavour. No graham crust or anything to spice it up, just a creamy smooth and sweet blueberry yogurt. I do find that after a while of vaping I sort of lose the yogurt flavour but the blueberry acai blend is incredible and carries it along just fine. Nice and blue and sweet without being too floral like many blueberry vapes can be. Really enjoyed this one!! **(9/10)** **[Apple Pleased](URL (A Saporific caramelized green apple lightly drizzled in warm spiced butter, This cannonball will blow your taste buds out of the stratosphere! 80vg) If you follow my reviews you know I don't particularly like green apple flavours. Well this one is seriously making me reconsider my feelings on green apple. What I get from it is a really nice tasty green apple smothered in caramel that's been bathed in a spiced cinnamon butter. Seriously it tastes pretty much exactly like that. It reminds me a lot of a fresh baked country pie or one of those caramel apple lollipops that are all sticky and hard to eat but so damn tasty. It's very authentic tasting and very rich. I think one of the reasons I don't like a lot of green apple vapes has been they taste pretty fake, this one stands up pretty well for me and I'm pretty much converted. **(8/10)** **[Moo Mooni](URL (Smashed ripe strawberries mended marshmallow ice cream with our greek yogurt. 75vg) To be honest I almost brushed this one off. Right off the bat I get a very sweet almost perfumey kind of floral strawberry flavour. A few hits later and it dies off and I get a sweet thick almost syrupy strawberry with just a hint of creamy yogurt. Eventually the yogurt gets sort of overwhelmed and I mainly get that sweet sweet strawberry and not much else. Don't get me wrong though, it's fantastic. Very jammy and rich for a strawberry flavour. It might be a bit too much for some but I ended up really enjoying it. Kind of wish there was a hint more of that yogurt flavour like Smur's but at the same time it wasn't really missed. **(8.5/10)** ---- **Jabane** (Ancient nougat, Treat of the gods. A classic honey burnished pistachios and almonds meringue) This is the other amazing honey flavour that I've tried in recent times and hands down the best out of the three. Seriously this stuff is what I imagine ambrosia would taste like and might just be the best thing I've tasted since I started vaping. It's an absolutely beautiful blend of nuts, honey, meringue and nougat. It's light yet distinct, full of little intricacies. The nuts are probably the lightest aspect with the just a hint of them to richen up the sweet honey infused nougat. The meringue is very upfront and gives it a beautiful almost creamy roundness to it. I'm almost at a loss for how to describe this, it's just beautiful. The honey is nice and bold but doesn't come off as floral like some others seem to and the nougat is just spot on, the closest thing I've tasted to the real thing. I've actually made my own honey pistachio nougat a few times and this juice totally puts it to shame. It's just that good!! Now if I could only find where to buy it and in large amounts. **(10/10)** ---- All around I have to say ODC makes some really incredible juice. One thing I should mention is it looks like they might be adding a drop of colouring to their liquids, my eyes have a hard time with reds and greens but even I can see Smur's is green and the others might have a bit of colour too. It doesn't really bother me much but it's possible others might not appreciate it. Jabane however doesn't appear to have anything extra added. If you haven't heard of or tried Ohmboyz Drip City I highly recommend you check them out!! So huge thanks to Alex for setting me up with these incredible delights I truly enjoyed them, now if you could tell me where I can purchase a barrel of Jabane it would be appreciated!!"

He had set me up with a neat little sample pack and was quite keen to get some feedback. Here are my honest thoughts on Hogtown Vapor. The set of three came in a little clear pillow box along with a flavour card. The bottles were 10ml samples and 0 nic so no comments on nic quality or throat hit as all three were super smooth. The labels are dark and minimalist and personally I dig their logo. Here's a look at [the set of samples I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Graceland](URL (Inspired by the King Elvis Presley and his favorite snack, the Fried Peanut Butter and Banana sandwich.) This takes me back to a time when I first started vaping, I gravitated towards simple custards and banana flavours and this reminds me a lot of the juices I vaped early on. It's a smooth blend of creamy lightly sweet peanut butter and banana. Not quite a candy banana but not super real either, more like somewhere in the middle. It's lightly sweet and very soft feeling, not sure if that's cause it's 0 nic or it's just that smooth. While it's not exactly complex or all that mature it's still quite nice and enjoyable. **(7/10)** **[Fruluz](URL (Who doesnt have a fond memory of reaching into the cereal box, and eating a handful of delicious dry bits.) Ok so most of you know my feelings towards Fruit Loops flavours, I'm pretty much over them at this point as I'm sure others are too. It really takes something different to stand out in the endless sea of loops. This one almost manages to impress me with it's twist on the classic cereal vape. There's no milk added! It's just a dry Fruit Loops cereal flavour that I have to say it's pretty much spot on. Absolutely no milk or cream to it yet it still comes off as super smooth, just not creamy. Again that could just be the 0 nic but hopefully they're just that smooth. Not too much of that citrus flavour that tends to ruin FL flavours either, just a nice dry cereal treat! **(8/10)** **[Fantastik](URL (This flavor is straight up Grape Popthat is really all that needs to be said.) This one was probably my favorite out of the set. It's a really nice but fairly simple grape flavour. I don't exactly get a strong pop flavour from it, to me it's more like a grape Blowpop or something like that. It's nice and sweet but not overbearing. It's different from other grape flavours I've tried but I can't quite put my finger on what it is that's different. It's almost like a candy grape and a real grape mixed together and it just works. This one too is super smooth but again that could just be the 0 nic. I've tried quite a few grape flavours and I have to say this one kind of stood out for me. It's got a little extra something to it that just gives it a bit more staying power. **(8.5/10)** ---- While all three of these are somewhat safe flavours I thought that they were all done quite well. Keep in mind the 0 nic may have played in to the smoothness of them but even so the flavours were very nicely balanced and well formulated. Definitely made with quality ingredients. If any of these flavours appeal to you I wouldn't have any trouble recommending you check them out. So big thanks to Josh and team for setting me up with these, I really enjoyed checking them out!!"
190,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,My Trip to the Ottawa CVE,10,5e5h27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5e5h27/my_trip_to_the_ottawa_cve/,2016-11-22 05:06:11,"Had planned to go on Saturday, but with the weather man predicting it was going to become winter overnight, I figured it was high time I got the balance of my patio furniture put away and the garage cleaned out so the car could also be put to sleep for the winter! I had been procrastinating!! Glad I did it, because the weather man was correct, sadly. Sunday morning I woke to crappy weather, but relieved I had spent the day before getting those chores done! So, I decided to clean my tanks and change the coils in anticipation of some fresh new, *non* DIY juices. But once they were all cleaned and back together I couldnt get the top off my Crown!! I spent so long trying, the elastic trick, the rubber gloves, soaked it in warm water, put it in the fridge, you name it, I tried it. All the while the clock is ticking and Im late!! So my friend shows up and I leave it in his capable hands, figuring a little more muscle will do the trick! Not. Im devastated. Im thinking I now need to buy a new one. This is my favorite tank, my all time, never leave home without it, love of my life tank! But wait, I can bring it to the show with me, and maybe I can get the guys I brought it from to have a look at it. But they werent at the show (where were you Vapor North??). So I was kinda bummed. But lo and behold, my first and primary stop and one of the main reasons I was going to the show: The Vaporist!! He and Majorvapes saved the day!! Once introductions were done, they immediately set to work, using these handy dandy little things (apparently tweezers that double as wrenches!) and using two of these wonderful little inventions, got it apart in no time!! I was thrilled! And I definitely need to get myself some of those thingies, pronto!! Phil promptly went off to try and find me some of them to buy, but no one seemed to have them at the show. Thanks for trying to locate some for me Phil!! Hes such a good guy! So, after chatting away for quite awhile I decided we better get at it; it was already late in the afternoon! For the other main reason we went; my friend likes coffee and tobacco vapes, which I deplore, (and can't/won't mix for him), but in my memory bank are all of the wonderful reviews Ive read by /u/majorvapes. First place of course, precisely where we are: /u/TheVaporist, for some of his Double Trouble. Which my friend tested and promptly declared: excellent!! Ill take some he says :) Wait, wait, I tell him, you also have to try his other stuff! He doesnt want to buy any fruit stuff because I make those for him, but I explain, this is *THE Vaporist*, you have to!! So he does and falls in love with the Pomegranate. Yep, better get two of those :) And the very kind Mr Vaporist himself tosses one in for me too :) Then he proceeds to figure out the nic mls I will need to nic these juices because my friend also vapes at two strengths like I do, so we buy 0 nic for most stuff and I nic it. All this to say: Phil, youre the greatest!! Above and beyond the call of duty as always! Phil was busy working the show; out and about, talking to people, customers and other vendors alike, hes a social butterfly that guy :) Meanwhile, majorvapes is filling my ears with where to go for my friend :) It's pretty wonderful having your own personal reviewer at your disposal at a show like that!!! I was about to head off to one booth and asked Major what he thought; his hmmmm...... made me pass :) Because I know; his recommendations are spot on! First, we made a quick stop over at /u/eMixologies to say hello to him! Always nice to put a face to the names you see on here! Then off we went, in search of /u/VanGoVapes for some of their highly touted tobacco vapes. Very helpful young guy there, bought some of those, and he tossed in a bunch of samples as well for my friend, which was very kind of him. Then we were off to Chateau Noir for some more coffee, bought one of those. Then Rope Cut for more tobacco, and bought a few more there. And then we hit /u/VaporusCanada for more of both, because the Major loves them :) Also got to meet /u/VapingJulian :) All in all a very helpful crews wherever we stopped, and most, if not all, know who the major is :) I tossed his name around a few times :) As an aside, funny/stupid story....we had wandered the whole show looking for the Vaporus. Didnt see them, and Major had pointed out they were behind their booth. We come across a large booth and I say: here we are....walk up and tell the young fellow my friend is looking for your highly recommended, by majorvapes, coffee line. He smiles, says great, and walks over to somewhere to get something. As we stand there, I ask the next person; who is Vaping Julian? That draws a blank stare and she says: who???? I say: VapingJulian, from Reddit.....do you know who I mean? She says no, no idea. Another woman comes over, all full of questions, (and a little pushy about it all) who is this vaping Julian??? Who are you?? Why do you ask about this Vaping Julian?? Who is he?? What is reddit?? By now I realize my mistake........we are NOT at Vaporus, we are at Vapours! I swear, I am not dyslexic and Major is not directionally challenged! He was right; Vaporus was indeed a few rows behind them! We quickly hightailed it out of that booth after my friend declared their coffee juice not to his liking :) We aren't buying coffee that hasn't come highly recommended by the man himself!! The only reason I managed to find the Vaporus was because I recognized the sign for LOr!! I wasnt looking for all their brand"" names (I didnt know most of them!) I was looking for the ""Vaporus"" sign! DOH! I guess the first time we had cruised by someone was standing in front of that LOr sign and I missed it! But maybe some signage for their next show? Pointing out who the big company, the Vaporus, is :) Glad we found them though, very friendly crew at their booth! And their coffee is as good as the major declares it to be, apparently, so my friend says :) Now it was my turn :) I swung by my local stores booth, Clear Sky Vapes, and picked up my so cute little mini Icare and a charger for it. Id been eyeing this for a few weeks and had planned on heading downtown to pick one up but I wound up grabbing it at the show. They didnt have the gold one though, so I got it in red! Very Christmas-y :) I really want to like this little thing :) Perfect for stealth vaping, which I do everywhere with my little Pico, which is temporarily down for the count as I await a new Melo 3 Mini tank (because I busted mine while in Denver last month). Denver was a tough trip for my vape gear for whatever reason....my Endura T18 battery bit the dust one morning so I had to rush out and buy a new kit, and my Melo 3 Mini tank popped off and broke apart. But I digress.....as usual lol. Then I headed over to Premium Labs. Fully prepared to spend a bundle on some Worlds Best Custards. They are so good, to me, but so loaded with sweeteners. A nostalgic vape for me....my first juice in my new Crown tank last New Years Day. Since I DIY now and dont vape that sweet stuff, I thought I would treat myself at the show to some sweetened juice. They have a huge booth and I wander from end to end, cant see them anywhere. So I start over and go around once more, I must have missed them, I think. Finally, in frustration, I ask an employee, where are the Worlds Best Custards?? Oh, we didnt bring those he says, but we have....blah blah and blah.....here with us. Nope, not going to work for me, I want some Worlds Best Custards!! So that bummed me out. They brought every other line they make but that one! So now I go wander some more, but my friend is getting tired and of course, he has bought everything he needs lol. So we go past the Juice Punk and I decided to buy some more of those. I had bought most of their line way back when and figured what the heck, Im here, I want something! So I tried one of their new ones and bought some of that and picked up a few others, and of course, my friend bought a tobacco one :) And then we headed back to the Vaporist to say our good byes and express our gratitude once again to Phil and Majorvapes. It was the highlight of the show for me, and the main reason I went :) So glad to finally meet those guys, both wonderful people who each do so much for this sub, each in their own way. It was a pleasure! Plus they fixed my Crown, remember! All in all it was a pleasant experience overall. We did our bit, dropped a fair bit of cash, between the two of us, in support of our local and Canadian vendors. I must admit, I sailed by most booths, I cant say I personally sampled much of anything, as I wasnt really on the hunt for new juices or lines, again, because I DIY now. But I was happy to buy stuff from those folks I know from here on Reddit. As was my friend. Some folks said it wasnt as busy as the shows in Montreal and Toronto. I wouldnt know, as I havent been to either of those, I had just missed last years Montreal show, as I started vaping just after it took place. But I really thought this show was the right amount of people, for my tastes. Not dead at all. Lots of people around to make it show exciting and yet not hordes of people so that you couldnt get near a booth or be able to get help from someone. Yes, some booths looked completely dead though. I suppose from a vendors perspective, this show may not have been as successful as others they have set up at, and I can certainly understand that. And these shows arent cheap for vendors to attend! But as the Vaporist said: its not about making money for him, its about the networking. And he does that very well. A smart business man that fellow is :) And he has a customer for life, his Double Trouble was declared the winner at the end of the day by my friend. It was his favourite out of all coffee ones he bought! Now I just need to nic it for him! So in summary, I enjoyed the show for the few hours I went, glad to support our locals and most of all: my goals were accomplished: got some great tobacco and coffee vapes for my friend and got to meet Phil and majorvapes :) There are good reasons why both those gentlemen are respected, both on here, and in real life. I always appreciate straight shooters and honest folks and these two are the real deal. Cheers!"
191,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: A collection of Vapour Artisans,17,5ebp2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5ebp2b/honest_review_time_a_collection_of_vapour_artisans/,2016-11-23 03:45:58,"Hey guys, A little bit before CVE I was contacted by Jason from [Vapour Artisans](URL Some of you long time redditors may remember him as /u/JGVapes, that was before he got in to the eilquid game. Well he was kind enough to get in touch and send over some of his best sellers and I have to say I've been enjoying them quite a bit. Here are my honest thoughts on a handful from Vapour Artisans. They came in a variety of bottles since he sent me a few from several different lines. All of them were in glass bottles with nice dropper tops. Clean labels all around with plenty of information on them. All of the bottles I received were MaxVG and 3mg. Here's a look at the [Summer Vibes](URL bottles, some [Baker Street](URL and a few from the [Maven Red Line](URL Testing was done in a narda with a fused clapton(28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Summer Vibes** **[Blackcurrant](URL (A mouth watering lemonade with a sweet burst of blackcurrant, finished with strawberry, raspberry and delicate hint of mango.) With this one I get a pretty decent bit of throat hit, not sure what's causing it as I didn't get nearly as much from the other Summer Vibes flavour, my guess is one of the flavourings is causing a bit of a tickle. It's not so back I can't enjoy it but enough that I felt I should call it out. It's a really nice mix of berries with a bright citrus backend. It' very bright and summery but just a tiny bit muddles with the berry mix. I mostly taste the blackcurrant and some raspberry but not getting much of the strawberry from it. I can also taste a bit of the mango on the exhale but it's subtle and just sort of adds some body to the whole thing. If you're in to citrus and berry flavours this one is quite nice. **(7.5/10)** **[Grapefruit](URL (A sweet and sour explosion! Refreshing raspberry grapefruit lemonade balanced with a dash of bold strawberry to round out this delicious blend.) I actually enjoyed this one more than the blackcurrant one. It's got a bit of bitterness from the grapefruit but it's nice and authentic. The citrus is almost candy like or like a sweet lemonade. I get just a bit of the berries on the backend but it's mainly the grapefruit that steals the show with this one. It's a bit different than some of the others I've tried but it's really nice and not overpowering or overly bitter. I also don't get the little bit of throat hit I got from the blackcurrant one. Another one that's very bright and summery but this one to me feels a bit more refreshing and I dig it! **(9/10)** ---- **Baker Street** **[Lemon Sherbert](URL (A deliciously sweet and tart lemon sherbet shortcake. An instant favourite.) I've been really enjoying lemon flavours lately. They've come so far from just a year ago. This one is no exception. I mainly get a nice lemon pound cake sort of thing that's just atiny bit sweet and not too sharp for a lemon flavour. I do get a tiny bit and I mean tiny bit of a throat hit from it which is likely the citrus but it's not unbearable and it's hardly noticeable after a few good pulls. The cake flavour I get though it great. My mother used to make a really nice lemon pound cake and she'd smother it with icing, this for some reason reminds me of that. I guess it's a bit reminiscent of a sherbet but I'm all about the cake in this one! **(8/10)** **[Mango Pineapple](URL (An amazing combination of mango and pineapple balanced with a hint of creamy coconut and perfectly fused with our delightful shortcake base.) This one is a bit on the heavy side for a fruit flavour. I get a rich mango that's almost thick, like it's over ripe mango but it's super authentic tasting, like I can almost taste the fuzz from the mango if you know what I mean. It kind of reminds me a of a glass of mango juice. The pineapple take a back seat to the mango but punches it up a bit and gives it more of a nice tropical vibe. I almost felt this one could be lightened up a bit as that mango is quite heavy but like I said it has a very authentic taste to it so if you love mango you'll probably dig this. **(7/10)** **[Strawberry Rhubarb](URL (Succulent strawberry and tangy rhubarb blended perfectly with a creamy vanilla cake base.) I love strawberry rhubarb, I was practically raised on it and this year has brought out quite a few of them. This one is a really nice addition to the list I've tried. It's just the littlest bit tart from the rhubarb and a little bit sweet from the strawberry. I imagine finding the right balance between the two was a challenge but VA seems to have done a stand up job of it. While I don't think it's my favorite strawberry rhubarb that I've tried it's probably a very close second. The strawberry comes off as soft, almost warm like it's been baked in a pie along with the rhubarb which also is a bit on the softened side, makes it that much more realistic. It's such a nice blend of sweet and tart with neither of them being overbearing. I could easily vape this all day!! **(9/10)** ---- **Maven Redline** **[Blue Razz](URL (Perfectly sweet, perfectly tart. A Great marriage of blueberry and raspberry.) I've never been a big fan of blue raspberry flavours, I know plenty of people like them but it's just not really my thing. That said I didn't mind this one. It reminds me a lot of a blue slushee. It just a little bit tart but mostly sweet. It's kind of soft, not offensive in anyway and has a really inviting smell to it. It's not harsh and it doesn't have a strong chemical taste or anything just a nice smooth blue raspberry flavour. And while I do get a good sense of the raspberry the whole thing tastes a bit artificial to me. I mean it's not like real blue raspberries exist,, or do they?? Either way it's an enjoyable recreation of a fairly classic treat and as much as it's not really for me I thought it was done rather well. **(7/10)** **[Gingersnap](URL (Warm gingerbread cookie blended with sweet vanilla and subtle notes of creamy coconut. A different spin on a classic treat.) Ok so this one didn't last long for me. I popped this in to an rdta and practically drank the stuff. Maybe it's the time of year but I found this so warm and comforting that I couldn't put it down. It's a really nice mix of spice like cinnamon and ginger, maybe a bit of molasses as it's got that deep richness to it. It's a tiny bit sweet but not in a bad way and leaves this really nice lingering taste of creamy coconut in your mouth. I do get a hint of dryness from it, most likely the cinnamon but it's not really biting or anything and I hardly notice it. While I kind of wish I got a bit more ginger from it, the whole thing is just fantastic!! **(9/10)** **[NX](URL (Our most popular tobacco flavour. NX offers a strong caramel and graham cracker inhale, with a smooth vanilla exhale. A signature Maven flavour.) I've been loving tobaccos this year. So many good one have come out making the mediocre RY4s of yesteryear seem like a distant memory. This one was my surprise favorite from the line and I couldn't be more happy with it. It's an incredible blend of a rich smooth somewhat dark tobacco with a nice sweet caramel and hints of vanilla floating around in it. The description mentions some graham cracker but to be honest it was kind of lost on me, not that it was even missed. I'm sure it just adds to that remarkable richness but I couldn't really pick it out. There's plenty enough going on in this to fall in love. It's such a rich deep flavour and in the right setup it's almost impossible for me to put down. While it is a bit on the sweet side for a tobacco I really really enjoyed it. One of my favorite tobaccos of the year for sure!! **(10/10)** **[Sweet Bourbon](URL (Capturing the essence of a full-bodied bourbon while blending subtle notes of toasted almonds and coconut.) Another incredible thing this year seems to have brought are some wonderful liquor based vapes. I'm not a huge drinker but I still enjoy the finer spirits as many of you I'm sure do as well. Well this one is a really beautiful recreation of a nice sweet bourbon flavour with plenty of other little subtleties thrown in. I get a wonderful bourbon flavour without any boozy edge with some toasted almond nuttiness and a wonderful coconut finish. It's bold and beautiful but not overbearing. That bourbon flavour has a nice light oaky flavour to it that I find really enjoyable. You can practically taste the tannins in this. Such a nice flavour and another favorite from the line.**(9/10)** ---- I have to say I was most surprised by the Maven line. I had seen them in store several times and always passed them up. I think maybe it had something to do with the rather modest labels, for some reason I just didn't think they'd be good. Boy was I wrong. Ok so I'm totally guilty of judging a book by it's cover but hopefully after reading this you won't make the same mistake as me. All around I was really impressed with pretty much everything Jason sent over, so thanks Jason you're a true gentleman and I really appreciate you sending them my way. If you have a chance to try any of these out please do, I think you'll be quite surprised like I was!!"
192,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,A very big thank you to everyone and shoutout to Analog-Dan!,11,5ecw32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5ecw32/a_very_big_thank_you_to_everyone_and_shoutout_to/,2016-11-23 07:12:24,"Hi guys, &amp;nbsp; Post-CVE sale post coming soon, it's already up on website, but I thought this post should come first! &amp;nbsp; Thank you all for passing by our booth this weekend to say hi! We had a blast meeting everyone, making new friends and putting faces to usernames :) &amp;nbsp; This show really was a challenge. Bringing 2 companies and setting up 2 booths was a PITA, especially on 1h of sleep. We were also missing some items that were not delivered to the expo (banners), so it made the booth look a bit weird for Bargain E-Juice. But as usual we pulled it off and the crew made it all happen yet again! They really are the best! I am forever grateful :) Special thanks to /u/majorvapes for helping us out on Saturday/Sunday. It was greatly appreciated! &amp;nbsp; The show was awesome! From vendors to attendees, the atmosphere is just amazing at these conventions. Everyone is friendly, smiling, sharing knowledge and helping each other. I find this is a rare thing nowadays, and consider myself lucky to be part of this community! &amp;nbsp; From the bottom of my heart, thank you all for making this so much fun! **You guys are what makes this community great, and give us vendors a reason to keep going!** I'd shout names but I'll forget someone and feel terrible about it ;) &amp;nbsp; Can't wait to do it all again. The stress is crazy beforehand, but it's all worth it! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I also want to take the time to give a shoutout to /u/Analog-Dan! &amp;nbsp; With every expo we attend, some things end up dragging and become last minute hassles. This time, it was with casings for DNA200 passthrough devices. I wanted to get a specific box (SILO 950) and was being tossed around right and left by a US manufacturer. I contacted them 3 months before the show, but was never able to get any clear answers from them or close a sale. &amp;nbsp; 2 weeks before the convention, I sent an email to our well known Analog-Dan to see if I could rush order some cases. As was expected, Dan is an extremely friendly guy with a lot of knowledge. He was able to make 8x Hammond 1590A boxes with custom elements extremely fast and saved the day! &amp;nbsp; He removed the lean, powder coated them, made the proper cutouts and buttons for the DNA200 and even created a custom 3d printed screen holder for the DNA200 that screws on the board and the box (no glue..yay!!!). The black powder coating he applied is so well done my engraver wasn't able to fully remove the layer in 1 pass to add my logo. Can't say the same about my silo/other cases! &amp;nbsp; The boxes ended up looking gorgeous and held up extremely well to the abuse from the show. The previous mods we painted with tremclad started looking like shit after 1 day at CVE Toronto. These still look new even after all the banging and scratching! Photos: URL &amp;nbsp; I honestly cannot recommend him enough for any custom mod that anyone would need! You can find him right here under /u/analog-dan or his website: URL &amp;nbsp; Thank you Dan for saving my ass, doing an amazing job and being a great guy! I am lucky to consider you a friend! &amp;nbsp; Phil URL"

The warm feelings all around and the sense of community helps remind my whole team and I what a privilege it is to work in and be a part of this industry. Our booth was honored to host the Horizon Distribution and the [League of Scoundrels](URL (SCNDRL) team out of California. Honestly some of the funniest group of people i've met, and in between the pranks and games [Jean Benedicto](URL (Benny) was signing mods and sharing his story about how he came into the business. [Andrew Birnbaum](URL (the CFO of SCNDRL) is probably the most knowledgeable and connected person in the industry i know of, and hearing his insights and his story was truly humbling. If someone is looking for a high end mech mod, look no further. Literally the best mech mods there are. I would also like to thank Vince and Rob from Horizon Distribution in Edmonton, none of this would have happened without you guys. Although the turnout was less than expected, it gave us a chance to really talk with and get to know people and their tastes. Much of the new lines that will be coming out in the next few months will be influenced by the insights we gained over this past weekend. Keep your eyes peeled folks! I hope that due to the convention being held in Ottawa that some MP's and our politicians were invited by the CVE crew to see the benefits that this industry has on Canadians. From the jobs created to the health risks alleviated from not smoking, we all know that the benefits are huge but hopefully others outside the industry noticed as well. With that being said, i would finally like to mention a couple people from this subreddit who really stood out to me personally. Firstly /u/majorvapes, you're a really cool person and your juice knowledge is off the hook. To those who haven't met Chris in person, despite the fact that he's the kind of stand up person who will say it how it is, he is also very approachable and welcoming. Thanks for the love you showed us at CVE Secondly /u/TheVaporist, it was awesome meeting you. Phil, thanks for helping me find a hand spinner, they are so addicting lol. I really enjoyed trying your juices, and i really liked your fruit loops flavour. Much Love Khizer Daya - COO PS. Just a reminder that if you are purchasing any juice from our website use coupon code REDDIT15 for 15% off"
194,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Coppervape BF Mechanical Mod Kit,10,5ehznq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5ehznq/honest_review_time_coppervape_bf_mechanical_mod/,2016-11-24 02:57:05,"Hey guys, Here's a little something I've been wanting to pick up for a while but just never got around to. It's a mechanical squonker made by [Coppervape](URL They're a company out of Shenzen that I believe makes clones but also some original products, like this [Coppervape BF Mech mod kit](URL Mine was sent over from [Gearbest](URL for review. It's a pretty simple device so this one's going to be short and sweet! Here are my honest thoughts on the Coppervape BF Mech Mod kit!! **Here are the contents of the box:** 1 x Mod 1 x Atomizer 1 x Replacement Wide Bore Drip Tip 1 x Replacement Tank 3 x O-ring 4 x Insulated Ring 2 x Screw **The listed features:** -Dual posts -Adjustable side airflow -510 thread -10ml capacity -Replacement wide bore drip tip and tank -Using 1pc 18650 battery ( not included ) -Material: stainless steel, brass and aluminium alloy -Size: 4.7 x 2.5 x 11cm Here's a link to a [full album of pics](URL ---- **The packaging:** It comes in a pretty straightforward [cardboard box](URL Inside the mod and extras are [safely packed in a sponge insert](URL With it you get [the mod, the atty, a chuff cap, a spare bottle, spare orings, spare insulators and spare screws](URL Simple and straightforward and no complaints from me. **The Coppervape BF Atomizer:** I'm going to start by saying that the atomizer is probably the weakest part of the kit and one of my only real complaints overall. Even though I'm still new to squonking I'm very familiar with what a good rda should be and this one kind of drops the ball. The airflow comes in from the [bottom and the sides](URL but you can only adjust both at the same time, you can't close off one or the other you have to use both and in a squonker that can be risky business if you over squonk/squeeze. I also found I didn't get the best flavour from it, not sure why as it seems reasonably well built, my guess is the excessive airflow even with it mostly closed. I personally would have loved to see it with independently adjustable airflows so I could chose to use only the side airflow and not the bottom and vice versa. The deck is a pretty standard one with [velocity style posts](URL and a reasonably deep juice well. It's easy to build on and really [easy to wick](URL just make sure your cotton reaches the bottom of the deck and you're pretty much golden. The bf pin protrudes a good amount but because of that bottom airflow you'll still want to use caution when squonking otherwise you'll be leaking out the airflow. The bottom airflow inlets on the deck are raised but they're almost even with the bf pin so like I said it can be risky business. Personally after using it for a couple of days I swapped it out for the Aspire Quad Flex in BF mode with the top airflow cap and had a much much better experience. **The Coppervape BF Mechanical Mod:** Now on to the mod itself. I have to say it's very well made and very well machined, everything about it feels solid. It's made from a single block of aluminum with some parts being made from stainless steel. There is the tiniest and I mean tiniest bit of play between the bottle/button assembly and the body of the mod as the two are help together with magnets. Not sure if that'll be the case with all of them but it is with mine. It's negligible enough that I really have to be looking for it to notice. The two pieces for the most part are solidly held together. That top piece [houses the BF 510, the bottle assembly](URL and the button. The [BF 510 looks and feels solid](URL can't imagine any issues arising from that but it's still reasonably new and I'm still new to squonking. The bottle assembly is super easy to use and unscrews from the bottom of the top piece to let you fill up when needed. The feed tube runs right to the bottom so you can get pretty much every last drop out of it. [The button](URL however feels a bit on the cheap side. It's made of plastic and if you turn it it locks but when just pressing the button it'll sometimes catch a bit unless you're pushing it down perfectly centered. Taking the whole thing apart is super easy so I cleaned it out and it seems to work a bit better but that's something to keep in mind. The body of the mod is sleek and compact, just [a tiny bit bigger than my original Noisy Cricket](URL It holds the battery and protects the juice bottle. That bottle holds 10ml and the kit comes with a spare in case you manage to crack it. Just pull the top off and you can unscrew and fill your bottle, very easy and convenient. It's nice and squishy too and I haven't had any issues with it yet. There's a nice sized cutout on the side of the mod where you can squeeze the bottle to juice up your wicks. The battery is held in with a rather small threaded cover. It's a bit of a pain to use but it works well enough. The threads aren't exactly the smoothest but I've been careful with mine and so far it's been working well. It's more just an inconvenience than anything. I sort of wish you could swap batteries through the top like the juice bottle but at the same time it's nice that the battery is secure in case the top accidentally comes off. **Performance:** As with any mechanical and/or rebuildable device, performance will really depend on your ability build and wick and also the quality of your batteries. That said with this thing, using [just a basic build](URL at around 0.3ohms it was performing great. Of course changing the atty made a big difference for flavour but even with the default atty the kit worked just as it should. I personally enjoy using mech mods and tailoring my builds according to my setup but anyone considering one of these should make sure they understand their battery safety as well as ohms law. **Overall:** I'm very happy to have received this squonker, it's very well made and works great to boot. I've been wanting to get in to squonking for quite some time but haven't been too keen on a lot of the designs that have been popping up lately so it was really refreshing to come across this beauty and the fact that it's affordable just makes it that much more appealing. As always the big questions, will I keep using this? Well I've barely given it a break since I got it and it traveled to CVE with me which was super convenient for the long car ride. Would I recommend this thing? Absolutely but only to those I know are confident with their knowledge of batteries and building."

197,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Kloud Headz,11,5eo0vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5eo0vu/honest_review_time_kloud_headz/,2016-11-25 01:41:09,"Hey guys, Here's something I picked up samples of at Juice Jam but never got around to. Before I was able to get to a review I was actually contacted by one of the owners and was offered a full set for review, impressed by the little samples I had tried I was more than happy to accept. I was able to pick them up in person at CVE from David, one of the owners. The company is called [Kloud Headz](URL and these are my honest thoughts on their lineup! The bottles are black and opaque and while they look fantastic they can be a bit of a pain trying to see what you've got left in the bottle. The labels have a really cool look to them with each sporting a different black and white background with their Kloud Headz Logo, flavour name and all the usual information in Bright yellow. The line is all 70vg and the ones I received were all 3mg. Here's a look at [the nice bottles](URL that I received. Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL I also tested some of them out in the iJoy Combo on a three core fused clapton (3x26/38) 5 wraps on a 3mm 0.17 ohms and running it around 80-100w, here's a pick of [the combo build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Energy** (A summer storm of red and green apple, strong gusts of strawberry with thunder bolts of a drink which elicits energy. She is a summer baby treat her right!) I'm not usually a fan of energy drink flavours but this one kind of caught me by surprise. Right of the bat I get a nice blend of gentle green apple and strawberry that sort of morphs in to the familiar taste of redbull or something like that. I don't drink many energy drinks so I don't have much to compare it with but I can say I enjoyed this quite a bit. I also get a bit of a red licorice sort of thing from it. It's a bit sweeter than most of the others in the line but somehow I don't think they use sweetener and if they do they use very little of it. Very nice and refreshing!! **(8/10)** **Mainland** (Embark on a trip to the eclectic tastes of the orient with this infusion of sweet guava, pomegranate and juicy pear. Influenced in part by the famous guava candy, have your mod fully charged, youll need it.) From this one I mostly get a blend of pear and guava. I don't really get a good sense of the pomegranate but there's a light tartness to it which I'd assume is from that. This one is pretty different but it's nice. It reminds me a bit of a cactus or aloe flavour, another very refreshing flavour from the line. It's a pretty delicate flavour and there's a note in there that's borderline floral but not quite. Such a difficult flavour to describe but if you've ever tried the classic Asian Guava candies it's pretty much bang on! **(9/10)** **Dohnutz** (Dohnutz will become your necessity. Fresh out of the stone-oven, frosted donuts with a cinnamon undertone and a dash of flirtatious vanilla. Savory, its time you met your maker.) There's something very light about this donut flavour. The cinnamon is light, the dough is almost fleeting, it's not sweet and there's just a little bit of dryness to it. But don't get me wrong it's still pretty fantastic. For me popping this in to the iJoy Combo with a bigger dual coil build really brought it to life. I'm pretty sure KH takes the less is more philosophy to heart as most of their flavours are quite delicate and light. I still get all of the elements from it but it's light enough I can vape it all day with no issues and still feel like I want more. I particularly enjoy the lingering taste it leaves on my lips. I kind of wish it was a touch sweeter but as it stands it's a pretty solid donut. **(8/10)** **Wake &amp; Vape** (A throwback milky cereal taste with miniature strawberry and banana slices. Vape and reminisce in the bliss of innocence eating cereal while watching the tv too close.) True to form, KH does things just a bit differently. I honestly was expecting a coffee flavour from this so was pleasantly surprised when I tasted it and it was a cereal. But not your typical cereal flavour. I get a creamy cereal with sweet strawberry and banana sort of sprinkled in. It reminds me a bit of a berry crunch cereal but with more fruitiness. I do get a tiny bit of a throat hit from this one but it's not unbearable at all and didn't stop me from enjoying it. It's different from the majority of cereals I've tried but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. **(8/10)** **Aphrodisiac** (Lava fudge chocolate with white chocolate swirls on the inhale and a smooth sweet strawberry exhale will have the hormones as high as your watts. Please vape responsibly!) Probably the richest of the line but it's still somehow comes off as light. I'm guessing again that it's the lack of sweeteners but I haven't confirmed that. This one gives me a nice powdery chocolate truffle sort of flavour with just the lightest touch of fruitiness. The strawberry is almost buried in the chocolate but I still get nice hints of it. It sort of reminds me of that flavour you get from the strawberry cream chocolates in one of those assorted boxes. Despite the description I actually found that this one gets kind of weird at higher wattages but keeping it low kept it nice and tasty. I should also mention that the wife really didn't care for the smell of this one but luckily it doesn't taste odd like it smells. A bit decadent but beautiful! **(8/10)** ---- All around high marks for Kloud Headz, all of their flavours were nice and clean tasting with nothing unusual going on. I mentioned it earlier, most of these are on the light side but that just means it's easier to vape them for long periods without getting sick of them. I also found them light on sweetener if they have any at all which I know many appreciate. If you haven't heard of Kloud Headz before I'd say they are definitely worth checking out! So huge thanks to David for setting me up with these beauties, I really enjoyed the line!!!"
198,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Cthulhumod Shuriken 24mm RDA,7,5ephh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5ephh3/honest_review_time_cthulhumod_shuriken_24mm_rda/,2016-11-25 06:36:24,"Hey guys, So /u/Cthulhumod reached out to me a little while ago to offer up the Shuriken 24mm rda for review. I've been a fan since their original Cthulhu rta. They always seem to have a good grip on what's good going in the industry and as far as I'm concerned they did a pretty darn good job with this Shuriken rda. I do have a couple minor complaints but nothing that would stop me from using it. Here are my honest thoughts on the Cthulhumod Shuriken RDA 24mm. **Package contents:** 1x Shuriken RDA 24mm 1x 510 tip adapter 2x air flow rings 1x pack o-rings 1x spare screws 1x allen key **Listed features:** * Depth of juice well: 6mm / 0.24'' * Support dual coil and single coil * 2 Post clamp styled build deck * Anti snip design * Side airflow control * 510 threading connection * 24mm overall diameter Here's a link to a [full album of pics](URL ---- **The Packaging:** This thing comes in a very [cool little plastic box](URL that I personally really enjoyed. The RDA showed up the day before I left for CVE and I tossed it in to my build kit to take with me. It's such a small box that it fit perfectly even though I had already packed. In the tiny little box they managed to pack all the usual extras as well as an additional afc ring. Along with that extra afc ring you get, the RDA, a 510 drip tip adapter, a pack of spare orings, a spare screw and an allen key. Everything arrived safely and in a [convenient little sponge lined package](URL couldn't be much happier with it! **The RDA:** [The Shuriken 24mm RDA](URL is well built, made from stainless steel and feels absolutely solid in hand. It's 24mm diameter and only 32mm tall with the drip tip. I got the black version but it's also available in SS. It's got a really nice 6mm deep juice well that'll hold a butt ton of juice, pretty sure I've got tanks that hold less juice. It sports a nice wide bore drip tip which is probably delrin but I didn't see it listed anywhere. The threads on the 510 are nice and smooth and it has [a non-adjustable 510 pin](URL On the afc rings it sports the Cthulhumod logo, the head of Cthulhu himself!! **The Deck:** The deck comes equipped with [two large posts with c shaped clamps](URL which are actually patented by Cthulhumod and we've seen them before on the original Shuriken 22mm rda. I've used a similar deck with the iJoy Combo if you recall but with the Combo there was a slight improvement, it came with spring loaded clamps. On the Shuriken 24mm you'll have to lift up the clamps by hand or turn the whole thing upside down when you want to slide your wire in. Actually I was just able to lift them up with the wire I was using and slide them in but it could be a bit of a pain for new builders. I personally don't have any issues building on it but would love to see those spring loaded clamps in this for convenience sake. While I don't have an exact measurement the deck is nice and wide and should accommodate some pretty hefty builds. I tend to prefer two post decks as it leaves a little spot in the middle where you can drip without worrying of overdripping and while this is a two post deck it unfortunately takes up most of that center area. Not that I had any issues with dripping down the cap, I still found with this design I prefer to pull the cap off and make sure everything is good and saturated. While I was at CVE I tossed in a quick [dual fused clapton build](URL (2x26/40 6 wraps on 3mm) and boy was I enjoying it. If you were at CVE you might have seen me walking around with it on top of my VS DNA200 and rocking it at 100w. Another thing I wouldn't have minded was the post screws use an allen key while I would have preferred philips head screws, again only for conveniences sake but the allen head screws did work just fine. **Flow Control:** For airflow control you actually get [two different AFC rings](URL which you can swap out to suit your preference. Both have three holes on either side but one has [3mm circular holes](URL while the other has [three 2.5x6mm slots](URL I noticed on the one with the circular holes the logo is [printed upside down](URL on the one side. On the slotted afc there is only one logo and it faces the right direction. Not really a big deal as it works fine it's just a cosmetic quirk with mine. I actually preferred the slotted afc anyway so it's pretty much a moot point for me anyway. **Performance:** Performance as with any rebuildable will depend on your ability to coil and wick as well as how much power you give it but with the build I chucked in it, it was working an absolute treat! Nice big flavourful clouds, but like I always say results will vary. One benefit of those large center posts up the middle is you're less likely to get any spit back and in the week that I've been using it I haven't once experienced any hot juice spitting in to my mouth. Also all of the options around airflow really let you run it how you want. **Overall:** I really enjoy using it, it's not exactly a flavour chasing rda but the flavour I do get from it is great. Pair that with the big clouds it can produce and you're somewhere in the middle of a flavour and a cloud chasing atty. Sort of the best of both worlds. It'll let you build some really nice big coils but also gives you plenty of options for the airflow. I wouldn't recommend this as a mtl rda but for those who like to build big and chuck some clouds, it's a pretty awesome option. I was enjoying it enough that while at CVE I picked up a [custom drip](URL tip for it, something I don't do often. I found the perfect one and it's made of [shredded up $5 bills](URL I can't remember the folks who made the drip tip but I'm pretty sure I picked it up from the SnakeCoils booth but I could be wrong. So the big questions will I keep using this thing? Yes absolutely 100% I will!! Really been enjoying the flavour and clouds I've been getting from it. Would I recommend this thing? Yup without question! Especially for anyone looking for an easy to work with 24mm rda that has great flavour and lots of airflow, it's a really great option! "

[The FoggyCoil] (URL is a division of Breaking Good which if you've followed my reviews for some time you might remember me covering some of their liquid for a company called Smoke-Less out of NS. Well I guess somethings have changed and now The FoggyCoil has asked me to review some of their stuff. It's still produced by Breaking Good but it's distributed through The FoggyCoil. Hopefully I got all of that right and if not /u/TheFoggyCoil please correct me if I got any of it wrong. Here are my honest thoughts on [The Comfort Zone](URL and [Sub-Section](URL lines from The FoggyCoil. All of the bottles I received were 30ml in those soft plastic bottles that are easy to squeeze. The labels were nice and simple with The Comfort Zone ones sporting a little blue cloud motif and The Sub-Section ones sporting an Ohm symbol. Nothing too fancy but they look nice and clean. All of the information we like to see on them in fine print. The Comfort Zone are all 70vg I believe while the Sub-Section stuff only lists them as Max VG. All the samples I received were 3mg. Here's a look at [the nice little bottles](URL I received. Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **The Comfort line** **[Apple Amore](URL (Delightful caramel apple pie  warm and surprisingly refreshing.) This one is new to the line, at least for me anyway. It's a lovely mix of apple, cinnamon and caramel/brown sugar that's a bit on the light side for such a rich flavour but very well mixed. Unlike a lot of apple cinnamon flavours this one adds a nice dash of caramel which can often have a boozy note associated with it, not the case in this one. The apple leans more on the red side which I prefer over green and the cinnamon isn't biting or overpowering. It's just a nice balance of the three main flavours. Like I said it's a bit on the light side but not in a bad way, it actually makes it a bit easier to vape it for long periods. It's not super sweet like some of the popular premium brands but it's still nice and tasty. **(7/10)** **[Blueberry Bliss](URL (A smooth, balanced mixture of blueberry flavourings infused with sweet accents.) This one I believe used to be called Blueberry Dream and it tastes exactly as I remember it. Realistic blueberries without any strong perfumey taste, a nice touch of cream and just a little bit of spice like a graham crust. Just as pleasant as I remember from the last time. For people who like nice fruits but also enjoy a nice dessert flavour this one is fantastic. It reminds me of a creamy blueberry pie with a graham crust. Just delicious!! **(9/10)** **[Smoothie Swirl](URL (Refreshing strawberry banana mango smoothie.) Another new one to me. I tried this one blind and didn't realize there was mango in it until I read the description but then it kind of made sense as I had written 'peach?' in my notes. It's a really interesting mix of strawberry and banana and I guess mango. It's got a tiny bit of throat hit compared to the others but it still manages to come off smooth and creamy. It's a bit light and the flavours are almost fleeting but when you taste that blend it's almost like a candy flavoured fruit smoothie. I found it really hard to describe this one but I thought it was pretty tasty anyway. The fruity flavours almost lean towards artificial but not in a nasty chemical kind of way. Almost like a McDs strawberry milkshake sort of thing but with some banana and a dash of mango. **(8/10)** **[Hazelnut Harmony](URL (The perfect blend of hazelnut and vanilla infused with hints of caramel and earthy undertones.) This one is also from the original lineup and I fell in love with it then and I just fell in love with it again. If you like nutty, rich creamy vapes you'll probably love this like I do. It particularly shines in a mtl tank like a kayfun v4. I mostly get a rich hazelnut and smooth vanilla mix but there's some other notes lingering in there like a hint of coffee or something. The caramel blends in and doesn't really stick out as it's own element but probably adds to the overall richness of it. Super rich and decadent but somehow doesn't wear on me and I could easily vape it all day, but that might just be my tastes. Just an all around beautiful nutty flavour!! **(10/10)** ---- **Sub-Section** **[Dimension](URL (Dimension is the desired strawberry cupcake that sits behind the protected glass. The ideal candidate you spotted amongst all the competition. Its the ideal portrait of flavour fusion, now within your reach!) This one is quite light on flavour and just a tad dry but what I do get from it is strawberry and whipped cream with just a hint and I mean a hint of white cake or vanilla. My guess is the dryness comes from the whipped cream. The strawberry is too light to really get a good feel for it. While it could use a bit more punch with the flavour it was still pleasant enough if not a bit bland. Maybe I expected it to be sweeter being a cupcake but it doesn't feel like there's any sweetness in it. **(6/10)** **[Origin](URL (Origin begins with a burst of crisp apple and quickly evolves into a mosaic of berry flavour impressions. It's sure to tempt even the most discerning of palates.) From this one I'm mostly getting an apple candy flavour with berries of some sort. It's fruity, light and refreshing and to be honest really reminds me of a flavour made by one of our more popular vendors on reddit. The berries aren't distinct enough for me to say what they are but it's not off putting as mixed berry flavours often tend to be. This one has a bit more flavour then the last one and pretty nice for a fruit blend. **(7/10)** **[Quadrant](URL (Quadrant is a smooth peach combination resulting from a restless passion to create the ultimate peach blend. It's expressed best by its journey through poem: A time for fruit; A fruit pursuit; To each their own; To own their peach.) This is a really nice peach flavour. Not like the fuzzy peach candy kind but there might be some little hints of it. It's more like a fresh juicy peach with some hints of something else fruity I can't quite place. But really it's all about the peach in this and it's one of the nicer straight peach flavours that I've tried and it doesn't make me cough. Not sure if it's the case for everyone but I find a lot of peach flavours to be a bit hard on the lungs. This one is nice and smooth, not over bearing but delivers a nice good hit of delicious fresh peach. It's not very often I really dig straight fruit flavours but I'll probably be finishing this one off. **(9/10)** **[Vector](URL (Vector is the utopian blend of peanut butter and banana. Its unique design will simultaneously create and satisfy your flavour craving with every indulgence.) This one strongly reminds me of a peanut banana custard made by a company not too far from where I live. It's a mix of creamy peanut butter, real banana and a smooth vanilla custard base. It's a bit on the decadent side but there was a time when I was crazy for stuff like this. I still enjoy it from time to time and I thought this is a very nice rendition of a peanut butter banana custard or pudding. Should mention I did find I got a touch of dryness from it too but it wasn't too bad at all. **(8/10)** ---- While I have tried a couple of these before the majority of them were new to me and I have to say I quite enjoyed them. There were a couple in there that didn't quite work for me but you know the saying. None of them were harsh or had weird chemical notes in them. Just all around well made juice with a nice assortment of flavours that I'd have no trouble recommending!! So huge thanks to /u/TheFoggyCoil for sending these my way, hope to see more of you around here!! Edit: sorry forgot to link the bottle pic"
200,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Griffin 25 Plus rta,11,5fd6o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5fd6o3/honest_review_time_griffin_25_plus_rta/,2016-11-29 05:12:30,"Hey guys, At this point I'm sure pretty much everyone has heard of [Geekvape](URL They've been making some killer gear over the pas year or two. Among some of the more notables were the Griffin and Avocado series of tanks. Both have been quite popular. Recently I received a [Griffin 25 plus](URL from [Gearbest](URL and I have at least one major complaint about it. Here are my honest thoughts on the Griffin 25 Plus by Geekvape. **The contents of the package:** 1x Griffin 25 Plus rta 1x Spare glass 1x Multi tool 1x Single coil adapter 1x Non-top air flow cap 3x Set replacement coloured orings 1x 510 drip tip adapter **The listed features:** * GeekVape Griffin 25 Plus RTA atomizer * Kennedy style bottom airflow * 18.9mm Velocity style build deck * Top filling * 5ml capacity * Stainless steel and glass construction * Ceramic block for single coil option * 510 thread connection * 25mm diameter base Here's a link to a [full album of pics](URL ---- **The Packaging:** If you've ever purchased a Geekvape product you'll be familiar with their [jewel case packaging](URL Everything comes well packed in the clear plastic container with everything held in place with [sponge and cardboard](URL You get [plenty of extras](URL like a spare tank glass, three sets of extra coloured orings, a non-top air flow cap, a 510 drip tip adapter, single coil adapter plug, spare grub screws and a handy dandy little multi-tool. [Great presentation](URL and everything arrived safe and sound! **The tank:** [The tank which can be almost completely broken down](URL for easy cleaning is incredibly well built, feels solid and looks really well designed. It's 49.5mm tall and 25mm in diameter with a whopping 18.9mm wide build deck so it can accommodate some pretty impressive builds. At the top of the tank it comes [pre-equipped with a top air flow cap](URL that can be switched out for a [delrin non top air flow cap](URL Hidden under that is the [two large kidney shaped fill ports](URL so filling it is a breeze. The tank itself holds 5ml of juice which is a decent amount but depending on your build it might not last that long. Everything about it is smooth, the threads the juice control and the air flow all turn with ease, no crunchy threads or overly tight orings. All around it's a pretty nice looking tank, with plenty of big chunky knurling all around to help remove the cap or the build deck as well as adjust the afc. There's a bit of styling on the tank too with the [Griffin logo](URL and name printed on the chimney. They don't go overboard with it either, just keep it nice and classy looking. Really it would be hard to say anything bad about the build quality of this tank, it's just very well designed, made with quality materials and seems extremely well built. **The Deck:** The Giffin 25 plus sports a fairly traditional albeit huge(18.9mm wide)velocity style deck but where it really separates itself from the pack is the way it's wicked. It's somewhat like an rdta where the wicks tuck in to a large gap below the posts and are fed by the juice holes coming from the bottom of the deck, somewhat similar to the Aromamizer. The posts are nice and wide and the post holes are huge so they should help you mount some pretty beefy coils if you wanted. I'm pretty sure the base is still press fit like the original Griffin was since I was able to remove the [510 center pin/s](URL and it didn't come apart. I didn't try too hard as I didn't want to break it but from what I could tell the deck was solidly pressed in to the base. The [510 pin is actually two pieces](URL which means it's fully adjustable. I think we all know to use caution when using a hybrid connection but this should be reasonably safe to use on almost anything. The velocity style posts sits above the deck coming from the center of the base on a single insulated dual contact pole. On the bottom of the deck you have [4 Kennedy style air flow holes](URL that come up right under your coils. The [juice flow holes in the bottom of the deck](URL are reasonably big and need to be completely covered when you wick it. This was the first rebuildable tank that I've owned for some time that really had a learning curve when it came to wicking. It took three tries with varying amounts of cotton before I was able to get it to mostly stop leaking. In the end I was basically plugging those holes with the tips of my cotton and just stuffing the area around them with the rest. Borderline dry hit territory. I read numerous reports of leaking but in any of the reviews I found none of them mentioned any issues with leaking. Mine would often leak overnight even after figuring it out I still tend to lose a little bit of juice in to the air flow base after it's been sitting for a while making it a somewhat unreliable tank. Sure you could blame me for poorly wicking it but no tank should take that much effort to learn how to [wick it properly](URL I should mention the kit also includes a silicone and ceramic [single coil adapter](URL if you like to build single coils, but for me if it's made to run dual, I'm going to build it with dual coils. **Flow control:** In regards to air flow control you have the ability to adjust two large slots at the bottom of the tank from full open to completely closed although this definitely isn't meant to be used as a mtl tank. You also have the ability to use top air flow with the top air flow cap. Likewise you can adjust it from wide open to completely closed. I prefer not to use it as I find it tends to mute the flavour a little bit but it's also quite handy for cooling off the vape if you find it too hot. I still use the top air flow cap cause I like the wide bore drip tip I just keep it closed off. I actually picked up [a really nice drip tip](URL from our very own /u/vapestashtips while at CVE and have been using that. One thing I want to call out that happens with a lot of top air flow tanks is when you remove the deck to rebuild or rewick and you place the tank upside down, any juice remaining in the chamber will leak down in to [the top air flow channel around the chimney](URL and try to work it's way out the top air flow. A bit of a pain especially if you like to use the top air flow, just make sure you close it before accessing the deck, if you use the non-top air flow cap it's not an issue. Towards the base of the deck [two large slots control the flow of juice](URL to the wicks. You can adjust the juice flow control by simply turning the tank in a clock wise fashion. I tended to leave it wide open but those using a thinner liquid may want to close it off a bit to help prevent any flooding. Once I got the wicking right I didn't really need to adjust it other than full open but your use of it may vary. **Performance:** As with most rtas or rebuildables performance will greatly depend on your ability to build and wick. I have to say with [the fused clapton build](URL ni80 6 wraps on a 3mm 0.17ohms) I tossed in to it it was working like a champ. Great big thick clouds and the flavour was actually quite decent for such a large chambered tank. I believe the chimney is 10mm wide so it can pipe a lot of vapour straight to your lungs. Having the ability to adjust nearly every aspect of the vape is pretty handy too so if it's not wicking fast enough you could open the juice flow or vice versa. If it's too hot, try opening the top air flow a bit. Too airy or too tight, adjust the bottom air flow to your liking. My preference was top air flow closed, juice control wide open and bottom air flow control wide open as well. With my build and at 80w it gave a nice full direct to lung hit that for me was just right. **Overall:** I have to say I'm very impressed by the build quality, the features, the vape it gives but because of the issues I've had with leaking I can't say it's a very reliable tank. Sure a big part of that has to do with my ability to build it and wick it but it's not like I'm new to vaping or rebuildables. If I was struggling I'm sure others will as well. I need to be able to rely on my tanks if I want to keep them in my pocket and with this I'm afraid it never left the house as I never felt confident enough in it's ability to not leak. So the big questions **will I keep using this thing?** Yes I will. I actually really enjoy using it I just don't currently feel confident in it as a traveler. Maybe that will change as I get to know the tank better but ease of use is an important factor as well, I do like a challenge though. **Will I recommend this thing?** I suppose I would but with a huge caveat that wicking it properly takes a bit of practice. If done right it should remain reasonably leak free but it not you'll be losing a lot of juice learning how."
201,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Culture eliquid,11,5fjn8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5fjn8y/honest_review_time_culture_eliquid/,2016-11-30 03:41:43,"Hey guys, Here's something I picked up a while back at the last CVE I believe. It's a line called [Culture](URL and I believe it's from a US based company but it's being distributed up here by [VBI](URL Brands International) so I don't have any issues reviewing it. It comes in some of the fanciest packaging I've seen but I don't think it does anything for the juice. Here are my honest thoughts on Culture. The set of three juices come in 30ml unicorn bottles which are safety sealed, packed in metal tubes, protected by sponge and enclosed in a box. Pretty safe to say they'll arrive safely. They also sport a graffiti theme on them, maybe it's an attempt to appeal to modern youth culture, I don't know. There's an industry saying that says the more spent on packaging the less spent on the juice and I might have to agree after going through this set. The line is all 75vg and the ones I picked up were all 3mg. Since there was so much fancy pants packaging here is a link to an [album of pics](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Heaven](URL (Soft sweet shortbread cookies packed with fresh blueberries, drizzled with a hint of caramel and a splash of milk.) Blueberry flavours for me can often have a perfumey taste and this one is a perfect example of what I mean. It's mostly a blueberry flavour with a pretty strong perfume that's just a tad creamy. I do get hints of a bakery type of flavour but it's essentially buried in all of that perfume. It's strong enough that it basically ruins the whole thing for me. Definitely not something I'd be able to finish. **(3/10)** **[Tag'd](URL (Baked apple cider donut filled with warm crisp spiced apples dusted with cinnamon sugar and topped with whipped cream.) This for me was the best of the bunch. It's a somewhat light green apple and cinnamon flavour with a hint of donut. While I don't tend to like green apple flavours this one isn't super punchy so I was able to enjoy it without being overwhelmed by green apple. While the donut flavour is light you still get a decent sense of it otherwise it'd just be another green apple and cinnamon. Really the best thing about this one is the mix of cinnamon and sugar which isn't too sweet or biting. I still wouldn't say it's an amazing apple cinnamon flavour but it definitely stands out in this line. **(7/10)** **[Wyld](URL (Sweet juicy Georgia peaches and perfectly ripe apricots balanced with a ribbon of sweet cream and finished with a layer of Velvety smooth Greek yogurt.) Ok so maybe I'm a bit biased now as to what a good peach yogurt flavour should taste like, I'm looking at you /u/aepko. But this one isn't half bad. It's a fairly strong greek yogurt flavour with a rather gentle peach. For me the yogurt is fairly strong and pretty much takes over the flavour. Greek yogurt works better for me than the more common yogurt flavour which to me tastes like spoiled milk or bile whereas greek yogurt has a dryer flavour to it but can be almost chalky if there's too much of it. This one is just on the line of being too much. I would of actually liked it to be dialed back just a bit so I can get a bit more of that peach but as it stands it's not too bad. **(6/10)** ---- Overall I have to say I was pretty let down by these. Sure they come in some really nice packaging but that's about it. The flavours were pretty average if not outright bad and to me didn't merit the over the top packaging they came in. Maybe if they spent more time developing the flavours and less time on the packaging I'd have a higher opinion of them. But hey if you want some cool metal tubes maybe check them out!?"

206,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Swerve by Vaporus,12,5gtih4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5gtih4/honest_review_time_swerve_by_vaporus/,2016-12-07 02:43:15,"Hey guys, While I was at CVE I had the chance to try a new line created by one of the incredible mixologists from Vaporus. His name is Mathieu Dub and he's been working on his own line for quite some time. I was fortunate enough to be given a set for review so here are my honest thoughts on Swerve by Mathieu Dube and Vaporus. The three bottle set came in nice cardboard boxes with a rather cool design to them. I spent way too much time trying to [line up the boxes](URL The bottles themselves are black with really nice clean looking labels. All the usual good stuff in fine print. Personally I really dig the black on black and colourful print on them. While I'm not a big fan of opaque bottles they do look really nice. The line is 75vg and the ones I received were in 3mg. Here's a look at [the nice bottles I received](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Descriptions in brackets, no links because of law 44. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Waves** (Kiwi, Apple, Iced Tea, Lemonade) This was probably my least favorite of the bunch and it was still really damn good. It's such an interesting blend of sweet apple and iced tea with a tangy back drop of lemonade. I don't get a good sense of the kiwi from it as it's sort of blended with the apple flavour. The Iced tea aspect though is pretty awesome and the whole thing sort of reminds me of that taste/smell you get when you take the lid off a can of powdered Nestea mix. You know the way you smell it but also kind of taste it and it sort of hits you in the back of the cheeks and gets your mouth watering, yeah like that! The lemonade and the iced tea work really well together but are still pretty distinct in the mix. Maybe it's because iced tea is often accompanied with a slice of lemon but in this it definitely works. All around a very refreshing and somewhat light flavour that would be perfect in the summer. **(8.5/10)** **Sheer** (Apricot, Vanilla, Cupcake, Buttermilk) Ok so I'm going to say it, there's a new apricot flavour in town and I have to say it's really freakin good. This one though isn't just a straight up apricot flavour. Instead it's a well layered and well conceived mix of apricot and a light bakery flavour. But it's not that simple, while the vanilla, cupcake and buttermilk give it that beautiful bakery finish I almost get a hint of spice from it too. I've tasted something like that before in an old fashioned vanilla cake and this has that same sort of thing going on. Upfront is a really nice bright and tasty apricot flavour but underneath that is that lovely cake that has a lot more depth than just a straight up vanilla cupcake. I'm pretty sure it's the buttermilk aspect that really gives it a more mature flavour and boy is it good. **(9/10)** **Drift** (Salted caramel, Cashew, Gelato) This one was my absolute favorite of the bunch! Often with flavours like this I struggle to find the right words to describe it, it's such a lovely blend that's complex yet oh so simple. It's an incredible mix of a nutty creamy gelato blended with salted caramel and I swear I'm getting just a hint, like a teeny tiny drop of a tobacco. I can't say I really taste the cashew per say but I do taste the nuttiness it imparts. The salted caramel is fleeting, I mean I do get a decent sense of the caramel itself but the salted aspect is almost a feeling as opposed to a strong taste. But it is there and you do get hints of it from time to time. Like a buttery salty caramel that just occasionally teases and threatens to make your mouth water. One great thing about this one is it manages to stay light despite being a rather rich flavour. It has a soft characteristic to it that makes it really pleasing to vape. For me it's adv material and a welcome addition to the list of personal favorites!! **(10/10)** ---- Overall I have to say this is an incredible line of really well crafted flavours made by an extremely talented young man. I've actually had the pleasure of meeting him and most of the Vaporus team and they are genuinely one of the best bunches of people I've ever had the chance to meet. I know because of law 44 in Quebec it might not be so easy to get a hold of these but if you have the chance I highly recommend you check them out!! So huge thanks to Mathieu and the gang, you guys make some seriously good things!! "

After speaking with the gentleman there for a bit I was offered a discount on the [Mage GTA](URL specifically for review. So I grabbed one!

In the box you get [the tank, a spare glass, two sets of coloured orings, some spare grub screws, a screwdriver, a little instruction card and a vape band](URL **The tank:** [The Mage GTA](URL is a single coil, 47mm tall and 24mm diameter genesis tank atomizer. It's got top fill, holds 3.5ml of liquid and has adjustable airflow. At the top of the tank you have a combination [chuff and top fill cap](URL While I love the comfort of the chuff cap I'm really not a fan of threaded plastic top caps, it's just too easy to cross thread and ruin them. This one as I just mentioned is comfortable, has a nice wide bore and does a great job of dissipating the heat. Another unfortunate issue with the top cap is the top fill is messy, sure it has big kidney shaped fill holes but the cap when screwed in all the way is recessed. The problem is liquid tends to gather around the top and when you close it, that little bit of liquid gets squeezed out around the entire top edge of the tank. You'll definitely need a tissue when filling it as I've yet to be able to fill it without wiping it down either before or after. There's no standard drip tip adapter included and unlike some chuff caps this one does not fit a 510 drip tip in it. At the base of the tank is the dual slot adjustable airflow, it doesn't click but is reasonably firm and stops at both ends when turning it. Plenty of airflow for my tastes but it can be a tiny bit swishy sounding especially if you close it a bit. The biggest issue I have with this tank however is the size of the chamber and how close it is to the glass. Even using 70vg liquids it struggles to let the juice down to the bottom where the wicks protrude from the base of the deck. It's bad enough that if you aren't paying attention you can easily get a dry hit. Several times while using it I've looked down only to see that the gap under the chamber is [completely void of any liquid](URL and I would have to stop and hold the tank on it's side to slowly and I mean slowly let the liquid work it's way down in to the void. I honestly couldn't imagine using this thing with anything over 70vg unless you have a lot of time on your hands. Another thing to mention is the glass won't stay fixed to the top piece so rebuliding and rewicking will require you to drain the tank. **The deck:** [The deck](URL is probably my favorite aspect of this tank, it's essentially the same deck as the Serpent mini and very close to that of the Mage GTA. It's single coil over a big airflow hole with offset clamps. I should also mention that the entire deck is gold plated which makes it super sexy. One thing I didn't like was the posts use philips head screws but they're a bit weird, sort of shallow so you'll need to find a screwdriver that fits. With the included one I had a bit of trouble getting enough pressure on it to really tighten it down so I ended up using one of my own. No handy little right angled cuts in the posts to make it easier to grip the wire like the Fuji GTA has either. [Wicking it](URL though is easy, just fill up those two grooves in the side of the deck and cut the cotton, just underneath it. It does take quite a bit to fill it but using a 3mm diameter coil provided plenty to work with. I haven't had any leaking or dry hits at least when the liquid is flowing under the deck. I popped in a [single fused clapton](URL 5 wraps on a 3mm bit and it came out to 0.3ohms, running it around 75-80w I was getting fantastic flavour and vapour, possibly even better than the Fuji GTA since the chimney in the Mage is about half the size and length of the Fujis. With my build in it, it ripped through the juice but only when it was flowing freely under that chamber. I found I could usually take a few good hits and then I'd have to tip the tank and wait for the air bubble to work it's way up and for the juice to work it's way down. Not convenient at all and if you're not paying attention you can definitely end up with a dry hit. **Likes:** * Nice looking tank * Gorgeous deck * Easy to build * Easy to fill * Easy to wick * No leaks **Dislikes:** * Messy top fill * Threaded plastic chuff cap * Poor liquid flow around chamber can lead to dry hits * Need to empty tank to rebuild or rewick **Overall:** As much as I did enjoy the flavour and vapour I was getting from this tank I found it just too much of a pain to want to keep it in the rotation. Constantly having to monitor the tank for an air bubble under the deck and then waiting patiently for the liquid to move around inside was just too much for me to really enjoy it. I know almost every atomizer I've ever used has one issue or another but it's about weighing out the pros and cons and this unfortunately fell a bit short by my needs. It's really a shame cause I really like a lot of the things Coilart has been doing. Hopefully they learn from this one and improve the next. So the big questions as always **Will I keep using this thing?** I think I already answered that, I've already parked it, I just don't have the patience to work with it. **Would I recommend this thing?** No, I don't think I would. I mean maybe if someone really had their hearts set on it and were aware of the issues with it but it wouldn't likely come up as a recommendation from me. "

210,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Snoogy's Pastry Line,10,5ij818,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5ij818/honest_review_time_snoogys_pastry_line/,2016-12-16 05:39:43,"Hey guys, Here's a couple of juices I picked up at CVE Ottawa from the good folks at [Snoogy](URL I had the chance to chat with the owner who's a really nice guy and he set me up with samples of their newer pastry flavours. I've tried some Snoogy juice before in the past but I've never gotten any for review. Well I'm happy to say they set me up with their new pastry flavours and I'm pretty much in love. Both flavours came in rather interesting twist to open/close [cardboard boxes](URL which I thought were really cool. Probably not the most practical for stacking and such but very cool and unique. The bottles were clear glass with dropper tops with some really neat labels that showed the basic flavour in several languages, either cake or cookie. The packaging and labels are somewhat modest compared to some of their past offerings and I for one really dug their minimalist style. Both flavours are 70vg and the ones I grabbed were 3mg. Here's a look at the [nice looking bottles I got](URL Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Descriptions in brackets but no links because of Law 44 and the sites carrying Snoogy outside of QC don't seem to have them listed. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! I also want to mention that the flavours and descriptions almost seem reversed to me but either way, I enjoyed both of them. ---- **Snookies** (For the fans of Snoogy cookies) From this I get a very rich rum cake kind of thing. It's got a really nice deep nut bread flavour that I've tasted before in other things but this seems to nail it down pretty much perfectly. It's a bit sweet, a little creamy and there's that nice bakery flavour to pull it all together. I also get a light taste of rum, not like it's boozy but sort of the flavour of rum. If you've ever had rum cake it's a lot like that. I really don't get a sense of a Snoogy sugar cookie on this one but like I said I think the labels were some how mixed up, either that or my taste buds are. It's one of those flavours that's just really hard to explain and you really need to try for yourself. Very rich, complex, decadent even but still light enough I could vape it all day long. Really enjoyed this one!! **(10/10)** **baba o rhum** (sweet bread that is soaked in rum syrup topped with a wonderful Chantilly cream and Brush heavily with the glaze) This one to me tastes like fresh baked sugar cookies, not the cinnamon laden ones that seem to dominate the market but an actual buttery sweet sugar cookie like you'd bake for Christmas and smother in icing. It's pretty much just that to me, a nice rich vanilla cookie flavour with a sweet icing over top. It's got a really nice buttery aspect to it and there's also just a hint of some sort of spice. It's not like cinnamon or anything like that, just a nice little kick of something which just adds to that bakery aspect of it. I have to say it's one of the best true sugar cookie flavours that I've tried maybe even the first and I really dig the fact that it's not a cinnamon cookie like so many others. If I'm correct and the labels are reversed on these then this is about as close as you can get to one of those delicious Snoogy cookies. Another one that I would gladly vape all day!! **(10/10)** ---- I'm pretty much positive at this point that the labels/descriptions were reversed. I had several friends try them out and they all concur that the descriptions seem to be swapped but either way they're both fantastic! I even went as far as contacting Snoogy to see if they had any input on the issue but they were at a bit of a loss about what to say. Either way, it'd be hard to go wrong with these as they are both incredibly well done. If you're like me and you dig the rich bakery flavours, do yourself a favour and check these out!! So big thanks Fady and crew for setting me up with these, I really really enjoyed them!! edit: [link to their fb page](URL"
211,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: The Winter Collection from Theravape,8,5iop11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5iop11/honest_review_time_the_winter_collection_from/,2016-12-17 02:04:49,"Hey guys, Here's something just in time for the holidays. While I was at CVE I picked up a set from [Theravape](URL I've yet to do a review for them but when I was at the expo they had a decent deal on a set of holiday themed juices. I've been a fan of their stuff for a while so I thought it'd be the perfect opportunity to grab some for a review. So here are my honest thoughts on [Theravape's Winter Collection](URL The set comes in 30ml white opaque bottles, you know my opinion on those, they look nice but aren't very practical. The labels are shiny metallic and have a nice festive design to them. They're all 70vg and the ones I picked up were in 3mg. Here's [a look at the set](URL of holiday themed bottles I got. Testing was done mostly in a narda with a fused clapton(2x28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Classified](URL (Chai Tea Latte) I enjoy a good Chai tea latte on occasion and this manages to nail it down pretty darn good. It's got a nice Chai flavour that's sweetened up a bit and the sharp edges of the Chai are smoothed over with a nice creaminess. For a Chai flavour it's almost light and doesn't have any biting elements from the cinnamon, cardamom or cloves that are typical of Chai. It also doesn't have any of that dry potpourri kind of thing that also tends to affect flavours with a strong cinnamon in them. Not to say the cinnamon in this is strong, it's quite nicely balanced with the cream and sweetness. I found this to be rather addictive and managed to burn through half a bottle the first time I sat down with it. I've tried quite a few Chai flavours and this one so far has had the most staying power with me. **(9/10)** **[Snowed In](URL (green tea ice cream) Ok, so maybe I'm a bit biased cause of the whole Asian thing but oh man is this lovely!! Green tea ice cream is sort of a staple in North America after a nice sushi meal. It's always been a favorite of mine since I was a little kid so I was really looking forward to this one. I've tried a few green tea flavours and a couple of green tea ice cream flavours and this is the closest to what I've been looking for. The green tea flavour comes off very authentic if not a touch light which in something like this is a good thing. It's more like a real steeped green tea as opposed to a stronger punchier matcha made tea. It's also got a touch of sweetness to it which is really nice. My only criticism, I wish that the creamy aspect of it was punched up just the tiniest bit, everything else about it is pretty much perfect for me. Just a really nice delicate flavour that green tea lovers should really enjoy. I'm sure this one won't be lasting long with me either. **(9.5/10)** **[The Wall](URL (candy cane and cream) This one will be for the mint lovers. It's basically a sweet and creamy candy cane flavour. It's minty but I also think there's some menthol/koolada in it as it has that refreshing cooling sensation along with it. The mint is pretty strong but it's not like a spearmint mint, more like a candy mint. Like one of those red and white after dinner mints or like a traditional candy cane. Again I kind of wish the creaminess of this one was punched up a bit too as it feels just a little bit thin. Recently I fell in love with a creamy mint flavour, this while close doesn't quite match it and compared to the other two in the set it feels just a bit basic. **(7/10)** ---- As I've mentioned, I'm a fan of Theravapes. They make some really great stuff and this Winter Collection is no exception. Looks like they are only available for a limited time but the site says they'll be around until March of next year so if you're interested you'll have plenty of time to pick them up. If you haven't tried Theravape yet I'd happily recommend you check them out!!"

215,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: L'Or by Vaporus,9,5ajw7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5ajw7g/honest_review_time_lor_by_vaporus/,2016-11-02 03:02:50,"Hey guys, Recently the folks over at [Vaporus](URL released a new tobacco line called L'Or which if you're not familiar with French means gold or rather The Gold. I actually had a chance to preview one of them some time ago so I've been eagerly awaiting their official release. Well it's official now and the gents over at Vaporus sent some over for review and I couldn't be happier. Here's my honest thoughts on L'Or by Vaporus. The clear glass bottles have a new look with white and gold labels that look rather nice. They've got all the usual info on there we like to see. They also have the Magnum Opus logo on them so I believe they're a new sub line of that. The L'Or line is all 70vg and I received them with 3mg. Here's a [look at the bottles](URL Testing was done in a narda with a fused clapton(28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Official descriptions in brackets but sorry no links as their site is currently down again due to Bill 44. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **&amp; Coffee** All of the flavours in the line are tobacco based so the names are all similar wherein they basically identify the additional flavour, in this case coffee. And what a coffee it is! It's like they took my favorite coffee flavour and combined it with my favorite tobacco flavour and made the perfect marriage of the two. Right off the bat you get a nice rich coffee, that's just packed with deep delicious and somewhat complex notes. On the back end you get a nice smooth tobacco that's equally rich and complex. The coffee takes the lead slightly but that tobacco just backs it up like they're meant to be. As I mentioned it's a smooth tobacco, reminds me a bit of a loose leaf tobacco, not too strong but adds a really nice complexity to the flavour. From the minute I opened this one I had a really hard time putting it down. Hits all the notes for me being both a coffee and tobacco lover. **(10/10)** **&amp; Caramel** This is the one I had a chance to preview and until I tried '&amp; Coffee' it had essentially become my favorite tobacco flavour out there. Now it's a very very close second. In essence it's sort of like a classic tobacco flavour, pairing a rich tobacco with caramel. To me it's like the way an RY4 should be, a nice blend of tobacco, caramel and maybe some vanilla? The tobacco doesn't take a back seat either like many RY4s, it's fairly bold and matched perfectly to the caramel flavour. The whole thing is just perfectly balanced and oh so smooth. There's a touch of sweetness from the caramel I imagine, maybe a bit more than a typical ry4 but like I said it's perfect. I don't get any of those odd sometimes boozy note I get from a lot of RY4s. I honestly can't find any faults with it and I'd have no trouble vaping it all day long!! **(10/10)** **&amp; Mint** Ok so this one is my least favorite from the line but it's still really good. Gone are the richer deeper notes of the other two and in their stead is a lighter, brighter and somewhat strong mint flavour. I get a bit of that cooling sensation too so I imagine there's some menthol/koolada in it. The tobacco also feels lighter in this one. If you've ever tried Wrath from their 7 Deadly Sins line it reminds me a lot of the tobacco in that, maybe even a hint of the green tea from it too, or that could just be my brain playing tricks on me. My only wish for this one was for the mint to be toned down just a bit. I find it just a tad strong for my liking but I'm sure mint lovers out there will quite enjoy it. Still even with the mint I get a wonderful sense of the tobacco but similar to another flavour I tried recently the mint and the tobacco almost seem a bit like separate elements. Maybe it's not easy to combine those two flavours but as far as I'm concerned this is a darn fine attempt. **(8/10)** ---- If you like rich tobacco flavours I honestly can't recommend these enough. You can really tell a lot of effort went in to perfecting these and at least for me it's very much appreciated. While you can't pick these up online just yet I know Vaporus will be doing some really great deals at CVE Ottawa which is coming up fast. If you're able to make it I'd definitely suggest you pay them a visit and try these out!! So huge thanks Vaporus for sending these my way,,,, I'm in love!!"

223,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Canada eClouds,18,5dgg6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5dgg6z/honest_review_time_canada_eclouds/,2016-11-18 02:42:28,"Hey guys, So I'm still getting through some of the stuff I picked up from CVE Toronto and thought I'd try and get a couple more out before leaving for Ottawa. Here's a set I picked up from [Canada eClouds](URL a company out of Georgetown I believe. I had the chance to try some of them at the show and they were kind enough to set me up with some samples. Here are my honest thoughts on Canada eClouds. The samples I got came in 15ml(or 10ml??) bottles and I believe they were all 3mg. The juices themselves are all formulated as 30/70vg. The labels are mostly black with a vaping beaver character on the front and all the usual stuff we like to see in fine print. Very Canadian feel to them!! Here's a look at [the bottles](URL I got. Testing was done in a narda with a fused clapton(28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Fruit Clouds](URL **[Artisan Clouds](URL (Citrus, berry lemonade) Right off the bat I have to say these are all quite unique, very well crafted flavours that remind me a bit of the stuff from SZ but still quite different. With this one I get a very soft and light blend of citrus and berries. Sort of that generic mixed berry but it's actually quite nice, probably because it's so light. I also get an almost candy flavour from it but again it's quite light, almost fluffy. It's almost hard to get a grasp on this one because it's so fleeting but what I do get is quite pleasant. I just wish it was punched up the littlest bit. **(8/10)** **[Dragon Slayer Clouds](URL (blueberry, raspberry, dragon fruit, with hints of other summer fruits) This one is a sort of an odd mix of berries with a bit more punch than some of the others. I can really taste the blueberry and the tang of the raspberry but the dragon fruit is sort of hard to pick out. There's definitely something there that adds to the berries but it's not a typical dragon fruit, at least in my experience. I do get a slight tickle in my throat from this one as it has a very slight edge to it. At first I thought it was quite odd but the more I vaped it sort of grew on me and the more I could pick out those berries. **(7.5/10)** **[Melon Glory Clouds](URL (Melon, citrus and watermelon) I usually enjoy a good melon flavour but this one is a bit different from the norm. I get a pretty strong citrus flavour like grapefruit that's a touch bitter, mixed with some honey dew and maybe some watermelon. Maybe I'm just not used to such a mix but it wasn't quite working for me and that bitterness eventually wore on me. Not bad just not really for me. **(6/10)** **[Fusion Clouds](URL (Melon Glory and Artisan Clouds, melons, berries, and citruses) Ok so this one is literally Melon Glory and Artisan smashed together. I'm personally not a fan of this one and to me it's just too similar to Melon Glory for me to really appreciate it. It's actually quite refreshing and bright. Very summery but the bitterness from the Melon Glory side of it gets to me after a short while. I know some people out there crave that bitterness but in this one it's just a bit too much for me. **(5/10)** **[Road Apple Clouds](URL (apple, fruit, and candy) This is not your typical green apple candy. In fact I don't really get green apple from it at all. I do get apple but it's more like a red apple flavour. It's quite different and I'm sort of at a loss as to how I could describe it. It's like candy made from real apples or something? I also get just a hint of citrus from it, something in there which sharpens it up just a touch. It's not super sweet even though it's a candy and as much as I had trouble figuring this one out I actually quite enjoyed it. **(7.5/10)** **[Sauble Clouds](URL (Peach and candy) From this one I get some peach flavour that's a bit dry and some sort of candy. In my notes I said it was like a breath mint without the mint. Sort of that chalky creamy essence you get from a breath mint. It's a bit fleeting, it's not very sweet for a candy and I felt like this one too could use a bit of a punch up. **(6/10)** **[Summer dream Cloud](URL (Orange creamsicle) I think many of you know how picky I am with the orange creamsicle flavours. Most of them just taste like burnt plastic to me. Well this one is no exception. The orange feels a bit stronger in this but after that it's pretty much burnt plastic for me. I also don't get much of a creaminess from this one. Could be just my taste buds but this one just isn't working for me. **(4/10)** **[Yogurt Clouds](URL **[Kawartha Lakes Clouds](URL (Yogurt, pina colada, pineapple, and other summer fruits) At first this tasted weird, an odd mix of yogurt and pina colada, but as I kept vaping it, it started to grow on me. I still think it's kind of weird but in a good way. It's such an odd combination of flavours but it somehow works pretty good. I do get a slight pasty taste from it so I'm not sure I could vape this all day but definitely an interesting treat and a unique twist on a yogurt flavour. **(7.5/10)** **[Muskoka Clouds](URL (creamy yogurt layered with fresh peaches, pears, and summer berries) This is one my two favorites from the line. It's a really nice peach yogurt with a little extra. I can't really pick out the other fruits but it just adds to the depth of the peachiness of it. Maybe I get a hint of pear from time to time but it's mainly a peach yogurt. I don't think it will replace my favorite Peach Yogurt but as far as I'm concerned, it's a very solid flavour!! **(9/10)** **[Beverage Clouds](URL **[Rye &amp; Cola](URL (rye and cola) This one is probably my unexpected favorite from the line. It's essentially a rye and coke with a dash of coolada to give it that on the rocks kind of feel. The cola is borderline cola bottles but it somehow works in this. The rye is probably the lightest component in this but it's definitely there adding a nice complexity to it. It's not boozy in anyway but it does have a nice mature flavour to it. I personally dig a lot of the ""grown up"" drink based flavours and this one is a fun addition. I don't know that I could vape this all day but it's definitely a nice little after dinner treat or something. **(9/10)** ---- All around I have to say these are some rather unique flavours. Sure a few of them didn't exactly work for me but we all know taste is subjective... I personally thought the line was quite well done and appreciate the effort that was put in to crafting them. If you like fruits and some truly unique flavours I wouldn't have any trouble recommending you check them out!! So thanks Canada eClouds, if you happen to be reading this, you make some fantastic stuff!!"
224,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Gangster Clouds,20,5dh0e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5dh0e3/honest_review_time_gangster_clouds/,2016-11-18 04:21:02,"Hey guys, Here's another one I picked up at CVE Toronto. I actually have a few more but they'll have to wait until after the expo. This set comes from the [Gangster Clouds](URL crew. Because this comes from Quebec links and info were a bit harder to find because of Loi 44 but I managed to find them on another vendors site so I'll include those as well. Here are my honest thoughts on the set from Gangster Clouds. One of the coolest presentation that I've seen comes from the Gangster clouds crew. Their sample pack comes in a neat little plastic container with a sticker on top that simulates the bullets in an old six shooter and when you open the container there are six little sample bottles inside, how cool it that? Here's a look at [the container](URL they came in. Here's a look at [the actual bottles](URL I couldn't find the ratio for these but I believe they are max vg and I also believe the samples were in 3mg. Testing was done in a narda with a fused clapton(28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Gambler](URL (Mango citrus and peach blend macerated with almond liquor) This one is a bit odd, it actually reminds me of the same sort of citrus you get from those creamsicle flavours I'm not really a fan of. It also has a sort of nutty essence which I'm guessing is the almond liquor but it's quit faint and overall the flavour is a bit on the weak side. Personally I don't really care for this one. **(5/10)** **[Alcatraz](URL (Mouth watering apple pie with a hint of spices) From this one I get a really nice warm baked apple pie kind of flavour with a hit of cinnamon. It has a slight dryness which might be from that cinnamon but it's not too bad. It has a really soft and light feeling to it for such a rich flavour, almost too light really but it's nice. **(7.5/10)** **[Scarface](URL (Delicious vanilla lime cake) Ok so you all know I pretty much despise lime flavours with a few exceptions, well this one just made the list and I have to say it might even be near the top of that list. I get this really wonderful mix of white cake or vanilla birthday cake with lime. I wish I could say it's more complex than that but it's just so simple and yet so good. Not many lime flavours have gotten a wow out of me but this one sure did. It's quite refreshing and unique but familiar and comforting all at the same time. It is a bit soft and light like some of the others but man did I dig this. Definitely a nice surprise from a lime flavour. **(8.5/10)** **[Prohibition](URL (Refreshing grape lemonade) I'm not a huge fan of grape flavours but I've tried enough of them to know a good one from a bad one. This one is definitely on the good side. But sort of like Scarface it's done just a little bit different. It's grape smashed together with a nice light refreshing lemonade. At first I thought it was really odd but once you try it it's pretty freakin good. It's a nice sweet grape flavour with a backdrop of lemonade. The lemonade really brightens up the grape in a really nice way. **(8/10)** **[The 1947](URL (Rich whipped maple cream with nutty pear and chocolate ending) This one really kicks in the flavour and I mainly get a nice mix of creamy maple with pear and a very soft chocolate on the exhale. That chocolate is light but lends itself to the richness of this one. One plus for this is I don't get that boozy edge I normally get from maple flavours. Many of my go to flavours are in the dessert category so it might be why I gravitated to this one but it's nice, rich and complex the way I like them. **(9/10)** **[Thompson](URL (Sumptuous creamy vanilla tobacco with caramel undertones) This one is for the tobacco lovers. I personally love a nice mixed tobacco flavour and this one while somewhat RY4esque is done really well. I get a nice sweet, creamy vanilla with a fairly familiar tobacco flavour and some lingering notes of caramel. This and 1947 are probably the richest and most complex from the line and I dig it!! **(9/10)** ---- I have to say overall I was quite impressed with these. I've said it before and I'll say it again there is some really great juice coming out of Quebec. It's just too bad about law 44 and their overbearing government. Still you should be able to source these online or possibly outside of Quebec and if you have the chance I'd definitely recommend you give them a shot!!"
225,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Quebec Vape,14,5dh38t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/5dh38t/honest_review_time_quebec_vape/,2016-11-18 04:34:26,"Hey guys, Ok, last one for today and last one before CVE Ottawa. Hopefully when I get back I'll have plenty of new and exciting things to share. For this one I'm going to look at two sets I got from the same folks running the Gangster Clouds booth. They're from a company called Quebec Vapes. I found links for some of them but again because of that stupid law 44 in Quebec finding any info online or even a place to purchase can be a bit of a challenge, so if anyone knows where to pick up the Platinum collections please let me know and I can update the post. These were two sets of samples and they both came in the little black 10 or 15ml sample bottles. The labels are nice and clean but the platinum collection are darker and a bit nicer while their High VG ones are brighter and a bit more colourful. Both are max/high vg and the ones I got were 3mg. Here's a look at the bottles for the Quebec Vape sets, [The Platinum collection](URL and their [Quebec Vape High VG line](URL Testing was done in a narda with a fused clapton(28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[The Platinum Collection](URL **The Pudding** (Grandma's delightful and comforting pudding with its legendary caramel and sugar sauce) If you like custards and pudding flavours you'll probably really enjoy this one. It's just that a nice vanilla pudding with some nice caramel notes on the backend. I didn't write down much in my notes for this one as it's pretty basic but it's one of those staples that if done right is pretty darn amazing. This one is done right. I don't get any weird boozy notes from the caramel and the custard/pudding aspect of it is super smooth and creamy. Not the sweetest but just right. **(8/10)** **The Cereals** (Lavish flavor of chocolate and peanut cereals in its creamy milk) Oh boy did I enjoy this one. It's a nice blend of chocolate and peanut butter cereals with milk. If you've ever tried Reese Puffs cereal it's pretty reminiscent of that, a nice mix of chocolatey cereal and puffy peanut butter. My only wish for this one was that the actual cereal flavour was a bit stronger as I mostly get chocolate and peanut butter with just a bit of a cereal in the end. But both the main elements are fantastic and the whole thing is nice and creamy/milky. It's sweet but not overly and for me I could easily vape it all day. **(10/10)** **The Cake** (Raspberry mousse cake, a blend of sweet and creamy mousse with the acidic side of raspberries.) Here's another one that I had a wow moment over. Have you ever had a [Flakie](URL before, the ones with the raspberry filling? Well this one tastes like the cream and raspberry jam filling you get in one of those Flakies and man was I digging this one. If you've never had a Flaky before it's essentially a super flaky pastry filled with cream and jam and sprinkled with sugar, they were a staple for me as a kid. Now my kids enjoy them and I have to sneak them past the wife, cause you know they're for the kids lunches... To me this it's such a perfect mix of raspberry and cream and the little sample bottle I got just wasn't enough!! **(10/10)** **[Quebec Vape High VG](URL **[Pet de clown](URL (Translates to: Clown Farts) (Melon and Strawberry) Never thought I'd suck back a clown fart and enjoy it but that's exactly what happened with this. It's a really nice refreshing watermelon flavour with a sweet strawberry back end. It's a bit on the sweet side but it reminds me of a drink of fresh watermelon juice. Super bright and refreshing and really tasty. The watermelon to me kind of dominates it but that's fine with me. It's almost candylike but still has a nice freshness to it. Not too long ago I fell in love with a watermelon gum flavour and this could easily make me forget it. If you dig sweet watermelon flavours you'll probably want to check this one out! **(9/10)** **[Blue Beard](URL (Blue Raspberry, Blue Slush &amp; Candy Floss) I get mostly blue slushee from this but I also get hints of the cotton candy. It's makes it a bit sweet but the one thing I have to say about this is to me it's borderline bathroom deodorizer. It's really sweet and pleasing but every once in a while I'd get a bathroom freshener vibe from it. I'm sure lovers of blue slush vapes will really dig this but to me it's a bit too artificial for my liking. Still it's probably one of the better blue raspberry flavours that I've tried though. **(7/10)** **[Sirenis](URL (Apple and Fruit Mix) I had actually tasted these QV ones blind as they didn't come with menu cards like the others did. My notes were pretty far off on this one but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it. I didn't taste any apple in it but instead I got a really nice candy flavour. It reminded me of those flying saucer candies, the ones with the sherbet powder in rice paper that [look like this](URL When I was a kid I loved those things and this somehow reminded me a lot of them. I don't normally dig sweet candy flavours but this one was really enjoyable. No harshness or anything just an ice sweet, maybe slightly fruity candy flavour. **(8/10)** ---- The Platinum collection is just fantastic, pretty much what I'd expect a platinum collection to be but the real surprise for me was their High VG line. Of the ones I tried I was really quite impressed. Lots of flavour, nice and smooth and just all around delicious. I know some of these may be harder for the rest of us to get our hands on but if you do get the chance I would definitely suggest you check them out!! Another great one coming out of Quebec!!"

233,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: 3 Monkeys,7,50nqz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/50nqz8/honest_review_time_3_monkeys/,2016-09-02 01:28:52,"Hey guys, I've been meaning to get to this one for a while. I had actually picked some up way back at CVE: Montreal but I didn't grab this set until CVE: Toronto. I got them from another great bunch of guys with some great juice out of Quebec. Seriously what's going on out there?? While I didn't get all of them I got most of the set of their original line. Some of you may have noticed I recently did their new line called Drip Fuel, only seems right I do their original stuff as well. The whole set comes in clear glass bottles with some nice and simple yellow labels, each emblazoned with the name of the flavour. Safety sealed and all of the usual info we like to see on the bottles. I got mine in 3mg which comes in a 30/70pg/vg blend but they also offer 0mg with that ratio. They do however offer 6/9/12mg in a 50/50 blend which is nice to see. Here's a look at [the bottles](URL Testing was mostly done in an m-atty(clone) with dual fused claptons(2x26/40lvni80), 6 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.17 ohms and running it between 35-75w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [fresh shot of the build](URL with [a little colour](URL and [some cotton](URL Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Sweet Savannah](URL (Strawberry custard) I haven't gotten too excited about strawberry and cream flavours lately and I'm not even sorry for that. While this one is listed as a strawberry custard it is in fact just another strawberry cream. It's not a bad one but it doesn't exactly stand out either. Ok so maybe it leans a bit more towards a custard and the strawberry flavour is more on the fresh side but it's still just strawberry and cream to me. Maybe I could say I get a little more vanilla out of it but I don't really. It's not overly sweet and at least I don't get any nasty taste from it but it's definitely not winning me over. **(7/10)** **[Baby Face](URL (Fruit Loops) Here's another one I'd have a hard time getting excited about. It's a pretty typical fruit loops flavour. I say pretty typical cause there's a literal butt ton of them out there. It's got a decent balance of the fruit loops flavour and milk. I've tried a lot of Fruit Loop flavours and so many of them are too similar, it'd be nice to find one that stood out a bit more from the rest. At least this one's not too citrus heavy and not too sweet. No real complaints about this one, it's done well just nothing really new either. **(7/10)** **[Original Ganster](URL (Peanut butter and banana) This one too has a somewhat familiar taste to it. It's a mix of banana custard and peanut butter with the banana being slightly more dominant in the mix. It's somewhat similar to Admiral Cavendish from Captain Oliver's but has a little more to it. The peanut butter gives it just a little more richness but mainly it's that thick tasting custard that leads the way. I enjoyed it quite a bit a first, enough that I actually picked up a bottle in Montreal but it soon wore on me as it comes off just a bit too artificial tasting for my liking. **(7.5/10)** **[Cin City](URL (cinnamon custard, sugar coated danish) Here's another one that I grabbed while in Montreal but this one I still really enjoy. It's a pretty standard mix of cinnamon and sugar with a little bit of a pastry in the mix. I love these kinds of mixes and can usually rock a cinnamon sugar vape all day if it's a good one. I find with this one the cinnamon can be a touch strong, especially the first few hits but it calms down pretty quickly. There is a touch of dryness to the cinnamon as well but it's not biting if you know what I mean. Churros seem a rather popular flavour lately and this could basically pass for one as well. **(8/10)** **[Cosa Nostra](URL (strawberry milkshake) Yay! Did you feel my excitement? Yeah guess what it is? Yuuup another strawberry cream. Not sure why they felt the need for two in the same line but at least they are different enough that you can distinguish them. To be honest I actually liked this one quite a bit more thenSweet Savannah. The strawberry flavour is a little less fresh and maybe a bit more syrupy and the cream is very noticeable on the exhale. I don't exactly get a milkshake vibe from it but it is definitely strawberries and cream,,, but not a bad one. **(8/10)** **[No. 12](URL (Bourbon tobacco) This one is a rather decent blend of a sweet dry tobacco with hints of oaky bourbon. I've been really enjoying tobacco vapes lately and this one is pretty nice in a rather uncomplicated way. It manages to combine a couple of the elements that I really enjoy. Mainly the dry tobacco and that bourbon. I kind of feel like it's missing a little something but as I said, it's pretty nice for what it is. **(8/10)** **[Escobar](URL (Corn pops) Ok this one is by far my favorite of the line. It's a really nice take on a Corn Pops flavour and I have to say it's pretty darn good. While I don't think I can say it's exactly like a bowl of corn pops, it's probably about as close as one can get. I get a really really nice corn cereal flavour, like sweet toasted corn with just a bit of milk. It's a little bit sweet but it's really all about that cereal flavour. It's such a rich corn cereal flavour and I can't seem to get enough of it. **(9/10)** ---- I have to say overall I was quite happy with the 3 Monkeys line, at least the ones I've tried. They seem like quality made juice with a decent selection of flavours. Maybe I'm a bit biased towards a couple of the flavours but don't let that stop you from checking these out!! Edit: pic links"

235,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Divine Premium Eliquid,10,52w9ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/52w9ev/honest_review_time_divine_premium_eliquid/,2016-09-15 23:57:45,"Hey guys, One of the lines I picked up at CVE Toronto this year was from a company out of Winnipeg called [Divine](URL I think maybe I had confused them with [DVine](URL which may be why I wasn't in such a hurry to try them out. Well I couldn't have been more wrong. Here are my honest thoughts on the Max VG line from Divine. I got nearly the whole set in 3mg, 30ml bottles and as I mentioned they are a max vg line. I say nearly because I seem to be missing one, The Duke but it's a strawberry cream so I can't say I'm all that sad about it. They come in clear plastic bottles with nice long tips on them but on their site they only show glass 60mls, so I'm guessing these were just samples for the show. The labels are all pretty much the same except for the name across the front. Nothing too fancy here but the glass bottles do look a bit nicer. Here's [a look at the 30ml bottles](URL which happen to be labelled as 60ml. Testing was done in a narda with a fused clapton(28/40lvni80) build, 5 wraps, slightly spaced on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.42 ohms and running between 30-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Blue Lagoon](URL (Blueberry &amp; Grape with a touch of lime) So I was bit hesitant to try this one because of the lime. Lime almost never goes over well with me but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I get a an interesting mix of blueberry and grape with a slight twang to it from the lime but no weird waxy taste that I usually get. The blueberry though is borderline floral but not unbearable in anyway and the grape is pretty subtle. I didn't realize it was in there until I read the description but once you realize it's in there you might notice it gives it a slight candy taste. Not my usual kind of flavour but it was quite enjoyable. **(8/10)** **[Divine Custard](URL (Smooth &amp; Creamy Vanilla Custard infused with Butterscotch and layers of cream) I love custards, they pretty much got me to quit smoking but I have pretty high standards when it comes to them thanks to a certain three lettered legend. Tasting it, I get a super creamy, sort of sweet vanilla custard with a light butterscotch on the back end, almost an aftertaste. It's the first somewhat ""basic"" custard that I've tried in a while that really piqued my interest. In fact I hard a really hard time putting it down to go on to the rest of the review. It's smooth, creamy, the vanilla is nice and that butterscotch gives it such a nice gentle finish. I could probably go on and one but it's like I said a pretty ""basic"" custard, just that it hits all the right notes for me. **(9/10)** **[Red Diamond](URL (Grapefruit infused with Strawberry and Blueberry) This one is a really interesting mix of grapefruit and fruit. I say fruit cause I can't really distinguish the strawberry from the blueberry, they're not very distinct, more like a nice fruity compliment to the grapefruit. I've only tried a small few grapefruit flavours and I have to say this one is rather nice. Definitely has a refreshing vibe going on, with a nice balance of tart and sweet fruit. For me I don't know that I could vape this all day as it is a bit strong but I will definitely enjoy it during the next bbq if the weather holds out. **(8/10)** **[RCG(Raspberry Cream Goodness](URL (Smooth creamy Raspberry Puree that will satisfy your raspberry craving) The description of raspberry puree on this one is pretty darn accurate. I get a smooth creamy raspberry that reminds me a lot of a raspberry jam or puree. It's gently sweet with a pretty rich raspberry flavour. It's not tart or anything just creamy and smooth. They say creamy in the description and I get a creamy feel from it but not so much a creamy taste. I don't have a whole lot to say about this one as it's a pretty simple flavour, mashed raspberries. **(7/10)** **[Strawmelon](URL (Strawberry &amp; Watermelon) The watermelon in this dominates the strawberry but you can still taste both of them. It's sort of candy-like, a bit like a Jolly Rancher but not quite. It also reminds me of [those strawberry candies](URL your grandma would always have in the candy dish. It's sort of a mash up of the two, watermelon Jolly Rancher and Strawberry candy. Nothing particularly wrong with this but it was probably my least favorite from the line and it wasn't even bad. **(7/10)** **[Mr. Fitter](URL (Apple Fritter) This is a pretty nice apple cinnamon flavour. I get a hint of green apple but also a nice warm baked apple kind of taste from it. The cinnamon is nice, not dry or biting and it's got a nice light sweetness to it. One thing I don't really get much of is a crust/pastry, not sure I got a sense of it at all really. I mostly get apple, cinnamon and maybe some brown sugar. I tend to love cinnamon flavours and apple cinnamon flavours and this one is pretty darn good. **(8/10)** ---- These were surprisingly better than I had expected. Like I mentioned above I think I had confused them with DVine which I really wasn't a fan of. They all taste like quality made well crafted flavours and I don't think I'd have any trouble recommending them. Now for those that are still reading I'd like to do a little giveaway. I somehow got an extra 60ml bottle of Blue Lagoon in 3mg, much as I enjoyed it I have way too much juice so I'm giving it away to a random person who comments below.

237,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Drip Fuel by 3 Monkeys,9,4v7mnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4v7mnm/honest_review_time_drip_fuel_by_3_monkeys/,2016-07-30 03:05:22,"Hey guys, Some of you may already be familiar with [3 Monkeys eliquid](URL I haven't gotten around to a review yet but one is coming. More recently however they launched a new line called Drip Fuel. I had the chance to pick them up at CVE so here are my thoughts on the new line. The line consists of 5 flavours that come in handy unicorn style bottles perfect for on the go dripping. One caveat though is they are only available in 0 and 3mg so sorry JCV these likely won't be for you. This stuff is meant for dripping so they come in a nice and thick 20/80pg/vg mix. The bottles have nice plastic labels with a fairly basic clean design but look really nice and have all the features we like to see, safety seals, childproof tops and all the usual safety warnings around the sides. Here's a look at the [five unicorn bottles](URL Testing was done in a Petri v2 with a basic clapton(26/40lvni80) build around 0.5 ohms and between 50-80w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Jackass** (Cinnamon, apple and milk) I really enjoy a good cinnamon vape and I also enjoy a good cinnamon apple vape. This one didn't particularly blow me away but at the same time it's not bad at all. It's pretty much cinnamon forward with a light green apple and I guess a dash of milk but I didn't really pick up much of it, just a slight hmm what's that sort of thing. The cinnamon is the kind I like not too strong or biting and doesn't give you that dry taste that some can give. I'm not a huge fan of a strong green apple taste I prefer a red apple myself but again it's not bad or too strong. Rather middle of the road for me. Would have liked a bit of pie crust or something in there to finish it off. **(7/10)** **Fresh Coast** (orange, grapefruit with cream) This was my least favorite of the line, it mainly leans toward the grapefruit with an odd sort of bitterness. An odd taste that kind of lingers in your mouth. I mostly get a citrusy mash of flavour with a slight creamy edge to it. Unfortunately that odd citrus blend just didn't work for me at all and it'd be really hard for me to find anything redeeming in this one. **(3/10)** **Doughboy** (Blueberry jelly filled donut) I love blueberries, I love donuts I should love this right? Unfortunately it's just sort of so-so for me. It seems to have it all a nice blueberry flavour that isn't too floral like many I've encountered, it's got a rather decent bakery flavour to it and it's a little sweet but not overwhelming so why don't I love it. Not really sure but it too came off a bit middle of the road for me. Not bad in the least but nothing amazing either. If I had to pick between this and Jackass I'd probably pick this though. **(7.5/10)** **Squirt** (Strawberries and creamy milk) Maybe I'm just tired of doing these but oh look yay it's yet another strawberry milk. Not sure why pretty much every vendor out there feels the need to do a strawberry milk but whatever here's yet another one. It's creamy and it's got some strawberry in it. I do get a bit of fresh strawberry from it but it's mostly a pretty generic artificial strawberry and cream. Why can't I find one that actually tastes like Strawberry NesQuik, the powder kind not that stupid syrup?? **(6/10)** **Circus** (lemon meringue, pound cake) Starting to think I'm losing my mind cause this was hands down my favorite of the bunch. After the first day that I tasted them I basically didn't put it down until it was almost empty, I like to keep just a little bit for when I'm writing in case I need to double check something from my notes. To be honest it's pretty basic, I get three things from it, meringue, lemon and cake/crust and pretty much in that order. It's the balance of them that does it for me. The meringue is very upfront for me and the lemon is sort of mild but ever present. Like a mild lemon curd kind of flavour. The cake or crust flavour is sort of subdued, mostly on the bottom end. I say subdued because it's sort of comes in last but it's definitely there and definitely tasty. I'll admit it's a bit on the sweet side, not sure if that's the meringue doing it but I personally found it hard to put down. I do get the tiniest and I mean tiniest bit of that waxy taste that I normally experience with lime flavours, I'm guessing it's from the lemon in this case unless they threw in a shot of lime, I dunno. It's subtle enough that I hardly notice it. I could probably gush on about this one but remember it's all subjective. I want to give this a 10 but that ever so slight wax flavour knocks it down just the slightest. **(9/10)** ---- Most of these were sort of average for me but as always tastes are subjective so results will vary. One thing I can say though is these are quality made juice, none of them had any odd chemical tastes or anything like that and while I only really fell for one of them everyone's different so why not try them out and maybe your favorite will be different from mine."
238,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: 3Bubbles + Mr. Kripeez,11,4wavcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4wavcz/honest_review_time_3bubbles_mr_kripeez/,2016-08-06 01:14:24,"Hey guys, Here's a couple of interesting offerings from a company called [PGVG Labs](URL I had a look around their site but I'm still not entirely clear if these are made by them or just distributed but it's what they were pushing at CVE Toronto so I picked them up. Checking their site I can also see that they are the exclusive distributors for a few other brands as well but details seem limited. So here's a look at a line of bubblegum flavours called 3Bubbles and a bonus Mr. Kripeez(yes I spelled that right). I had a look on a number of sites that carry them but none seemed to list the pg/vg other than one that just listed them as Max VG so the ratio is a mystery but they all seem on the thick side. My guess would be 25/75 pg/vg or thereabouts. All the ones I got were in 3mg and both the 3Bubbles stuff and the Mr. Kripeez come in rather nice cardboard boxes without any extras. The bottles are clear glass with all the regular safety features we like to see as well as all the usual info on the sides. One thing I particularly liked is the metallic labels, not only do they look great but they should last longer, not that a 30ml lasts long with me. Here's [a look at the boxes](URL they came in and here's [a look at the bottles](URL themselves. /u/Afghani_Bobandy had requested a bit more detail around builds so going forward I'm going to try and include some more details and pics. Most of the testing was initially done on my Desire Yuri running a dual fused clapton build (2x26/38g) 6/7 wraps around a 3mm, all Nichrome80 coming in at 0.2ohm. It's an older build but cleaned up it's still working great running around 60-80w. Here's a [pic of the build](URL in the Yuri. I've also been taking a couple of them to work in a Fodi F2 or a Corolla 1.5 running a single fused clapton (2x28/40g) 6 wraps in the Yuri 5 wraps in the Fodi on a 2.5mm coming in at 0.45ohm and 0.4ohms respectively and running it around 30w. Here's a look at [the fodi f2 build](URL didn't have one handy for the Corolla. I also wanted to post some details on the scale I use but didn't have time to put that together, it'll come next time. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Vapobaba](URL (Green apple bubblegum) This was my least favorite of the line and the one that I thought tasted the least like a bubblegum flavour. It really tasted more like a green apple Jolly Rancher candy. It might be that I don't really love green apple I prefer a bright red but this one almost felt out of place to me in the line. It's not a bad flavour especially if you enjoy green apple but it just didn't give me a strong bubblegum vibe. Might be why I didn't enjoy it as much as the other two but I'm going to blame the green apple. No real harshness or disgusting chemichal taste but it does have a tinge of green to it. Still a decent flavour though just not my fav from this set. **(7/10)** **[Vapolicious](URL (Watermelon bubblegum) This was my absolute fav from the line and it's almost empty. It's a really nice bright refreshing watermelon bubblegum flavour that is pretty much spot on. No odd chemical tastes from it, no harshness, not too sweet and it doesn't seem to gunk my coils much at all(it's pretty much clear). Reminds me a lot of Hubba Bubba watermelon gum. I can easily vape this one all day long and the flavour keeps up nicely. It's not the most complex flavour but it's definitely satisfying if you enjoy watermelon bubblegum. **(9/10)** **[Vazooka](URL (Bubblegum) Straight up bubblegum! It tastes like a classic pink bubblegum flavour. Something along the lines of original flavour Hubba Bubba or like Big League chew. I can't really say it doesn't have an artificial flavour because to me pink bubblegum is pretty artificial tasting. That said though it doesn't taste like a mouthful of gross chemicals. Same as the others, no odd taste, no harshness just a nice sweet classic flavour. This one though has a bit of a pink colour to it, not sure if it's added colouring or just the flavours used but thought I should point it out. Still a nice addition to the list of bubblegum flavours that I enjoy. **(8/10)** ---- **[Mr. Kripeez](URL (vanilla from Madagascar, grilled marshmallow and a touch of Rice Krispies) A lot of Rice Krispies flavoured juices have been popping up lately and this one stands out in that it's quite different from the others that I've tried. ""A touch of Rice Krispies"" is right as I don't really get a strong sense of the Rice Krispies in it at all more like a mix of a rich vanilla and a bit of marshmallow. It's kind of sweet, has a slight creaminess to it and is very smooth. That creaminess gives it an almost buttery taste/feel not sure if it's coming from the vanilla or some added cream/milk. That vanilla though is one of the stronger components in this and really takes the lead when tasting it, the other flavours just sort of fall in line after it. While it isn't bad or offensive in anyway it's also just a bit unusual and to me hardly tastes like the Rice Krispies treat flavours I've tried and enjoy. Being that I've really been enjoying the RK treat flavours lately I was a little let down by this one. Like I said it's not bad though, just different. If you like a good vanilla flavour this might appeal to you more. **(7/10)** ---- PG/VG labs has some interesting stuff in their lineup and from what I can tell they are quality made juices. While these ones might not be the most complex of flavours they are still very enjoyable classics or guilty pleasures. If you haven't had the chance to try these I wouldn't have any trouble recommending you do!! edit: some links and details"
239,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Mistr K by LaVapeShop,8,4xe23n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4xe23n/honest_review_time_mistr_k_by_lavapeshop/,2016-08-13 01:24:24,"Hey guys, Here's yet another line from [La Vape Shop](URL that I was fortunate enough to pick up at CVE. It's a line based on elixirs and tonics and it's called [Mistr K](URL I didn't spell it wrong). Pretty sure there's at least one or two more coming from La Vape Shop so stay tuned for those in the near future. This has to be one of the fancier sample sets that I've received, coming in a [metal box](URL lined with sponge along with a decorative cardboard tube that you could put a bottle in. The bottles are clear fogged glass with black labels with old timey print on them that reminds me of old news print ads for some snake oil or something. Still have all the relevant safety info on there as well. Unfortunately one of the bottles leaked a bit before I was able to get to the set but only a tiny amount. The line is all 20/80pg/vg and the ones I got came in 3mg(only available in 3 and 6mg sorry JCV). Here's a look at the [full set](URL Testing was done in a narda with a fused clapton(28/38lvni80) build, 7 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out around 0.5 ohms and running between 20-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's a [pic of the build](URL sorry it's not the cleanest pic, I'm at work and it's all I had on my phone. Official abbreviated descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Charm** (apple, melon and pears) I always look forward to a good melon vape and this one proved to be quite unique in it's choice of blended flavours. I primarily get a smooth blend of apple and pear with a really nice melon finish on the bottom end. The apple flavour is really nice, kind of like apple juice and not too green for my liking while the pear just sort of compliments it as it tends to. The melon as I mentioned comes on the back end but it's really nicely done, not overpowering, just smooth and delicious. **(8/10)** **Keys** (key lime pie with meringue, lemons and graham crust) You know how I feel about lime flavours but this one isn't half bad. That waxy flavour I usually get from lime is pretty dialed back but the lime/lemon comes off bright and even a little creamy. I don't get a strong sense of the meringue and the crust is mostly overwhelmed by the lime but it's pretty bearable for a guy who doesn't like lime vapes. **(7/10)** **Hex** (maple whiskey) I've been loving these alcohol flavoured vapes lately and this is another nice addition. This one is a really nice rich whiskey that's sort of creamy with hints of real maple syrup. There's a rich dark sweetness to it most likely from the maple and elements that remind me of a barrel aged rye without that burning alcohol taste. Very mature flavour that's just really well implemented. **(9/10)** **Glory** (coffee, cream and chocolate cereal) Wow, this one is rich, dark and delicious. I really enjoy the complexity of it but I find it tends to taste a bit burnt pretty quickly. That's not going to stop be from enjoying it though. It reminds me a lot of tiramisu or like a mocha cake with rich coffee icing. I get these lovely laces of coffee intertwined with chocolate and it's just fantastic. Probably not an adv but one of those really enjoyable after dinner vapes or maybe a good pairing for your morning coffee. **(9/10)** **Rapture** (gin, lemon and mint) This is the one that leaked and I suspect it might be from the flavourings in it. It's a strong lemon and mint that's very bright and refreshing. I guess it's sort of along the lines of a mohito but not exactly like it as it's lemon and not lime. Might be why I found it a little more bearable than some others I've tried. This one's not really in my profile but it's still a very well executed flavour just not for me. **(6/10)** **Nostalgia** (Blueberry cobbler, real blueberry and real cake) This one takes me back to my childhood, Sunday dinner is on the table and a fresh picked blueberry cobler is in the oven. It tastes so much like a fresh baked blueberry cobbler but it's a bit light/mild. Probably a good thing if you want to adv it but I feel it could use just a tiny bit more punch in the flavour department. I can't really distinguish any cake but it does give me that sense of bakery/crust along with the blueberry. Really nice, smooth flavour that's not too strong for a dessert. **(8/10)** ---- I've been really blown away by a lot of these juices from La Vape Shop. Until pretty recently I had never even tried their stuff but I'm so glad I've had the chance to now. So far they've all been very well crafted quality made flavours with a really good variety to boot. So if you haven't had the chance yourself I highly recommend you check them out!!"
240,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Vape Shakes by Twelve Monkeys,12,4y07ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4y07ak/honest_review_time_vape_shakes_by_twelve_monkeys/,2016-08-17 01:54:12,"Hey guys, Here's a line that was launched at CVE Toronto by a company I think we're all familiar with [Twelve Monkeys Vapor Co.](URL It's called [Vape Shakes](URL and it's three flavours based on milk shakes. I didn't actually pick these up at the show but recently had a chance to pick them up on the cheap, so I did. A friend had been raving about one of them so I thought I'd give them a go. They come packaged in [little plastic cups](URL with lids that makes the dripper tip look like a straw and the whole thing like a little milkshake, super cute! The actual bottles are clear glass but have that foggy finish. The labels are bright and colourful and have all the info we like to see. Here's a shot of [the bottles](URL The line is 70vg and I picked them up in 3mg. Testing was done in a Petri v2 with a dual clapton(26/40lvni80) build, 9 wraps on a 3mm coming out to 0.52 ohms and running it between 60-75w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's [a shot of the build](URL after a rinse and rewick. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Strawberry Crumble](URL (Strawberry rhubarb, vanilla, cheesecake, graham cracker crumbs) So dare I say it, yet another strawberry cream. I honestly didn't know there was rhubarb or cheesecake or even the graham in it until I read the official description. This is the one that a friend has been fiending for and I personally don't really get it. To me it's a super sweet strawberry flavour that's not really fresh or fake tasting, mixed with some cream. It's so sweet it leaves your lips tasting like sugar. I honestly didn't notice the rhubarb or the cheesecake at all and only got a hint of the graham on the very bottom end after reading the description and that might just be my imagination. Oh yeah and it's also really really sweet, did I mention it's really sweet!? Don't get me wrong it's not bad at all especially if you like sweet vapes but the description seems a bit inflated, since it's mostly just strawberry and sugar. **(7/10)** **[Cookie Nut Crunch](URL (Peanut butter cream filling, chocolate cookie biscuits) Mmm peanut butter and chocolate, I should love this right? Well.... I don't know if there was something wrong with this one, something wrong with me or what but I taste some kind of fruit in this as well. I do get a soft creamy peanut butter and chocolate kind of thing but there's also an odd fruity kind of vibe going on too. The pb and chocolate are light, almost fleeting. It's super creamy and smooth, a bit on the sweet side as well but I still found it quite enjoyable. While it wasn't exactly what I imagined it would taste like it's like I said still quite enjoyable. **(7/10)** **[Milky Mango](URL (Mangoes, yogurt and milk) This one was my surprise fav of the bunch as I don't tend to like yogurt flavours but this one does it really well. If you enjoy a fresh mango lassi then you will probably love this. If you've never tried a lassi it's basically fruit and yogurt blended up in to a thick delicious drink, mango being one of the more popular flavours. This comes really damn close to matching the taste and even the sensation of a mango lassi. It's quite thick and creamy. I also get little hints of peach but it could just be my automatic association of those two flavours after trying so many peach mango blends. Usually I can't stand yogurt flavours as most taste awful to me but this one adds a dash of it and it works well, at least for me. It just adds a bit of sour tartness to the cream. This'll be a nice summer time flavour for me! **(8/10)** ---- I think we can all agree Twelve Monkeys makes some good eliquid, yes some of it might be of guilty pleasure type but it's good stuff none the less. If you enjoy Twelve Monkeys and like creamy flavours you'll probably want to check these out!!"
241,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: M.E.O. Mother Earth Organics,14,4ycofr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4ycofr/honest_review_time_meo_mother_earth_organics/,2016-08-19 00:51:00,"Hey guys, I was fortunate enough to be setup by the gents from [M.E.O.](URL while I was at CVE Toronto. I've been wanting to get to this one for a while since I was already a fan of a few of their flavours. Here are my thoughts on the ones I picked up at the show. The bottles are varied, some black and some clear but all of them have nice clean labels with all the info we usually like to see along with some nice simple graphics on some of them. On their site I found that their MEO line comes in 70vg while the Milk Line, Amazing Apple and Signature series are Max vg and listed as being anywhere between 80-90%vg. All the ones I got were in 3mg. Here's [a shot of the bottles](URL all lined up! Testing was mostly done in a Petri v2 with a dual clapton(26/40lvni80) build, 9 wraps on a 3mm coming out to 0.52 ohms and running it between 60-75w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Here's [a shot of the build](URL after a rinse and rewick. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[MEO Organics Line](URL **[Strawberry Lemonade](URL (Strawberry lemonade) This started off pretty nice for me but seemed to pick up an odd note the more I vaped on it. It reminds me quite a bit of pink lemonade but I don't really get much of a sense of strawberry from it. It's sort of tart/tangy like lemonade but doesn't get irritating like some lemon flavours can get, at least while I was vaping on it. One of the more enjoyable lemonade flavours that I've tried. **(7/10)** **[Scrumptious](URL (peanutbutter and vanilla cupcake) Apparently this one is being discontinued as per their site but I'll still give you the run down. This one sounded fantastic but left me rather disappointed. I mostly get a rather strong, somewhat dry tasting nut flavour that has a slightly musty note to it. I don't get any sense of vanilla or cupcake at all. I tend to like nutty flavours so I didn't completely hate this one but it definitely misses the mark. **(4/10)** **[Planet Jupiter](URL (light blueberry, swedish berries, ripe strawberries, pomegranite, finished with a light cream) This is one of those berry blends that I'm not a huge fan of since I can't really distinguish one from the other in the mix. I do get a slight candy note from the Swedish berries but it's only slight. Speaking of slight I don't really get a sense of the cream in this either, it might be the higher pg that throws it off for me but I don't really taste it at all. **(6/10)** **[Orange-A-Tang](URL (Orange Creamsicle, tangerine, vanilla ice cream) So this definitely tastes like orange but I get more of a vitamin C orange kind of vibe from it and not a fresh orange. This also seems to have that slight plastic note that I've found in other creamsicle flavours. As much as I enjoy oranges this one isn't for me. **(4/10)** **[Fuzzy Guava](URL (peaches, nectarine and guava) It's peachy, a bit tart but not bitter. Not too sweet and even kind of refreshing. I feel like there's a bit more nectarine then the guava and it might be me but I feel like I get hints of mango. That might be my auto association of the two flavours though. This one was probably my favorite of the Organics line and to me had the most genuine flavour. **(7/10)** ---- **[MILK Series](URL **[French Toast and Milk](URL I'm a fan of the Milk series and when I had the chance I picked up a bottle of this a while back. It's kind of hard to describe as to me it doesn't taste exactly like French Toast but it's pretty darn close. More like it nails a bunch of the elements of a good french toast breakfast. I get hints of syrup, cinnamon, cream/milk and some sort of cake/bakery flavour. It's not smack you in the face flavour, it's more mellow and smooth. A well blended mix of flavours that I could personally vape all day. **(9/10)** **[Crunch and Milk](URL ( your favourite cereal, soggy with sugary milk) Don't ask me what cereal this is supposed to be, I've had long debates with a friend over what it's supposed to be. From the label you'd think it was Cinnamon Toast Crunch but that's not what I get from it, I don't taste any cinnamon in it. To me it tastes like the milk leftover in the bowl after finishing your cereal. What cereal, I'm not sure but it gives you that sweet grainy cereal flavour absolutely smothered in milk. Sort of a light sweet bakery flavour that's nice and creamy. Another one that I could vape all day! **(9/10)** **[Crisp and Milk](URL (Sugar crisp cereal, puffed wheat, and sugar molasses) This is so far my favorite from MEO. Sugar Crisp is one of my all time favorite cereals and this manages to capture it's essence in a bottle. You get a nice sense of the puffed wheat but more so you get an amazing caramelized sugar taste. It's rich and that molasses is what makes the sugar taste so dark but it such a good way. Along with the puffed wheat and caramelized sugar you get that nice milky/creaminess that the whole line incorporates making it a nearly perfect rendition of my favorite cereal. Yes it's on the sweet side and might be a bit of a coil gunker but it's one of my new guilty pleasures. **(10/10)** ---- **[RL Signature Series](URL **[Carrot Cake and Frosting](URL (Carrot cake and frosting) Recently /u/Setzrfd reviewed this one and I couldn't have had a more different experience. I personally love this stuff. Sure it might not be the most complex according to setzrfd but what it delivers seems to work for me. It's mostly a nice blend of spice or bakers spice served up with a ton of sugar. This juice is the absolute worst coil killer I've ever vaped and I'm not even mad. Would not recommend using this in a tank with replaceable coils unless you have money to burn. I know when I vape this stuff that after only a few mls my coils will be shiny and black with burnt sugar. But that sugar serves a purpose, it gives you that thick white frosting flavour you'd find atop a nice piece of carrot cake. Maybe it's just me but I also feel like I can taste a bit of sweet carrot in there. Not something I would vape all day but something I would definitely enjoy after a nice meal or when I want a little special treat. **(9/10)** ---- **[Amazing Apple](URL (apple with more apples) Ok so I don't know if I'd personally call this Amazing Apple but it's definitely Pretty Good Apple in my opinion. I'm so used to apple being accompanied by cinnamon that this is a nice refreshing take on an apple flavoured vape. I get apple upon apple out of this but I swear I can also taste something like dragon fruit or maybe pear in it. Something that gives it a bit more body. I really appreciate the fact that it's not a strong green apple flavour smacking you in the face but more of a sweet red apple kind of flavour. Of course it's just layered with more apple but how could I describe is as anything other than apple. It's a little bit tart and just a little bit dry but overall it's a pretty nice fresh apple flavour. **(8/10)** ---- So apparently I'm not the biggest fan of their original Organics line but it looks like a number of them are being discontinued anyway according to the site. Maybe it's the fact that they're organic while I've grown accustomed to artificial, who knows. Their Milk, RL and Apple though are all pretty fantastic. If you haven't yet given MEO ejuice a try, what are you waiting for?? They make some really incredible stuff and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who these flavours appeal to."

It's called [Unicorn](URL and it's produced by [VapLab](URL out of Quebec. Not sure exactly where the name is derived but they all come in handy 30ml unicorn style bottles,,, hmmm coincidence? As I mentioned they're all in unicorn bottles and they sport shiny metallic labels. I actually had a bit of trouble trying to get a pic with no glare. All of the usual info we like to see is on the labels as well. I picked up the set in 3mg and the line is listed as Max VG but the actual ratios vary by flavour starting at 30/70pg/vg and going up to 20/80 pg/vg. I'll list the ratios next to the flavours. Here's a look at [the shiny Unicorns](URL Testing was done in a Stumpy with a basic clapton(26/40lvni80) build around 0.4 ohms and between 35-75w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Dragon Grenade](URL (Dragon fruit, pomegranate, coconut and cream 30/70pg/vg) I've only tried a few dragon fruit vapes and I know many of us will claim there can be only one ;) ;) But I have to say this isn't too bad. I get a lightly tart taste with hints of dragon fruit and an almost apple juice sort of thing maybe from the pomegranate?! I don't really get a sense of the coconut or cream from this one but it's probably the higher pg in it. I personally find pg tends to kill the cream in a lot of vapes. Very much a light refreshing summery type of flavour. **(7/10)** **[Jolly Berry](URL (Candy, berry, melon and sour 30/70pg/vg) I think some of you might know how I feel about candy and sour flavours, usually not something I gravitate to but this one does a damn good job of recreating a particular favorite, watermelon Jolly Ranchers. It's probably the best rendition I've tried yet and pretty much dead accurate to the namesake. It's a bright watermelon candy flavour that I think maybe has just the tiniest hint of koolada to give it a refreshing vibe like the candy. It lists sour as a flavour but I don't get much of a sour taste and definitely no irritation from it, just a really nice clean tasting watermelon Jolly Rancher flavour. I'll be enjoying this over the course of the summer! **(9/10)** **[Tangerine Dream](URL (Orange, mango, sweet and cream 25/75pg/vg) This has to be one of the most complex orange flavours I've tried yet. There's so much orange going on in it. I get bright notes of fresh orange with deeper notes like dried orange slices and even a hint of tartness like you'd get from the rind. Mango and orange go hand in hand and I've seen more juice combine the two flavours but I can almost never distinguish one from the other. I think that's why they pair so well. I really can't pick out where one ends and the other begins but either way it's pretty damn good. This is another one though that also lists cream and I have to say I didn't note it at all when tasting it, not that it's missed. Such a bright tasting juice! **(8/10)** **[Donut Crunch](URL (Donut, cereal, milk and cream 25/75pg/vg) Usually I tend to like things more as the vg ratio goes up, not the case with these ones. I really hate to say it but this might possibly be the worst donut flavour I've tried to date. Definitely getting the milk and cream in this but it's way too strong and comes out a bit off, like it's spoiled. Similar to a lot of yogurt vapes I've tried. Off milk is about the best description I could give it. I do get hints of a fruity/berry cereal but the milk/cream taste in this just completely kills it for me. Also I don't get that typical flavour associated with donut vapes. Sorry VapLab but this one just isn't for me. **(2/10)** **[Milky Way](URL (Milk, Peanut, caramel and custard 20/80pg/vg) I had really high hopes for this one since Milky Way is one of my favorite chocolate bars but sadly it was a bit of a let down, but just a little. It tastes like chocolate with an odd nougat taste. It kind of reminds me of the flavour of malt but just a bit too much. I only tend to get a real sense of a Milky Way bar on the very bottom end, almost like an afterthought but it is kind of there. The problem for me with this one is it's only on the bottom end and not throughout. If I could get that taste from the start it would be really really enjoyable. **(7/10)** **[XO &amp; Cream](URL (Cognac, custard, banana and cream 20/80pg/vg) Saved the best for last and this might be one of the best tasting custards I've ever tried. I mostly get a rich creamy vanilla type custard with a very rich finish. The banana kind of blends in to the custard so it's subtle and doesn't turn it in to a banana custard/pudding, just sort of gives it a bit more flavour and depth. The cognac adds to that incredible richness and gives it an almost spicy note which I find very pleasant while the cream smooths the whole thing over without adding any funky taste. Not sure if this will dethrone my favorite of all time OMC but it's a very welcome addition. **(9.5/10)** ---- This was the first time I've tried anything from VapLab and I must say I'm quite impressed. The line covers a variety of tastes so most should be able to find at least one that they like. Not sure exactly what's going on but Quebec seems to house some of the best juice makers in Canada and I for one hope to see more great things come out of la belle province. "
244,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: VaporNorth Signature Flavours,12,4rvf7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4rvf7e/honest_review_time_vapornorth_signature_flavours/,2016-07-09 02:11:25,"Hey guys, /u/coolloser did a review of some VN juice the other day which somehow spurred me to jump the queue with a new set of Signature juices that were sent to me from the wonderful gents at [VaporNorth](URL I spent the last few days with them but to be fair, I pretty much tucked in to them the day they arrived a few weeks back. I absolutely love the design of the VaporNorth bottles. They have a very clean but cool looking blue and white design sort of reminiscent of old sailor tattoos or something like that. The bottles are the nice squeezy kind and they generally work great. All the usual info in fine print and I got them all in Maxg VG and 3mg. Here's a look at the [rather cool bottles](URL Testing was done in a Stumpy with a basic clapton(26/40lvni80) build around 0.4 ohms and between 35-75w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Red Wedding](URL (raspberry doughnut mixed with creamy yogurt) This one will likely be hit or miss for a lot of folks because it's a yogurt. I've tried plenty of yogurts and I don't think I've enjoyed any of them, they all kind of taste like yak. This one on the other hand isn't too bad, maybe because of the mix with the doughnut. I primarily get a light raspberry flavour with little hints of pastry/doughnut all made creamy with yogurt. The yogurt seems pretty dialed back and doesn't really give a strong spoiled milk flavour like many I found do. It's pretty unique but probably not something I'd vape regularly. **(7/10)** **[Polar Bear](URL (chocolatey thin mint cookie) I've done a few of these in recent times and I have to say I've pretty much fully come around to chocolate and mint and this one is another very nice one for the list. I find the mint/menthol is a touch stronger in this than some of the others I've tried and really gives a nice cooling feel when vaping it. Reminds me a lot of a York peppermint patty or a GG Thin Mint that's been dialed up just a touch(ever put them in the freezer?? amazing!). It's got a very nice chocolate flavour, somewhere between a milk and a dark with just a hint of cookie floating around all wrapped up in that bright refreshing mint to kick it all up a notch. If you love chocolate mint cookies, this could very well be the one you're looking for! **(8.5/10)** **[Nahanni](URL (smooth cherry tobacco) This one is for the tobacco lovers, it's a bold tobacco flavour that reminds me of cut tobacco or a nice cherry pipe tobacco. The cherry isn't too strong that it takes over the tobacco but rather compliments it pretty nicely. I did get an odd alcohol type note from it but it seemed only on the first few fresh hits. Then it smoothed out considerably leaving me with that nice smooth rich tobacco. Not my favorite tobacco or from the line but still pretty darn nice. **(7/10)** **[Ms Muffet](URL (warm cinnamon apple muffin) I had a chance to sit and chat with the boys in blue at CVE Toronto and they explained the idea behind these and with this one it was sort of an attempt at tackling the venerable Muffin Man, ergo Ms Muffet. It shares a lot of the same components of Muffin Man but the sweetness has been dialed way back. I get a nice warm green apple with a gentle cinnamon muffin follow up. The muffin flavour seems almost more subtle than the cinnamon but the whole thing is very nicely balanced. It doesn't have that overbearing sweetness that MM has for me so I could easily vape this all day. If you liked MM but maybe found it a bit too sweet this will probably be perfect for you. **(8/10)** **[Mossback](URL (warm kentucky bourbon) Kind of saved the best for last with this one and a bit of a surprise for me. Following on the success of Lady M this is another alcoholic drink based flavour, one that I never thought I'd enjoy as much as I do. I'm primarily a whiskey and beer type of guy, I don't get too fancy with the drinks but this just like it's description is a warm Kentucky bourbon and I'd be hard pressed to describe it as anything but. I get rich notes of bourbon with the most wonderful oak barrel mid notes and maybe it's just me but I find I'm getting some hints of raw coconut or something like that at the very bottom end. Interestingly enough you get all that flavour without the taste of alcohol, no odd boozy notes in this one. A very mature flavour that to me is absolutely amazing and a must try if you enjoy a good drink. **(9/10)** ---- I really like where VN is going with their Signature series, it really makes them stand out from so many others I've seen. Yes these are some mature flavours but we aren't advertising to kids amirite!? So if you haven't already checked out the new additions what are you waiting for??"

UG standing for Ultra Good. I didn't have the chance to grab the whole set at CVE Toronto so I was quite excited to try them out. Here are my honest thoughts on the line. I received the set in 3mg and they're all max VG but vary in their ratios, I'll list them with descriptions. The four 60ml glue top bottles are dark blue and come in individual boxes. I'm guessing the line used to be smaller as the [graphics on the boxes line up](URL when you put them in a line but there's an extra letter. They look really nice and clean. All the usual info we like to see around the sides.

Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Brighter Blue](URL (Classic New Yorkan blueberry cheesecake, 75vg) This is one of those flavours that sort of grows on you the more you vape it. I mostly get blueberry with a slight floral kick to it. The cheesecake essentially gets buried in it for me but as far as I can tell gives it a nice rich creaminess. As I mentioned it's mostly blueberry but it's a pretty nice blueberry that leans a bit more on the natural side. It sort of reminds me of the smell when you're picking fresh blueberries. Kind of wish the cheesecake came out a bit more in this but as a fan of all things blueberry I quite enjoyed this. **(7/10)** **[Frappe](URL (refreshing strawberry milkshake, with a hint of ripe bananas, a drop of french vanilla and a smooth malted nutmilk finish, 70vg) I don't tend to get excited about strawberry and cream flavours as they're pretty much a dime a dozen and most are quite similar. This one manages to set itself apart though, just a little bit anyway. The strawberry is fairly bold, not super fresh tasting but not exactly artificial either, more like a rich jam flavour. But it's the addition of banana, french vanilla and the malted nutmilk that make it just a little bit different. It's still mainly a strawberry and cream but there's much more body to it. The banana is super subtle while the vanilla just sort of blends it all together but the malted nutmilk kind of lingers on the exhale rather nicely. It's a nice touch on what could otherwise be a pretty generic flavour. **(8/10)** **[Warmer Days](URL (an original contradiction between juicy oranges and summer flowers, a kiss of honeydew, all wrapped up in a subtle background of tropical and exotic fruits, 80vg) As much as the description appealed to me on this one I couldn't really get in to it, there's something in it that doesn't quite work for me. It tastes tart and bitter like orange rinds with a sort of flat Honeydew melon flavour in the back end. I get an almost a grapefruit kind of thing. The flowers and tropical flavours don't really stand out for me but likely lend themselves to that zestfulness. It does however have a rather refreshing vibe to it. It'll probably make a really good palate cleanser but that bitterness was a bit too much for me. **(6/10)** **[PB&amp;J](URL (crunchy peanut butter on the inhale, and tart &amp; sweet strawberry jam, 70vg) Most of you know I have a loyalty to a certain PB&amp;J flavour so I didn't want to like this one, honest I didn't, but the thing is, it's pretty damn good. The jam reminds me of the strawberry from Frappe, it's rich, like jam but sort of like the thick jam you get on top of those Peek Frean Fruit Cream cookies, dense and concentrated. The peanut butter is also a bit richer than I'm used to and has a really nice deep flavour, almost like the nuts are roasted. It's a tad on the sweet side but not enough to bother me in anyway. I also find the peanut butter flavour sticks around a bit longer than my go to pb&amp;j flavour. I don't think this will dethrone my go to but it's definitely made the list. **(9/10)** ---- Overall I had a really great experience with these. They taste like quality made juice and the flavours are well formulated. Not only do they have great juice but /u/emixologies is a really great guy,,, despite his hatred for me. So if you haven't given them a try yet I highly recommend you do!!!"

One of the smaller sets I received from [LaVapeShop's](URL Martin was called Epicure which was composed of only two flavours. They're a tea line inspired by exotic flavours and are hands down one of the most beautiful lines I've had the pleasure of trying in quite some time. The two flavours come in a nice little brown cardboard box emblazoned with the epicure logo. It folds open sort of like a Chinese takeaway container. I couldn't find the pg/vg ratio but the ones I got came in 3mg and seem rather thick so I'm guessing 20/80 or somewhere around there. The bottles are clear but fogged and the labels have lovely floral imagery related to the origins of the flavours.

It's quite different from anything I've tried but at the same time has some very familiar elements. Right off the bat I'm hit with a nice mellow cinnamon which I don't see listed in the description. It's not a strong one but I wasn't really expecting it either. Next comes a nice tea flavour that sort of lingers in your mouth and hangs around after the exhale. The real surprising element is the addition of beet sugar. I love beets, especially pickled beets but in this I actually taste a little bit of that sweet beet flavour, amazing if you love beets like I do. I don't get a very strong sense of lemon in this which I'm fine with as it really doesn't need much of it, I think it just perks it up a bit. All of this comes out smooth with the addition of the cream, making the whole thing super rich and pleasant to vape on. **(10/10)** **[Bombay](URL (Link on site is broken - Apricot, white tea, brown sugar, cream) Checking their site I don't see this one listed but was able to find a broken link so maybe it's out of stock or coming soon, not sure. Either way it's just as delectable as the first one but couldn't be more different in it's profile. This one comes off more as a fruity tea vape and reminded me a lot of an Arizona Ice Tea or Snapple if they had an apricot flavour. You mainly get the apricot up front immediately followed by a nice white tea flavour on your tongue. The tea sort of comes after much like with Istanbul. But that's about as similar as they get. The white tea flavour is a bit more familiar and it has a nice sweetness to it thanks to the brown sugar. The apricot and the tea flavour are very nicely balanced and again made smooth with the addition of cream. Ok so this one might be just a tad less exotic but that doesn't mean it's any less amazing. **(10/10)** ---- With legions of similar flavours out there it's really refreshing to come across a line that's a bit different, that strays from the common and familiar. It can be a bit of a risk but sometimes the risk is worth the reward. It's pretty rare that I have an oh wow moment these days but both of these had me saying it. If you have the chance, do check these out, they are absolutely beautiful!!"
247,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Fat Rat by the Juice Punk,8,4kzhx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4kzhx2/honest_review_time_fat_rat_by_the_juice_punk/,2016-05-25 22:57:23,"Hey guys, When I was at CVE Toronto I met the good folks from [Juice Punk](URL and they offered me a set of their new line called Fat Rat for review. I'm already a fan of some of their juices so I couldn't pass up the chance. If you check their site it was up for pre-order with the juice shipping just this last week. The bottles came hand wrapped in brown paper and twine in a white box that was stuffed with some hay like stuffing(rattan?) along with a flavour card and a nice JuicePunk branded notebook, very nice touch!! Here's a look at the [contents of the box](URL The bottles are marked Max VG and 33ml which is a bit unusual but I guess likely more accurate if filled to the top. They came in clear glass with a label that's similar in style to their past offerings along with all the appropriate information we like to see. Here's a look at [the actual bottles](URL Testing was done in a Stumpy with a dual fused clapton(2x26/40lvni80) build around 0.18 ohms and between 45-75w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Agent Provocateur** (Pineapple Extreme) This one I was probably looking forward to the most as I've pretty recently come around to pineapple vapes and I'm still looking for a good one to fill the void. This one however was a bit too light for me to fall in love with. It's a light pineapple taste that to me feels like it's missing something. Not quite fresh pineapple and not quite a candy either. Light on sweetness, there's no noticeable tartness and the flavour itself comes off a bit dry. When compared to the other two it just feels,,,, lighter. All that said it's not really bad either. There's no harsh, artificial or chemical taste to it and what pineapple flavour I do get is pretty good. Guess I just wanted a bit more from it. **(7/10)** **Road Warrior** (Insane melon) I really like melon vapes but I can also be pretty picky about them. This one is a blend of several melons but it's hard to nail down exactly which ones. I get some cantaloupe, some honeydew and I'm pretty sure a little watermelon too. Nothing new here but it's been done very well and with the quality you'd come to expect from JuicePunk. In comparison to Agent Provocateur this one really packs a flavour punch but as strong as the flavour is it's quite smooth and clean tasting. As a fan of melon I'm always on the lookout for new melon vapes and this one's just made the list. **(8.5/10)** **Master Hellion** (Grape Fanatic) When it comes to grape flavours I'm pretty much the opposite of how I am with melon. I don't seek them out and I don't really enjoy them all that much. There's been a few exceptions but when it comes to day to day I will hardly ever pick one up. This one is a little bit different from the ones I've tried. I get a slightly candy, powdery grape taste that sort of leaves a lingering powdery taste on my tongue. Think grape Fun-dip. As far as grape flavours go this one had some real staying power with me and I found myself vaping it for the entire afternoon that I worked on the review. Pretty much a record for me. **(8/10)** ---- Unlike the majority of their other lines, these seem to be not so complex, single flavours that are just done really well. JuicePunk makes some quality stuff and these are no exception. While they aren't the most complex flavours they are still flavours that are readily sought and it's nice to see companies make good stuff that doesn't alienate people with less complex tastes. If you enjoy a good fruit flavour vape and these sound appealing to you, I highly recommend you check them out!!!"

It's something I picked up in a shop while I was there that I think is a truly Canadian flavour and I figured some of you might enjoy it. Made by [Pristine Eliquids](URL by two gents named Ren Buffoni and Zurd. It comes in a clear glass bottle with dripper and the liquid itself is a 10/90 pg/vg mix, but it's labelled 'max vg, pis toute'. I picked mine up in 3mg. It's not the fanciest but it's one of the most unique presentations I've seen with a wood patterned label adorned with a stylized beaver and an actual piece of wood glued to the front. It's basically what caught my eye and as soon as I inquired about the flavour I knew I had to have it. The bottle is childproof and the label has all the info that it should have on it. Here's a look at the [cheeky little beaver](URL Testing was done in a hobo v3.1 with a dual 26g build around 0.3 ohms and around 35-55w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Castor** (Its slightly oily taste of fried pastry covered with maple butter and brown sugar, all sprinkled with delicious ground cinnamon make this e-liquid real happiness.) Have you figured it out yet? It's beaver tails!! It's the first beaver tails eliquid that I've tried and at first I was expecting something similar to a funnel cake liquid but this goes a rather different route. I can actually taste the fried pastry and like the official description says there's even a hint of an oily taste like you get when eating one of these classic Canadian treats. That delectable dough is accompanied by a very nice but somewhat light maple and cinnamon sugar mix. I found the three main flavours were very well balanced and none of them over powered the others. As rich as this liquid is, there's almost a lightness to it which makes it adv material for me. It is a touch on the sweet side but surprisingly not a bad coil gunker. One thing I like is it's based on a classic beaver tail not one laced with chocolate or fruit or whatever, it's basically fried cinnamon sugar dough and I love it. **(9/10)** ---- I haven't seen this anywhere outside of Quebec yet but it did make an appearance at CVE Toronto if you were lucky enough to catch it. At least now you can pick it up [online](URL a few places. If you're into festival foods and enjoy a good beaver tail you'll probably want to check this stuff out! edit:site and names"

One of the most generous was a gentleman named Martin from [LaVapeShop](URL He very kindly furnished me with several of their lines. Here's my thoughts on the first couple lines that I had the chance to try with plenty more to come. Both lines comes in a 30/70 pg/vg blend with the exception of one flavour(Berry Cheesecake is 20/80) and I picked all of them up in 3mg. They come in handy unicorn bottles with nice colourful labels all wrapped up in some [rice paper bags](URL emblazoned with their [cheerful ambassadors](URL Here's a look at the handy dandy little bottles for the [Ice King](URL and [Cake King](URL Testing was done in a narda with a basic clapton(26/40lvni80) build around 0.5 ohms and between 20-45w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- ***[Ice King](URL **Blueberry** (Blueberry ice cream) I love all things blueberry so I'm constantly looking for a good blueberry vape. This combines two things that I enjoy in a vape, blueberries and cream. The blueberry is fairly realistic but I do get just a hint of a floral note from it. It is however smoothed over with the creaminess of the 'ice cream'. I noticed I got a bit of an odd taste when I kicked up the watts so this one is most likely enjoyed best at lower temps/watts. At lower watts it stays nice and creamy with that fresh blueberry taste. It's nice but doesn't quite nail exactly what I want from a bb vape. **(7/10)** **Black Cherry** (Black cherry ice cream) Honestly, I thought I was going to hate this when I first smelled it. It reminded me of a visit to the dentist, that fake cherry flavoured fluoride they would put on your teeth as a kid. But luckily as soon as I tasted it all thoughts of that went out the window. It tastes like a creamy cherry candy, almost powdery and it kind of reminded me of astronaut ice cream. The cherry flavour though really reminds me of the same black cherry you get in the ice cream but instead of little bursts of it you get it all throughout. **(7.5/10)** **Peanut Butter** (Peanut butter ice cream) I love peanut butter vapes so I was pretty excited to try this. I get a nice creamy peanut butter that's a bit on the sweet side. I do sometimes get a tiny bit of an artificial taste that reminds me of PB scented products, a bit waxy like lip balm or something but it's not enough to put me off. One thing I can say about all of these flavours so far is they are all smooth, creamy and sweet and this one is no exception. This will be a nice little addition to the list of pb vapes! **(8/10)** **Hazelnut** (Hazelnut ice cream) This was my absolute favorite of the bunch and might actually replace a certain nutty creamy vape I've been enjoying a lot lately. It's so smooth, creamy and sweet with a really nice nutty hazelnut finish. I find it leaves a lingering sweetness on my lips and tongue and with this one I rather enjoy it. It's like a bowl of melted hazelnut ice cream and I can lap this up all day long. After trying it out, without hesitation I brought it and only it to work with me and enjoyed it all day long. **(10/10)** ---- ***[Cake King](URL **Flip that cake** (Pineapple upside down cake with cinnamon icing.) I recently learned of a Brazilian treat where they roast pineapple on the grill and cover it with cinnamon sugar, I so wanted to love this for that reason but ultimately it just wasn't for me. It's an interesting mix of a sort of baked pineapple dusted with cinnamon. The cinnamon sort of takes the forefront and clobbers the pineapple in this which makes it just a tiny bit cloying. It's almost hard to get a good sense of the pineapple because of it. I also hardly get any sense of a cake from this one. Just not for me I guess. **(6/10)** **Berry Cheesecake** (New York style cheesecake topped with strawberry coulis) Mixed berry almost never goes over well with me, I like to be able to tell what I'm vaping, that said to me this is a mixed berry cheesecake and I don't mind it at all. I get a nice creamy indistinct berry flavour and what I think is a hint of graham. There's also a tiny bit of sourness to it that really lends itself to the whole cheesecake thing. The description says strawberry but like I said it's pretty indistinct. Even though I can't tell what it is I still found I enjoyed it quite a bit. Not something I would seek out but something I can definitely vape. **(7/10)** **Cookie Custard** (Hot and gooey cookie covered with custard) This has a sweet light vanilla custard and almost like a cookie dough kind of taste to it. The custard really overtakes the cookie aspect of it but it's a rather nice custard. The flavour seemed a bit odd to me at first but quickly grew on me. Not exactly the typical cookie flavour nor is it a common custard. It's a nice mix of the two and I was pleasantly surprised as it grew on me more and more. I was half expecting an Italian cinnamon sugar cookie like so many others out there but I can't quite put my finger on what this is. Whatever it is, it's good! **(8/10)** **Apple Crumble** (Mix of apples, brown sugar, cinnamon and oatmeal) Right off the bat I get a nice baked apple flavour with a bit of brown sugar and a touch of cinnamon, but just a touch. The really beauty of this one is the crumble. They manage to capture that buttery, crispy crumble kind of taste and boy is it nice. I also really like the apple in this one, not a strong green apple taste like so many others, instead I get a nice warm almost apple sauce kind of deal from it. It's probably the cinnamon and brown sugar that gives it that feeling but whatever it is this one was probably my surprise favorite from the cake line. **(8/10)** ---- This is the first chance I've had to try stuff from LaVapeShop aside from the expo and I have to say so far I've very impressed. Both of these lines are very well done. Yeah they might be a touch on the sweet side but I know a lot of you like that sort of thing like I do. So if any of these sounds good to you I encourage you to check them out. I'll have a lot more coming from these guys over the coming weeks so stay tuned as there will likely be a little hardware giveaway as well ;)"

So I'm making this post to see if anyone else has ordered through Hollywood Vape Labs before. If you had gone to CVE it would've been hard to miss [this](URL ejuice line. So far things are a little rocky. Before placing my order, I emailed them through their website asking if they were planning on getting bigger sizes on their juices since I had fallen in love with Sneaky Sneaky at CVE. No answer. I give them a little more than a week time before deciding, *""Fuck it, I'll just order.""* I order 3 bottles (free shipping) and it goes well, no kinks in the website, did everything through email bank transfer. They accept the money pretty quick but I haven't been given an email notification on the process of my order. Mind you I'm not new to ordering ejuice online since I order Jedi Slayer online from DSV for roughly 8 months running. And with DSV it's pay, accept and ship off right away with a tracking number. I know each company runs a little differently but I'm feeling a little lost in the dark with HVL. To make things weirder, ever since placing my order with HVL, I kept getting emails from Microsoft saying there's been weird activity going on with the email I had placed my order on. This could just be sheer coincidence, but just pointing it out since vape ordering and weird bank/credit card activity is something we're all familiar with. (yes i've checked my bank for any fraudulent activity. there is none. yet) I'm not expecting a miracle answer here, and I'm grasping on the fact that they are indeed a brand new ejuice company based in Vancouver, and hell, for all I know, my ejuice could be on a Canada Post truck on it's way here. I just wanted to know if anyone else has ordered off of HVL too and what their experience was like. EDIT: Grammar. EDIT 2: Update. Got in touch for HVL. I have now received a tracking number. Sucks that I had to email them asking them for it though. Nevertheless, Canada Post says I'll have it by Monday. Thanks everyone for your useful input! "

After trying them out one day I went back and bought the whole line the next. It's an amazing line of juice inspired by recipes your Grandma might have made. The set comes all packed up in a nice [neat little box](URL The juices are in 30ml big top unicorn bottles with drippers which is a bit odd since they don't reach the bottom but luckily they include 5 glue bottle style tops that you can switch out. The bottles are also dark coloured but still translucent so you can see how much you got left but the dark colour should help with shelf life. They're a 25/75 pg/vg blend and I grabbed them in 3mg. On their site they're individually only available in 140ml bottles but you can buy the 30ml sample set like these as well. Here's a [look at the set](URL I picked up. Testing was done in a hobo v3.1 with a dual 26g build around 0.3 ohms and around 35-55w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Aunt Pattie's Pounded Peach Cobbler](URL (Aunt Patty has taken advantage of the peach trees in her back yard for years. From peach moonshine, to canned peaches, Aunt Patty has utilized her peaches for many things. No peach on earth is quite like ones she uses in her Pounded Peach Cobbler. Now you too can take advantage of Aunt Patty's peaches!)Right off the bat this smells fantastic, like a peach cobbler fresh out of the oven. I get a nice warm baked peach kind of taste with a just the right hint of cinnamon and a nice cobbler crust aftertaste. The flavour is a bit on the gentle side but it's oh so authentic tasting. Feels like a very well crafted juice, very clean with lots of layers of flavour. The peach and cinnamon are at the top and the cobbler/bakery taste is a bottom note that sort of lingers in your mouth. Very nice for a peach flavour! **(8/10)** **[Great GG's Buttered Muffin - Lemon Poppy Seed Muffin](URL (Passed down from generation to generation, great Grandma's recipe, written on parchment paper, still comforts the wildest of children.) When you read the name you kind of expect something else unless you notice the Lemon Poppy Seen Muffin in small print. It's not even mentioned in the description but as soon as you open the bottle you get a waft of delicious lemon poppy seed cake. My mom makes a really nice one and this reminds me of it on so many levels. The lemon is nice and bright but not overly tart or anything and you can practically taste the poppy seed and the cake. To finish it off there a nice sweetness like it's been frosted with a white icing. Just an incredible flavour. It's like they took the cake and squeezed it right in to a bottle. **(9/10)** **[Pops and cops - Strawberry rhubarb pie](URL (After a long night of drinking with the lads, Pop gets brought home by the local PD, and someone was in a world of hurt if Pop didnt come home to some Strawberry Rhubarb Pie.) This year is shaping up to be the year of the strawberry rhubarb vape. I actually tried a few of them at the expo but this was the only one I came home with. I grew up eating Strawberry rhubarb, in fact my parents have a rhubarb patch that's over 35 years old and still producing. It's a seasonal treat that takes me back to my childhood and this juice managed to capture that essence in a bottle for my personal pleasure. I mainly get a warm soft strawberry, like it's been baked to mush accompanied by a tart, almost bitter taste of rhubarb. If you've never taste the combination it's kind of hard to describe but it's amazing!! I don't get much of a pie crust from it more just the filling aspect but I can live with that since it's so very authentic tasting. Not sure that I could vape this all day but more of a way to satiate a craving or a nice after dinner treat. Just incredible! **(9/10)** **[Lick 'N' Spoon - Chocolate cream custard](URL (When you and your siblings fought over who got to lick the chocolate cake batter off the spoon. But no one ever thought about how that spoon had left welts on their asses the day before.) This one for me was the biggest let down, the others all seem so well layered and this one just kind of feels a bit flat. I get a light chocolate taste and honestly not a whole lot else. I could go one but I'm struggling with what to say. It's pleasant enough but just kind of bland. **(5/10)** **[Uncle Dixon's cider - Apple cider](URL (From moonshining, to back yard brawls with the family, no cook out was complete without Uncle Dixon's Apple Cider.) I almost wrote this one off when I first tried it. I didn't get much apple just a dry cinnamon kind of thing, like pot pourri. But it very quickly grew on me. It really reminds me of the holidays, the smell of cinnamon and spice wafting through the air an apple pie baking in the oven, it's like that but shoved in a bottle. After getting to know it a bit better it's more like a mulled apple cider, heavy on the spice but not overbearing or biting. The apple is really more of a background note in this with the spices being upfront. Turned out to be one of the more enjoyable apple cinnamon vapes I've tried. **(8/10)** ---- All around some very high marks for this line, I can't tell you enough how authentic these taste and how much I enjoy them. You can tell a lot of time and effort went in to crafting these and it's very much appreciated. If you're in to bakery type flavours there's bound to be something in here you'll enjoy!!"

While I was at CVE Toronto I had the chance to meet the gents from [Avro Eliquid Laboratories Inc.](URL I had never actually heard of them but in casual conversation it turned out that they were originally from my home town of Hamilton but had moved up to Kitchener I believe(their site still lists Hamilton). They were a very friendly bunch of guys and I got to try out some of their juice. One of the lines I tried was called [Sweet Tooth](URL a rather decent line of candy flavours. I usually don't gravitate towards candy flavours but the guys were nice and these were impressive enough that I grabbed the set of four flavours just for a review. Here are my thoughts on Sweet Tooth Ejuice. The whole line is max vg and I picked mine up in 3mg. They come in clear glass bottles with nice clean labels that sport all of the information we normally like to see. Here's [a look at the bottles](URL Testing was done in a Stumpy with a basic clapton(26/40lvni80) build around 0.4 ohms and between 35-75w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Not going to bother with official descriptions cause if you don't know what these are you've been living under a rock. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Swedish Fish](URL This was the one that reeled me in, no pun intended. It genuinely tastes like [Swedish Fish](URL to me. More importantly I don't get any weird or harsh chemical tastes from it, just the smooth clean taste of Swedish Fish. If you've never tried Swedish Fish, they taste like [BigFoot](URL gummies or [Swedish Berries](URL I've been enjoying them for years and now I can enjoy them in a vape. Probably the highest I've rated a candy flavour yet. **(8/10)** **[Skittles](URL I was never a very big [Skittles]( URL fan. I liked the tropical ones better than the original but would usually skip them altogether since I just wasn't really in to them. But I think I remember well enough what they taste like to make the comparison. These taste a lot like a mouth full of original Skittles, not one distinct flavour but a mash of citrus, berry and other flavours. Again I don't get any weird harsh or chemical taste from it, just a pleasant if not a bit mild flavour of Skittles candy. Ok so it is an artificial flavour to begin with but vaping it I don't taste anything funky. I actually enjoy this more than the actual candy but it's not likely something I will finish. **(6/10)** **[Rocket Pop](URL I'll admit, I loved [Rocket Pops](URL as a kid and still grab one from time to time when the [Dickie Dee man](URL comes around. I've got kids now so I have an excuse. So I was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately I do get something a bit odd from this, but it seems only on the first few hits and then either my mouth adjusts to it or something changes and it becomes very close to a rocket pop flavour, sweet and mild. Not sure how to describe the flavour of rocket pops but it's pretty close to a white popsicle if you've ever tried one of those. **(6.5/10)** **[Dreamsicle](URL This one I'm squarely on the fence with. I get one of two things, either a very authentic tasting orange creamsicle or a strong taste of plastic. It's so one or the other that I really couldn't enjoy it all that much as I would keep trying to focus on the weird plastic taste. But when it was 'working' I would get a very rich deep authentic tasting creamy orange flavour that just screams [Creamsicle](URL The orange flavour itself is so different from anything else I've tried but like I said it's very reminiscent of an orange Creamsicle with a thick sweet orange flavour, complimented by a nice creamy ice cream. I wanted to to give this a higher rating but that odd recurring plastic taste just irks me. **(5/10)** ---- As I mentioned I'm not really in to candy flavours so these may appeal to others a bit more than they do me. One thing that impressed me with them was they don't taste like burning sugar or harsh chemicals like most candies have tended to taste for me, just nice clean flavours, well except that plasticky weirdness I got from Dreamsicle I guess but that could just be me. So if these sound like something you might enjoy why not check them out!"
259,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Moonshiner,11,4ozc8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4ozc8k/honest_review_time_moonshiner/,2016-06-21 01:40:46,"Hey guys, While I was at CVE Toronto, I tried a line that was new to me called [Moonshiner](URL They were nice enough that I picked up the full line just for a review. I tried to find some more information but I'm pretty sure these are out of Quebec so info is limited. They seem well crafted and from what I've tasted I'd say there's no added sweetener to these but I wasn't able to confirm it anywhere. The bottles are pretty standard clear glass with droppers and nice dark labels that have all the regular info we like to see. One of them you might notice is a bit different from the others, sporting a pic of the Sopranos, it's the latest addition to the line and actually my favorite of the bunch. Here's a [closer look at the bottles](URL Testing was done in a Stumpy with a basic clapton(26/40lvni80) build around 0.4 ohms and between 35-75w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Blueberry Yum Yum](URL (Imagine a blueberry muffin comes out of the oven moist and tender, with butter !) This is a very interesting take on a bakery flavour. Rather light on blueberry and I don't really get much butter from it but the whole thing kind of grows on you. Like the more I vaped it the more I seemed to like it. The bakery flavour I get is a bit different from what I'm used to but it works and reminds me of something rather wholesome. Almost more cake like rather than muffin but still quite nice! **(7/10)** **[Dat Something](URL (American decadence at its finest. Inspired by the all-american glazed donut, its taste will leave you feeling as full as if you had eaten a couple of the gooey treats. Same rich taste, but zero calories.) I don't really get a donut from this, in fact I mostly get a rice cereal type of thing with notes of honey. I could be way off but it reminds me more of the crispy treats flavours that I've tried. Also as I mentioned I don't think they use any sweeteners so none of these have any real sweetness to them just nicely balanced flavours. It has a real old timey kind of taste to it and I have to say I quite enjoy it. It too kind of grows on you and the more I vaped it the more I seemed to enjoy it. **(8/10)** **[Moonshiner Reserve](URL (This liquid reproduces the taste of an old Quebec classic dessert. Originally produced as an afterthought It is made from leftover pie dough, butter and brown sugar, rolled like a bun and baked to a crisp. The liquid result is a creamy,buttery caramel with a hint of pie dough. A rich toffee flavour that could very well become your all day vape.) This one I had high hopes for but unfortunately it misses the mark for me. The biggest problem I have with it is a strong boozey/alcohol note that I'm pretty sure comes from a maple or maybe caramel flavour they might be using. I've tasted it before in other things and it's just awful. Even after steeping and breathing the heck out of it I still taste it. It gives it a real artificial/chemical kind of taste that just ruins it for me. Besides that there isn't much to it other than a rather rich caramel taste. If you can ignore that odd note it's not a very bad flavour but for me it's just too much to ignore to really enjoy it. **(5/10)** **[Stifler](URL (Anyone remember the American Pie movie? Now picture this hot and hearty apple pie with a touch of brown sugar and cinnamonits so good; you will want to vape it while eating ice cream!) So I'm not sure what Stifler had to do with the pie in the movie and I'm not sure why you'd really want to associate yourself with that particular pie anyway but who am I to judge!? This seems to follow the course like the others do, somewhat light on flavour and sweetness but rather nice in what it delivers. The soft baked apple flavour I get is a bit light and it's complimented with a nice gentle cinnamon and a buttery sort of crust. Very soft and mild with just a touch of dryness, probably from the cinnamon. **(7/10)** **[Stugats](URL (Nuts and cream) One of my favorite flavour combos is nuts and cream. I've tried quite a few of them as it tends to be one of the things I gravitate towards when looking for new juices. This one is hands down my favorite of this line and packs the most flavour of the bunch. It's a rich deep nutty flavour that tastes almost like roasted nuts and cream. I had a hard time picking out what the nut flavour is but it could be like hazelnut or roasted pistachio or something similar, rich and deep. This one is also very smooth with the addition of the cream that just surrounds the delicious nutty flavour that I get. Pretty much picked this one up and haven't put it down. It goes absolutely fantastic with a nice morning coffee but I'd have no problem vaping it all day either. **(9/10)** ---- All in all this is a really fantastic line, especially for those who don't like flavours that are packed with extra sweeteners and such, just well crafter flavours. So if any of these flavours appeal to you why not check them out!!"
260,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,A review a day. Day #20: Double Double by The Vaporist.,14,4p0f5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4p0f5h/a_review_a_day_day_20_double_double_by_the/,2016-06-21 05:10:57,"What's more Canadian than a beaver? A double double of course! The newest hype juice in Canadaland debuted at this year's CVE courtesy of The Vaporist. Phil was kind enough to send me some for review, don't worry receiving it for free doesn't change my opinion. &amp;nbsp; #What's in the box?! -60ml full glass bottle with dripper. -Empty 30ml (childproof) unicorn for those of us who prefer plastic. -Super awesome keychain featuring the monocle dude. #The Nitty Gritty. **Packaging** The packaging on this juice is fast removed from The Vaporist's past offerings. The box doesn't have the monocle dude at all! The front is simple and clean but there's lots of information on the back including; PG/VG ratio, flavour profile, age/poison warning, and of course Canadian awesomeness. I think boxes are usually gimmicky for juice but I do think it helps to protect the glass bottle in shipping. It's also kind of like opening a present, yay! The labels on the bottle like to stick to hand though which is a little annoying. &amp;nbsp; **The branding** There's been some contention over the fact that Double Double looks and tastes like a certain coffee company up here. (It's Tim Hortons, there I said it). Personally, I'm a fan of Weird Al and love parodies, homages, and whatnot especially when it doesn't steal customers from the original. If the juice was ""Canadian Coffee with 2 cream and sugar"", it would be the same but not as fun. &amp;nbsp; **First Impression** This juice smelled very sweet out of the mail and it had me worried as a lot of coffee flavours are too sweet. I rewicked my Tsunami (dual twisted 26g at .2 ohm), fired it up and promptly coughed and sputtered. Holy throat hit batman! I turned it down a bit and the hit mellowed out. When my SO came home, I passed it over without revealing what it was and the reaction was ""Blech, what is that?"". In his defense, we've been doing lots of fruit lately. Once he realized it was coffee, it changed to ""Mmm"". When my sister came home, I did the same and the reaction this time was ""Yum, fill my tank with that!"". She didn't care what it was, she just knew it tastes good. &amp;nbsp; **Overall impression** In my dripper the taste was decent but i was getting more of a sweet cream than a coffee flavour so I decided to do a 1 ohm build in my Simba and it really brought the coffee out! I compared it to some other coffee flavours I have and it really stands out next to Moshi and Cloud Connoisseurs. The coffee flavour is very realistic compared to the others and not overly sweet. I can actually vape it all day, the throat hit gives a nice kick in the morning just like real coffee :D The really cool thing I've noticed is that my other juices really pop when vaping alongside Double Double. It's like having a palate reset all day, which is really nice for flavours that mute quickly. We're really digging Double Double now, it's only been a week and it's almost half gone. I could do without the glass bottle personally but it makes it look more ""premium"" and if you've ever had The Vaporist's juices, you know they are quality. &amp;nbsp; #In Conclusion. This juice really shines in lower wattage and is the best coffee flavour I've had. I'm so glad the flavour matches what the box showcases because I've been let down by coffee juices so many times. Just get it for the keychain at least!

261,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,A visit to the Vaporus Laboratories in Montreal,22,4gz5vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4gz5vj/a_visit_to_the_vaporus_laboratories_in_montreal/,2016-04-29 22:35:13,"Hey guys, As some of you may know I was in beautiful Montreal last week for a work thing. While I was there I hit up a few shops and visited with some friends but most interestingly I was invited over to check out the new [Vaporus](URL offices and laboratory. How could I to say no to that considering they make [my favorite juice of all time](URL Also I know many of you are really in to seeing clean rooms and mixing stations so this could be a real treat for some of you. When first entering [the building](URL you are greeted by a very bright and clean reception area with the [Vaporus logo emblazoned on the wall](URL Since there was still a bit of work being done in that area I won't share pics of the offices themselves. Besides that's not what we're here to see. All of the technicians working in and around the lab/cleanroom have to wear hair nets/beard nets, lab coats, rubber gloves and the little blue booties that go over your shoes. I got to wear all of them too as part of the tour and was probably a little more excited about the booties than I should have been as a grown ass man. Whatever, let's check out some pics, [booties on](URL The lab and cleanroom are built to ISO7 standards and are modular so if they ever need to add/remove/adjust anything it's an easy change. The rather expensive Canadian made [juice filling/bottling machine](URL inside is capable of outputting [thousands of bottles a day](URL and while I was there I got to watch a production run that literally took minutes to finish. It grabs a bottle, fills it, [inserts the tip and screws on the lid](URL then [sticks on the label](URL and shoots it out the other end. There was a bit of setup time as they were just swapping over from a different batch but once that was done it ran like a well oiled Rube Goldberg machine and was absolutely mesmerizing to watch. They explained to me that production changes like different bottle sizes are easily accommodated and parts can be swapped out in minutes to suit their needs. Here's an official video showing [the machine in action](URL [The machine](URL has automated quality control, magically rejecting any bottles that were missing juice, a dropper tip, a lid or a label. Ok so maybe it's not magic but lasers and sensors, still it's like magic to me. They follow up with a visual QC to make sure everything is looking good and catch anything the machine may have missed, you know cause stupid machines. I also got to check out their new [3 axis industrial tumbler](URL that can homogenize a whole 5 gallon bucket in a few minutes, like a paint shaker on steroids. They also showed me some of the more mundane lab gear but I didn't grab any pics of that stuff, things like beakers and magnetic mixers. We talked quite a bit about impending regulations and their philosophy of being ready for whatever may come down the pipe regulation wise. Rather than sit idly and wait they sought to get ahead of the game and setup their own in house regulations and protocols for manufacturing, quality control, mixing, packaging etc. You can tell they are proud of what they have built there and they rightfully should be. When regulations do hit, if they're not helping to set the bar they should already be well ahead of it. Really I can't thank /u/VapingJulian, Jesus, Mathieu and the gents from Vaporus enough for the tour, it was a really cool experience to see how it all works. You guys are an amazing bunch and I for one really appreciate the work you guys are doing. Keep it up and can't wait to see what the future brings us from Vaporus!! Looking forward to seeing you all at CVE! Edit: names!"

Sorry we've been noticeably absent and I wish we weren't. Things have been a crazy grind trying to finalize these flavours in their production run and get them suitable to share but we're finally here! URL We are launching our newest additions to our signature line at CVE this year for people to come by and check out. But don't worry if you can't make it out you can still benefit. During the launch of these new flavours we will be offering a **FREE SAMPLE PACK OF THE NEW SIGNATURE FLAVOURS** with every order over $20! This way you can get a favourite like L'Anse Amour or Ice Berry and still try *all* of our newest signature flavours! &amp;nbsp; We've spent a long time developing these flavours, too long really as a few of our insiders can relate. We've been watching what people are saying about other flavours trying to recreate magic and aim in a direction we think you guys will find exciting. I can without any hesitation say these are our best flavours yet and we've been sitting on pins and needles trying to push them out! &amp;nbsp; I'll do a quick break down here for you guys so you know what you can expect: &amp;nbsp; -------- **MS MUFFET** is a warm cinnamon apple muffin. Like many fellow vapers households, The Muffin Man sweeped through our shop also. But we felt it wasn't quite right and more than anything the price point wasn't something we could sustain to keep ordering! What started out as a personal pet project turned quickly into a favourite of ours that we developed into a full signature of our own. -------- **POLAR BEAR** is a chocolatey thin mint cookie. There's two things that always take way too much effort to get right in a vape, chocolate, and mint. Both flavours have the risk of overpowering each other and having them blend together is a goal we've been chasing since we started. I'm very proud of this flavour that blends the best of both with a familiar cookie crunch. -------- **NAHANNI** is a smooth cherry tobacco, with subtle floral and caramel notes. I think to most people tobacco flavours are something they've left behind. We wanted to make tobacco a mainstream flavour again that anyone can enjoy. We took our favourite parts of tobacco with it's rich bold smoothness and wrapped it in a subtle cherry brightness. Don't be afraid of its identity, Nahanni is a flavour we're confident anyone can enjoy. -------- **RED WEDDING** is a raspberry doughnut paired with yogurt. There's been two things dominating vaping in recent months, doughnuts and yogurt. This flavour is what I'm personally the most excited to release. For fruit and dessert lovers it has a perfect blend of sweetness and richness that sit on your tongue in perfect harmony. If you're a fan of doughnuts, raspberry, or yogurt, take my word for it and give it a go. -------- **MOSSBACK** is a warm kentucky bourbon. We've seen a lot of success recently with alcohol flavoured vapes and we think that this trend is going to only get bigger. This flavour has been finalized since our last signature release but we had trouble locking down reliable suppliers for the ingredients required to make it. It's our oldest of the new line and has been my tried and true late night vape. -------- &amp;nbsp; These flavours are included in 5ml sizes with any order over $20. We do not use any sweeteners in our flavours and are very proud of that fact. You can find our new line [here](URL or if you're new our expanded line is viewable [here](URL . As always we have $6 flat rate shipping across Canada, and you can save some money with our [bundle pricing](URL if you think any of them will be a winner for you. We hope you enjoy these flavours and we're excited to see all of you out at the CVE! Stop by our booth to say hello and give 'em a try!"
270,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Review of Overkast E-Liquid,7,4j4e7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4j4e7c/review_of_overkast_eliquid/,2016-05-13 13:03:45,"I was gloating about my new vapemail from Overkast on the CVE GroupMe chat when /u/MajorVapes and /u/JoeVapes encouraged me to put up a review here and JuiceDB. Despite that encouragement, this is my first public review ever, so don't expect it to be of the same high quality as MajorVapes. First, a little about me: I live in Toronto and have been vaping for about 7 years now (I forget how long exactly, but I started when the 510 cig-alikes were a shiny new thing). I'm currently using a Horizon Arctic subtank at 0.25 ohms on a Coolfire IV Plus at 30-40 watts. All the liquids below are 1.5mg nicotine. **Lou** - named after the drink Caribou Lou, it's a combination of pineapple, coconut, and rum. I've never had that particular drink, but it sounds a lot like a pina colada, which I am very fond of. I find the liquid to be a perfect mix of all three flavours, with very a very natural and powerful pineapple taste. The coconut flavour comes out more on the exhale and the rum rounds it out perfectly. This works really well as either an adv or an occasional treat. **9/10** **Glitch** - a combination of fresh strawberry and kiwi on a cream base. Over the years, I've tried a whole bunch of strawberry flavours, but nothing comes even close to this. The strawberry is rich and full, and makes me feel like I'm eating freshly cut plump strawberries straight from the field. The cream base doesn't taste creamy to me, but helps add body to the flavour. I don't notice the kiwi flavour very much, but kiwi isn't as bold as strawberry to begin with. I can adv this, but there are times where it feels a little too rich. **9/10** **Cran Tang Clan** - cranberries and tangerine. This is the weakest of the four flavours, in my opinion, but it's still really tasty. It's not as pronounced as the others, and I don't really get much cranberry from it. The tangerine taste is spot on, and doesn't taste artificial at all. It works great as a mellow adv. **8/10** **RCT** - Raspberry Chai Tea. I don't normally drink tea, so I figured this would be my least favourite of the lot. Boy, was I wrong! I've never had a flavour that I enjoyed this much, with the possible exception of Sweet Unicorn Farts from MEO. The dominant flavour in RCT is a spiced black chai tea which I (probably wrongly) describe as an Earl Grey. The raspberry adds a hint of sweetness and tart to the flavour. RCT reminds me of Kashmiri Chai, which is a fantastic concoction of black tea, various spices, and condensed milk. I not only find myself all day vaping this, I will often crack open the bottle just to smell the delicious aroma. **10/10** One other thing I want to add is that the customer service I've received from Overkast has been fantastic. They've thrown in extra 30ml bottles of their flavours on all of my orders with the exception of my first order, which was their sample pack. They even threw in a sweet drip tip on one order. I've also messaged them a few times on facebook with questions, and received a response within minutes. **Edit:** Here's a pic of the very cool bottles: URL"

Win a free mod!,6,4j6elk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4j6elk/going_to_cve_win_a_free_mod/,2016-05-13 23:51:56,"**UPDATE** Every giveaway will have different times, starting at 1. Times will be shown below next to the giveaway listed. Hey everyone, so as most of us know Canada's Vape Expo is this weekend. I'm really excited for it since last year's Vapecan was a lot of fun, so this year I thought I'd give back to the community to spread the fun! Since there will be vendors selling hardware, I didn't want to take that away from them and give away things on behalf of my youtube channel, so I'll be giving different things away through different vendors that I know and support. Additionally I'm aware of the fact that any giveaways must be sealed, that means I'm limited to what I can provide (I don't have that much stuff!) Now that's out of the way, what are the prizes and how do you win? 1:00pm First up is for **That Good Eliquid**, they will be located as soon as you walk through the door at the **Ecig Flavourium** booth. In order to win you must be the first person to buy a bottle of their new flavour **Mango/Tea** and mention either my reddit name or the WackedOutEcig youtube channel. **Prize: iJoy Asolo 200w** 2:00pm Next up is for one of my favourite Canadian Eliquid companies **Twelve Monkeys**. In order to win you must be the first person to both buy either **O-rangz** (my favourite) or something from their new line... I recommend **Bonogurt** and mention my name/the channel. **Prize: Freemax Starre Pro** 3:00pm Next is for another Eliquid company that I'm a big fan of called **MEO/Mother Earth Organics**, their launching **Crisp + Milk** at CVE so like the others, the winner will be the first to buy a bottle and mention my name/the channel. **Prize: iJoy Reaper Tank** 4:00pm Finally is not for an eliquid company, but for **Definitive Coils**. Mark at Definitive is a really amazing coil builder from Toronto and even though I don't vape those really intense coils a lot, I'm a big fan and appreciator of his work. In order to win you have to buy a set of any of his coils, which he'll install for free on the spot, and mention my name/channel. Mark has generously offered to provide some extra Definitive swag for another giveaway that'll probably be on the youtube channel after CVE. **Prize: Freemax Scylla tank, with clapton coil and rta coil** Obviously I'd love to giveaway through every vendor I support, but I just don't have that much **sealed** gear to giveaway. While I'm here I may as well give you some heads up on other vendors to check out though: **Hazetown Vapes** - They'll have some great gear and eliquids like Lane Cove Vapor, POH and Cooley's. **Kloud Panda** - Try out their new flavours from the LVL2 line, the donut is my favourite. Also from their OG line try Winterstrike if you're a fan of chocolate/mint! **Cold Turkey** - Mistress Eleanor.. nuff said. **416 Vapes** They're launching the Danish Rolls, I haven't tried it yet, but they'll be at the Ecig Flavourium booth too so you may as well try it... knowing 416 and their new lines I'm sure I'll like it. There are so many more that I could mention, but I need to get to work so that's it for now. Have a great weekend everyone and I look forward to seeing everyone at CVE! **Please limit your winnings to one per person, I understand that everyone wants more and more gear, but let's make it fair for everyone.** **ALL GIVEAWAYS WILL START ON SATURDAY** "

275,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Free Starter kit at CVE?,6,4j7ifo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4j7ifo/free_starter_kit_at_cve/,2016-05-14 03:49:45,Was on the CVE website and saw they are giving away free starter kits when throwing in a pack of darts. Now I am analog free but figured it would be a great way to get my parents each a starter kit (wife and I would throw a pack in each). Each parent is probably a pack and a half a day smoker. Does anyone have any details on this? Would this be scamming if there is a legit purpose? Any input or opinions would be great.

I got a FREE Ego AIO for trading in my smokes, tried a million juices and even bought a few. I just wanted to thank you all for giving me the encouragement to go. I'm glad I did! Hey everyone! I'm a LOOONG-time lurker and finally ready to make the transition away from smoking. I was at a store today, ready to buy my starter kit, when the guy mentioned that I might want to hold off and check out CVE this weekend, although he wasn't sure if there would be much hardware for sale there. I'd love to pick up my starter kit there and a bunch of juices to sample, especially if it saves me money in the long run. The way he made it sound, it would be worth the savings I would get in discounts and samples on juice, which would be my main reason for going. But I'm wondering if I belong there, because even if I bought my kit at the expo, I don't think I'd be able to use it right away (right? because I'd have to charge the battery?). I'm worried that I won't be able to sample the juices because I don't have my own ecig, and I'd feel embarrassed to explain to every vendor why I can't try their juice, or that I don't know what they're talking about. I did hear that they're giving away starter kits, but I figure that's more for the tagalongs. Would anyone actually be selling starter kits there? So, do you guys think that CVE would be a good starting point for a total beginner? Or do you think it would be a bit intimidating, especially for someone without any gear. Thanks so much!"

Yesterday I dragged her to CVE with me and to my surprise she took to it pretty fast, tried probably more juice than I did and picked herself up some 0mg juice. When she saw the rose gold Crown tank and asked about it, I just instinctively bought it for her and gave her my spare evic VT I had in my pocket. But now I need to get her her own mod. But not sure what to get in terms of boxes with LiPos built in. She has seen the propaganda about exploding batteries and wants a built in. I'm looking for max 40w (can be higher but doesn't matter) and something between 2000mah-4000mah internal. Now I know she will also want something that looks really nice preferably black she asked. I tried looking through fasttech and got overwhelmed BONUS: would be great if the same vendor also had a sigelei 213 and obviously a reddit couple. Thank you all for your help. "

F U. That is all.

There were a lot of deals to be found though, and I got 500 mls of juice for $80, which is not too shabby. I also have a lifetime supply of vape bands, so that's good, I guess. Gangster clouds had the coolest looking booth with the poker table and 1930s speakeasy vibe. There were a lot of Qubcois vendors there trying to get some Ontario customers because they can't ship to their own province. That's pretty fucked up, and I felt bad for them because the ones I spoke to seemed like nice people. I hope their businesses can survive. I was disappointed in the lack of hardware. I was looking to buy a mod, but there weren't many options, and the few that were there weren't priced great. The highlight of the event was finally meeting the legendary Phil from the Vaporist. He is as nice a guy as I imagined, as were the other guys working his booth. I also want to thank Mark at Vapor North for being awesome, and the young lady at the Vaporus booth who patiently dripped all of their flavours for me until I settled on some PB and Jealous. In the end, I'm glad I went. I didn't get as much free stuff as last year, but it was still a good time, and I have enough juice to last me a while. "
284,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot: Double Double by TheVaporist,20,4jljge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4jljge/honest_one_shot_double_double_by_thevaporist/,2016-05-17 00:58:39,"Hey guys, I really couldn't wait to get to this one, plus it looks like I've got some friendly competition round here, so I better keep them coming, *ahem* looking at you /u/coolloser ;) We all know and love Phil /u/TheVaporist, well this past weekend at CVE Toronto he launched a new flavour that he's been working on. It's called Double Double and it's an homage to a Canadian staple, a Tim Horton's double double coffee. While some of us might feel that the packaging and branding is a bit on the cheeky side, I for one think it looks amazing. This seems a real departure from anything [TheVaporist](URL has done in the past but he seems to have tackled it with the same attention to detail and quality as everything else he's done. The 60ml brown glass bottle comes in a beautiful cardboard box artfully designed to have a familiar if not a little cheeky, brown and red look. In the box you get the bottle of juice, a 30ml unicorn bottle and a really cool key chain emblazoned with TheVaporists new revised logo. I got it in 3mg and I'm pretty sure the ratio is 30/70 pg/vg/ Here's a look at the [fancy pants packaging](URL Testing was done in a hobo v3.1 with a dual 26g build around 0.3 ohms and around 35-55w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official description not needed for this one. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **[Double Double](URL Ok so full disclosure I did get to try this in it's early stages and I have to say it's really really come in to it's own. When I first tasted it maybe a couple months back, all I got from it was dirty coffee grinds and sugar, now it's become a full bodied tribute to our nations favourite morning drink. Now you'll probably ask, does it taste exactly like a Tim's!? Well that sort of depends, I know that if I go to every Tim's in town and get a double double from each one they'll all taste slightly different. Hell I could go to the same Tim's several times in one day and have a different experience each time. Different water, different temperatures, varying performance of their SureShot dispensing machines, all of these things play part in creating a perfect and ""consistent"" cup. On top of that each person's idea of a perfect double double might vary slightly, some preferring more cream, some more sugar etc. etc. What I do get from it, is a rather satisfying medium roast coffee blended with a rich cream and a perfect hit of sweetness. I also pick up little notes of vanilla or something like that, but the actual coffee flavour in this is one of the most authentic I've tried. It tastes like real coffee! I'm pretty sure it has something to do with him using a unique method to extract the flavour from real coffee beans. He didn't offer much there detail wise but that's the gist of it that I got. I love coffee vapes and this is one of the first ones that's been just a basic double double coffee and not some blend of nuts, caramel, Bavarian cream etc. It's a rather nice departure from pretty much all the others on the market, at least the ones I've tried and it basically checks all the boxes for me!! **(10/10)** ---- I'm pretty sure this is the first 10/10 for Phil, from me at least and I really hope to see more like this from him in the future. I actually spent quite a bit of time hanging out with Phil and his crew at the convention this past weekend and I can honestly say I don't think I've ever met a nicer bunch of guys, so thank you Phil for being our official redditor meet up place, for this amazing juice and for just all around being an awesome guy.

This reg pretty much bans another CVE right off the bat once it comes into force. &gt; (1) No person shall, in any place where electronic cigarettes are sold or offered for sale, display or permit the display of electronic cigarettes in any manner that would permit a consumer to view or handle an electronic cigarette before purchasing it. &gt;Promotion &gt; (2) No person shall promote electronic cigarettes, &gt;(a) in any place where electronic cigarettes or tobacco products are sold or offered for sale; or &gt;(b) in any manner, if the promotion is visible from outside a place in which electronic cigarettes or tobacco products are sold or offered for sale.

289,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: X/O and MunCheez by eMixologies,14,4k36pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4k36pf/honest_review_time_xo_and_muncheez_by_emixologies/,2016-05-20 02:06:02,"Hey guys, So I had a chance to meet our very own /u/emixologies at CVE this past weekend. I couldn't afford his whole line so I asked him if he had the choice what juices of his would he want reviewed. He pointed me to the X/O Eau de Vape line and Mun Cheez. A few people asked about the Mun Cheez so I thought I would do both and knock this one out first. The [X/O bottles](URL are actually quite nice, slightly frosted and the x and o letters are cut out which gives it a very cool look where you can see the juice through the front. The labels also feel a bit plasticky so they'll likely hold up to a bit of juice spillage. The also have all the good info we like to see. I picked them up in 2.5mg and found the ratio listed as 25/75 pg/vg. The [Mun Cheez bottle](URL on the other hand comes in a dark hard plastic bottle with glue bottle style top which makes it great for dripping but filling certain tanks will be a pain. This was available in 3mg but I couldn't readily find the ratio as it's just newly released and not available anywhere I could find. Testing was done in a Stumpy with a dual fused clapton(2x26/40lvni80) build around 0.18 ohms and between 45-75w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. ---- **[X](URL (Honeydew and fresh-picked blueberries, drowned in light french vanilla) I didn't really get a taste of this one at the expo but I figured if it was being suggested I would grab it anyway. I'm a big fan of honey dew flavours and I've tried a lot of them, this one sadly doesn't quite do it for me though. I almost feel as though the champagne of X made it's way in to this one as there is a little bit of an alcohol/chemical taste that I get from it. It feels a bit thin. As far as blueberries and french vanilla go they are pretty much overwhelmed by the honey dew or whatever it is that gives it a somewhat strong taste. I even coughed a bit after the first few hits but that seemed to calm down quickly. **(6/10)** **[O](URL (Watermelon-infused champagne, complimented by a handful of watermelon candies.) If this was described as a watermelon bubblegum, it would be dead accurate but watermelon-infused champagne is a bit of a stretch. The main flavour I get is a candy flavoured watermelon more along the lines of a bubblegum. I don't get any champagne taste from it at all and the candies I'm pretty sure are what give it that bubblegum quality. If you don't get hung up on the description then this is actually a fantastic watermelon flavour, possibly one of the better ones I've tried. I'll definitely be enjoying this with the warm weather coming as it's super refreshing and quite reminiscent of summer. Also no odd chemical taste or anything like that from this one. **(8/10)** **MunCheez**(Oreo infused cream cheese cups) Ok here's another one that the description didn't quite match what I'm tasting but I'm not even mad. This one I was really expecting a creamy Oreo type flavour but what I'm actually getting is more reminiscent of my big sister's [grasshopper pie](URL It's like creme de menthe meets Oreos in a creamy green pie of deliciousness. This pretty much captures the essence of that pie and shoves it in to a bottle. It's a bit on the rich side but not so rich you can't vape it all day. I don't even like mint but that pie is one of those exceptions and now so is this liquid. The mint in it is mild, like very mild, just enough to give it that creamy minty taste with the Oreo flavour sort of sprinkled in the background. If you've never tried the pie please do and if this sounds like something you'd like check the juice out!! **(9/10)** ---- [eMixologies site](URL is apparently down right now but I've linked to another site where you can at least get the X/O. I have to say I was quite happy with these even despite the possibly confusing descriptions. If you get the chance make sure you check them out. So thanks /u/eMixologies and it was a pleasure to meet you!! "

292,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: I can't believe it's not donuts!,10,4esfe5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4esfe5/honest_review_time_i_cant_believe_its_not_donuts/,2016-04-15 04:03:32,"Hey guys, Donuts have been making a big splash in the vaping industry lately and I've certainly been enjoying a few of them. I saw a deal on the full set of '[I can't believe it's not donuts!](URL line, one of the latest from [Premium Labs](URL and I just couldn't resist. So of course I'm going to share my thoughts with you all! I picked them up in my usual 3mg and I believe they are all max vg at 75%. The bottles came packed in a [cardboard box ](URL that looked rather nice. The bottles are brown glass with decent droppers and the labels are rather colourful and contain all the usual necessary info. Here's what the [bottles look like](URL Testing was done in a hobo v3.1 with a dual 26g build around 0.3 ohms and around 35-55w. I also ran them in a griffin rta and a reaper plus. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Gala Royale** (Caramel crunch apple pie fritter) This is quite possibly my favorite apple flavour of any kind. It's lightly sweet with a nice caramel flavour, a touch of cinnamon but it doesn't have an overbearing apple taste like most things apple flavoured tend to have. It's like a really nice apple pie slathered in caramel and turned in to a donut,,, or fritter I guess. I haven't found an apple flavour yet that doesn't wear on me really quickly and with this I actually cleared the bottle before I got to the review. Tbh I cleared almost all of them they are that good. The donut flavour isn't over powering either and doesn't give me that weird play doh taste that many others tend to do. Easily and adv for me! **(9/10)** **King Kong** (Cinnamon sugar maple dip banana donuts) While I found the maple was rather subdued I do get a really nice cinnamon banana flavour with that ever present and familiar sweet donut flavour. The banana is somewhere in between candy and real, sort of on the soft side but the maple comes off almost like the caramel in Gala Royale, just adding more sweetness. Rich and sweet but not cloyingly. Another one that I could easily vape all day and another one that I emptied before the review. **(8/10)** **Blue Steel** (Powdered donuts stuffed to the max with sweet blueberries and jelly) This was my least favorite of the bunch and the only near full bottle I have left of the set. Maybe it's just me but I find blueberry just doesn't work that well with donut flavours, too bad since I love blueberries. The blueberry in this is strong and reminds me a bit of those POM juices and not so much a jelly filling. The donut taste pretty much takes a back seat to the bb flavour, it's still there just not the focus. I get the powdered sugar which provides the sweetness but it just doesn't work for me like the other donuts do. **(6/10)** **Dohz Nutz** (Caramel dipped donut topped with a blend of mixed nuts and filled with creamy peanut butter) The description on this one is a bit convoluted but at the same time it's not too far off. It's very rich with the sweet donut flavour just dominating but you still get nice hints of caramel, cinnamon, nuts and maybe some peanut butter. While a bit on the decadent side I still really enjoyed it and could adv it with ease. This entire line is rather sweet but not so much that it ruins it for me. **(9/10)** **The Duke** (Cinnamon sugar earl grey infused donut rolled in light cinnamon sugar dipped in a light vanilla glaze) By far my favorite out of the bunch and very different from the mainstream donuts. It combines that familiar sweet cinnamon donut flavour with a rather burgamot(citrus) heavy Earl Grey tea flavour. The black tea flavour sits back a bit but definitely comes through and brings a whole new element to this donut flavour. The cinnamon is also a bit subdued in this but it allows that lovely Earl Grey flavour to shine through. By the time I got around to writing this I'd already grabbed another bottle as a treat. **(10/10)** ---- For some reason I passed these by at CVE, I think it was cause Phil /u/TheVaporist was watching me from across the aisle but in hind sight I kind of regret not trying them sooner. Nearly the entire line is wonderful and well worth trying out at least once. One thing I should mention that as sweet as they are I didn't experience a lot of coil gunking and was running several tanks through the griffin or reaper+ before needing a rewick. In other news I'm heading to Montreal tomorrow so I might not have a review up next week but will get one posted as soon as I'm back. Also I plan on checking out a number of shops while there so I'll likely have some new lines for the queue!!"

No way we'd release the website like that haha! Hey Guys! Sorry been so busy lately and haven't been on reddit too much. As very, very few of you know, and mostly because I preferred keeping it on the down low until I get the ball rolling properly, We're an ejuice manufacturer. We focus a lot more on wholesaling to shops, and our prices are pretty much brick and mortar prices, except we do have 60mls for 29.99-34.99, which is considered on the more affordable side of things for physical retail points. We have many upcoming lines, ranging from the affordable max VG to the most upscale of mixologies. I just wanted to quickly introduce my company, as well as invite you to come see us at booth 132 at the upcoming CVE in toronto if you wanna see for yourself what we're all about! We also have some cool giveaways on our facebook page every time we release a new line (there's one right now, you can participate until May 1st!). You can find our page at facebook.com/emixologies. We also have a cool little promo video we've put together to present our latest line: XO Premium Eau de Vape. The Contest is on the same post with the video mentioned above. Anyhow, all of you guys who are going to the CVE, We want to see you guys pass by and say hi! As for our website on which we've been working on lately, we'd like to know your opinion/feedback on its looks/navigation, the flavor descriptions, etc. Please note product pictures haven't been uploaded yet (but you can find them on our FB page) and the free shipping over 50$ is not correct, we just put it temporarily to see how the slider will look. Also, if some of you guys do some wholesale and could let me know what you think about our wholesale text, it would be awesome! Our pre-release website can be accessed at ug-mixologies.myshopify.com by entering the temporary password: sijewb . As I've mentioned earlier, I'm very unfamiliar with online retail. My specialty's always been the manufacturing and wholesale to shops, so all feedback is appreciated :) Thanks in advance to all of those who bothered reading through this wall of text haha."

295,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: A handful of Darkside Creations,15,468yl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/468yl2/honest_review_time_a_handful_of_darkside_creations/,2016-02-18 01:49:32,"Hey guys, [DSV](URL has been on my list to do for quite some time. I was able to pick up a handful of them at CVE Montreal last year. A couple of them were purchased, while the 10ml samples were received for free at the show. If you've never heard of DSV they're a Canadian Company that offers a lot of flavours and options on their juice. All five flavours were picked up in 3mg and come in their DSV Blend which is a max vg with no pg added according to their site. They offer a couple of different pg/vg ratio options, DSV Blend and DSV Boosted, both are max vg but Boosted has an extra flavour shot. The bottles are dark plastic with clean looking labels that have all the usual information. Here's a look at [the bottles](URL Tasting was done in a derringer with a dual 26g build at 0.3 ohms around 35-45w. Using Puff cotton, rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **G-Money** (A beautifully smooth vanilla custard with a slight caramel finish) I had heard about G-Money many times on Reddit and other places. Being a custard lover when the chance presented itself I just had to try it. What can I say about it!? It's a custard, a vanilla custard and a pretty standard one at that. I wasn't blown away nor way I terribly disappointed. It's sort of right in the middle to me, it's not the greatest but it's not bad at all either. The vanilla is the main focus like most custards, the custardy/eggy taste is subtle if at all. I do get that hint of caramel but it too is very subtle. Overall a pretty basic custard vape. **(7/10)** **Jedi Slayer** (This is a nice play on a classic chocolate peanut butter flavour. Not crazy sweet but full bodied and creamy with a light banana finish.) I was pleasantly surprised by this one as I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. The chocolate does have a bit of an artificial kind of taste to it and reminds me of that chocolate syrup kind of flavour I've tasted in others before. The peanut butter is a bit mild in this as it has to contend with that rich chocolate taste. The banana in it though is pretty good and doesn't taste too fake or like candy nor is it overpowering at anytime. It's one of their most popular juices and I can kind of see why. **(8/10)** **Blue Raspberry** (A sweet blue raspberry flavour that will take you back to yesteryear) I was not a fan of this at all. It tastes very artificial and had a bit of harshness to it. It also tasted a bit dry and for lack of better words, bitter. Like I could taste the vg in it. The flavour was just too weak but what I got wasn't that pleasant and a little too artificial. Not much else to say about this one. **(3/10)** **Clearly Kings** (It is the candied watermelon flavour that all the others try to be) I believe this was an attempt at a clear version of their King's Cream which is actually pretty decent. However this one to me leans more towards a candy watermelon flavour. Like a watermelon jolly rancher but not quite. There is definitely a bit of artificialness going on with this one and I got a similar feel from it as the Blue Raspberry but it tasted just a bit better. **(4/10)** **Wild Child** (just like your favorite energy drink) This stuff smelled kind of like sweet tarts and has a rather artificial cherry?/fruit kind of thing going on. Much more pleasant than the last two but still not something I really enjoy. I don't like energy drinks so I didn't really expect to like this one much but it was at least a bit better. I'm sure if you like energy drinks this might actually appeal to you. **(4/10)** ---- DSV is one of those companies that has a bajillion flavours and even if you don't like any of these I'm sure they'll have at least one flavour that works for you. They've been around for quite a while too so why not check them out!!"
296,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Plante Vape,10,471lii,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/471lii/honest_review_time_planète_vape/,2016-02-23 03:30:54,"Hey guys or should I say Salut les gars, This one's pretty much going to be only for our friends in Qubec because of a certain stupid law. I don't think these will be available to anyone outside the province, at least not at this point. It's a line I believe called 'Thriller' that I picked up at CVE Montral last year by a company called [Plante Vape](URL Like I said while this won't be very helpful to most folks here I still like to support our friends in Qubec who got the shaft from their ignorant a-hole of a health minister and law 44. I wasn't able to confirm the pg/vg ratio but they seem rather thick so I'm guessing they are max vg or somewhere around 20/80 pg/vg. I got the whole line in 3mg and they came in nice dark coloured glass bottles with decent drippers. The labels contain all the usual info we like to see and the designs have a nice clean look to them. Here's what [the bottles](URL look like. Testing was done in a derringer with a dual 26g fused clapton build around 0.2 ohms and around 35-55w. Using Puff cotton, rda rinsed and rewicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Godfather** (honeyed cigar) If you like honey flavours or blended tobaccos that aren't strong on the tobacco flavour like SY4 from SZ you might really enjoy this. This is primarily a honey flavour with just a hint of tobacco. There's an almost smokey/spiced kind of feel to it sort of like a Milk and Honey but substitute the milk for a mild dry tobacco. A rather simple flavour with the focus being on that golden honey flavour. I have a friend who really enjoys it but it's just a bit too simple for me. **(7/10)** **Black Monster** (raspberries and blackberries) For me the raspberry came out strong on this with the blackberries sort of leaving a lingering taste in my mouth. Very pleasant and soft this one was surprisingly good for a berry mix. The blackberries give it a bit of a bitter or tart kind of taste which also goes well with the raspberry. The thing with being a bit tart is it tends to make it feel a bit dry at times. Not something I would see myself reaching for regularly but a nice change when craving something with berries. **(7.5/10)** **Paranoya Punch** (berrylicious flavour with a touch of citrus) When I first tried these I didn't have the official descriptions and I was convinced there was some papaya, mango or something similar in this. It has a very slight tropical kind of taste to it. I'm guessing it's the blend of berries and citrus that do it. There's also something else that's rather familiar in it but I wasn't able to put my finger on it, reminded me of an SZ flavour. It's pretty tasty but not something I could vape all day myself as I'm not a fan of indistinct fruit flavours. **(6/10)** **Exoshake** (creamy banana explosion) It's definitely creamy and banana but the banana is a bit different. You taste it but it's not all you get, it's blended in with maybe a hint of something else I can't describe. Sometimes it reminds me of those Milk To Go, the banana flavoured ones other times it's more indistinct and comes off as a sort of creamy fruit blend. It's like a slightly artificial banana shake but not so much fake candy flavour, more like the banana flavoured amoxicillin you got as a kid for ear infections or whatever. I've had a hard time deciding if I really like this one or not but in the end I think I do. One thing I did really enjoy with this one was the aftertaste, a light lingering taste of banana milk!! **(8/10)** **Killer Baby** (rainbow of creamy cereal flavours) This is quite possibly one of the best cereal flavours I've tried. I tend to like the milky/creamy cereal flavours the best and this one definitely delivers. Super creamy/milky and the berry flavour notes are light and sweet. There isn't a strong citrus flavour and the cereal notes are pretty much perfect. I find it more leans towards the berry crunch type of cereal and not so much the loops which I also tend to prefer. Super smooth and creamy and all day material for me. Too bad I won't be able to get this on the regular. **(9.5)** ---- I was tempted to write this whole thing in Frenglish/Franglais but ultimately resisted the urge... So if you live in Qubec or close to it I'd have no issues recommending you check these out. The whole line is smooth and soft with no nasty harshness or chemical tastes. While the flavours are somewhat common they're just a bit different from the usual ones that I've tasted to set them apart."
297,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Fables by Straight Up Vapours Inc.,10,3zkz2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/3zkz2v/honest_review_time_fables_by_straight_up_vapours/,2016-01-06 03:50:28,"Hey guys, Here's a line called [Fables](URL I grabbed while at CVE last year. It's made by a company called [Straight Up Vapours Inc](URL out of British Columbia. They have a fun and interesting theme to them all centered around various fables and fairy tales. I got the line for free with the purchase of another juice and they came in 3mg. I couldn't find a mention of the pg/vg ratio but they seemed decently thick so my guess would be from 70-80% vg. They came in nice unicorn bottles that are 30ml if I'm not mistaken. The labels were a bit cutoff but looks like they had all the necessary info and the graphics were fantastic. Here's a look at the [bottles](URL Testing was done in a Chrysalis rda using a dual 26g build around 0.3ohms, puff cotton rinsed and rewicked between flavours. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Emperor Dragon** (Fresh pured dragon fruit topped with frozen pomme seeds) There's a certain vendor around here that makes a really fantastic dragon fruit vape, this one might just give him a little run for his money. It's got a similar fresh dragon fruit taste but a little extra something. The frozen pomme seeds in the description couldn't be more accurate. It's not mint, it's not quite coolada it's a cool refreshing yet light taste of apple that seems to intertwine with the dragon fruit. It really adds to that fresh feeling of the juice yet is nice and mild leaving the dragon fruit forward. **(8/10)** **Leprechaun** (Ripe golden pineapple candy) Probably the most disappointing of the bunch. I've enjoyed a few pineapple vapes lately and was looking forward to trying this one. Unfortunately I just found it too weak on flavour. What flavour it had was good, like a pineapple gummy candy but again it was much too mild for me to enjoy it. It could also stand to be a tiny bit sweeter as it's supposed to be a candy vape. Ultimately to me it felt like it was watered down with too much vg. **(5/10)** **Lil Red** (Strawberry gazpacho with watermelon wedges and dusted with fresh cocoa powder.) Not sure what to say about this one other than wow. I get a blend of strawberry and watermelon, kind of playing off each other. Mainly I get strawberry but it's sort of freshened up with the water melon. The dusting of cocoa is very subtle but definitely there, it adds a sort of richness over the whole thing but not a chocolate taste, just a hint of, well cocoa. I normally steer clear of straight strawberry flavours but this was a very pleasant surprise. **(9/10)** **Mr. Clause** (A pured melody of orchard picked fruits blended with cactus juice) This one to me was a blend of soft apple and pear but with a hint of something a little exotic like,,, cactus juice. If you've ever had an Aloe drink you'll probably be familiar with the flavour and will likely enjoy something like this. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the cactus was the main focus cause as is it's a little too much like an apple juice. Still very nice but not something I'd go nuts for. **(7/10)** **Tooth Fairy** (Chocolate mousse with an orange zest.) If you were my friend and you gave me a Terry's chocolate orange for Xmas I would probably punch you in the mouth. I absolutely hate the combination of chocolate and orange. But in order to be fair, I took one for the team and tucked in to this atrocity of a juice and was awarded with a rather pleasant surprise. It's actually pretty damn good! I mean it won't change my view on a Terry's chocolate orange but darn it if I wasn't completely taken back by how 'not bad' it was. The chocolate flavour was wonderful, not that fake gold coin taste I get from a lot of chocolate ejuices I've tried but a rather nice milk chocolate kind of thing. The orange is very mild so it only seemed to freshen the things up and not kill it with an overbearing taste of orange zest. Again, not something I would run to but now not something I would run away from either. **(7.5/10)** **Yeti** (Traditional after dinner mint.) Ok story time. When I was a little kid I once stole a box of After Eight dinner mints from my mom and hid in a closet and ate the whole thing. It made me so sick I was never able to eat anything chocolate/mint ever again without feeling nauseous or getting a head ache. Still to this day I avoid mint like it's the plague, not that I hate the flavour, it's just a fear that it will make me sick or cause a head ache that keeps me away. Sometimes just the smell of mint gum is enough to bring on some brain pain. Fast forward to this beauty that I got, or course I had to try it. I loaded it up and braced myself and was immediately rewarded with that taste that I had once loved so very long ago. Like a York peppermint patty or an After Eight dinner mint, it was,,,,,,, absolutely wonderful. Why had I waited so long!? This juice too has a very pleasant milk chocolate kind of taste but replace the orange with a mild mint and well you get this, like I said,,, beauty. **(8/10)** ---- All in all I really enjoyed these juices, they have a fun theme, the flavours are fairly unique and I quite enjoyed tasting all of them. If these sound appealing to you why not check them out, just remember that taste is subjective and results will vary!!"
298,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest one shot and some news: Vaporus,10,40mnqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/40mnqh/honest_one_shot_and_some_news_vaporus/,2016-01-13 01:38:14,"Hey guys, So I was lucky enough to try out a new flavour from Vaporus recently but was asked not to discuss it yet. Well it's finally time but first a bit of news! As many of you probably know our friends in Quebec where hit hard with this law 44 crap, no advertising, no social media, treating ecigs exactly like tobacco, basically a full blackout for the province. It's such a shame because some of my favorite vendors come out of Quebec and this has only made things more difficult. However I think this is a great opportunity for us as a community to help out. Maybe we can't do much but it would still be nice if we could post and share as much news about Quebec and it's vendors as possible to help them out, since they aren't allowed to anyway. Things like sales, new product alerts, new locations or anything really would be helpful to both us as customers and the vendors living in Quebec. I'm in Ontario so it doesn't directly affect me but it has already affected my ability to do some of my reviews, a number of the juices I picked up at CVE Montreal I can't even look up or share a link to anymore because of this stupid law. Well I've heard through the grapevine that the good folks over at Vaporus are opening a new store in Gatineau this weekend and launching this new flavour. They've also got some amazing deals if you're in the Gatineau area Jan 16-17th. From what I hear they are offering all of their 30ml bottles for $10, even the Magnum Opus line!! The new shop can be found @ 325 Greber Suite G2. Wish I lived closer to take advantage but you can't win them all. I also posted this news to my [Instagram](URL [Facebook](URL and [twitter](URL accounts, while I don't have a lot of followers, it would be great if any of you could retweet, repost or share it if you can to help get the news out. Insta: URL Twitter: URL Facebook: URL Anyway enough of this news stuff, on to the juice! It's a max vg juice they're adding to their Sub Ohm line so the [bottles look like this](URL I got to try it in 3mg and testing was done in a number of devices but mainly my derringer running a dual 26g 0.3ohm build. Official description in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Berry Good** (A white chocolate strawberry captain crunch) Holy hell it's as good as it sounds! This stuff is soft, creamy, lightly sweet, hangs on the tongue and is just pure heaven. I quite literally destroyed the bottle I received in a couple of days. The berry flavour doesn't scream out strawberry, it's a bit more on the generic berry flavour side, just like a berry crunch cereal but nice and light and doesn't give you a gross artificial flavour sort of taste. The cereal flavour I get from this is spot on, not too strong but enough to make it taste like cereal. White chocolate to me tends to get lost in a vape, I find it usually comes off as a sweet cream more than a white chocolate which is what I find in this, a nice sweet creaminess that coats the whole thing. I find overall it's very well balanced and I can easily vape this all day long!! PB&amp;Jealous has a new contender!**(10/10)** ---- So if you're in the Gatineau area this weekend, I would highly recommend you go grab yourself a bottle or two of this stuff, it's absolutely delightful!

299,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Vapor Jedi,13,41ox88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/41ox88/honest_review_time_vapor_jedi/,2016-01-20 01:33:19,"Hey guys, [VaporJedi](URL was at CVE Montreal and were giving away 15 flavour sample packs if you won a spin on a wheel. I think most people still walked away with a pack even if they didn't hit the jackpot but I was lucky on my spin and won the pack. The sample pack was made up of 15 flavours and I'm pretty sure they are the more popular flavours if I heard correctly. Bottles were 10ml and they all came in 3mg. Checking the site they are all 30/70 pg/vg and cover a wide array of flavours. Here's a look at the [little tiny bottles](URL Testing was done in a derringer running a dual fused clapton around 0.3 ohms, puff cotton rinsed and rewicked between flavours. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective, results will vary! ---- **Birthday Cake** (A creamy vanilla cake with tons of icing) I don't really get cake from this, to me it tastes more like a vanilla pudding or custard. There's a strong and familiar vanilla taste with a hint of sweetness. While it doesn't exactly taste like cake if you like a vanilla custard this might appeal to you. **(6.5/10)** **Dark Secret** (a blend of the darker sides of Raspberry and other fruits) I'm not usually a fan of too many mixed fruit vapes and this is no exception. To me it tastes a bit like an air freshener with hints of raspberry. Not exactly tart or sweet it's a soft warm artificial raspberry that I seem to get. Overall it has a somewhat bathroomy taste to it, not for me! **(4/10)** **Yellow Snow** (peaches, pears, and pineapples) When opening the bottle it has a strong pineapple smell. Vaping it I get a gentle mix of peach and pineapple but can't seem to pick up any pear. It's soft and not overpowering too which is nice considering it has two flavours that can be quite strong on their own. **(6/10)** **Crusty Ape** (banana custard) This has a familiar taste to it, it's like a vanilla pudding with some banana thrown in. It reminds me a bit of Admiral Cavendish from Captain Oliver's but a bit more mild. The banana is the second note in this one as the pudding/custard really comes through on this. **(7/10)** **Leprechaun's Lunch** (Irish cream coffee, with an alcoholic tinge to it) This was one of the better flavours in the line for me. It came off like a buttery coffee with hints of fake chocolate. I didn't really get a hint of alcohol like they suggest. Really not too bad for an Irish cream flavour. **(7.5/10)** **Ugly Kitten** (guava and raspberry) I didn't get much from this as it was quite a bit muted to me. It had a very very faint inhale with a slight raspberry on the exhale, similar to Dark Secret's raspberry. I don't really get a sense of Guava either from this and the raspberry comes off as warm and soft. **(6/10)** **Fairies Fart** ( blueberry, strawberries, and bubblegum) Candy strawberry seems to come out up front on this, not so much a blueberry taste to me. I was really reaching to taste bubblegum in this and instead to me it reminded me of a ~~grape~~strawberry BlowPop. **(7.5/10) **G.A.S.** (Green Apple &amp; Strawberry) If you like apple vapes you could dig this, I mostly get a light green apple taste with just a hint of strawberry. It's a mellow apple and not crisp or tart. The strawberry doesn't play much of a role in this to me as it kind of gets lost in the apple. For a fruit blend it's not bad but nothing that makes me saw wow either. **(7/10)** **Fritter** (Apple fritter) I was looking forward to this one but was sadly disappointed by it. It has the same green apple taste they seem to use in all of their apple based juices. It's like drinking a warm glass of apple juice with a hint of cinnamon in it. I don't get any kind of bakery from this just apple juice. **(3/10)** **Pink Pirahna** (Cherry certs) If you're my age you might have went through a phase where you were decked out in the latest gear from 'Stitches/Le Chateau', rocking a sony walkman and canvas bag and in your pocket was a roll of cherry certs. Yeah that was me in the late 80's and this was a little trip down memory lane. This one nails the flavour of cherry certs right down to that dry powdery, artificial, medicine-y taste so many of us loved, at least I did. While it isn't something I could see myself vaping all day, it gets points for nailing the flavour of my awkward teen years. **(7.5/10) **Jedi Pudding** (creamy vanilla custard) This is a pretty middle of the road vanilla custard, while it wasn't mind blowing it's pretty comforting and familiar. It's not as rich and deep as some others I've tried but it's got a nice and smooth vanilla taste to it. Not much more to say about this one. **(7.5/10)** **Sleeve of Wizard** (Absinthe) I'm still mad about this one. I thought I was grabbing P.M.S when I vaped it and got a very nasty surprise. It gets points for being accurate as it tastes just like a mouthful of black licorice, which is arguably the worst flavour in the world. I personally hate this flavour. It actually made me gag it was so strong and intense. **(1/10)** **P.M.S** (Peach Mango Strawberry) Not sure why but it seems most juice makers like to mix peach and mango, I'm not a fan of this as the two already taste fairly similar and when combined they pretty much become homogeneous. In this mix the strawberry gets lost as I can't only really taste the peach mango mix. It's got reasonably refreshing feel to it but at the same time it's a bit flat, like it's missing something. **(6/10)** **Zombie Woof** (Tobacco blend/ Nutty and smooth with hints of vanilla and chocolate ) I get hints of nuts with a rich tobacco flavour in the background. At first I started to enjoy it but after a very short while it started to get that wet tobacco taste that I can't really stand. One of the richer flavours in the bunch just not exactly for me. **(6/10)** **Late Night Snack** (Peanut Butter, Banana, Chocolate) I get a very nice blend of peanut butter and chocolate. The banana only seems to leave the slightest hints that it's in there. This is by far the richest flavour in the line of samples I tried and also the best of them as well. The chocolate flavour is decadent and not artificial tasting and it blends perfectly with the peanut butter. Definitely something I could see myself picking up again,,,and again. **(9.5/10)** ---- All in all I found VaporJedi to be pretty average stuff, it's not bad by any means but it's also not mind blowingly good. To me there was at least one gem among them but remember taste is subjective and results will vary. So if any of these sound good to you, why not check them out!!"
300,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Cereal Battle 2K15!!,31,42mo65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/42mo65/cereal_battle_2k15/,2016-01-26 04:52:26,"Hey guys, Sorry this has been a long time coming. I said I would do a cereal battle a while back after /u/CuBu posted a comparison that he did. These are all cereal vapes that I picked up last year in 2015. Most are Canadian but quite a few are from down south. I broke them up in to categories as best I could. Many of them have been reviewed by me but there are quite few that have yet to receive an official review. ---- **Frosted Flakes:** [Cereal Vapist: Frosty's Flaked](URL is an in your face sugar flake taste 80VG) They're going for a frosted flakes type of taste and they pretty much nail it but unlike Vape Flakes from BC the corn flake taste is very much dialed down. To me this is a shame as it's what I really liked with Vape Flakes. It's milky/creamy and sweet with that hint of cereal flavour to let you know what it's supposed to be. **(8/10)** [Cereal Vapist: Frosty's Flaked - Strawberry](URL flakes but with strawberry 80VG) So this is pretty much the same flavour as Frosty's flaked but with a hint of strawberry. I was surprised what a difference that little hint can make. It has that same sweet, milky/creamy taste as the regular flakes but the strawberry flavour adds a very nice touch to it. I wanted it so badly to taste like Special K red berries but it's more like I added strawberry quick on flakes. It's a somewhat artificial tasting strawberry. Still quite enjoyable though! **(8/10)** [Breakfast Club: Vape Flakes](URL flakes soaked in fresh whole milk) It's a bit of a toss up between this and Apple Snaxx for me. It's so wonderfully different from a lot of the cereal vapes I've tried. It's similar to Just Add Milk from Toronto Juice Co. but sweeter and with milk. It's like frosted flakes instead of corn flakes. One thing I really dig about this one is it has a nice toasted corn flake taste to it. Those toasty corn flakes are covered in sugar and smothered in milk, delicious!! **(9.5/10)** **Winner:** Vape Flakes wins it for this round. It has a more authentic taste and a really nice toasted corn taste that the others just didn't have. ---- **Fruit Loops:** [Cereal Vapist: Code:187](URL explosion of fruit circle cereal with just a hint of cream 73VG) They claim to murder the competition with this one, therefore the code 187, murdah murdah murdah. While it is killer I don't know if they quite kill the competition. Definitely get that classic Fruit Loops taste from this with a nice cream, not too citrusy like many tend to be and not too sweet like some others. I did find it was almost missing something though but not enough for me to be bothered. Maybe it's that hint of cherry I get in some others maybe it's something else. Either way I would put this one right up there with Froops or O'Rangz, but just a little different from either. **(9/10)** [Breakfast Club: Froops](URL (Dried fruit medley doused in fresh Milk) There are tons of fruit loops vapes on the market, some are good some are bad, some are great!! This one to me is great. Talking with a friend we both felt it tastes a lot like O'rangz from Twelve Monkeys but without the super sweetness that it has and maybe a bit more cereal. It's another great balance of fruit, cereal and milk. Not too much citrus which usually kills a cereal vape for me and not too sweet so I can vape it all day. **(9/10)** [BE: Circle Loops](URL loops flavor) I've been enjoying cereal vapes a lot lately and I've tried lots of them. /u/CuBu posted a really nice comparison the other day, I highly agree with his judgment on those juices and this one as well. I found it extremely light on flavour but what I do get is mostly lemon. Like a light lemony vape , reminded me of a finger bowl or Neo-citron or just a hint of pledge. I actually found it a tiny bit harsh after vaping it for just a short while. The citrus kind of irritated my mouth. I broke out a few other cereals to compare and it just pales in comparison to pretty much all of them. **(5/10)** [Eastwood: Morning Dose](URL our morning dose of goodness with this yummy e-juice) This one is the closest to the standard fruit loops vape that everyone seems to put out these days. I would compare it to Circle Loops from Bargain eJuice in terms of quality and flavour. It's a bit harsh for me even after a week+ of steeping, breathing and a couple of warm baths. The 100ml I ordered of each came in two 50ml bottles so I kept one as control and only one of each got speed steeped, a noticeable difference in color after the process. Even then there is a harshness to it, I feel it in my lungs/chest not so much my throat. In fact I found it hard to vape for more than a few minutes without coughing. Keep in mind this is 3mg which should have next to no throat hit and definitely no chest hit. The flavour itself is rather citrus forward which is what I normally don't like in cereal vapes. Not really milky/creamy and can't say I taste any cereal. **(4/10)** [Vapor North: Loop Hole](URL (Loop Hole is a perfect recreation of a fruity loop cereal) VaporNorth makes good juice and LoopHole is no exception, it's a very well balanced fruit loops vape with a bit of milky/creaminess to it. The citrus is fairly well balanced but the cereal flavour is a bit light. Overall a great addition to the VN signature series. **(8/10)** [Vaporus: Kohala](URL by ""vape loops"" premium line but with an emphasis on cereal and milk)Like almost all Fruit Loops/Fruity Pebbles juices the citrus comes off first and foremost but I don't mind that personally and it often calms down after a steep. Dat after taste though, this juice leaves a very satisfying taste of just drank the milk from the bowl with a very nice tartness. Again, extremely smooth in a dripper which the description claims it was designed for. This one I've been having a hard time putting down!! **(8/10)changed from original rating** [Twelve Monkeys: O-rangz](URL (A careful marriage of lemony fruits accented by wheaty cereal and finished with creamy milk) This has been my favorite fruit loops cereal vape for a while. Yes it's very sweet and I kind of wish it was just a bit lighter in that department but it nails pretty much everything else. It's not overly citrus and there is a nice cereal flavour to it. Would be perfect if they toned down the sugar just a bit. **(9.5/10)** [Wonderlust: Smitten](URL loops and milk) I'm not a huge cereal vape fan, most of them have too much citrus for me to enjoy. I don't normally pick this one up but at the same time, it's one of the few cereal vapes I can actually enjoy. It's milky and the cereal taste is nicely balanced. I also get a hint of cherry that I feel most others leave out or bury. Leaves an awesome aftertaste and yes it tastes like the milk after a bowl. **(8/10)** [Lock &amp; Harbor: SS Guppy](URL (A blend of sweet and fruity breakfast cereals completed with a crunch and a hint of milk.) Picked this up in a giveaway a while back, this one is fantastic and would easily compete with O-Rangz. Well balanced, a bit sweet, milky and the citrus is where I like it. **(9/10)** [Sin Juice: Jealousy](URL fruity cereal blend provides you with a feeling of breakfast on a sunny morning) So everyone seems to have a cereal vape these days and I must say they are getting much better. The thing that kept me away from most cereal vapes for so long was the usually strong lemon taste I found in most of them, it was just too much for me. Lately though I've tried a number of good cereal vapes and I would have no problems throwing this one in to that category. Pretty standard fruit loops type vape but much less sweet than O-Rangz which I prefer and it gets the citrus balance just right. **(9/10)** [VapeWild: Fruit Hoops](URL (breakfast cereal with hints of orange, cherry, and lemon with a creamy after note similar to the milk) This is garbage and the worst fruit loops vape I've ever tried. It tastes like pure orange pledge if pledge made an orange flavour, save your money and skip this. **(1/10)** [Kilo: Cereal Milk](URL (perfect blend of fruity cereal and milky cream) For some reason I'm not the biggest fan of Cereal Milk, they don't do anything wrong it just doesn't sit right with me. I find it can be the tiniest bit harsh at times, guessing from the citrus. Doesn't mean I haven't killed a few bottles of it as it isn't bad at all. **(7/10)** **Winner:** O'rangz wins this round for me. Yes it's crazy sweet but there's something about it I can't get enough of. ---- **Crunch Berries:** [Cereal Vapist: Crunched Berries](URL of crunchy berry goodness 74VG) This one falls a bit short. It's berries and cream/milk but I don't get a very strong cereal flavour. A friend tried it and suggested it's even a tiny bit floral. It's definitely different from a lot of the other crunch berry type cereal vapes I've tried, not in a bad way just different. Maybe it's the berries they use or something but it doesn't quite nail that crunch berry taste to me but it's still quite decent. **(7/10)** [Breakfast Club: Crunk Berry](URL balls of fruit drizzled In 2% milk) This is arguably my least favorite of the bunch but it still rates incredibly high if that says anything. The only reason I rate it a tiny bit lower is every time I drip this stuff the first few hits taste just weird, like cedar wood or something. Only the first few though then it turns in to a cereal heavy berry crunch type flavour. The berries aren't overpowering which I prefer, it's nicely balanced between cereal and fruit. Again it's smoothed out with milk which makes it very easy to vape for long periods. **(8/10)** [Vaporus: Berry Good](URL white chocolate strawberry captain crunch) Holy hell it's as good as it sounds! This stuff is soft, creamy, lightly sweet, hangs on the tongue and is just pure heaven. I quite literally destroyed the bottle I received in a couple of days. The berry flavour doesn't scream out strawberry, it's a bit more on the generic berry flavour side, just like a berry crunch cereal but nice and light and doesn't give you a gross artificial flavour sort of taste. The cereal flavour I get from this is spot on, not too strong but enough to make it taste like cereal. White chocolate to me tends to get lost in a vape, I find it usually comes off as a sweet cream more than a white chocolate which is what I find in this, a nice sweet creaminess that coats the whole thing. I find overall it's very well balanced and I can easily vape this all day long!! PB&amp;Jealous has a new contender!**(10/10)** [Canada Ejuice: Good Morning Canada](URL is a wonderfully flavored breakfast cereal styled flavor for any Canadian Morning!) This is an amazing breakfast cereal vape, the cereal it reminds me of isn't actually available here anymore but is one that I regularly smuggle back from the US whenever I visit. Mutha frikkin Fruity Pebbles!!! Now I'm sure many of you aren't old enough to remember or have experienced the glory that is The Flintstones Fruity Pebbles before Canada banned them. I used my Google-Fu to try and figure out the story and I found two versions. In one they claim Canada's strict rules on healthy food prompted the ban, Post the makers of fruity and cocoa pebbles I guess couldn't be bothered to rename their product as a snack food since it was barely passable as a cereal product. The other story is about Copyright and Cartoon characters on cereal boxes and dumb laws preventing their use in Canada. Not sure which story I buy most. Either way we Canadians were destined to never taste their magnificence again. That is unless you travel to the states where they can still be found in abundance, or occasionally in some specialty store as an import. This juice is like liquified Fruity Pebbles, as soon as I smelled it I knew it was familiar, an old friend an old long lost friend. Sorry if I seem a bit nostalgic over this one but it was a childhood favorite. If you've never tried them, they taste a bit like fruit loops but more fruity and flavourful not citrus-y, they're shaped similar to deformed Rice Krispies and they are super colourful. This juice is pretty much a spot on Fruity Pebbles and a new favorite for me! **(10/10)** **Winner:** This one was tough for me but I went with Berry Good from Vaporus, it's so creamy, soft and delicious that I can't put it down when I have it. ---- **Apple Jacks:** [Cereal Vapist: Apple Crax](URL cinnamon cereal flavor 80VG) To me this tastes more like an apple pie/strudel type of flavour, which isn't bad but it's not quite Apple Jacks to me. It's just a decent blend of apple and cinnamon with a bit of pastry/cereal to it. Pleasant enough but not one of my favs from this line. **(7/10)** [Breakfast Club: Apple Snaxx](URL apple crunch topped with a light cream) This might be my favorite out of the bunch. The first few hits are kind of weird/strong as your mouth kind of sorts out what it's tasting. I get a strong but not too strong cinnamon right off the bat that slowly trades places with a nice apple flavour. After maybe the third hit I get straight up Apple Jacks. There's a nice cereal flavour that accompanies all of these juices that varies a bit for each one. This one has a nice grain like taste but it also has a nice creamy/milkiness to it to balance it all out. Amazing stuff! **(9.5/10)** **Winner:** This one was pretty easy, Breakfast Club has a much more authentic tasting Apple Jacks and I would go with that anytime! ---- **Cinnamon Toast Crunch:** [CS Vapes: Enemy Spotted](URL (Cinnamon toast crunch) I grabbed this at CVE Montreal and was not let down. It's a very nice take on a cinnamon toast crunch cereal. I don't get a milk/cream from it so much but the cinnamon is the way I like it and it doesn't overpower the other flavours in the juice like the toast. **(9/10)** [MEO: Crunch and Milk](URL (A mouthful of your favourite cereal, soggy with sugary milk.) This is a cinnamon toast crunch type vape and it's fantastic. It's a light cinnamon with a toasty cereal type flavour that's well balanced and delicious. I could vape a whole bottle in not time. **(8.5/10)** **Winner:** Enemy Spotted takes this one. I found it had a nicer, rounder taste than Crunch and Milk. ---- **Others:** [SZ: Cerious](URL granola cereal with a touch of milk. Mixed in is the faintest hint of blueberries.) This is not your average cereal flavour!! It's light, it's sweet, it's creamy and it's blueberry. I'm not sure I can say it tastes like granola but it does have a very nice cereal flavour that's perfectly complimented with the blueberry. It's definitely creamy and doesn't give me that dry cereal or that bowl of milk taste like most others do. For me it tastes like a big bowl of cereal sprinkled with fresh blueberries all blended together. Delicious and a nice change from the standard cereals out there! **(9/10)** [ECV: Cereal Trilogy](URL of Boss Reserve) ECV has been doing a clone wars thing where they released some clones of popular flavours without releasing what they were and if you were the first to guess what it was you could win a year's supply of juice. Well this was one of those flavours, I didn't guess it someone else already had but I couldn't resist grabbing a bottle. I haven't had Boss Reserve in a while and don't have any on hand atm to do a side by side but from what I remember it's pretty damn close to the original, if not identical. What's Boss Reserve you ask, it's a honey graham cereal flavour smothered in milk with a touch of banana. Pretty awesome stuff. If you've never had it or Boss Reserve before, do yourself a favour and try it out! **(8/10)** [Toronto Juice Co: Morning Glory ""Just Add Milk""] (URL (Morning Glory is a tasty blend of cereal flavours , lightly sweetened and blended to create a smooth, nostalgic vape.) My first cereal vape so I was a bit confused when I started tasting all of the other cereal vapes out there that taste like citrus. I personally like this kind of cereal vape, it's not very sweet, it doesn't have that citrus note, it's not creamy/milky, it's cereal. Get it, just add milk. I get RiceKrispies, corn flakes and those types of cereals in a comfortable blend. It might be too bland for some, but I kind of like it. **(7.5/10)** [Thick Oil: Sweet Oil](URL cereal treat) It's another cereal vape, but to me it's pretty much perfect! It's like a rice crispy treat smothered in milk cream but I also get hints of fruitiness like a fruity pebbles type vape. It's not heavy on citrus, it's more like berries and it's lightly sweet so I don't get tired of it too fast like some others that I enjoy. Easy to vape on all day long and one of the better cereal vapes I've tried!! **(9/10)** **Winner:** Going to give this one to Cerious from SZ, it's so unique and different yet comforting and familiar. It's got an amazing blueberry flavour and is likened to a granola as opposed to a generic cereal. ---- These are just my take on all of the cereals I got to try over the last year. There's still tons out there that I haven't tried and I'm sure there are tons more coming out soon. Let me know what your favorite cereals were for 2015!?!

If you couldn't make it, hopefully we'll be able to attend close to you for the next installment! &amp;nbsp; First off, I want to give the biggest shout out to my team there. They are simply freaking amazing. Everyone worked their ass off and the sinergy was perfect! There is just no way I would have made it without them. They are the reason the show was a success! &amp;nbsp; Our booth wasn't the prettiest or flashiest, but we had a unique tasting setup. While most of them used a Subtank Mini, we went with Kayfuns on each side. 4xKayfun V4s for the High VG line, 4xKayfun Lite+ for the High PG line, all with a 5 wrap 2.5mm 34/30 clapton in it. Going back and fourth every 30 minutes to test them was a PITA, but definitely worth it. The flavor it produces was great! Only 2 dry hits during the whole event, so all in all it worked amazingly well! &amp;nbsp; I didn't take to many pics, but here a few of the booth before opening on Sunday (I was the one taking the pics so am not in them): URL The vape stands were a creation of the Reddit extraordinaire /u/Vendeta44! A big Thank You, especially knowing the amount of time spent on them! And..Sorry...For...My...Short...Texts...Every...Time! LOL &amp;nbsp; We met a LOT of people. From the reddit family, friends (old &amp; new) and businesses, we really had a blast seeing all of you! Sorry if we couldn't sit and chat, the booths were extremely busy at certain times (as you may have noticed) and we didn't want to leave anyone out! &amp;nbsp; The atmosphere this community has is just beautiful and makes working in this industry extremely enjoyable! It was a great learning experience, hopefully one we will get to re-live soon :) &amp;nbsp; Special thanks/props to our friends @ /u/vapornorth (How was the poutine??), /u/dashvapes (I ninja'd some swag btw :P), /u/VapingJulian &amp; the Vaporus team that passed by, and every single redditor who came and showed support (I don't want to include nicks because I am certain I will miss one)! &amp;nbsp; I wish I could say I am taking the day off to relax, but that would mean delaying your CVE orders, which I refuse to do!

305,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Eastwood eJuice,18,3v043j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/3v043j/honest_review_time_eastwood_ejuice/,2015-12-02 01:54:49,"Hey guys, [Eastwood eJuice](URL popped up on here a little while back and I got in on the pre-order deal. Always love to try a new vendor and based on price and selection they looked enticing. Since I was saving for CVE I only grabbed three bottles but the nice folks at Eastwood threw in a couple extras for me as well. All the ones I ordered were 3mg and Max VG, one of the extras was 6mg but it was fine. I've been on a bit of a cereal kick lately so the flavour selection was pretty narrow on this one which might have been the downfall of this review. Will be sure to spread it out next time. The bottles were actually quite nice and clean and the labels had all of the appropriate info. Here's a pic of [the bottles](URL Testing was done in one of my trusty derringers, with a dual 26g build coming in around 0.3ohms on a sigelei 150w. Was using Puff cotton, rinsed and re-wicked in between. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective, results will vary! ---- **Morning Dose** (Enjoy our morning dose of goodness with this yummy e-juice) This one is the closest to the standard fruit loops vape that everyone seems to put out these days. I would compare it to Circle Loops from Bargain eJuice in terms of quality and flavour. It's a bit harsh for me even after a week+ of steeping, breathing and a couple of warm baths. The 100ml I ordered of each came in two 50ml bottles so I kept one as control and only one of each got speed steeped, a noticeable difference in color after the process. Even then there is a harshness to it, I feel it in my lungs/chest not so much my throat. In fact I found it hard to vape for more than a few minutes without coughing. Keep in mind this is 3mg which should have next to no throat hit and definitely no chest hit. The flavour itself is rather citrus forward which is what I normally don't like in cereal vapes. Not really milky/creamy and can't say I taste any cereal. **(4/10)** **Secret Sauce** (Another secret mix for those daring and brave to try it out.) I guess I'm either brave or stupid cause I grabbed both of the secret sauces. The first one smells heavily of candy, very artificial with a hint of bathroom deodorizer. The flavour on the other hand is very light, dry and powdery, a bit like Sweetarts. To me it wasn't a cereal like I was expecting from the blurred out image on their site. This one was also hard on my chest and made me cough after just a few hits. I also got a bit of a buzz after those few hits, not usually the case for me with 3mg. It's like a bad version of VJuices Umpa Lumpa. **(3/10)** **Secret Sauce v2** (A secret but heres a clue, theres a fun cereal flavour blended in.) This one wasn't nearly as strong smelling, in fact I could barely smell it. The flavour was also very light and much less offensive than the other two so far. I didn't really get the cereal they claim is in there more like another version of a light powdery candy vape. This one also has that artificial bathroom air freshener kind of smell/taste to it. Interestingly enough this one wasn't as harsh to me as the other two, either that or I was getting used to it by then. **(3/10)** **Monkey Juice** (Strong on the Banana with slight but special fruit mix). If you've ever tried Circus Bear from VapeWild, this tastes a lot like it. It's very artificial tasting but pleasant enough. It tastes like a mix of candy banana and some other artificial fruit flavours all blended together. This one came in 6mg but was surprisingly light on throat hit and my lungs compared to the others. Not something I would regularly go for but somehow was the most enjoyable out of the bunch I received. **(7/10)** **Gummy Drops** (An amazing blend of sweet fruit flavoured candy with a gummy twist to it.) This seemed unusually thin compared to the others, both in consistency and flavour. It had a very weak flavour and I found I was tasting my cotton more than I was tasting the juice. It came off as harsh and chemical to me and had me coughing like the others. Couldn't really taste anything even remotely similar to a gummy candy, it tasted more like the secret sauces but worse. **(1/10)** ---- This is the part where I normally suggest you go and try a vendor, however after my experience with Eastwood I would suggest you're on your own to make that decision. For me posting a less than glowing review is not an easy thing to do, but I feel it's something that needs to be shared. Yes taste is subjective but quality isn't so much. I've read some good reviews for Eastwood on here lately and maybe it's just the flavours I selected or an unlucky batch so please take my words with a grain of salt. Would love to hear some others experiences with Eastwood! Edit: link"

309,CVE,Canadian_ecigarette,Honest review time: Cereal Vapist by Vape Fuel,8,3x327e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/3x327e/honest_review_time_cereal_vapist_by_vape_fuel/,2015-12-17 01:57:21,"Hey guys, I've been slacking a bit lately on the reviews, sorry for that. Here's a new line I picked up at CVE this year. While it's not Canadian made it should be available here. It's a line called [Cereal Vapist](URL by [Vape Fuel](URL and they're somewhat similar to the Breakfast Club line but also a little different. Bottles are clear glass with decent droppers and interesting label designs. The also contain all the pertinent information and warnings about safety and such which is always nice to see. Here's a look at [the bottles](URL I grabbed them in 3mg but the pg/vg ratio varies so I'll list them with their descriptions. Testing has been done over the past week or so mainly using a derringer with a dual fused clapton build coming out to 0.2ish. Using Puff cotton, rinsed and rewicked in between flavours of course. Official descriptions in brackets. Remember taste is subjective and results will vary! ---- **Frosty's Flaked** (This is an in your face sugar flake taste 80VG) They're going for a frosted flakes type of taste and they pretty much nail it but unlike Vape Flakes from BC the corn flake taste is very much dialed down. To me this is a shame as it's what I really liked with Vape Flakes. It's milky/creamy and sweet with that hint of cereal flavour to let you know what it's supposed to be. **(8/10)** **Apple Crax** (apple cinnamon cereal flavor 80VG) To me this tastes more like an apple pie/strudel type of flavour, which isn't bad but it's not quite Apple Jacks to me. It's just a decent blend of apple and cinnamon with a bit of pastry/cereal to it. Pleasant enough but not one of my favs from this line. **(7/10)** **Frosty's Flaked - Strawberry** (Sugar flakes but with strawberry 80VG) So this is pretty much the same flavour as Frosty's flaked but with a hint of strawberry. I was surprised what a difference that little hint can make. It has that same sweet, milky/creamy taste as the regular flakes but the strawberry flavour adds a very nice touch to it. I wanted it so badly to taste like Special K red berries but it's more like I added strawberry quick on flakes. It's a somewhat artificial tasting strawberry. Still quite enjoyable though! **(8/10)** ... apparently they also have a chocolate version but it wasn't available at CVE. **Crunched Berries** (bowl of crunchy berry goodness 74VG) This one falls a bit short. It's berries and cream/milk but I don't get a very strong cereal flavour. A friend tried it and suggested it's even a tiny bit floral. It's definitely different from a lot of the other crunch berry type cereal vapes I've tried, not in a bad way just different. Maybe it's the berries they use or something but it doesn't quite nail that crunch berry taste to me but it's still quite decent. **(7/10)** **Code:187** (An explosion of fruit circle cereal with just a hint of cream 73VG) They claim to murder the competition with this one, therefore the code 187, murdah murdah murdah. While it is killer I don't know if they quite kill the competition. Definitely get that classic Fruit Loops taste from this with a nice cream, not too citrusy like many tend to be and not too sweet like some others. I did find it was almost missing something though but not enough for me to be bothered. Maybe it's that hint of cherry I get in some others maybe it's something else. Either way I would put this one right up there with Froops or O'Rangz, but just a little different from either. **(9/10)** ---- Overall I was quite happy with this pickup from CVE, they're only a couple dollars cheaper than Breakfast Club but they also claim 35ml per bottle as opposed to just 30ml. I got a discount on the full line so it was hard to pass them up. If you see them in your local or find them online I wouldn't have any issues suggesting you give them a try. Edit: links and grammar"

I'm stressed and wondering if I produced enough bottles! LOL Being our first expo, we don't know what to expect, but it'l be fun! I'll get a chance to meet some of you guys and put a face to the names (and you mine :P). &amp;nbsp; So what are our CVE specials? - First 30ml for 5$ - 30ml for 10$ - 4x30ml for 30$ - Disclosed on Reddit only: Show me your flavor build! * I'm looking for the best flavor build possible. Bring your best flavor RDA with your best flavor build on it and let me try it! Impress me and get a free 30ml (hint: it won't be easy)! &amp;nbsp; Something important to note: All of our flavors will be available to drip at our booth! Only 30ml E-liquid bottles will be available. Max VG and 1.5mg will be unavailable. We decided to do this to limit the amount of inventory to carry and manage during the show. You can grab them from the website at the same price as the convention though! &amp;nbsp; **CVE/Black Friday Sale** For the website, I have created a category for CVE/Black Friday. We've got the same specials as CVE going + we added the 120ml grab at 30$! The section will be up until Monday. &amp;nbsp; There are 3 items in this category: * **The Collection CVE 30ML**: 30ml bottle selection for 10$ each (up to 3, switch to next item for 4). Use coupon code below to get the first at 5$. * **The Collection CVE 30ML QUAD PACK**: 4x30ml pack for 30$. * **The Collection CVE 120ML GRAB**: 120ml bottle for 30$. Use coupon code ""**CVE**"" to get 5$ off the first 30ml bottle and get free shipping. The only restriction to use this coupon is that you have ""The Collection CVE 30ML"" and min 40$ in your cart. Else use **""FREESHIP""** as usual for free shipping. &amp;nbsp; *Hint: Grab a Quad pack or 120ml Grab + CVE 30ml to get 150ml for 35$ with free shipping!* &amp;nbsp; Link to the category: URL &amp;nbsp; I've also put some old items in clearance. &amp;nbsp; Logically, you should expect your order to be delayed until next week, since we will be busy with CVE. &amp;nbsp; I think that covers all. If not I'll edit the post later on! &amp;nbsp; See you guys tomorrow! Phil URL"
