0,CVEs,linux,Which distro has the best security team?,0,d1l1xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/d1l1xi/which_distro_has_the_best_security_team/,2019-09-09 12:53:01,"Hello, Linux community! There are plenty of Linux distros to choose from and it can make selecting a distribution quite confusing when the goal is security. Most of the people don't even realize the difference between ""security"", ""privacy"" and ""anonymity"" and Google isn't helpful with it's silly ""[15 Most Secure Linux Distros For Privacy And Security](URL Also people most of time don't want ""special"" players like Qubes OS or Tails (which cannot be even compared, you see), they want something different. Now, don't get me wrong. This is not an r/findmeadistro post, though it probably leads to selecting a proper distro for a reader. But this post is intended as an insight into the current state of the real Linux security. There were [multiple](URL [times](URL when patches introduced bugs and even vulnerabilities, and the most impactful ones I am aware of were introduced by distro maintainers (remember Meltdown mess?) At the same time, it's not just about security teams. It is also about distributions and has an ambiguous word ""best"" in it, which allows me to slightly modify the course of question: security is not just about patching vulnerabilities in time. It's also about picking right tools from the beginning, including TLSv1.3 (which is likely not yet available for Debian users), ECC (specifically, Ed25519 support in software), etc. And my question is intended to find out the most competent AND active community. This is a very complicated question, actually. For example, take a look at Arch Linux's [security page](URL which usually has lots of vulnerabilities opened because they rely on upstream directly. Then, take a look at a nice utility called [arch-audit](URL And then read about [malware in AUR](URL I also believe there was a story about Arch getting security fixes faster than Ubuntu. And then think about how fine-grained control over your OS can help security. Let's clarify some things and recap: * By security I safety from unauthorized data access and identity stealing, not ""anonymity"" or ""privacy"" - two words that almost became trademarks because of incompetent ""TOP 10"" approach. * A person who responds to this post must be aware that some CVEs are not exploitable by themselves, as well as the well-known fact that correlation does not mean causation, i.e. ""bigger userbase"" or ""Canonical-backed"" does not mean that a distro has a better security team. Look at [Linux Mint](URL I [dare](URL you! * By ""best"" I mean ""providing security patches fast enough with sufficient code quality"" and ""providing **actually** safe defaults"". Cheers!"

2,CVEs,linux,List of distros with (or without) CVE status?,3,8ororm,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/8ororm/list_of_distros_with_or_without_cve_status/,2018-06-06 01:24:13,"I'm curious about which distros maintain, or at least discuss publicly, their status with respect to CVEs? I know that Red Hat has [a CVE Database](URL Debian has [CVE-compatible advisories](URL and other big ditros provide something like this. I'm just wondering if there's a curated list of distros, whether they provide a list focused on their official repos, and if not what they recommend users do. This came to mind when I was looking into Void Linux, which apparently doesn't provide their own list, but stays close enough to upstream that the user can just monitor the CVEs themselves. "

Updates to [Anchore.io](URL include: - Private Repositories: Allowing you to setup private repositories to be scanned by Anchore. - A Graphical Policy Editor: The new graphical policy editor allows you define your own custom policies and map which policies are used with which images. The policy editor supports CVE whitelisting - allowing a curated set of CVEs to be excluded from security vulnerability alerts. - Expanded Notifications: In addition to image update notifications the Anchore Navigator can now alert you by email when CVEs have been added or removed from your image and when the policy status of your image has changed, for example an image that previously passed is now failing policy evaluation. Your feedback would be extremely helpful, so if you have a minute head over to [URL and take a look Thanks!"
4,CVEs,linux,Can we stop recommending Linux Mint?,357,4v116g,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4v116g/can_we_stop_recommending_linux_mint/,2016-07-29 00:40:25,"Linux Mint has many problems: * Linux Mint mixes Ubuntu and Debian packages (see [here](URL * Due to the mix of Debian and Ubuntu packages, when an update is released that breaks Mint, the maintainers blacklist it until it works again, even if it is a security upgrade. (Note: they don't try to fix it, they just blacklist it) * Mint doesn't publish CVEs, and you can't check if you are vulnerable because you don't know where a certain package came from. * When one of their packages has the same name as a upstream package, they block the package and replace it with theirs. For example, the package mdm contains *Utilities for single-host parallel shell scripting*, however, in Linux Mint (and only Linux Mint), the mdm package is the Mint Display Manager(aka a clone of gdm). * Security updates are optional. * By default, using the Update Manager, you won't get updates for critical parts of the system(xorg, systemd, kernel), even security updates. * The use of old kernels means that newer hardware isn't supported You will probably have a better time with Ubuntu(or any other distro) MATE or by installing Cinnamon on Ubuntu(we really need a Ubuntu Cinnamon Spin) than with Linux Mint. So, can we stop recommending Linux Mint to beginners? Because they will run into much more problems than with any other distro and will get the wrong image of what a (good) Linux distro should be. Sources: * URL * URL * URL TL;DR: Linux Mint is a mess. Don't use Linux Mint, at least until they fix it. Edit: removed xed example as it's not valid. **Edit2**: I want to clarify that I don't hate Linux Mint, I think it's a good project, but in it's current state it definitely has a *lot* of problems that need to be fixed."
5,CVEs,linux,Thinking of switching from Chromium to Chrome for timely updates - comments?,1,4vdpp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4vdpp0/thinking_of_switching_from_chromium_to_chrome_for/,2016-07-31 06:01:32,"I've been using Chromium, primarily for ideological reasons. But I've noticed that on most linux distros Chromium is slow to be updated. Right now, several CVEs exist with Chromium version 51 that is the most up to date version available on Ubuntu and Debian. Yet Chrome 52 (which address the CVEs) has been out for well over a week. If I switched to Chrome, I envision having better security via getting timely updates. I'm hesitant though for ideological reasons, and it seems Chrome adds some bloat to Chromium, but perhaps the added security is worth the little bit of bloat. Appreciate any feedback you guys have on this."
6,CVEs,linux,Any OpenSCAP users? Is it possible to scan 3rd party packages for known vulnerabilities as well? Not just what comes from RHN?,15,35z8v9,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/35z8v9/any_openscap_users_is_it_possible_to_scan_3rd/,2015-05-15 05:29:00,"I tested OpenSCAP and it does a nice job scanning existing system using RHSA definitions provided by RH. What I'm trying to set up is a system which can scan a specific location or a file, checking it against a list of CVEs. That location or a file can be a package our sysadmins put together, or part of a bundle developers are releasing (e.g. a jar file) or a third-party package (e.g. a copy of apache tomcat binary downloaded from apache.org)"
