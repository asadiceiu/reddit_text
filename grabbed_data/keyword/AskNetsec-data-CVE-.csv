I'm relatively new to the industry and I'm having trouble understanding the technical details. I would appreciate any help you can provide. My questions are: 1. Does the target system already need to be compromised in order to take advantage of this exploit (specifically in the case of Atlassian Confluence as seen here: [URL 2. What are the implications of accomplishing path traversal? 1. Will the threat actor be able to access other systems on the network or just files on the system itself? 3. What is ""server-side template injection""? 1. I'm asking the wrong question, but don't know how to word it. I understand the concept, I think. Maybe I should ask, ""what does it take to accomplish this""? Does the threat actor already needs to be IN the network to take advantage of this exploit? Does it make the server vulnerable or the endpoint? Or both? Here's the CVE description from MITRE: The Widget Connector macro in Atlassian Confluence Server before version 6.6.12 (the fixed version for 6.6.x), from version 6.7.0 before 6.12.3 (the fixed version for 6.12.x), from version 6.13.0 before 6.13.3 (the fixed version for 6.13.x), and from version 6.14.0 before 6.14.2 (the fixed version for 6.14.x), allows remote attackers to achieve path traversal and remote code execution on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance via server-side template injection.

But, they're all pretty simple, and not very impressive. &amp;#x200B; My question is, can I use this experience to start a career in security? If so, how? I would really like to get out of doing bug bounties sooner rather than later, as they are simply not a reliable source of income. Even though I've had some great successes, this month I could find nothing or just get a bunch of duplicates, and make $0. However, I feel not having a formal education and no certs will really hamper my chances of getting employed anywhere. Is this true? Have any of you been someone who only had bug bounty experience and got a job in the field? I'm willing to learn anything that is necessary to get there, because I finally feel like I've found the field I want to be in for the rest of my career. &amp;#x200B; Thanks in advance for your thoughts."
33,CVE-,AskNetsec,Updating an Exploit DB Exploit,1,ajbioo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/ajbioo/updating_an_exploit_db_exploit/,2019-01-24 22:28:16,"As per title, I've come across an exploit which I needed to use, however, the author made a small assumption in his entry to Exploit DB. The exploit 'requires' the user to have 3 permissions, in order to exploit the app. You don't actually need the 3rd permission, though it does improve the reliability against non-default installs. The exploit also doesn't gracefully fail if the 3rd permission is set. As such, I've updates the MSF exploit module to gracefully fail, and added a flag allowing the user to attempt the exploit without the 3rd permission. The update is mostly comprised of the authors original code. I can't see much in the way of literature or examples of someone uploading an updated exploit to EDB. I've seen [URL however it reads as if for initial CVE/Exploit discovery PoC, and doesn't say much for updating other authors exploits. Is is simply best to reach out to the author and ask them to update and credit, or should I email EDB with the updated exploit retaining initial authors name? I'm mainly focused on the ethics and process others have followed. Thanks."

We found these issues and sent messages to the company about it. They mostly made tickets and said they would fix the issues but never did. We felt it was necessary to reveal this information to other clients since they had a right to know. We waited one or two years for them to release a patch and nothing ever changed. We wanted to give them time but we didn't want engineers to be left in the dark about these potential problems. Some clients thanked us and some people criticised us for doing it this way. They asked if we had CVE ids, but none of us have ever had to file any (so the answer was no). They asked if we told the vendor and how long we knew about the problems. There are a few more things of interest that we know of where attackers could get credentials and stuff in the right situation. (Told vendor about this a year ago) This time we would like to announce this properly so people know outside of reddit. It was hard getting the right info about CVEs and suggestions for when to report. We thought waiting half of a year or maybe a year before releasing this was acceptable but we wanted to ask here. 1. If you tell the vendor about the problem, how long should you wait before revealing this to public? We understand waiting for a patch and for the patch to be rolled out by other clients to their equipment so that everyone has a chance to protect themselves 2. When do you file for CVE? Do we wait until a patch or can we file immediately? 3. If we file a CVE, will they contact the vendor for us? 4. IS there a way to submit information needed for decrypting stuff (like keys) so they can verify without it being included in the final report or will they do that after reviewing? 5. What if the vulnerability exists only in older code or versions, do we still need to contact the vendor? We understand that we didn't go the best way in reporting this so we would like to know a more proper way in doing this for next time."

A lot of spam was sent from his email account and the hosting company said he likely got hacked because he's using an outdated CMS. I'm trying to help him migrate to an updated version of the CMS and get rid of malware, if there is any. But first I need to understand what's going on. How is it possible for the hacker to send spam after hacking the main website? The SMTP server is separate from the main server (smtp.hostingprovider.com), and presumably requires my friend's username and password to the smtp server (basically his Microsoft Outlook login), right? In theory, it should be separate from any passwords used on the website, correct? So the attacker shouldn't have been able to send mail via the SMTP server...? My current best guess is that maybe there was a file on the website that had the SMTP login in it. I remember there was an emailing app on the website once, so maybe the app had the login, so that it could connect to the SMTP server. If that's true, then I should be able to simply ask the hosting provider to change the login of the SMTP and maybe the attacker won't be able to send spam anymore, while I fix the vulnerabilities. Am I correct, or is it not that simple? Edit: It's probably not that simple, is it? He runs a small website making business, and not only his website is compromised, but also his clients' websites are compromised (or at least, they have also been sending spam). I'd like to know how you think the attacker did this. My only guess right now is that maybe there was a list of logins on the main site for every one of his clients. But I don't really know. *** Also, what's the best way of making sure there aren't any shells on the webserver after I upgrade it? I couldn't find any malicious files, but there might still be malicious code somewhere (although, I guess the hacker doesn't really need a shell on the website. He could have just connected directly to the SMTP server through his own computer, right?). For example, [this exploit](URL would have left the exploit code inside the Joomla database, if I've understood correctly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I haven't reported a CVE or disclosed a vulnerability before, so I don't know the etiquette surrounding it.

I'm running Nessus on a virtual machine and I used it to scan my home lan. The problem is that Nessus fails to find vulnerabilities to report. The home lan consists on user-end PCs and Macs, plus a cheap router from the ISP. For testing purposes, I also turned on a computer I had laying around with Debian Lenny (yes, that freaking old and unpatched), and Nessus failed to find vulnerabilities in every host. I also know for a fact that my Mac is vulnerable to the shellshock bug for example, however, I don't think it can be remotely exploited with my current settings. I'm using Nessus Home version 6.2, with the basic scan setting. The scan output reports some vulnerabilities (like the router's configuration webpage is vulnerable to a SSL/TLS Renegotiation handshake), but won't report any CVE vulnerabilities, for example. I'm planning to deploy Nessus on my work network (which I'm responsible for), for regular scans, but if I'm not finding vulnerabilities in a network I'm sure I have them (the debian box, for example), I'm probably doing something wrong. Can anyone help me debug this? I've manually updated the plugins to no avail. Thanks! EDIT: On Nessus, under Policies -&gt; Plugins, all plugin families are enabled. Original thread: URL"

I decided that itd be best if i tried out stuff on my own, so i got metasploitable and have been messing around with that. Iv realized that i have a very hard time finding a specific vunerability with a program that i can exploit. I dont mean a zero day or anything, just an existing problem that is know about and that i can exploit with metasploit or public code. I feel like i have a decent understanding of the various tools and everything, i know how to get a bunch of info with nmap, with metasploit auxillary modules and so on, its just actually going about finding an exploit. For example, when i got metasploitable i scanned it with nmap -sV and -A and outputted it into a file. I then went over it and decided id try to attack apache. I look at the version (2.2.8) its obviously very out of date so i know theres some sort of exploit, that and the fact that its being used on metasploitable. I go on google, i look at the list of bugs on apache, i searched apache with searchsploit.. i see that theres bugs obviously but i dont really know where to go from there. For example i see with searchsploit that theres an exploit related to http request headers but i dont know what to do next, all there is a textfile and when i click the CVE link it does not give much information. Same with OSVDB. This goes with all other things too, Samba, SSH, Tomcat, MySQL, whatever. I just dont know how to find an exploit. For well known popular bugs i have no problem, for example that backdoor in vsftp as soon as i google it theres links everywhere about it, anything else though im stuck. So yeah, i guess its pretty pathetic, but i just end up stuck everytime. I think i dont have the right way of going about things. Also i realize i could probably use a vunerability scanner but id rather not do that, i think doing things manual is probably the best way to learn. Anyone have any suggestions? Thanks! "

Our Pen Test team includes CVE info and [CVSS](URL scores (Base and Temporal) for all things they find. I like it as it's an open way to show how ""bad"" a particular vulnerability is. We use the [NIST](URL CVSS matrix to convert the CVSS numeric score to severity rating... basically a word that management understands (High, Medium, etc.). For those of you that do a similar translation (or use tools that include it), have you had a client ask that you use the Temporal scores instead of the Base scores for the severity rating? If so... what are your thoughts on it?"
