I will be upfront and start by saying I have no professional computer science or cybersecurity experience. I earned my bachelor's degree \~2 years ago in International Security with a minor in Arabic, and I am currently completing my first semester of graduate school toward a master's in Cybersecurity. I work full time as an accountant, and would like to work toward a career dealing with computer forensics/investigations/cybercrime, although I am flexible on the field matter. That being said, I am willing to do just about anything to get my foot in the door. Internships, a minimum wage job, whatever it takes just to get started. I am in the Portland, OR area, but I am also flexible on relocation. I am moderately proficient with Java, Python, and SQL. I am intensively growing my networking skills at this time. I will be taking the ISACA Cybersecurity exam in December, and then I aim to have my CCNA no later than June of next year. What more can I do to make myself employable? To me, the idea of approaching a company and saying ""Hi, I've never done this before, and I have 0 hands on experience, so please take me in and show me how to do new stuff"" seems pretty crazy. On the other hand, I am very sharp on learning new things and willing to take on any job with a good attitude/growth mindset. I know projects are king when it comes to getting programming jobs, but do projects matter at all in cybersecurity? What other skills or certs would you recommend? Please accept an enormous and sincere thank you on my part, for anyone who takes a moment to respond. Being new in a field is always challenging, but I know this is where I am meant to be, and I am ready to take on anything."
