0,CVE,Cisco,where can i find software release history for all versions of a cisco product?,1,i3vo03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cisco/comments/i3vo03/where_can_i_find_software_release_history_for_all/,2020-08-05 10:53:51,particularly for the catalyst 3650 switch and the 1900 router. 3650 is using io2 12.6 and the 1900 is using ios 12.4. Doing a mock security infrastructure analysis I'm searching CVE database for vulnerabilities but I don't know what the latest release versions are.

2,CVE,Cisco,Bluetooth issues with new 8845 firmware 12.7(1)?,1,fclsxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cisco/comments/fclsxs/bluetooth_issues_with_new_8845_firmware_1271/,2020-03-03 11:10:43,"Due to CVE-2020-3111 we have been upgrading the firmware on all vulnerable models of our phones. I have a single 8845 being used in production. I upgraded the firmware to 12.7 (1) without issue, however the new firmware seems to break bluetooth headset functionality. I have experimented with changing ""Line Mode"" from enhanced to session, per some old suggestions on some forums but have not had any success pairing and using a bluetooth headset on this phone after the upgrade. I rolled back the firmware and instantly the bluetooth function is flawless. Any ideas? This particular 8845 is my bosses phone so of course I want the upgrade to be flawless and successful but so far we are having to remain on a vulnerable firmware to retain bluetooth. I do not have a smart contract for this phone unfortunately. THANKS!"
3,CVE,Cisco,CVE-2019-15992 - CSCvr85295 - ASA/FTD Remote Code Execution Vulnerability,1,ebwmmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cisco/comments/ebwmmf/cve201915992_cscvr85295_asaftd_remote_code/,2019-12-18 01:42:03,"Has anyone looked into this in more detail? I'm confused by the whole ""could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying Linux operating system of an affected device."" What is the definition of ""authenticated"" in this scenario? Are they referring to authenticated in a device management sense? If so, wouldn't that kind of be like a pilot hijacking his own plane? I get that it could be a less priviliged account being used and executing code above his permission level, but still, if someone has any of the creds used to manage your ASA/FTD box, I think there are bigger issues. Or are they referring to authenticated to, say, a VPN session? That could potentially open up the exploit to thousands of users with less than ideal password management. But if you're using 2FA and certs, then that should be less of an issue, too. Right? Or am I completely off base here."
4,CVE,Cisco,Anyone have a switch running the routing lanbase on internet edge?,9,biwa4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cisco/comments/biwa4a/anyone_have_a_switch_running_the_routing_lanbase/,2019-04-30 09:26:07,"May seem like a weird question but the network I manage has one. The way the ISP provided their gateway called for us to have a double router in place, and today something very strange happened. The device went down for \~5 minutes, came back, then an hour later another \~5 minutes and when we went to check on it we noticied a lot was not as it should be. Each time was a full reboot of the 2960S, and when we saw the config we found a new user account as well as the tftp-server having been enabled for startup-config on nvram. Current version: `Cisco IOS Software, C2960S Software (C2960S-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(2)SE11, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)` Then after seeing all this, I got back on the switch and locked it down again. No SSH, Telnet, SNMP, HTTP, HTTPS, etc like before and within an hour restart + old config was back with full remote access. **No, I did not forget to write mem, I write it too religiously, I wrote it at least 50 times in that session a lot.** &amp;#x200B; So, if anyone else has an issue similar to this today please comment and maybe we could work together to find a root cause of this issue. If this was an exploit in order to gain remote access as it seems, it is not yet a CVE which led me to want to tap the ports on incoming traffic so we could see what was really hitting this switch. That however will have to wait till tomorrow to see if the issue returns."

My problem is the the semi annual vulnerability list published by cisco last week : URL When generating the cisco prime report, i expected to see a lot of devices vulnerable, but it s not the case. It seems that Cisco Prime PSIRT definition are not up to day. Questions : * does anybody have any clue of the usual delay between the vulnerability publication and the update of the PSIRT report on Cisco prime ? * Given a specific CVE, is there a way to have the visibility on Cisco prime if the CVE is checked in the PSIRT report ? and which devices are not patched specifically on this CVE ?"
7,CVE,Cisco,3925 CUBE - SIP Message Date/Time stamp and IOS 15.5(3)M6,2,6t0wui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cisco/comments/6t0wui/3925_cube_sip_message_datetime_stamp_and_ios/,2017-08-11 22:48:01,"I am testing out a new IOS in my DR site. Our DR site doesn't handle active calls so it's a good place to test new IOS releases. I am upgrading to attempt to remediate CVE-2017-6736. I have my router using NTP and it's set to EDT. I upgraded from IOS 15.4(3)M6 and I've noticed that SIP messages started sending the Date/Time header as EDT instead of GMT. So this causes the upstream QFlex to fail to initiate inbound calls. What's interesting is that my production CUBE still running IOS 15.4(3)M6 is sending SIP messages with date/time stamps using GMT while the router is again using NTP and is set to GMT. Anyone know a quick and dirty way to configure 15.5(3)M6 to send date/time stamp headers in SIP messages as GMT? I believe I need to set both request and response headers this way. I believe I need to do something with the active sip-profile. I was researching using [this link](URL It mentions how to remove headers but not change them. **Update:** TAC got back to me. This is a confirmed bug. The [RFC for SIP](URL states that all messages require Date/Time stamps to be in GMT. [CSCvf0713](URL is being internally modified to represent more versions of IOS impacted by this bug. In the meantime, Cisco informed me that most likely the upstream QFlex is rejecting request/response mainly because it doesn't see the key term GMT in the date/time stamp field. I am going to update my SIP profile to the following to see if that temporarily fixes the issue. If not, I'll just revert to 15.4(3)M6 until the bugfix is released. ! voice class sip-profiles 111 response ANY sip-header Date modify ""EDT"" ""GMT"" ! This should effectively rewrite all instances of EDT being sent in my date/time stamp from EDT to GMT. It will not update the time, but again, I was told that most devices upstream are only going to look for ""GMT"" and not do a validation on the actual time. I'll post back tomorrow after I've tested and updated my CUBE. Cisco has accepted this as their problem as their SIP stack in the latest IOS versions is not correct. "
8,CVE,Cisco,Confirmed Cisco Bug - CSCvf07153 SIP Date header format not in GMT,8,6t1a5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cisco/comments/6t1a5z/confirmed_cisco_bug_cscvf07153_sip_date_header/,2017-08-11 23:53:02,"[Official Cisco Bug](URL impacting SIP. I spoke with TAC and the issue is more widespread than the published impacted version. I made [this post](URL prior to TAC getting back to me, but TAC confirmed that IOS 15.5(3)M6 is impacted by the issue. Apparently it impacts all the recently released SIP stacks. RFC states that SIP messages must be sent with date/time stamps in GMT. Cisco bug changes date/time stamps to local timezone setting (I believe). If your Date/Time on your routers/SBCs is in GMT you might not ever see the problem. As such, I would test any new IOS firmware versions you want to apply to your network devices. I discovered the bug in my environment/lab attempting to remediate CVE-2017-6736. "
