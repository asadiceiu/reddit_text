Network security is a thankless awful job. New vulnerabilities are discovered constantly. Your platform might rely on 20 different pieces of software and one vulnerability in any of them could destroy you...how are those vulnerabilities found?...hackers. Some are white hat and publish papers on their findings and you get a CVE report with recommended fixes. Trust me you dont know the half of what goes into software and literally no online software system is safe no matter what anybody tells you. Then you have to fight the business side if you want to take downtime to upgrade or patch a vital piece of software because all they see is lost revenue while you are down. Ive worked places where we KNEW the vulnerabilities of a system for years but were never given time and resources to fix them because other shit was deemed more important. Ultimately I work for them and will do what Im paid to do after I did my job of repeatedly raising the concern. Its not like Im going to rewrite THEIR software for free in my spare time for no money just because they wont listen to the concerns Ive been screaming from the rooftops...but if you think software security is easy you are insane. It is a constant game of trying to patch and fix obscure vulnerabilities people find. Version 1.3.6 might be vulnerable but 1.3.8 fixed that and now you need to upgrade critical infrastructure across your entire system quickly while also limiting downtime and being confident the upgrade wont break something else you didnt anticipate and bring your entire platform down. Software isnt fucking easy dude. Everybody bitches at us system administrators because when everything works they wonder why they are paying us but if some obscure thing that screwed over some of the best engineers in the country happens we are assholes for not predicting something we cant predict and are literally not paid to do. If I told my boss I spent the last two weeks pouring over the new nginx codebase trying to break it he would ask me why the fuck Im doing that instead of closing tickets for new features. Stop blaming good software engineers for a literal known thing. Do you think a company like Twitter isnt hiring top tier engineers and admins and security guys? Of course they are...this is just the nature of the business. Everybody wants their shit online and easy and whines until something bad happens and then they cry that a known issue with software - that vulnerabilities will be found- happened. Half the big data leaks at places like government contractors come from non tech employees with customer data on their laptop leaving it in their car and it gets stolen. Just ask SAIC. Or it is regular employees with low level access being phished for credentials and being stupid enough to do it and exposing their entire fucking company. Stop blaming the engineers who work really hard doing their fucking job and being woken up at4AM to fix issues so you can still do your banking or jerk off to porn at your leisure ''' [Context Link](URL [Go1dfish undelete link](URL [unreddit undelete link](URL Author: /u/dextersgold

There are plenty of Linux distros to choose from and it can make selecting a distribution quite confusing when the goal is security. Most of the people don't even realize the difference between ""security"", ""privacy"" and ""anonymity"" and Google isn't helpful with it's silly ""[15 Most Secure Linux Distros For Privacy And Security]^^1 "". Also people most of time don't want ""special"" players like Qubes OS or Tails (which cannot be even compared, you see), they want something different. Now, don't get me wrong. This is not an r/findmeadistro post, though it probably leads to selecting a proper distro for a reader. But this post is intended as an insight into the current state of the real Linux security. There were [multiple]^^2 [times]^^3 when patches introduced bugs and even vulnerabilities, and the most impactful ones I am aware of were introduced by distro maintainers (remember Meltdown mess?) At the same time, it's not just about security teams. It is also about distributions and has an ambiguous word ""best"" in it, which allows me to slightly modify the course of question: security is not just about patching vulnerabilities in time. It's also about picking right tools from the beginning, including TLSv1.3 (which is likely not yet available for Debian users), ECC (specifically, Ed25519 support in software), etc. And my question is intended to find out the most competent AND active community. This is a very complicated question, actually. For example, take a look at Arch Linux's [security page]^^4 which usually has lots of vulnerabilities opened because they rely on upstream directly. Then, take a look at a nice utility called [arch-audit]^^5 . And then read about [malware in AUR]^^6 . I also believe there was a story about Arch getting security fixes faster than Ubuntu. And then think about how fine-grained control over your OS can help security. Let's clarify some things and recap: * By security I safety from unauthorized data access and identity stealing, not ""anonymity"" or ""privacy"" - two words that almost became trademarks because of incompetent ""TOP 10"" approach. * A person who responds to this post must be aware that some CVEs are not exploitable by themselves, as well as the well-known fact that correlation does not mean causation, i.e. ""bigger userbase"" or ""Canonical-backed"" does not mean that a distro has a better security team. Look at [Linux Mint]^^7 , I [dare]^^8 you! * By ""best"" I mean ""providing security patches fast enough with sufficient code quality"" and ""providing **actually** safe defaults"". Cheers!

In my opinion, Deepin is much like Ubisoft and EA in some ways. They do have some very brilliant ideas, but they do not treat the quality of their software seriously. They also do not treat the issue of copyright/licensing seriously enough (just like the streaming plugin of their music player). First things first, they actually allowed something that is not allowed in any of the major Linux distributions, that is their desktop environment relies on a version of WebKit which contains many security vulnerabilities. They have used a modified WebKit 1.8.2 for nearly three years and as we know today, this version contains at least some of the following CVEs and they left them unpatched: - CVE-2013-2909 - CVE-2013-5195 - CVE-2013-0905 - CVE-2013-0902 - CVE-2012-5851 - CVE-2012-3650 - CVE-2012-3697 Their version of WebKit also will not compile on newer versions of GCC and requires dirty hacks to work which may potentially introduce more bugs and vulnerabilities to the package. Considering the fact that Deepin is actually backed by a commercial firm which want to compete in the Chinese (government) market with Red Hat, Novell, Canonical, and a few other Chinese firms, this kind of software quality is totally unacceptable. Even community distributions like Arch Linux and Gentoo will not tolerate this kind of security risk. This is also one of the few main reasons that the projects of porting it onto other Linux distributions have mostly being stopped or been dropped. For example, all the AUR packages related to Deepin have been orphaned or out-of-date, gentoo-zh overlay is purging the related packages from their repository in the next 7 days, and AnthonOS (a not-so-famous distribution, initially a student project) have announced that they will drop Deepin packages within the next few months (all these porting projects have once made Deepin ""proud""). Because the packages maintainers simply cannot continue maintaining the packages and introducing security hazards to end users. Another part reflecting their software QA is how they built their package. According to the maintainers of gentoo-zh overlay and opensuse-zh repository, the build scripts of Deepin packages invoked sudo directly. At least, doing this is very dangerous in some ways and can only be considered as a hack which should never appear in release versions or stable branches, but that was exactly what they did. Besides software quality, Deepin is also not a good player in terms of copyright/licensing. Around a year ago, Deepin got a special volume licenses from CrossOver which grants its users full license of CrossOver Linux. There is nothing wrong with this act as Deepin is a commercial firm after all. However, then Deepin started to packages some Chinese commercial Windows software (mainly freemium software) like QQ without permission from the original developers like Tencent. What is more, they reversed engineered these software and removed embedded advertisements and installable components similar to OpenCandy prior to their packaging. They even shipped CrossOver and these repackaged Windows software with their installation medium. Though these actions are severe violations of the EULAs of the Windows programs, they always claim that what they are doing is right and is a win-win for users, them, and software developers. Another severe violation of software EULA is that Deepin shipped Google Chrome as their default browser with their installation medium, which can be seen on the screenshots on Deepin. According to various sources, they did get permission from either Google or Adobe to do so, but they still redistributed Google Chrome and Adobe Flash Player in the name of ""conveniences for the end user"". On the other hand, Elementary show way more respect towards the rules and quality of their software. Though it is just a student project, they have been working very hard to polish their software before they claim it ""stable"". Though their code might be a long way away from the standards of Linus Torvalds, their code is already much cleaner than the ones of Deepin. Yes they may need a special version of GTK or Vala to compile, but their code at least does not rely on outdated software that puts users at risk, and they uses clean build scripts with no dirty hacks. Their code also compiles with almost no problem on the latest toolchain. Even Fedora is confident enough to include their Pantheon environment in version 22 as an alternative desktop environment. Though Elementary recently got lots of criticism because of Elementary OS: Why We Make You Type ""$0"", this in fact showed that they would rather rely on donations to keep the project running than doing some doubtful and questionable things that Deepin did to attract users and potential income. This made me respect them more than a commercial distribution which does nasty things and even claims to ""shame the ones who criticized them in two years with their own words (from Chinese social media Weibo)"". Deepin Linux was originally Hiweed Linux, a desktop oriented Linux distribution powered by a enthusiastic community which aims to ""Void the pain of the newbies and save time of the experts"" in a way much like Mandriva. It came out around the same time of other native Chinese distributions like MagicLinux but it became the only survivor of that era. However, now being run by a different group of people, it seems that Deepin has drifted away from its original objectives and became the ""betrayer"" of the FOSS community. Elementary, on the other hand, is more like a group of idealists creating a work of art, doing their best to create the perfect result. Though they have to ask for donations and follow an extremely schedule, they are doing a respectful and clean job and being respected by the FOSS community as innovators and artists. In my opinion, they are pretty much like the lines of this song: Pure Pure Heart (Song).

I'm most recently experienced with RHEL systems. I'm not asking for tech support, just trying to get a feel for what a typical Wind River Linux workflow would be. I am tasked with providing an estimate to migrate our product to run under Wind River Linux. I realize that other distros may seem more appropriate, but Wind River has specifically been chosen. This OS will essentially be a host for several containers, some of which will need to communicate between themselves and some of which will need to access external devices (e.g. ethernet, serial, etc.). I've read some of the docs for Wind River Linux, and can see that it's a derivative of the Yocto Project (which I've been wanting to delve into for some time). * I'm having trouble getting my mind wrapped around a workflow for a Yocto Project like Wind River. My understanding is that I would start with a base template (I think that's the right word) and then modify the build configuration to include pieces that the OS needs to support the installed applications. is this basically a typical ""dependency resolution"" problem (like I did with Slackware back in the day)? Basically: build an OS, try the applications, look at the errors, and add needed parts? * I think I saw that Wind River uses DNF for package management. Does that mean that, for example, if postgres is update due to a CVE, a deployed host (with postgres installed in the host, not in a container) would only need that rpm updated?

I know that Red Hat has [a CVE Database]^^1 , Debian has [CVE-compatible advisories]^^2 , and other big ditros provide something like this. I'm just wondering if there's a curated list of distros, whether they provide a list focused on their official repos, and if not what they recommend users do. This came to mind when I was looking into Void Linux, which apparently doesn't provide their own list, but stays close enough to upstream that the user can just monitor the CVEs themselves.

It's seriously well-engineered; even backwards compatible with older nodes which in the past, before this possibility was discovered, made it seem like a non-viable option because of the network's upgrade inertia. This backwards compatibility alone (aside from the other benefits it offers) makes it superior to other, more naive solutions such as ""just increase the blocksize to 2mb"" as this would require the entire network to update their software to succeed. Unfortunately, the designers of the deployment mechanism naively gave veto power to the miners, the ones that are making insanely high profits off the fees right now. Surprise surprise, they are unwilling to enable it. Then, news broke that one of the biggest players in the mining industry may be blocking the upgrade because it is incompatible with its secret patented tech. Tech, btw, that is directly in conflict with Bitcoin's security assumptions, exploiting a weakness in the Bitcoin mining algorithm so seriously that it now has a CVE number. UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) is a movement of users that are not cool with this kind of corporate takeover of Bitcoin. BIP148 is the specific UASF that is now gaining a lot of traction and is already represented by over 10% of listening nodes in the network. What it aims to do is to economically force the miners' hands into activating the existing deployment of Segwit by boycotting all non-signalling blocks. On Litecoin, the mere threat of this same UASF led the miners to fold on their blockade. On Vertcoin, the UASF actually overcame a blocking miner that kept up an extended fight, wasting tons of money on mining more incompatible blocks than there were compatible blocks. With Bitcoin the stakes are much higher, and the disinformation campaigns much bigger. Keep a critical eye open to everything you read, and make up your own mind. Educate yourself, for your own good. Being passive is not the safe, neutral option. If you want to understand truly how insane the game theory is at this point, read the plea for rational extremism. It is accurate as far as I can tell. If you are interested in chatting there's a slack with a community support channel with a ton of pinned resources to help you spin up your own BIP148 node if you feel so inclined.
