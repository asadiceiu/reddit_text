0,vulnerability,security,"Performing apt upgrade in China, trustable or not?",1,fhcsix,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/fhcsix/performing_apt_upgrade_in_china_trustable_or_not/,2020-03-12 18:50:01,"Is there any reason to worry if an `apt upgrade` on a Linux system was done in China without VPN? The `apt update` was performed over the VPN to outside of China so that should not be any issue. When performing an `apt upgrade` afterwards without the VPN, I have noticed some of the packages were fetched from a certain .edu.cn domain and then some critical components such as firmware (on the RPi), kernel, llvm, etc. resulted in ""Undetermined Error"" (which I think is a good sign in this case). Question is, for those packages that have already been upgraded, should those be trusted or shall I consider the system had potentially exposed to a supply chain attack and therefore possibly compromised? In short, how easy / difficult to compromise Linux systems if you have total control over one or more of the official Debian apt sources? I have not been able to find any concrete references to the vulnerability of the Debian apt in related to a supply chain attack. Therefore this question."

Automated tools are an incredibly valuable way of testing for vulnerabilities, and when used effectively can help developers patch quickly and effectively. Relying purely on an automated tool for a vulnerability report wouldn't be my choice of submitting a report, Nash told The Daily Swig. If they went through and looked and confirmed all 5,000 vulnerabilities then my hat goes off to them, otherwise, I suspect there is a high level of false positives. It looks they are talking about 1,775 plugins with over 5,000 vulnerabilities, so I suspect again due to the automated nature they are probably hitting the same vulnerability and classifying it as new vulnerability each time it's referenced, he added. Despite these misgivings, Nash clarified that he felt the research was nonetheless worthwhile. None of that is to take away from the achievements, or the research done  they found potential vulnerabilities in 2% of plugins in the repository, Nash, an active member of both the WordPress and infosec communities, noted. We asked Garcia to confirm that the WordPress vulnerabilities discovered had been manually verified. Garcia responded: We have verified some manually and would say that most of them are vulnerable. We have not included functions that escape special characters We have only identified vulnerable plugins where the parameters are not validated. We know that maybe there are false positives, but we do not include as vulnerabilities code lines with validating functions like esc\_sql() or htmlspecialshars(), so we no that there are more than 5,000 POTENTIAL vulnerabilities, but the main thing is that the developers don't validate the SQL injections. ### RootedCON The two Spanish researchers presented their findings at the [RootedCON cybersecurity congress](URL in Madrid last weekend. The pair have developed a code analysis tool called WordPress Terror that analyzed the plugins. There are no immediate plans to release WordPress Terror to the wider community, according to Garcia. &amp;#x200B; More info: [URL"

I think I know of two ways this can happen on public Wi-Fi or on one's home network: 1) Since DNS requests are unencrypted, if an attacker can intercept DNS requests in a man-in-the-middle attack, he/she could send back the wrong IP address to a malicious site. 2) The attacker could log in to the administrative page of the router--assuming the person responsible for the router didn't bother to change the default password--in order to change the DNS server on the router to a malicious one--which would redirect all users on the network to malicious sites when they, for instance, make an attempt to visit the legit version of gmail.com. Otherwise, if the person responsible for the router did bother to change the default password on the router, an attacker could leverage a router firmware vulnerability, which would still allow the attacker to access the router's administrative console and change the DNS server to a malicious one. Is all the above correct? Are there any other ways a user can be redirected to a malicious website on public Wi-Fi or on one's home network, without intercepting DNS requests or changing the DNS server on the network's router, assuming the victim's computer hasn't been infected, yet, with malware, or the DNS server itself hasn't been hacked?"

Unfortunately, I found some seemingly serious issues while testing the app. So far I've found that I could enumerate all user accounts without any authentication; the responses to such requests include name, e-mail address, DOB, sex and various health-related items such as average heart rate and distance travelled for the day. There are other routes I could easily use to get more details such as ECG data for any user. Most seriously however is a route which would allow me to reset the password for any user, allowing me to take over any account if I so wished (I want to emphasise: I don't). I haven't of course exploited any of these vulnerabilities; I am not interested in exploits, only in security. I of course want to let the affected company know about these flaws, however I'm not sure of the best way to do this. I've checked to see if they have a bug bounty and they don't appear to. I could of course contact the company directly via their website, but I'm worried that they might perceive my message as a threat rather than what I want it to be, specifically just a friendly warning. I've heard stories where security researchers are targeted after reporting a vulnerability responsibly, so I certainly don't want to go down that road! Perhaps an anonymous tip of some kind would be the best option? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I only want to improve the security of this device and app for all of their users, I don't want these vulnerabilities to be exploited.

I was able to log in as him and now I have admin access to every installation his dealership has handled. How do I report the vulnerability responsibly? **Long version:** My parents have a large building with a modest enterprise network deployment from a very large hardware manufacturer in the smart home space. The house was set up by a dealer. I recently was replacing some hardware around the house (removing doorbirds, installing nest helloes, etc etc) and discovered the WAP signal was too weak to reach all the devices. My dad told me that the dealer had been out to the house to reduce the transmission signal for the network because my sister had complained that she was getting disconnected from the wifi when walking between floors. The dealer said that it was because the signal was too strong and was interfering. I know this is probably bullshit, because the wifi bands have separate channels, and each AP operates on a different one, so I set about trying to log in to the hardware and reconfigure it. This is where things got interesting. I discovered easily enough what the default gateway ip was and logged into the router using the default credentials for the manufacturer. I was relieved the dealer had not changed them. I discovered that the router didn't control the WAP transmission signal or even the SSIDs of the networks, and surmised there must be a controller on the network that is used to configure them. I downloaded the manufacturer's administration app. The app required an account with the manufacturer, and the manufacturer required a dealer code to register an account. I thought I was out of luck, but decided to prod at it a bit. I discovered that the router had remote administration enabled. I correctly surmised that this mean DDNS was enabled. I was not surprised to discover that the manufacturer offers their own DDNS service for anyone with an account (ie, any dealer with an account). The router was configured to use the manufacturer's ddns service and the dealer's credentials were saved. The username/password dialog boxes looked normal, but using chrome's inspect element tool on the password box lead me to discover that the router's http server was actually populating the saved password in plain text in the ""content"" attribute of the dialog box. The normal  was rendered on view, I assume, achieved by some other HTML attribute on the element. Anyway, I logged in to the administration application using the dealer's email and password from the DDNS settings and discovered that I now had access to every deployment the dealer has ever installed: restaurants, stores, and several homes. Needless to say, I was able to find the IP of the WAP controller and adjust the signal transmission power. Next time I'll stick with port scanning the LAN for open 80. I'd like to responsibly notify the manufacturer of this blatant security flaw, but I'd also like to avoid getting sued. Ideally, if possibly, I'd also like to return all their equipment for a full refund, go with an alternate manufacturer, and be able to blog about this publicly. Thanks for reading!"

I've left it in Airplane Mode when sleeping many times, in an area that is shielded from 95%+ of outside RF, and noticed it (RF Meter) waking me up occasionally with the 'beeper' setting turned on. The broadcast pings persisted through a software update from 12.4.2 (or something) to 12.4.3 with only a Wi-Fi connection and no cellular connection being used during the update process or afterwards. *I haven't had any faith in technology since 2015, when everything at my work and at home was hacked (possibly through Kaspersky root certificates or other features), but this is an unfortunate new low. An iPhone was among those monitored during that period, and a Steam RCE vulnerability discovered because of it (assumption due to timing). Whether its researching Lazar's claims, downloading a CIA document on Illuminati bloodlines (don't do it its a psyop fluff-piece), or the rumors of intolerant neighbors, there must be some reason that the pings are now operating from Airplane Mode when they didn't before. Will I ever find out? Probably not.* P.S. Law Enforcement around here used the ""Exigent Circumstances"" catch-all to get a ping running against my phone without a warrant one night, and from then on it seems that they enjoy taking every legal liberty they can. Now with a nearly unlimited legal authority to perform thorough investigations, I can only hope that they are reasonable in their assumptions and not out for blood (they usually are). My home button quit working randomly so I can't reset the working memory of the iPhone by holding the power button and then the home button when the slide to power off Springboard overlay menu comes up, nor can I use it to hard-reset the phone. I may keep the phone in Airplane Mode until I get a new power button ordered just in case this post is read, thus connecting it to the telecom network would allow the deletion of a piece of code. If any of you can tell me how I can copy the working memory off the phone with a side channel or chip reader I *may* feel obliged to try it out. If the memory is encrypted on-die with these iPhones that would make the effort impractical. Something tells me there is an alternative storage where this code can persist between Apple software updates."

The process would then take over CPU usage. I scanned the file and didn't find anything, until I decompressed it with UPX. Then online antiviruses recognized it as Linux/Bitcoinminer.c. The IP address when accessed through web gave a message ""proxy miner is on"" or something like that. That is, the thing itself looked harmless to an extent.

As it is considered by numerous individuals as a practical option in contrast to traditional fundraising routes and may turn into a convincing methodology for organizations going forward, this emerging method for investment is, as yet, working out its curls. ICOs use cryptocurrency as their essential financing instrument and, in that capacity, offer a new avenue for inventive organizations to do things differently. These are gaining more and more attention as people are drawn to cryptocurrency following new blockchain startups that have raised progressively larger amounts of capital. In any case, the ICO course may show both great and troublesome results. While ICO fraud and failures detrimentally affect cryptocurrency's notoriety, successful ventures give cryptocurrency greater credibility in the eyes of society. Luckily, there are good-natured organizations in the cryptocurrency space that give important instructions, just like this [Article](URL from KuCoin, on how to cement the viability of a certain ICO. Anyone can learn from the setbacks, and improve their methodologies for analyzing ICO projects. For the development of the industry, ICO projects as well as speculators must evolve in order to maximally protect the interests of both large funds and small private investors. It is critical to divert the flow of assets from inconsistent projects over to new companies that are extremely enthusiastic about their thoughts. Doing this will ultimately improve the industry as a whole."

The symbolic link method used to for the escalation got me thinking if there are any other services or programs that have a similar vulnerability. So I made and put [this tool](URL on GitHub that checks Windows registry keys under HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE if non-admins/regular users have permissions to create symbolic links there. Turns out there are quite a few. Now, that alone doesn't mean they are vulnerable, but it's still something that should be looked further in to. So I'm here to share some findings someone might be interested in. Notably there are some registry keys where non-admins don't have direct write permissions to, but can still create symbolic links. This might be an issue if such key is used to store temporary subkeys that could be replaced by symbolic links for example.

These should be checked if they are used by any privileged processes and see if they can be of use. I do realize the list below contains some apps I have installed on my computer, but this is fine. You may also note Steam is also still listed here and that's because it still falls under the category. The fix Steam issued stopped the background service from updating privileges to the keys on startup, which seems like an appropriate fix. It stops access being granted to symbolic link target keys by actions regular users can do (restarting the background service). My guess is these privileges are now only set when Steam is first installed, which requires admin privileges and thus is safe.

Just before he left, he was in contact with someone at Acunetix (Website Security Scanner). Now that he is gone, I am supposed to take responsibility on that (the security team in my company is now reduced to one person : me, 0 years of experience). Acunetix is expensive and I have no idea why he wanted to go for this solution. Our solutions are all hosted on AWS, and we started working recently with Security Hub. I think it adds a layer of complexity to add another tool external to AWS while we monitor and scan everything in there. However, I have no idea what the power of Acunetix actually is and if it is worth it or not. I also read a bit about Sonarqube and Veracode, but I dont see major winning points. So what is your opinion ? Is Acunetix worth it for the price? Can I manage vulnerability scanning more easily with AWS services ? Is there an even better solution ? Thanks a lot for your input ! TL;DR: I am the only security person in my company since my coworker left without any handover. I need to make a decision : do we for now on use Acunetix or do we keep on using AWS services such as Inspector / GuardDuty Advice needed !"

It was supremely easy to get hired in IT then. Today I have followed the money and have landed in health care in which infosec is absolutely boring unless you think HIPAA compliance and policies are a great thing. I have done the scope dope motioning in a SOC. I have done the penetration tests for vulnerabilities. I have created policies and procedures for compliance. It all sucks. Companies hate security. They dont want to pay for it and only grudgingly acknowledge it. Government or security councils are the only reason they comply. If you enjoy sitting in meetings then infosec is for you. If you love being the first person blamed for stuff then youll love being infosec. If you love writing and updating policies and procedures youll love infosec. If you love BS risk assessments that nobody wants to complete, few want to remediate and that are only done because the government says so, youll love infosec. If you love creating metrics so you can justify your job to sr mgmt (why am I paying for this system again?) then youll love infosec. Think itd be fun to push a button to run the monthly vulnerability scan, create the report, distribute and then be the one who has to update the spreadsheet acknowledging, typically, the lack of remediation? (Why didnt you update he server. Vendor says we cant. You do know that Wanna Cry is still a thing. Doesnt matter. The thing still runs on Win98.) Youll be answering for it when something gets hacked even though nobody is accountable or cares. Think youll be working with the latest SIEM? Probably not. A competent CIO will likely engage a MSP to do that for you. Youll have the boring pleasure of being the person that they contact when something alerts that needs handling. Then youll make a call to have it looked at because, you know, they dont give you admin access. Separation of duties and all. Youre the middle man. Funny how the job advert was so specific that you needed to know cloud, SIEM, MS, routers, switches and here you sit writing a new hire security orientation. I mean, they expect you to know EVERYTHING but you wont actually DO anything. Perform one risk assessment and tell me youre not already bored. If you are lucky enough to be on a red team that actually has a CIO/CISO that thinks its great for their guys to sit around playing with tools to break into systems and networks, like a govt think-tank, then the job is probably not boring. You know, companies want to make money. Spending on security does not help in that regard. Its like insurance. Its only useful when something gets exploited and then its all your fault even though you didnt have the headcount or budget to actually make a difference. The only infosec job I liked was one where the company culture was A+. Even then the job was boring. But the company made it tolerable. Unfortunately it was in ATL and no amount of sweet culture could overcome the congestion. Yea, its boring. And sucks. Im glad there are young bucks waiting impatiently to get their chance because Im out. Let me know how its going after your 20 years. All that AI should be interesting."

They get blocked for 2 hours after 3 tries by fail2ban, and have about 20 or so IPs that they are rotating through, but the fact that the effort seems so low has me wondering, could this be some kind of byproduct of a bigger attack I'm just not seeing? Like exploiting some kind of vulnerability but it just happens to also trigger those log entries? This also appears to be targeted, because my SSH is on a non standard port, so it's not just random bots or anything, as I doubt those bother to scan every single port, they just look for port 22 and go for low hanging fruit. I mean I suppose it could be a random attack but it just seems more targeted given they bothered to do a full port scan. I very rarely get login attempts but my phone has been lit up all day. I have 31 blocked IPs as I type this. I don't see anything else weird though... but I have been getting lot of threatening emails saying my email is hacked and they want bitcoin (it's hosted on that same server) but the passwords they are telling me they used are wrong. Though some of them are my old passwords for other web services that I've since changed. Basically they say they have webcam footage of me watching porn and I don't even have a webcam, nor watch porn. (serious, I'm Christian) But I'm more worried about the idea that they might somehow be getting into my server and are just good at hiding their traces. As far as I know these emails are mostly just scams but do wonder what kind of effort they are actually doing to hack people. I mean if they really do get in and actually do find discriminate info then they have even more ammunition. Should I be worried? I'd like to think that I run a rather tight ship, but I'm no security expert especially when it comes to the more advanced hacking like where they can send specially formatted packets that start to do all sorts of weird stuff. Like looking for 0-day exploits etc. I understand there's way more to security then just having a good firewall and brute force protection and strong passwords and all that. Real hacking actually bypasses all of that completely by finding a flaw in the firewall, software, etc. Also one log entry kinda weirded me out, I forget the exact line, but it was basically a disconnection notice, but the IP was nowhere else! Normally the client connects, tries to login, fails, disconnects so you see the IP show up for those actions. But this particular entry was just a disconnection, and that's it. I even did a grep search for the IP address in case it was very far up in the log or something but did not find anything. How would this happen? I tested what happens if I just telnet to the port and disconnect, but I get a different message."

103,vulnerability,security,15 free WiFi security testing tools,1,aqvduv,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/aqvduv/15_free_wifi_security_testing_tools/,2019-02-15 21:44:45," For enterprise IT managers and network administrators, the best way to protect a relatively fragile WiFi network is to hack into your own wireless network with the most popular and ""hot"" tools in hacker circles and figure out a network security vulnerability And targeted reinforcement. Here are 15 free (nearly free) WiFi network intrusion detection tools introduced by cio.com. These tools will help you discover the security risks of rogue APs and weak Wi-Fi passwords, and make up for the vulnerabilities before hackers visit. 1, Vistumbler scanner The WiFi scanner can discover details of nearby APs, such as signal strength, security mode and MAC address. WiFi sniffers, on the other hand, capture the raw packets of the wireless network and import these packets into other tools such as decryption tools. Vistumbler, a WiFi scanner, is an open source Windows program that displays basic AP information such as authentication and encryption, and even reads SSID and RSSI. Also graphically shows the signal strength. Vistumbler also supports GPS devices, with different local WiFi network connection, the output of other formats of data. 2, Kismet Kismet is an open source WiFi scanner, packet sniffer and intrusion policy system that runs on windows, Mac OSX, Linux and BSD. Kismet can display AP details, including hidden SSIDs, as well as raw wireless packets, and import data into tools such as Wireshark and TCPdump for analysis. In the Windows environment, subject to the driver, Kismet only works with CACE AirPcap wireless cards. But on Mac OSX and Linux, Kismet is compatible with many wireless cards. 3, WiFi Analyzer WiFi Analyzer is a free Android app that can be used to search for AP Hotspots on Android tablets and Android phones. The WiFi Analyzer can show the AP specific information in the 2.4GHz band and some of the devices in the 5G band. You can send the AP information list (XML file) to the mailbox or other programs, or you can take a screenshot of the screen. The WiFi Analyzer can graphically display the channel signal strength, history, and frequency of use, and the WiFi Analyzer itself is a good one Signal intensity detector. 4, WEP, WPA / WPA2 crack tool: Aircrack-ng There are many tools that can crack WiFi encryption, but they can only crack WPA / WPA2 PSK passwords by using WEP security flaw or violent dictionary attack. WPA2 AES / CCMP encryption is still a relatively safe choice. If using WPA2 PSK mode, then your password length is preferably more than 13 mixed characters. Before your Wi-Fi network is compromised or ""rub"", it is best to use self-cracking tools to attack. Aircrack-ng is an open source WEP / WPA / WPA2 PSK cracker that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and OpenBSD. You can download to VMware images or Live CD files. 5, Cloud Cracker As its name implies, Cloud Cracker is a commercial online password cracking service (cloud cracking) that charges $ 17 per 20-minute service and can be used to crack hashed encrypted password protected documents in addition to cracking WPA / WPA2 PSK passwords. CloudCracker dictionary 300 million passwords, computing power, you only need to crack the WPA / WPA2 handshake file or PWDUMP file upload, the rest to Cloud Cracker. 6, FreeRadius-WPE Although enterprise class WPA / WPA2 based on the 802.1X authentication protocol is safer than PSK, there are still security vulnerabilities. FreeRadius-WPE tool can help you understand the attacks on the enterprise WiFi network and better protect the network. FreeRadius-WPE is a patch for the open source FreeRADIUS software that enables man-in-the-middle attacks on WiFi networks that use 802.1X authentication. The above article is what I saw on a website about [***CCIE security***](URL It feels very practical and I recommend everyone to collect it. &amp;#x200B; URL 7, Reaver If you are using a wireless router, then you need to pay attention to a security hole found late last year: Many router manufacturers provide WPS (one-button authentication mode, user-friendly to complete the router device connection authentication) PIN code can be cracked within hours . Reaver is one such tool. Reaver is a Linux program that can brute force WPS PIN and WPA / WPA2 PSK passwords for wireless routers in 4-10 hours. Reaver also offers a handy, dedicated hardware solution: Reaver Pro, with a graphical web interface. 8, WiFish Finder One of the most frequently used means of WiFi hackers is to hypothesize the fake AP hotspots, so-called ""evil twin APs"" or ""wireless honeypots."" When someone mistakenly links to this AP, hackers can capture any e-mail and FTP link data the user uses and can even access the user's shared files. Counterfeit AP tools can also fake DNS cache to display fake hotspots or website landing page to obtain user login account. WiFish Finder is an open source Linux program that captures wireless network data passively and proactively detects and discovers vulnerable wireless clients. The WiFish Finder can generate a list of network requests for client requests and detect the type of security for those requested networks. 9, wireless honeypot: Jasager Jasager (based on KARMA) is a Linux firmware that provides a set of Linux tools to discover wireless client vulnerabilities similar to WiFish Finder, but the big difference is that it can be used for wireless honeypot attacks. Jasager can run on FON or WiFi Pineapple router. It can configure soft APs, generate SSIDs for nearby wireless clients, and provide DHCP, DNS, and HTTP services to wireless clients. The HTTP server can tell network access requests to specific websites. Jasager also captures and displays the plaintext POP, FTP, or HTTP login information for any victim. Jasager has a web-based command line interface. 10, Fake AP Fake AP runs on Linux and BSD systems and can generate thousands of fake APs by transmitting SSID frames. Fake APs can be used by attackers to confuse IT staff or intrusion policy systems, but can also be used by average consumers to confuse street hackers. 11, WiFiDEnum WiFiDEnum (WiFi Driver Counter) is a windows program that helps discover wireless network device driver vulnerabilities and protects against exploits of wirelessly-driven vulnerabilities. The ability to scan for limited or wireless Workstation network, mobile wireless card driver details, and identify potential security vulnerabilities. 12, Nmap Many veteran cable eavesdropping and attack tools can actually be used for wireless networks such as Nmap, an open source TCP / IP scanner that can be used to discover hosts and clients in the network. Nmap can run on windows, Linux, Mac OS X, has a graphical interface and command line interface. Nmap can report operating system information on the network, types of services provided, packet filters, or firewall types to help find unsecured hosts or ports. 13, Cain and Abel Cain and Abel are password-recovery, cracking and sniffing tools on Windows that can be used to show how to sniff out plain text passwords from the web. 14, Firesheep fire sheep Fire Sheep Firesheep is a Firefox plugin capable of HTTP session hijacking, which is bypassing hijacking. Fire sheep can monitor user web login information in the network and exchange login cookie, that is to say as long as the fire sheep scans your website login cookie, the computer running the sheep can enter the same website as you need without inputting the password account , Such as online banking, online stores, social networks and web e-mail. 15, BackTrackConsider a very popular Linux-specific software - BackTrack, the software preset more than 320 intrusion testing tools, can be widely used in the field of web, web servers and so on. You can install BackTrack to your hard drive or install it from a bootable CD or USB drive."

But given my background I've gone and advocated better security practices for friends and family (better passwords, two-step auth, and so on). Recently I was reading that mobile malware and breaches were going to be more of an issue in the future and I realized that with one's email, app accounts holding login, and two step all being routed through a mobile device, if someone were to get access to it you could side step all the extra precautions.

Now these days malwares are getting advanced day by day. New vulnerabilities getting discovered at lightning speed and takes more time to patch them, mean while systems remain vulnerable to unseen malware attacks which are yet to be added in anti virus databases. Let's say firm ABC uses two different anti virus solutions X and Y. Now major vulnerability comes up in market and cyber security researchers starts to upload malware signatures to public databases such as virus total and anti virus vendor for solution X updates thier database instantly and vendor for solution Y does it 1-2 weeks later. Meaning firm ABC's systems using Y anti virus solutions will remain vulnerable to malware attacks for 1-2 weeks. Now let's try to solve this problem with blockchain technology. As we all know blockchain based ledger can store and distribute data globally and make it available to everyone in few seconds. What if we can develop a system which can store malware signatures on block chain uploaded by community trusted cyber security researchers and all anti virus solution utilises this unified system of malware database. So now whenever new malware is discovered by cyber security researchers all anti virus solutions gets updated with new signatures so they can layout detection techniques for them in less time and security researchers gets paid in crypto currency to support them in thier further research work. This way we are enabling malware researchers directly protecting thousands of businesses relying on anti virus solutions. Don't forget to up vote if you liked my idea :) "

As I understand it, the vulnerability is present when a TPM running vulnerable firmware generates an RSA key. At that point, the public key can be used to derive the private key. My question, however, is how this affects secure boot in current versions of Windows. As far as I know, the TPM does not perform any key generation for secure boot and the secure boot keys are managed by Microsoft. Therefor, as far as the end user is concerned, ROCA isn't really relevant in the context of secure boot. Is this correct?"

The bug allows anyone with local physical access to a computer to access the last logged-in users full account - even after that victim believes they've signed out. This includes after the browser is closed, quit, and the computer has been restarted. This bug exposes personal identity information, financial information, and financial account access - including the ability to withdraw funds (some accounts may have additional security protecting against funds withdrawn, but not all). I have responsibly disclosed this bug through the company's bug bounty program on January 26th. I have made at least four attempts to be aggressive in helping the company support/security team recognize the severity of this bug. But their responses have all been a form of ""working as designed"" and ""it's not great, but that's the way it works"". (Unbelievable I know, but those are the facts for this case). I attempted to report this bug to the relevant US government regulators. The regulators responded, but did not request any details about the specifics of the bug. They had no follow up after a simple ""who are you"" call. I have informed the company that I contacted the US regulators. I believe this bug is likely one of the worst kind of bugs - because while it is not a remote access vulnerability, it is a very high impact vulnerability. It is very likely to cause a lot of damage to a few users. To those users, and perhaps even to the company, it will be completely inexplicable. Victims of un-authorized funds transfers will know they are victims, but to the company it will appear as a ""one off case of user-error"". Because there are so many users on this site, the exploit could occur many times before the company, regulators, or users identify the access vulnerability. Questions: 1) Are there any resources or experts that I could consult on whether public disclosure, for the purposes of applying pressure to the company, would be appropriate? (My hypothesis is that public disclosure is appropriate, based on the severity of the impact, the disinterest of the company, and the elusiveness of the cause) 2) Are there any other paths for disclosure that I should attempt before public disclosure? 3) If I were to publicly disclose, I would inform the company of a date of pending public disclosure. How many days of pre-disclosure time should I provide the company? (It has already been 30 days). "

Such remote access would bypass the OS, bypass antivirus, and whatever else exists on the targeted machine. In this thread, we will dispel or verify the cluster of rumors swirling around IME ""Intel Managment Engine"". Criticize and/or correct the following facts, liberally. + IME is part of the CPU, not the motherboard. + IME is a full operating system running through firmware. It is a redux of MINIX. + IME runs its own OS with its own dedicated CPU. + Intel pretends IME is a ""Feature"", but failed to disclose its existence in any public way. It was later ""discovered"" by a German security outfit. + The National Security Agency (NSA) became aware of the vulnerability posed by IME, and requested that Intel give them their own little ""switch bit"" to turn it off. Intel's engineers obliged --- in a move that effectively admits guilt. Netsec bloggers refer to this as the **""NSA bit""** now. + This IME stuff was not implemented in Intel chipsets until about 2015. It only effects certain ""generations"" starting from gen 6 and later. + IME could be used to gain remote access to a machine over the internet -- in a way that is so drastic that some netsec experts call it a ""God Mode"".

Every one of these always claim to have the same bank-level encryption processes and they never store your data, but is it really that safe? Obviously anytime you give a password to a third party you're at risk, but do these kinds of apps open you up to more vulnerability than linking a PayPal account to your bank or saving a credit card on Amazon?"

They're scared it'll get TOO out of control, and they need to shut it down. 2. It's designed to send messages over the course of it's life.

As a last point, this 'virus' is missing one crucial sign that it's from somewhere other than western; Bad grammar.

I have wiped or replaced all the drives, encrypted all their sensitive data, and am even in the process of setting up TAILS to ensure maximum security. I knew that sensitive files (mainly religious pdf's and word documents) had been formulated on these computers and then uploaded to the internet, but since the hard drives were all new and no overtly identifiable information was present I thought nothing of these uploaded files.

As a privacy consultant I make a living off being paranoid (although this job was volunteer) and this made me think. If sensitive files metadata can revel the Mac address of the the Network interface Card (and quite frankly who knows what else), then ANY piece of hardware associated with these computers has to be replaced (even though they can still be used in the US, this is expensive) as there is no way to tell if some type of sensitive identifier (metadata or otherwise) has on some integral forensic level been associated between that sensitive file and say your mouse/keyboard or computer screen. I haven't heard of any other internal or external hardware causing a security risk, but after almost overlooking the massive danger caused by a files metadata being associated to the network interface card or a computer I would have thought safe, my paranoia is at an all time high (I'm not exactly a forensic expert).

Hashes and salts protect against password theft, but not against hackers inserting their own hashes &amp; salts into the system's user database. Let's say you have a daemon that provides a web interface. This web interface also has a form for adding new users (standard registration form with username, password, password confirmation, and some sort of CAPTCHA). The daemon then hashes and salts the password etc. But this implies that the daemon has to be able to write to the user database. Now imagine that there is a security vulnerability in this daemon. A hacker exploits this, and has now access to the system, with the same privileges as the daemon itself. If the system is set up properly, then the daemon isn't running as root, so the hacker won't be able to mess up the entire system. But, he can manipulate the user database! So, the hacker could introduce a new user by manually inserting a username, hash, and salt. How could one protect against this, or at least detect this? Even if the user database were controlled by a different process, that process would be unable to distinguish between requests coming from the daemon and requests coming from a hacker who compromised the system. Some internal public-key setup would also fail simply because any keys the daemon uses for authentication would also be within reach of the hacker. Two ideas I've come up with: 1) The weak point is the registration process, more precisely, the fact that it immediately creates a new user. Instead, the form could just issue a registration request to the admin. If this is possible, then it also becomes possible to disallow read-write user database access to the daemon. The manual user registration could be done by the damin through other, internal means. But what if the machine is an embedded device that is installed somewhere far away? How would admits access that? What if there are 5000 of these devices? How could admins handle this volume of devices? 2) Let the admins regularly audit the user list. This sounds much less secure than the idea at (1) though. Any other ideas?"

Some months ago I read about a SQL-Injection in Joomla 3.4 that would allow an attacker to perform a session hijacking. This is because Joomla 3.4 stores in the database the session value of each user that connects to Joomla. I thought that maybe saving the session value in the database might not be a good idea, in particular if we consider CMSs where one might install additional third party plugins that could open the CMS to SQL-Injection. What is interesting is that a couple of weeks ago I performed some testing on an old web site I was given by a friend of mine. His web site was so old that he was still using Joomla 1.1. I could immediately find a SQL-Injection in one of the plugin that he was using, so I remembered of the session table and I looked for that. I found it, and I tried to show the effect of such a vulnerability. The thing is that .... I couldn't. I took the session value stored in the database and confronted it with the one in my browser and it was different. I checked the source code and it turns out that Joomla 1.1 generates a pseudo-random number, performs some md5 operations with that number as seed, and sends to the browser the pseudo-random number and stores in the database the result of the md5 operations. This wouldn't allow me to perform a session hijacking at all. So I started to wonder on what would be the best way for managing sessions values. Why storing them on the database? Why not simply using what the back-end programming language is providing (like session_start in php)?"

A little background: In the Army, I worked with radios, cabling, routers and switches, satellites, and (of course) computers. My next job was working as working as a service desk technician, working everything from ""My Outlook broke!"" to replacing motherboards. I now work in Cyber Security, utilizing McAfee's ePolicy Orchestrator and Tenable's SecurityCenter. I've worked with servers before as well. I currently have a home lab running two 2016 servers and two 2012R2 servers, with a few supplemental Linux servers. I've played with WSUS/SCCM, Active Directory, DNS and setting up a CA. I currently use Nessus for vulnerability management and Spiceworks for monitoring. I am fairly confident. I enjoy both quite well. I am unsure which path to choose. I would like to take on a role that includes both SysAdmin as well as Cyber Security. Any certifications that might help with both, or any that are good to have in general?

This is the first time I've dealt with this sort of situation. We're a reference website. Our revenue comes from ads. 98% of traffic is anonymous, mostly from Google. Hardly anyone creates an account. We collect no sensitive information -- no CCs, only email, password, and optionally gender, birthday, bio, website. An account gets you access to our daily email and a user forum. Admin accounts can moderate the forum and edit a limited selection of ancillary content on the site. The real content is accessed through a separate account system. Our engineering team is 4 people, none of whom are security experts. We've followed best practices as far as we know them. Never done a pen test or audit. We offered $100, based on URL He responded with these prices: - account takeover $1000 - sql injection $3500 - remote code execution $5000 So a big difference in prices. Also, I'm much more concerned about SQL injection and remote execution (which he did not initially mention) because they could to outages, which would be more costly to us than compromised accounts. My thinking is to ask him what vulnerabilities he has found, so we can know what we might be paying. If it's just one account takeover, I'd probably then see if he'll take $500, or if not, give him the $1000. He said he would be willing to share the exploit first and take our word that we will then pay him, which helps me trust him, though then I started to wonder if that's his intent and all of this is mind games intended to draw us deeper into some kind of extortion trap...so that's why I'm looking for guidance. Are there hidden dangers here? Should we cut off further contact and hire a reputable security firm to audit us? Or can I proceed based on my own/my teammates' judgment? "

While applying for a professional license from a US state licensing board, I accidentally discovered what I think is a serious personal information security problem. In brief, the website generates PDF forms populated with sensitive personal and professional information intended to be distributed to various parties and completed as part of the application process. I discovered by accident that the links to the populated PDF files are actually permanent, publicly accessible hyperlinks that do not require any kind of authentication to access. Anyone who has or can discover the links can therefore download PDFs full of sensitive information and these links presumably exist for all of the thousands of applicants to the board. I am intentionally being vague about the name and location of this board to avoid giving anyone ideas before I can report this tomorrow when the board is open, but is my sense correct that this is a big vulnerability? Is it a simple matter to scan a domain for random gibberish file names? Could search engines be indexing these files? Should it be assumed that this information has already been compromised?

We have a corporate anti-malware tool for standalone machines and servers, but more than half of our physical machines do not have the resident agent installed. Those machines either have an old client that we no longer use, or the Microsoft consumer client (which can't get updates, as our network dudes block MS update). Without the corporate client on all physical machines, I don't have any view of malware outbreaks, unless I detect them via other methods. 2. We use a SIEM, but key systems are not being monitored by it (corporate anti-malware server, email servers, database servers, HR management system, corporate web filtering software). Given our business, we host a fair amount of HIPAA, potentially valuable PII, and will soon be handling cardholder information. Not having the monitoring tool we've chosen integrated with all systems that should be, in my opinion, monitored, makes me feel like I'm at work all day with my pants down. 3. We have a huge amount of legacy equipment and applications that are on our network, that are not compatible with more modern OS's, and maybe not even with the best patched versions of the antiquated OS's and hardware they use. So far, using this excuse, the guys who run our WSUS servers simply don't allow any windows security patches, to any of our machines. Thinking about future audits, vulnerability assessments, and potential breeches, this makes me really anxious. 3a. we don't have an inventory of legacy systems 4. A good portion of our user base runs on virtual machines, on the VMWare View platform. We have no anti-malware, at all, on either the physical hosts, or on the VMs themselves, at the recommendation of the implementing vendor. Their recommendation was that ""as users can't make changes to their VMs you don't need it. You can just spin up their base images again. This seems like a bad idea, although I recognize that our more traditional resident anti-malware client is not the right choice for the machines in that environment. The manager in charge of all the guys who created this mess wants me to write a position paper as to why I want to change the situations I've described above. While that's not an issue to produce, I feel like all of the above is basic stuff. I also feel like I can't even get to other stuff, like 2FA on our critical servers with cardholder or HIPAA data on them (for starters) until we make some headway on the above. Complicating this: I have no real titular authority in this organization, although I do have the backing of the director of my dept. I have to *convince* the manager of the guys who made this mess, that we need to do the work to make this right. I'd love to hear thoughts/advice. I'm feeling overwhelmed, and like I've stepped into a bad role."

I bought a game 3 days ago on playstation network for PS4, was playing last night and left it on - where I presume it went into stand-by mode at some point. I just got an e-mail saying there was a purchase made from my account at 6:27AM. Just a little background, I live with my girlfriend and my 14 month old son - No one was awake at 627 AM, and all the doors were locked. So I get this purchase, I got them to refund (After some arguing about ""online credit"" but I won that, but that only solved half my problem. So I ask for the IP address the transaction took place from. They said the transaction, 100% took place from my Playstation 4 Unit. Ooooooh, scary right? The call is coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE! I ask him for the information about when my playstation was woken from sleep mode, made the purchase, and then what time it went back into sleep mode. He tells me they can't give me that information, but they tell me the purchase took place from MY CONSOLE. I tell the guy he is full of it, and he says I should call the police if I think someone has been in my house. Now I am not a guy who believes in supernatural shit, and i don't believe either a ghost, nor a robber came in my house, booted up my TV, then playstation, signed me into PSN, confirmed the purchase, signed out, put the system back into sleep mode, and then left without disturbing anything else. And I am absolutely sure no one living here in my house made the purchase. I know what I say sounds unbelievable, and I'm a pretty savvy dude - So I tell the playstation guy I want to speak to their security department. He says they don't have one. I say, of course you must have a fraud department or something like that, again he says they don't. Now I am considering having the police come to my house so they can serve PSN with a subpoena for a 60$ purchase that I was refunded. Which sounds ridiculous, but this needs to be figured out. One more thing, PSN Firmware updated to 2.50 yesterday, cooincidence? Maybe Can nayone shed some light on WTF is going on?"

But a geek friend told me to just look for data loss prevention and mail security, I hesitated a little bit but in the end he convinced me to go at it. So I started to look for the cheapest solution I could find with the help of my friend ofc. We cale across a lot of providers but one caught my attention, so I went for it and everything was great. So since I havent an IT guy in the office yet, I had to call them every day about any problem even if its not their concerns but they helped immensely until I recruit an IT guy. So after 2 years the business had grown but there was no cybersecurity attacks or whatever so I said to myself why loosing that amount of money for nothing and I thought I shouldnt get another licence for the next year and I was willing to call them next week to end it. After two days a big big fire has happened in the next office and the fire got into mine as well, but fire men has managed to get the fire off but some computers were blown by the fire. But thanks to data loss prevention all the data was still on their server. I imagined if there was no solution I mean all my clients Purchase Orders nd info were list so if a client doesnt want to pay me then I have nothing to do because all the papers in the computers are gone.

Automated tools are an incredibly valuable way of testing for vulnerabilities, and when used effectively can help developers patch quickly and effectively. Relying purely on an automated tool for a vulnerability report wouldn't be my choice of submitting a report, Nash told The Daily Swig. If they went through and looked and confirmed all 5,000 vulnerabilities then my hat goes off to them, otherwise, I suspect there is a high level of false positives. It looks they are talking about 1,775 plugins with over 5,000 vulnerabilities, so I suspect again due to the automated nature they are probably hitting the same vulnerability and classifying it as new vulnerability each time it's referenced, he added. Despite these misgivings, Nash clarified that he felt the research was nonetheless worthwhile. None of that is to take away from the achievements, or the research done  they found potential vulnerabilities in 2% of plugins in the repository, Nash, an active member of both the WordPress and infosec communities, noted. We asked Garcia to confirm that the WordPress vulnerabilities discovered had been manually verified. Garcia responded: We have verified some manually and would say that most of them are vulnerable. We have not included functions that escape special characters We have only identified vulnerable plugins where the parameters are not validated. We know that maybe there are false positives, but we do not include as vulnerabilities code lines with validating functions like esc\_sql() or htmlspecialshars(), so we no that there are more than 5,000 POTENTIAL vulnerabilities, but the main thing is that the developers don't validate the SQL injections. ### RootedCON The two Spanish researchers presented their findings at the [RootedCON cybersecurity congress](URL in Madrid last weekend. The pair have developed a code analysis tool called WordPress Terror that analyzed the plugins. There are no immediate plans to release WordPress Terror to the wider community, according to Garcia. &amp;#x200B; More info: [URL"

I am 33 years old computer science college dropout and I have 7+ years of professional experience as frontend developer. When I was 4 exams away from graduation, two business opportunities presented themselves within the span of couple of weeks. The first offer was system administrator at the national library in the capital city of a country I live in. The second one was remote work as frontend developer. Both of these are my passions, but I chose frontend development back then and that was my first official job in IT. After a month it was clear to me that I'm either gonna have to leave work and finish college, which I was only 4 exams away from graduation, or irrationally drop out from college and continue working. I dropped out and never looked back at my formal education ever again. Fast forward, here I am today. A 33 years old frontend developer with no wife and kids, and with a good salary. However, a day does not go by without thinking about that first gig offer as system administrator and what would my life be like if I chose that path. I think that gig was pretty much rigged in my favor back at the time, since my friend already worked there and he had some experience already. I was just a Linux enthusiast and it seemed to me that my friend was ready to drag me along with him through work until I get all the ropes, because I sure as hell wasn't qualified as system administrator back then by skills and expertise (I'm still not). However, after all these years, I just can't let go of this other passion of mine, which is cybersecurity. I have to try. Here's my starter roadmap: * Acquire Network+, Security+, Linux+ * Leave frontend development behind me, along with my senior position and good salary * Get a job as system administrator or network administrator, along with junior position and lower salary * Acquire CCNA, CySA+ * Get a job for entry level cybersecurity role of any kind Starter roadmap should be cleared in up to 5 years. I'm not sure how I'd like to progress after that at this point, but further progression may look something like this: CASP+, SSCP, GSEC, OSCP... I am **willing** to: * Leave frontend development, my second ongoing passion, behind me * Leave my current senior position * Leave my current good salary * Leave my current location I am **not willing** to: * Work second or third shift, but I am willing to appear at work at any time of day or night if an incident occurs * Work as help desk On work days, I am usually able to steal 2-3 hours of corporate time and learn for certification at work, plus additional 2-3 hours when I get back home after work. On weekends, I usually have around 20 hours of time to learn. Would it be considered as drawback if I look for a job for junior system/network administrator when I'm 33/34 years old? Would you jump into trial by fire if you were in my position right now? Am I being real here? I am kindly asking cybersecurity community of Reddit to share their thoughts with me on this topic considering my situation and, if possible, to provide their own most probable version of starter roadmap, where the last item on that map would be '**Get a job for entry level cybersecurity role of any kind**'. Thank you"

Unfortunately, I found some seemingly serious issues while testing the app. So far I've found that I could enumerate all user accounts without any authentication; the responses to such requests include name, e-mail address, DOB, sex and various health-related items such as average heart rate and distance travelled for the day. There are other routes I could easily use to get more details such as ECG data for any user. Most seriously however is a route which would allow me to reset the password for any user, allowing me to take over any account if I so wished (I want to emphasise: I don't). I haven't of course exploited any of these vulnerabilities; I am not interested in exploits, only in security. I of course want to let the affected company know about these flaws, however I'm not sure of the best way to do this. I've checked to see if they have a bug bounty and they don't appear to. I could of course contact the company directly via their website, but I'm worried that they might perceive my message as a threat rather than what I want it to be, specifically just a friendly warning. I've heard stories where security researchers are targeted after reporting a vulnerability responsibly, so I certainly don't want to go down that road! Perhaps an anonymous tip of some kind would be the best option? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I only want to improve the security of this device and app for all of their users, I don't want these vulnerabilities to be exploited. I've omitted the name of the device, app and company from this post for obvious reasons."

Two things that have been discussed (with nothing yet decided) include: r/cybersecurity is for more technical discussions about cybersecurity, discussing the concepts, technologies, and threats in that realm. r/security is for discussing (still cyber / information) security programs, management, c-level issues, and things like that.

Energy producers and utilities dont just keep the lights on. They play a unique role in a countrys critical infrastructure, encompassing economic health, public safety, and national securitymaking them appealing targets for state-sponsored hackers and saboteurs. For years, hackers linked to Russia and Iran have probed for weaknesses in energy and utility cybersecurity defenses around the world. Among their top prey: oil and gas producers, nuclear power companies, and electrical grid operations. And in nearly every instance, their strategies have included phishing emails targeting the weakest link in most organizations security: humans. Organizations hit by a continuous barrage of phishing attacks often face an expensive, high-stakes problem thats hard to solve with traditional email security practices. ###### Phishing: Rising Costs, Serious Risks The average annual cost of cyberattacks was $17.84 million per utility company in 2018, according to Accentures 2019 Cost of Cybercrime Report. Thats a 16% jump from 2017. Energy companies saw average annual losses rise to $13.77 million. Yet bad as it is, the consequences for successful email attacks on energy producers and grid operators can easily eclipse remediation costs. Government and cybersecurity company investigations have shown that state-sponsored attackers have spent years phishing for nuclear reactor technology, login credentials for power plant control engineers, and other sensitive data. The fear is that successful phishing campaigns could have serious consequences for the organizations that fall victim, as well as for the constituents and communities they serve. Its a valid fear. A 2017 report, for instance, found that one group of threat actors had successfully phished their way into US and European energy companies, gaining [hands-on access to power grid operations](URL In other words, they had the ability to shut off the lights in the countries these organizations operated. Why didnt they? We dont know, but analysts are concerned that the attackers are holding on to that information to exploit latermaybe at a time of international turmoil. Utilities are vulnerable to other types of email-enabled sabotage, too. A 2018 report from Aon describes a plausible scenario involving a [phishing attack on a hydroelectric dam contractor](URL Ten days after stealing employee credentials and accessing the dams control network, attackers could open all the floodgates all at once, causing catastrophic flooding. ###### Email Attacks Go Nuclear Energy companies and utilities operate advanced technology, and security has been a major issue since long before cyber-espionage was a glimmer in Putins eye. How are state-sponsored attacks getting around security controls? Sophisticated social engineering tactics delivered via email In the case of the US grid hack, investigators say conspirators linked to the notorious Dragonfly hacker group emailed [New Years Eve party invitations](URL to energy sector targets. They also sent emails with industry-centric content to get targets to open attachments that would exfiltrate the victims network login credentials. Last October, the US indicted seven Russian intelligence operatives for a phishing attack on Westinghouse Electric Companys nuclear power operations. In that case, phishing emails directed victims to a [fraudulent Westinghouse website hosted on a lookalike domain](URL and designed to collect employees login credentials. According to the Justice Department, the attack appears to have played a part in technical reconnaissance aimed at gaining access to IP addresses, domains, and network ports. In another phishing attack on US nuclear facilities reported in 2017, [criminals posed as jobseekers sending resumes](URL to plant control engineers. The resumes contained credential-harvesting malware that the attackers apparently hoped would give them access to safety and operational systems. Thankfully, the FBI reports that the perpetrators were only able to access business and administrative networks. That hack of the US grid that took bad actors all the way to operational access? It didnt start with an attack on power companies. Instead, the hackers targeted utility companies vendors and partner email systems. Once trusted email accounts at those organizations were successfully infiltrated, they were used to launch email attacks designed to dupe power plant employees into downloading documents and sharing sensitive information. And its getting worse. In 2019, there has been a spike in spear-phishing attacks on US oil and gas businesses. Investigators suspect Iran is the culprit behind one email campaign targeting executives with a [fake job recruiting message](URL impersonating the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Clicking the link would lead to the installation of malware like the kind that has struck Middle Eastern oil and gas installations in the recent past. Considering Irans track record of targeting companies like Saudi Aramco for data destruction, the current phishing campaign is a major concern for US fossil fuel producers and refiners. ###### Keeping Imposters Out of the Inbox In all these cases, attackers rely on the simple fact that people are highly susceptible to well-timed email messages that appear to be sent by people they trust. Old-school secure email gateways (SEGs) and first-generation advanced threat protection (ATP) products arent designed to filter out these advanced email attacks. As a result, individual employees are left to make snap judgment calls about the safety of the messages in their inbox. By contrast, modern email security solutions analyze incoming email based on past sender behavior and a host of other signals to identify messages that are authentic and trustworthy. Using our own solution as an example, [Agari Secure Email Cloud](URL applies advanced data science and real-time intelligence from trillions of emails to ferret out attempts at identity deception and block incoming phishing and other socially-engineered email assaults. In the event a phishing email slips through and is detected post-delivery, the solution contains it and even removes it from all the organizations inboxes automatically. As it stands now, Lloyds of London estimates that a single, [coordinated phishing attack](URL against power plants, utilities and other critical infrastructure could lead to $193 billion in losses worldwide. Which means energy and utility companies may find theres plenty of incentive to deploy solutions to protect against state-sponsored phishing attacksor risk getting zapped into major losses of their own.

You cant say where you feel the pain, or what type of pain, or what is making you sick. Without this information, it is nearly impossible for the doctor to know how to treat you. From a cybersecurity perspective, this is very much like calling every email attack a phishing attack or even a hack. It limits the ability to identify proper countermeasures, and it frustrates meaningful comparison between potential approaches. With cybercrime on the rise, threatening individuals, enterprises, and governments, it has become vital for the security industry to establish a common way of talking about the problem. It is our responsibility to enable organizations and their information security teams to clearly convey their concerns and request guidance matching their needs. To address this need for a common language, Agari has developed a classification system for types of cyber threatsa threat taxonomythat breaks down common email attacks in terms of how they are carried out, and what the attackers wish to achieve. At the same time, this taxonomy serves as a guide for enterprises and organizations with a need to enunciate their security concerns and priorities. While the taxonomy is not in any way limited to Agaris solutions, it is currently limited to attacks leveraging email or other types of messaging. URL The threat taxonomy describes communication-related threats from various perspectives or dimensions. It starts by considering the *classification* of the message: Is it a malicious message? Or is it simply an unsolicited message such as spam or grey mail? Next, the taxonomy looks at *sender authenticity.* If the sender is not who they say they are, is that person using an imposter email address, a compromised account, or a temporary account? Using these two dimensions alone, many of todays common threats can be described in a straightforward manner. Additional dimensions detail the sender identity, recipient, threat delivery, and motivation. As an in-depth description of the threat taxonomy is beyond the scope of this post, we can instead provide an overview of certain aspects that many of our customers have expressed an interest in. We do this by describing two common types of email-based attacks using the taxonomy: [business email compromise](URL (BEC) attacks and targeted attacks using compromised accounts, known as [account takeover-based](URL (ATO) attacks. ## The Threat Taxonomy and BEC Attacks BEC attacks were virtually unknown a few years ago, but have since risen to become one of the most prominent email-based threatsthe FBI estimates these attacks are responsible for more than [$26 billion in exposed dollar losses](URL over the last five years. This dramatic rise can be explained from several perspectives. One is that it is a *targeted* attack, meaning that the volume is low and the individual variation is relatively high, making the use of methods based on blacklisting largely irrelevant. This means that traditional security technologies simply dont apply, leaving most mail systems vulnerablewhich means, in turn, that the malicious emails will be delivered. A second reason is that these attacks take advantage of existing workflows and mimic business-as-usual conversations, making them instantly credible. In one common version of a BEC attack, the criminal simply creates a free webmail account and sets the display name to match the party he or she wishes to impersonate. Since reputation-based email filtering methods will typically deliver all emails from webmail accountsexcept those that have been observed to spew millions of unwanted emailsmalicious BEC emails are almost always delivered. And since most users, even when being careful, rarely look further than the display name when determining who an email is from, this type of identity deception is successful. ### Taxonomy of a BEC Attack URL Now, lets use the threat taxonomy to restate what we just said: Consider the first dimension of the taxonomy: classification. Since BEC attacks are inherently malicious, this is an easy one. Next, the *sender authenticity* can be an imposter, since these attacks commonly use display name deception. However, we have kept all our options highlighted here as BEC can take any form of sender authenticity. Looking at *sender identity* and *recipient*, we know that these emails are typically sent from a trusted source, such as an executive or partner, and they are sent internally to employees. Next, *threat delivery* showcases a response-based email. While typical [consumer phishing emails](URL contain URLs, and many [ransomware](URL attacks have attachments, cons like BEC attacks have neither as they typically look to receive a response from their target. As such, they are commonly harder to detectespecially for security vendors that use the approach of blacklisting URLs or attachments known to be bad. Turning to the last dimension of the taxonomy, *motivation*, it is clear that the BEC attacks of today are either aiming to steal funds (financial) or data (theft or destruction). A common type of data that BEC criminals aim to steal is W-2 data and/or other personally identifiable information. ## The Threat Taxonomy and ATO Attacks While the account takeover-based attack is relatively uncommon, it is increasing dramatically in commonality due to its abilities to circumvent all traditional countermeasures, whether the technique is used to infiltrate victim organizations, plant ransomware, or steal sensitive data. This is because if the criminal uses compromised accounts as launchpads to attack the contacts of the users whose accounts were compromised, the intended victims receive emails from people they have interacted with in the past. Typical security solutions implicitly assume that this is good email trafficalmost independently of the content of the emailwhich means the malicious emails get delivered. And if the attack is crafted in a cunning manner, the users receiving these emails believe these messages are secureand either open the attachments or follow the instructions that they would have ignored if the email came from a stranger. The most common type of email compromise involves a user getting phished. For concreteness, lets say that Alice receives an email that looks like it comes from her email provider, and it instructs her to log in, maybe under the premise that unwanted access attempts have been made such as in the 2016 [John Podesta](URL attack. As Alice logs in, the attacker steals her password. The attacker automatically searches Alices email communications and determines that Alice interacts with Bob, a very wealthy businessman. And now, the attacker sends an email from Alices account to Bob, saying Sorry about the long wait! I just realized that I never got around to sending this. Talk to you soon!  and then attaches a file, that when opened, will put ransomware on Bobs computer. ### Taxonomy of an Account Takeover-Based Attack URL In this scenario, the *classification* of Alices email is malicious since the attacker is using it to wreak havoc on Bob. The *sender authenticity* is a compromised account since this is an actual account used by someone Bob knowssomeone with an internal/coworker *sender identity*. Since this is ultimately a ransomware attack, the *threat delivery* is payload-based with a *motivation* of financial gain. ## Using the Threat Taxonomy In conclusion, there are many different email-based attacks. Their similarities and differences are best understood by breaking down the nature of the attacks, which can be done using the taxonomy we describe above. We have shown how to describe two important attacks using this taxonomyBEC attacks and ATO attacks. These, of course, are just two examples. As [cybercrime continues to grow](URL well uncover new ways that criminals use email to target their victims, and continue to update this taxonomy. *To learn more about how to stop BEC attacks, check out the Agari Advanced Threat Protection* [*simulated demo*](URL "

The online survey of 803 registered voters in the United States was conducted from October 10-16 by our internal research team, the Agari Cyber Intelligence Division (ACID). Its goal was to gain insights into voter awareness, trust, and perceptions of campaign email communications and related phishing attacks. Recent reports that North Korea, [Iran](URL and [Russia](URL have launched more than 2,700 phishing attacks against presidential campaigns and other high-value targets have made one thing abundantly clear. Cybercriminals and state-sponsored threat actors are actively seeking to derail political enemies, defraud voters, and undermine US democracy. Again. What the survey reveals about voter sentiment suggests that achieving those goals may be far easier than many in the US may imagine. ## 2016 DNC Hack Stokes Fears in 2020 The damage done by hackers who infiltrated the Democratic National Committees email servers cannot be overstated. According to our survey, 30% of registered voters believe the impact of weaponized emails stolen from those servers was enough to change the outcome of the 2016 election. Whats more, just over seven in ten registered voters are either somewhat or very concerned about this kind of foreign interference in the 2020 election. That includes 90% of registered Democratic voters, as well as 55% of registered Republican voters. More troubling is that over two-thirds (69%) of all votersincluding 91% of registered Democrats and 44% of registered Republicanssee such transgressions as a threat to our democracy. Even the whiff of campaign email breaches could undercut faith in the entire electoral process and delegitimize the outcome. &amp;#x200B; URL ## 79% Wary of Donating to Campaigns After Receiving Fake Emails Consternation over 2016 may also dampen campaign fundraising and voter turnout efforts. Threat actors who successfully infiltrate or spoof campaign email accounts, for instance, can impersonate candidates or key staff members in fraudulent emails targeting donors, voters, or the press. Sixty-one percent of voters in our survey say that receiving a phishing email would prevent them from donating to a presidential candidates campaign, while another 18% said theyd have to reconsider. With an average ROI of [$38 for every $1 spent](URL email is a digital channel [no campaign can afford to see hobbled](URL due to drops in deliverability rates or recipient apprehension about opening, much less acting on, what purport to be appeals made by campaigns. Factor in the dissemination of fake news or policy positions from spoofed or hijacked email accounts, or successful breaches of state election systems, and the threat grows more pronounced. ## Taking the Bait: Emerging Election Season Phishing Tactics The only thing that seems to have changed since 2016 is the sophistication of new email attacks. Russia and North Korea are targeting organizations that [work closely with presidential candidates](URL instead of just the campaigns themselves according to *The New York Times*. In addition to gaining access to sensitive emails, polling data, or other sensitive information, launching phishing attacks from the email accounts of known and trusted individuals and organizations only increases the likelihood a campaign will be breached or defrauded. Yet this years presidential campaigns continue to struggle with woefully inadequate email security. This is mostly due to the fact that few candidates have dedicated staff or resources to deploy the defenses this critically important communications channel requires. But even despite stepped-up support from the FBI, Homeland Security, and other federal agencies in beefing up [security against phishing and other cyberattacks](URL not enough progress has been made. ## Top Contenders Keep Coming Up Short In fact, only one of the 13 candidates currently [polling above 1%](URL Elizabeth Warren (D, MA) has implemented the necessary precautions to prevent attacks on campaign staff, donors, voters, the press and others, according to our [2020 Election Security Tracker](URL &amp;#x200B; URL Four others, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Senators Corry Booker (D, NJ), Tulsi Gabbard (D, HI), and Kamala Harris (D, CA) have implemented protections against email scams impersonating the candidate or their campaigns. And former Massachusetts governor William Weld (R) is the only other candidate to implement solutions to protect campaign staff from inbound email attacks. The other seven top presidential contenders, including incumbent Donald J. Trump, remain wide open to attacks targeting campaign workers, donors, voters, news media, and foreign governments against fraud. In the event of another razor-thin election, insufficient email security could cost candidates big. ## Snatching Victory from Deceit And forget victim or beneficiary heresimply being hacked could be a deal-breaker in this election cycle. A staggering 60% of voters in our survey say that a successful email attack would lead them to not vote for a candidate, or question doing so. This is particularly the case for younger Democratic and non-affiliated voters, who have been a crucial voting bloc for the partys candidates. Those least likely to change voting behavior over a successful phishing attack are Republican men over the age of 44. Across all demographic cohorts, 8% report they would not vote for a candidate who falls prey to phishing, while 18% say theyre unsure. Another 34% say they might still vote for the candidate, but only after doing more research about the impact of the hack. So far at least, the Warren campaign deserves kudos for taking email security seriously. Considering the stakes for their presidential ambitions, their campaigns, and their country, wed all better hope the remaining candidates start doing the same. *For full results from our survey on email security, phishing, and Election 2020, download the full report* [*2020 Election Security: How Confident Are Voters?*](URL"

I want to get people thinking tonight. So here goes... &amp;#x200B; I have something I would like to get everyone's opinion on. Currently I work for a company that is completely virtual. This means Desktops and Servers in-terms of scope. In the security department both SoC and engineers use the same virtual desktops as everyone else. Now here comes my point. Should it be this way? I ask this because in my mind if the VDI infrastructure is down it cripples the security department. Security would not have the ability to do IR or additional investigation. Sitting ducks until a trip to DC and hours of TS. So should the security department have physical laptops and/or desktops to interface with the environment if such were to occur? Does adding physical devices to the network introduce unnecessary risk? Even if the physical PCs happen to be locked down to great lengths? Let me know what you think. Seems like a lot of companies like this idea of migrating to a 100% virtual env. When speaking of IR in a pure virtual environment, possible infected virtual devices(desktops/servers) can be wiped by a simple restart when using a win 10 appstack or snapshot backups. Also disabling NICs on infected or compromised VDIs can be helpful for quarantine to allow for further analysis allowing recovery to continue."

305,cybersecurity,security,Social Engineering: The Weapon of Choice for Email Scammers,5,cuh2t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/cuh2t1/social_engineering_the_weapon_of_choice_for_email/,2019-08-24 03:32:01,"*Editor's Note: This blog post was originally found on the* [*Agari Email Security blog.*](URL URL By John Wilson The recent Internet Crime Report from the FBI [showcasing the growth of business email compromise (BEC)](URL from a $700 million problem to a $1.3 billion problem over the course of only one year was certainly alarming. It showcases just how much cybercrime is growing, despite increased defenses across organizations worldwide. But one key element stands out for methe fact that none of these attacks involve malware or malicious links. The fraudsters weapon of choice continues to be plain-text email messages, and theyre clearly becoming more successful. These emails rely on identity spoofing and social engineering tactics to manipulate recipients into wiring millions of dollars by making them believe they were reacting to a known and trusted sender. Though its true that some email attacks still include phishing links or attachments with spyware, ransomware, or any kind of -ware you can think of, it is the criminal use of human psychology in simple, innocuous-looking email messages that is quickly becoming the number one cybersecurity threat to businesses and consumers alike. ## Double Trouble with BEC But how can this really be possible? How can smart people be fooled into revealing sensitive information or wiring money (and apparently lots of it), simply by receiving an email purporting to come from a known business or individual? Youd be surprised. For one thing, were not talking simple spam here. Today, networked cybercrime rings produce emails that can be so well researched and so exquisitely targeted that they can be virtually indistinguishable from messages sent by a trusted colleague or brand. Adding to the impersonation? Ploys such as display name fraud, look-alike domains, and, when possible, previously compromised email accounts that can be used to easily defraud their prey. Sometimes, it even involves meticulous grooming over weeks or even months as fraudsters gain the trust of unsuspecting employee or consumer targets. As a whole, these efforts appear to be well worth the effort. ## Angles of Attack with Social Engineering Today, a typical business email compromise campaign will snare its first victim in just under four minutes[,](URL often with queries about a past-due invoice or updates to payment details. More recently, weve seen criminals asking for gift cards, which are typically easier to obtain and less likely to raise alarm across the organization. Sometimes, these social engineering schemes entail a late-afternoon message purported to come from a top executive, but [recent research](URL shows that they typically arrive in the morningoften as employees are just settling in for the day. Because they are sent right as employees are sitting in traffic on their way into the office, criminals are effectively increasing the odds the recipient will read the message on a mobile device. Why? Because most mobile email clients display only the senders name as a defaultnot the email address. Recipients pressured to act quickly while late to the office may react to messages that appear urgent without thinking to confirm legitimacy. The SEC report makes clear just how financially remunerative these rackets can be. In fact, according to the FBI, more than $13 billion has been pilfered through such cons since 2013. But this isnt the only email problem impacting your business. ## Fast Money, Long-Lasting Effects from Email Scams Phishing attacks targeting consumers typically involve impersonating well-known brands from a variety of sectors. Consumer packaged goods, media, retail, fast food, real estate, banking, government, and just about any other industry you can imagine can be leveraged as the bait in a phishing scam. Here too, social engineering is central to success. By projecting urgencyPassword Check Required, Your Payment Has Been Declined, or Security Alert, for instancethese emails are designed to fool recipients into responding quickly before facing some perceived consequence. Last year alone, [consumers lost $172 billion](URL through these and similar online scams. When it is your brand that gets impersonated, victims often unfairly blame your company, sharing their outrage on social media. Even when a customer hasnt been personally duped, publicity about cons bearing your brand name can mean theyll be hesitant to open the next email you actually do send. And with these scandals living on Google for years, its not easy to put the past behind you, even when extra security measure have been taken to prevent it from occurring again. Not only can victims face financial ruin, but the ripple effect can also have serious repercussions to your bottom line. Among other things, it can hobble marketing efforts in a channel thats 40 times more effective at generating revenue than any other digital medium at your disposal. The impact can be long-lasting, despite your best efforts to move forward. ## Traditional Email Security Isnt Enough Unfortunately, while traditional secure email gateways (SEGs) and other email security solutions are generally quite good at ferreting out malicious links and malware, they havent proven effective at countering fraud attacks that are primarily propelled by social engineering. Instead, some organizations are finding they need to deploy [artificial intelligence-based technologies](URL that apply behavioral analytics to understand the relationships between sender and receiver to detect and prevent socially-engineered email attacks. As for protecting customers? That can be even harder. While many organizations have implemented the Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) standard that can help recipient systems spot brand impersonators, only [12% of the Fortune 500](URL have set up the DMARC policy parameters needed to do this effectively. Organizations across the FTSE 100 and ASX 100 show even worse numbers. Emails attacks continue to be a money-maker for cybercriminals because organizations continue to be powerless against them. It is only my implementing the tools available as part of the next-generation [Secure Email Cloud](URL that we can protect against themno matter which tactics they use and who they plan to target. It is time that organizations worldwide take proactive steps to protect customers and employees alike with solutions that combine machine learning and globally crowdsourced threat intelligence to defeat sophisticated con artists. Otherwise, these cybercriminals will rob us all blind. *To learn more about how the next-generation Secure Email Cloud is changing the game for cybersecurity,* [*download an exclusive report*](URL "

While BEC phishing attacks have been[ big news in the United States](URL recently, advanced email threats are a very serious problem globally. Private businesses and public institutions across the globe must be vigilant towards the threat that BEC attacks pose. According to Verizons [2019 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)](URL BEC is still advantageous for the criminal element precisely because it provides a quick way to cash out. Other types of cybercrime require work on part of the adversaries to convert stolen data into accessible wealth. Meanwhile, BEC requires only that someone responds to an initial email and believes the person on the other end long enough to fulfill his request. This is especially true as [gift cards become a more popular mechanism for cybercrime](URL likely because they are easier to acquire and harder to track. Interestingly, the 2019 Verizon DBIR notes that 18% of clicks made through to phishing messages came from those using mobile devices. We live in a world where people are often on the go  answering work emails from airports, cafes, or while picking up their kids from soccer practice. The hurried nature of such instances may make professionals more susceptible to BEC attacks, particularly because they may not be as vigilant in examining each email as if they were on a desktop computer in the office. Its just another factor to consider when defending against BEC schemes. # International Incidents Take Center Stage It doesnt take much to see that this problem is an international one. There have already been warnings that Russian hacking groups are targeting government, media, and political organizations across Europe as part[ of a cyber espionage campaign](URL ahead of upcoming elections. Specifically, targeted spear-phishing campaigns are the opening gambit for the attacks, according to ZDNet, with fraudsters sending spoofed emails to their intended victims with links that appear to lead to legitimate government websites. In actuality, these links are malicious and plant malware onto the computer of those affected. Also in recent months, attack group London Blue has resurfaced and,[ as we have previously noted](URL is using legitimate commercial services to mass harvest target data for their phishing campaigns. This type of activity has resulted in a master targeting database containing the contact information of more than 50,000 financial executives. The same can be said for cybercriminal organization [Scattered Canary](URL which used Lead 411 to find their targets  both in the United States and elsewhere. # Financial Services and Healthcare Remain Prime Targets While financial services and healthcare are the two most-targeted industries in the US, little changes once you leave North America. An upsurge in phishing messages has been targeting customers of DBS Bank in Singapore. The messages purport to come from the bank and feature links to sites where they are then asked to enter bank account details, victims would soon[ discover that payees were added to their bank accounts](URL and unauthorized transactions were made. Criminals are increasingly utilizing social engineering tactics on users and tricking employees at financial firms into providing their web-based email credentials. Another common method of attack? Compromised accounts, which are notoriously difficult to trace, as cybercriminals use the legitimate accounts of employees to give an aura of authenticity and send phishing emails to colleagues. Healthcare remains another highly targeted vertical. This isnt surprising because, like finance, it has access to a treasure trove of data that criminals would love to get their hands on. Hackers commonly use BEC attacks to get healthcare professionals to click through a link to a phony site that asks them to enter their email credentials. And once this has been done, the criminal then can gain access to any number of sensitive emails containing patient information. # International Defense Parameters are Critical Businesses in every geography are at risk of critical breaches and financial loss due to email phishing attacks. And they continue to be among the most frequent types of cybercrimes perpetrated against them Thats why its so important to have the proper defenses in place to prevent business email compromise and related attacks from being successful. This starts with proper employee education, but even all the training seminars in the world wont fully prevent phishing schemes from tricking users from time to time. Instead, [next-generation technology](URL that combines machine learning with advanced analytics can spot, flag, and prevent fraudulent emails from even reaching the inboxes of employees  enabling them to focus on less on cybersecurity and more on their work. It is clear that this threat isnt going away anytime soon.

One of the hardest hit victims of Petya and Wannacry ransomware attacks were [healthcare industries](URL  computer systems which were responsible for regulating the patients health were made inaccessible. # 5 Security Vulnerabilities you should definitely get patched ASAP **1. Choose reliable third party vendors** Retail industries and other companies use third party vendors for a variety of reasons, such as customer data storage, payment processing and point of sale solutions. When the security of these third-party entities gets compromised, the next step in this chain of attacks is to hit your services. The worst culprit most of the time is [phishing attacks](URL through which the culprit manages to again access to your networks, and continue to cause maximum damage. Related: [9 Most Important Cyber Security Software used by Fortune 500 Companies](URL In order to better safeguard against POS attacks you should choose these third party vendors carefully and make it a point to understand *where* the customer data is stored, and then invest more resources into protecting that data. **2. Ubiquity provided by IoT devices** Most companies seek to enrich the customers overall experience of using their product by providing free services such as free Wi-Fi, kiosks and mobile apps  while all of these do indeed make the customer a happy shopper, they also drastically increase your chances of getting hacked. Those POS terminals are connected to the same network as the smartphone/laptop that is leeching off of your free Wi-Fi. All it takes is placing one nasty bug into your system and the attacker can get access to all the juicy bits of information, free for the taking. **3. Restrict access to information within the company** Access to customer data within the company should only be restricted to those employees or departments that need them. Sensitive information should only be accessible by executives and other employees who are higher up in the hierarchy. **4. Tokenization** This is definitely a no-brainer. Tokenization takes sensitive information such as credit card numbers and replaces them with sequences that can only be under your possession. The likelihood of criminals getting access to your token is next to nil  unless they have access to your customers physical device as well, such as their mobile phone. In this case its up to you to determine the authenticity of the online transactions. A few dead giveaways can usually tell if the customer is a fraud, such as too many purchases in a short amount of time. **5. Encryption** When hackers do manage to enter into your systems, all they get to see is a bunch of scrambled 0s and 1s. Theyll never be able to make out the information in a million years  depending on the strength of the encryption. We recommend a network wide AES 256 bit encryption  even powerful supercomputers working in tandem for thousands of years wont be able to force their way into your sensitive data."

I'm talking ideas like: \-SaaS &gt; PaaS &gt; IaaS &gt; On-prem \-Treating our internal network as a Zero-Trust \-Outsourcing operations activities wherever possible so IT can focus on architecture and innovation In a nutshell, maintaining a laser focus on assessing, classifying, and securing the data itself. I understand this concept in theory, and for the most part I agree with it: between BYOD and the cloud, we've effectively shot the ""traditional perimeter"" in the head and dumped its body in a roadside ditch. With the rising tide of AI, ML, and MSSP solutions all jockeying for a slice of the security pie, budgets for traditional internal SecOps (for most orgs, at least) is going away. With so many solutions (email security gateways, SD-WAN technologies, endpoint security, PKI services, password management engines, etc...) now residing completely in the cloud, who has the appetite to stand up and manage yet another rack system, or slap another blade into the enclosure? But at the same time there's a part of me that struggles with these challenges, and I think a big part of that is infosec training as a whole is lagging behind. I just sat for the CISSP a couple months ago, and the content on cloud technologies is minimal. I look at college ""Cybersecurity"" degree programs, and there's still a heavy network security focus on firewalls and IDS/IPS and NAC, as well as a heavy assessment and pentesting lean towards traditional infrastructure systems (check patches, close ports, limit administrative access, etc.) But there's very little foundational infosec content out there on the next generation of security challenges -- most 100 and 200 level classes still approach infosec concepts largely from the traditional on-prem model. Sure I can go sit for something like a SANS 500 or 600 level class in ""Cloud Security Fundamentals"" or whatever, but none of those are currently listed in their ""Top Courses"", and people who are new to this field really need to be exposed to more of these technologies earlier to start them off in the mindset of thinking securing data OUTSIDE the org first, rather than ""layering"" and other more traditional models that are easy concepts to grasp because they can piggyback on visual network diagrams, but don't really address the way things are moving in a largely PaaS/SaaS world. I get it: it's much easier to draw out a standard internal/firewall/DMZ model and teach on that, than it is to focus on what makes up that nebulous ""cloud"" blob that just gets stuck at the top of most of these diagrams -- but realistically in today's world that model should probably be flipped.

Basically what happens is a fraudster phones up your mobile network provider and says you have lost your sim card or need a replacement, after convincing the staff there your phone number is then ported to the fraudsters device. From here, they can use the number to reset passwords for email addresses and the like in order to take over your online life, or perhaps to dig deeper and find out bank details before eventually targeting your money.

411,cybersecurity,security,Forensic Readiness: Setting the Foundation for Cybersecurity,2,7x4b8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/7x4b8m/forensic_readiness_setting_the_foundation_for/,2018-02-13 08:44:50,"Ive been involved in addressing many different cyberattacks in 2017 and early 2018, with some attacks being more successful than others. My involvement was usually in identifying the nature of the attack in a post mortem fashion or thwarting the advancement of an attack in progress. One common thread among all of them was the lack of forensic readiness by the organization that was attacked. So, what exactly is forensic readiness? Most organizations deploy some advanced hardware at the perimeter (such as firewall/application proxy) to control North-South traffic that is either generated from the local network heading to the Internet or vice versa. Other organizations adopt a more advanced model of installing an additional Intrusion Detection System on the network that monitors East-West traffic (traffic that moves between the users, servers, storage etc.). A logging system is installed to capture the events and then the assumption is that we can defend this echo system successfully. The reality, as many of you reading this blog understand, is that this type of installation is typical but inadequate. If something were to happen (user account hacked, USB device, malware traversing an email file or someone gaining access to a cloud tenancy, etc.), the logs provided by the firewall and the IDS device would not be sufficient to ascertain what happened let alone attempt to prosecute the case if the business was harmed. Im going to walk you through some of the changes that I think are necessary for a strong foundation in cyber security and pertain only to the data collection portion of the forensic process. Identifying Sources of Data:  Local equipment such as firewalls, servers, local Active Directory controllers, wireless devices, etc.  Remote equipment: Similar to above but residing in a different location such as remote offices and data centers  Cloud providers: O365, Azure, AWS, Google, and other hosting providers whether hosting Infrastructure or Application as a Service Acquiring the data:  Set up an NTP server to synchronize all devices to ensure that incoming data has proper timing (for correlation purposes)  Configure the sources to send the logs to a centralized SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system such as Splunk or AlienVault  Configure the sources to have the necessary settings for the logs in order to sufficiently identify an attack and/or present enough evidence to allow prosecution  Configure the cloud tenancies to adequately collect and forward the logs to the SIEM  Install Intrusion Detection Systems/Capabilities on your VPN tunnels and any other external connector with a partner or client and ensure that proper logging is enabled and forwarding to your SIEM Although data collection is a sub section of forensic readiness, it cannot be underestimated because in every incident I have participated in, the logs pertaining to the attack were never sufficient. Please feel free to comment on this blog and or contact me at uhoulila@crossrealms.com. Be on the lookout for my upcoming forensic toolkit, which addresses forensic readiness more comprehensively. "

That's all well and good. That should be a pretty basic standard when you're providing this kind of service. Here's where it gets interesting. As part of the review that my team performs, we ask how vulnerabilities are remediated. Here's the answer that we've gotten: *""&lt;software/application that they've written internally&gt; maintains a clear separation between various systems. The policy is enforced realtime and on a continual basis. It is simply impossible to access any internal systems without first authenticating, authorizing role, and providing an intent. &lt;Vendor&gt; follows a zero trust policy for cybersecurity.""* This seems really off to me. First, I would never, in the history of ever, say that something was impossible to access.

There are other imaging software for it but I have to have a bootable media handy if I want to restore it and the windows computer has to be hard wired into the network for it to find the backup ( I do not want to use an external hhd, needs to be through wifi. ( but reliability is more important than convince / so keeping a bootable media won't hurt. I think we can all say that Windows 10 has matured enough that it is stable. I have actually had problems with macs. If I switch to windows I'll get an android, like a Samsung galaxy or one plus 3t. I don't do pc gaming, just console. ( I just prefer it ) I will do coding I do virtual machines with VMware on my Mac ( don't mind buying a license on windows if need be ) Office 365 and 1Password is compatible. I like media consumption like watching anime I love technology a lot!!! Seams like apple is always behind ( but they when they do release the ""new-old thing "" it works . Programs is a thing. I work on Cisco equipment. And it seams like most programs are on pc. Don't want this to be a debate, just want to know what y'all would suggest. "

Basically, fitting the saying jack of all trades, master of none. If youve never heard that saying before, here is a link to what Wikipedia has to say (URL Ive had a long security career with its main focus being information security (InfoSec). When I started out in security there were basically two paths, InfoSec or the other guys. There was no cybersecurity or pentester, just the other guys, the attack side of the equation. Interestingly, when I took the CISSP there were ten domains and I dont think the other guys fit any domain well. Now, the domains number eight and there are many careers that can be built on a single domain or even a subsection of one. Although, I understand the 8 domains are a combining and expansion of subject matter rather than a reduction. One question/answer from the FAQ sums it up nicely: Q: How is the CISSP exam changing? A: The CISSP exam is being updated to stay relevant amidst the changes occurring in the information security field. Refreshed technical content has been added to the Official (ISC) CISSP CBK to reflect the most current topics in the information security industry today. Some topics have been expanded (e.g., asset security, security assessment and testing), while other topics have been realigned under different domains. The result is an exam that most accurately reflects the technical and managerial competence required from an experienced information security professional to effectively design, engineer, implement and manage an organizations information security program within an ever-changing security landscape. As a result of the content refresh, we have updated some of the domain names to describe the topics accurately. CISSP Domains, Effective April 15, 2015 * Security and Risk Management (Security, Risk, Compliance, Law, Regulations, Business Continuity) * Asset Security (Protecting Security of Assets) * Security Engineering (Engineering and Management of Security) * Communications and Network Security (Designing and Protecting Network Security) * Identity and Access Management (Controlling Access and Managing Identity) * Security Assessment and Testing (Designing, Performing, and Analyzing Security Testing) * Security Operations (Foundational Concepts, Investigations, Incident Management, Disaster Recovery) * Software Development Security (Understanding, Applying, and Enforcing Software Security) Link: URL I can definitely say that Ive spent time in all domains and some more than others of course. Today I spend most of my time in the Identity and Access Management domain with supporting knowledge from Security and Risk Management, Security Engineering, Communications and Network Security, and Software Development Security. Ive been called a SME (Subject Matter Expert), but typically only when convenient or beneficial for the prime. Otherwise, I truly prefer to understand how the products work instead of how to work the product. Although, the later is what gets me paid many times. That product and hands on experience also helps (IMHO) when in the architect role also. So which are you and whats your specialty? Are you a jack of all trades? A netsecer that does it all or have you grown into a specialty like VPN/Remote access only, network/routing, switching or something else. Maybe youre a sysadmin that now only specializes in AD Forest/Domain infrastructure or email/Exchange only. For us security folks, maybe youre a master at forensics or malware analysis. Let me know and if you got this far thanks for reading. "

Why can't it be depicted differently, showing off how amazingly clever people who discover security flaws really are?

If you know a better sub for this to go in, please let me know. Im currently a first year student in computer science, minoring in mathematics, going to a university where the focus is software engineering(or web development depending on your preference). My destination is kind of tricky. I want to work in cybersecurity as a deep learning engineer with the freedom to switch to a data scientist role. The reason is both practical(some of the personal projects I want to create involve both skill sets), and economic(more freedom of opportunity, and depending on the company one may be more valuable than the other). correct me if Im wrong, but the skill sets almost completely overlap, except DS requires more on the statistical analysis side, and less on the software engineering side(doesnt employ advanced ML models, worry about clean code, or really build anything meant for anyone but the data scientist). now, from what Ive read, outside of cybersecurity this would be pretty easy, as someone who can wear both hats is really valuable. I dont know if this really holds true for cybersecurity though. Id much rather focus on cybersecurity than business applications: to be fair, almost all the applications of programming, data science, and machine/deep learning outside of cybersecurity, the healthcare system, and government(al oversight) and tech seem uninteresting. I dont want to work in finance, business, advertising, or web-based services(quora, linkedin, facebook). Now I know the pathway if I didnt want to do this in cybersecurity, computer science bachelors, spend my summers working on coding and trying to land internships at programming companies, take as many math courses as humanly possible, with linear algebra and statistics being fairly mandatory. around my fourth year summer, try to land an internship at data science for social good. probably would go to CMU for their machine learning masters program, and just take every advanced statistics course I can.I would work on open source projects throughout my schooling. Now what do I need to tweak if my end goal is to work in cybersecurity? Is their particular companies I should try to intern with? Is there any certifications, or classes outside of school, I should take in order to improve my resume? Is there a machine learning program that would be a better fit other than CMU(thats not Harvard; unless I get it paid for I dont want to spend the next 20 years paying for [4:6])? Also a PhD isnt an option Im looking to take. At the current rate Im going to be 30 or 31 getting out of my masters program. Worst case scenario, I dont want to be getting my first job at 40, and still wind up making less than my peers who decided to stop at getting their Masters. It would be preferable to work in another field then transfer to cybersecurity if getting a job in cybersecurity Im taking classes at my college in java, though I spend my free time coding in python3. My current short term goal is to be coding with scrappy and selenium by next summer and to be generally skilled enough to land my first internship. with the end goal in mind what are some other modules/tool sets I should get comfortable with at this early stage in my coding practice?
