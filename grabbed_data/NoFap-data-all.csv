0,vulnerability,NoFap,NoFap while with a partner...,1,i2ohzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/i2ohzz/nofap_while_with_a_partner/,2020-08-03 11:58:17,"Heyy yall... I haven't posted here before. Just wanna intro myself, share some experiences and questions. Hi Im Altruce! Im 33yo and I have been on a transformational path for about 7 years now... I'm reading through NoFap and SR reddits and I'm feeling super inspired by everyones successes and courageous vulnerability. Yall are bad ass. Recently I completed 25 days of semen retention, while being sexually active with my girlfriend throughout the entire thing. Luckily she and I are both into tantric sexual practices so I had her total support for the duration. One thing I didn't manage success with was not looking at porn. I have come a looonng fucking way with porn addiction in the last 8 years from busting nuts 7-10 times every day to now I might peep an instagram booty pic or watch something on pornhub for a few minutes once or twice a week, usually without busting although ill prolly edge. I have let go of nearly all the shame and guilt around it, altho there's def some still present, it's not nearly what it used to be. While I was doing semen retention, I was also edging myself a lot, doing mantak chias testical breathing and my gf was giving me hella amazing handjobs resulting in full body ecstatic spastic orgasms without ejaculating. It was intense. Towards the end i was feeling pretty amazing but was also super fucking horny all the time, even with transmutation practices. I did it for a 21day semen retention challenge my buddy shared on Instagram. I am wanting to embark on another streak of SR/nofap and I am wondering a few things... It seems most people posting here are not being sexually active while doing these practices. I'm wanting to hear from those who are in commited relationships and doing this work, how does it look for you and your partner? Also, how the fuck do I not look at booty pics or porn? I cant tell you how many times i have deleted all the ""saved"" pics from my instagram, its just super sexy women but it almost always leads me to looking at porn. At this point I have no problem not busting a nut for a week or so but i cant stop looking at porn to save my life. Ive tried blocking sites on my phone and computer but hell if i dont know my own passwords haha ive talked to my gf about her setting the password for me(we hide nothing) but that seems like it would be disempowering ultimately bc then it's out of my control. Besides that... Do you let yourself edge at all? I usually do a transmutational/ inner alchemy breath practice right as i edge and move the energy around similar to testical breathing. I suppose this counts under semen retention but not nofap? I have more thoughts and questions but ill leave it here for now. Peace be with you brothers!"

Boy has PIED. and boy is freaking out but also boy doesnt wanna let it go. Background: I am a 21 year old male and probably suffer from PIED. I have been trying nofap since last October (so almost a year) and have had two 2 month streaks and even in the middle of the streaks decreased PMO a lot and basically 0 porn (however A LOT of fantasies which i decreased this time around). Rn I am on a month long streak. I was never really ADDICTED to porn but all the symptoms of PIED made sense with my experience so i guess if the shoe fits. I started nofap because last summer I tried to hook up with this girl and I just was not attracted to her AT ALL and I couldn't get it up. I gave some bullshit excuse like ""sorry I'm not over my ex i think"". Before this, I used to usually meet girls at parties at college when I am decently drunk. And the 2 times I got a girl back to my room it was the same story and I just blamed it on me being drunk and didn't worry about it. But after I couldn't get it up COMpletely sober I got worried and started looking into this. In the past year that I have been aware about nofap I haven't really tried to hook up with anyone because I have been very anxious about not getting it up. So I think performance anxiety is going to come and bite me in the ass too. I have been feeling much bette, have had much better morning wood and just better with the symptoms in general. But still the thought of trying just makes me super anxious. And, even tho I have gone to third base/oral with like 4 different girls, I have never really had sex. So I am also afraid of just not being good?? And none of my friends OR ANYONE else knows about this because i am damnn ashamed and opening about it seems like an awful lot of vulnerability and idk how to muster it. The conundrum: I came back to my home country for the Summer (i study in the US) and I have been talking to this girl from my high school. We really didn't talk to each other much during HS but both had a crush on each other at some point and i didn't do anything about it lol. But during the quarantine period we have been talking A LOT and its super cute stuff like texting till 7am and me sending cute supportive memes during her exams. So, we both caught feelings for each other (haha yeah through texting like a couple of lil 7th graders). We spoke about how we have feelings for each other and how good we prolly would be together. However, i told her that i don't think i am ready to do this because ill have to go back to the US next semester and really wont be in the same place/country for the foreseeable future. She believed me BUT it's just a full lie. I am actually terrified of my PIED. She's really sweet and kind of experienced when it comes to sex. And, i guess i look decent, always seem confident, and hide this \~stuff\~ really well so everyone assumes i am experienced too?? I don't correct them because i am hella insecure about sex because of my PIED so it feels good tbh. But this is a double edged sword because this makes it sooo much harder for me to talk about this with anyone. Literally NO ONE in my life knows about this because i am so so embarrassed about it. She's really cute and smart and all around swell person. And she likes me back!! I really don't wanna give up on her because I just haven't felt like this about someone in a while. So what you guys suggest? should i try to talk to her about it? should i just try to sleep with her hoping it'll work out? or should i just leave it alone. TBH she's great but i am not sure how she will react about this. And, if u guys think i should talk to her how would you guys bring it up and talk about it? PIED is such a stressful thing because i don't even know how to go about fixing it. i have been working out, taking cold showers, and obviously no porn and masturbating. But at some point it gets hard to trust the process and u think about maybe u will never get better?? or never have the balls to try. In the last year, going through nofap, i always said i'll try once I really like someone because i will be comfortable. But now it just seems like stakes are that much higher? (also doesn't help that she knows all my friends here) Any insight will be useful thanks!!"

3,vulnerability,NoFap,Going deep with my addiction,1,iaxpmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/iaxpmc/going_deep_with_my_addiction/,2020-08-17 04:36:40,"One way I understand my addiction is by writing down the conflictive inner dialogue I have with my self. I think some of you can relate to this. This is how it goes: *I'm in the center of an amphitheater where the light is only on me. I can't see anyone, but everyone can see me. I only listen to the voices from the audience, where some talk positive things to me, while other negative.* *Especially one guy keep target my vulnerability by talking in a rude way. That's the Porn Guy.* &amp;#x200B; &gt;Porn Guy: Hey, why don't you enjoy yourself a bit? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Me: How do I do that? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Porn Guy: Watch some porn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Me: No way! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Porn Guy: All your problems will vanish. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Me: No they won't. I'll just ignore them and they will become bigger and worse. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Porn Guy: You will enjoy it. I promise. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Me: Yes for a short moment and then the guilt, shame and self-hatred will kick in. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Porn Guy: That's because you don't do it enough. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Me: I've been struggling with it for years. It's enough! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Porn Guy: Just do for f\*\*\* sake. Obey my orders! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Me: I want to get rid of it, so I can achieve the goals of my life, be more happy and enjoy real love. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Porn: So you really think you can beat this addiction? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Me: Indeed! But hey... Let me know who you are? I cannot see you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Porn Guy: Don't think about me. Just do what I'm telling you to do. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Me: No, I want to see! Either come to me, so I can see you closely, otherwise I'll turn on the light. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Porn Guy: You do not want to do that. Don't do it! *I turn on the light and I see a 10-year-old kid that is scared and craves attention and validation. A kid that craves his father's love. An insecure individual that is afraid of facing his problems. A kid that focus on what other people feel about him, instead of what he feels himself.* *I found out that this boy is me.*"

5,vulnerability,NoFap,Get you some real life accountability,1,ibnzlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ibnzlj/get_you_some_real_life_accountability/,2020-08-18 08:01:34,"Greetings Dude Men of NoFap! I have been on this sub for a few weeks now. In the last 8 years I have gone through huge shifts in my relationship with p, m, o and my sexual energy in general. I'm not here to talk about that today though. Right now I am around 15 days into semen retention/ nofap... altho I haven't been keeping strict count bc who has time for that? I just wanna live... Anyway I wanna talk about accountability and vulnerability today. I see a lot of folks come here for accountability when they relapse and I think that is great. It's awesome to see so many people with the desire to change themselves for the better. However, I want to point something out. We are all anons to one another. We don't have real emotionally intimate and vulnerable relationships to each other. We are just words on a screen as far as we can tell. So while I see the value in a supportive community like this, I also want to encourage you all to share what you share here with your friends, partners, parents, etc etc the people closest to you. Share with them about your addiction and your desire to change. Ask them to support you by being willing to hear about when you relapse or want to relapse. It is absolutely no sweat off anyone's back to anonymously post to the internet ""4 days in and I relapsed! Such shame! Much guilt!"" But if you have someone in a close relationship that you have agreed to be accountable with, the stakes leading up to a possible relapse are much higher. And when a relapse does happen, the experience of being compassionately, empathetically and powerfully WITNESSED in REAL LIFE in your shame and guilt and desire to change, will be more healing and integrative and wholesome than posting to a bunch of anons ever could be. Right now I have at least 10 close friends including my partner and community elders who know I am retaining. The accountability aspect of not wanting to have to go through telling them if/ when I slip up... PLUS the compassionate holding and support I will recieve and the emotional healing that comes with such vulnerability if I do makes any outcome a TOTAL WIN and pushes mr further along to success. This kind of vulnerability takes immense courage and not everyone is lucky to have people they can safely share these most vulnerable, intimate and authentic aspects of themselves with... but for those who do... do it. You will have much more success and much more transformation and growth if you do. That's it for today. I think I will make another post soon covering many topics surrounding this journey. Peace and blessings yall!"

Learnt from my mistakes. On the good side this is my highest streak of 2020. Gonna keep at it and reach 90 days before this year gets over. During this streak the mistake i made: 1. Sleeping positions. This is something that is overlooked and not talked about. I have always slept on my stomach and this puts a some pressure on your private parts. Few days back i have ended up masturbating during my sleep and its because of this factor in overlooked. 2. Vulnerability: Night time is the time i'm prone to relapse. Since i finished 34 days i thought it will get easier. I'm going to make a list on a set of situations that makes the most vulnerable and stick it on a wall. 3. Meditation: I have been doing a lot of physical exercises these days and have been on a proper diet. Meditation was something i have overlooked upon. From today on wards i'm going to do at least 10 minutes of meditation. This is what i can think of right now. If anyone have mistakes that they have done and it lead them to relapse, please do comment on this post. We can learn form our mistake and will add more if i come up with any more."

""It's better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles"" - Buddha. As this quote suggests, everyone in this group knows the value of conquering yourself. Everyone in this group is one way or another fighting the demons that are not under our beds but within us. Those torturous, unscrupulous desires that waste our valuable time by making us do unimportant things. Everyone has different reasons to tame these demons, and I have my own reasons. I referred it as NoAddiction challenge, instead of NoFap challenge. Because I think my problem is nor mere fapping, but broader than that. I am addicted to negative behaviour, which is acting as a coping mechanism for stress, extra work, anxiety. But I am fully aware that, I and I alone is responsible for whatever happens with me. Taking responsibility is true freedom. So, here I am. I, Ankit take the pledge that from this day till my last day I won't indulge into any negative habits, thought or behaviour that will adversely impact my life. I will do anything to guard me against evil things that are lurking on this planet. And I start this with relieving myself from my compulsive masturbation habit. &amp;#x200B; Plan of Action 1. Block all dirty websites. 2. Use the laptop as minimum as possible. 3. Read every day at least one page of motivational stories. 4. Whenever the first instance of vulnerability appears, perform positive self-talk, remember the moment of success. 5. Daily journal my positive experience here on this group. 6. Take responsibility for my behaviour."

When that energy builds up within you, you're liable to do some things you normally wouldn't. You become hungry like a dog. And you will fuck anything walking. I fucked hookers because i hadn't masturbated in so long. I hit up girls i normally wouldn't have. And thars the least of your worries. What do you do when you haven't jacked off in months, and a pretty broad comes and teases you, takes you to her crib, and next thing you know you look out the window and see fifteen guys, all looking to kill you because of the neighborhood you're from. Many of you don't think about the vulnerability that comes with this.

But I ended up getting a yes (ppl are busy maybe she didn't see the message right away.who knows). It brings me to an overall observation about P: it actually saves you from the negative emotions of possibly getting rejected. (Also known as vulnerability). And on top of that it *builds* a sense of shame for even wanting sex in real life, because of it didn't, then why would it be so hard to go out there and get it?

Alcoholic subjects have low levels of dopamine D(2) receptors in striatum, and increasing D(2) receptor levels in laboratory animals reduces alcohol consumption."" This pretty much means that PMO addiction and related brain changes can cause you to binge on alcohol aswell. As the above quote says, increasing D2 receptor density in the striatum (with nofap) decreases alcohol consumption. I have seen this effect on every single streak, I lose my cravings to drink and I change from a blackout drinker into a social drinker. This is quite interesting phenomenon."
14,vulnerability,NoFap,SELF RESPECT AND SELF CONFIDENCE,1,hclwe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/hclwe1/self_respect_and_self_confidence/,2020-06-20 22:59:17,"SELF-RESPECT, SELF-CONFIDENCE Self-confidence and self-respect are indispensable qualities in human life. Without them life seems dull, oppressive, or threatening; and we lack the initiative and enthusiasm to fulfill our potential. Although different, these two qualities are inextricably linked. Self-respect To understand self-respect we can first consider the question of why we respect others. Respect is a feeling of admiration for someone whose qualities, attitudes, and behaviors exemplify a given set of values. Values are centrally-held beliefs about oneself, the world, and the principles that govern life. Every individual is constituted of a range of values, existing in several domains: material, physical/sensual, emotional, intellectual/cognitive, moral, spiritual/ religious/ transcendent. Our values inform us of ""worthy objectives upon which to concentrate""1 in life, as well as how lasting satisfaction can be attained. They therefore guide attitudes, choices, and actions in life. Like any belief, the values we hold may be partially or wholly inaccurate, leading us to adopt attitudes and pursue choices that are counterproductive to desired outcomes. Thus we can rank values according to the degree to which they accurately reflect the reality of life. For example, one may believe that the most direct way to life-satisfaction is to make more money now and in the future; another may believe that money has a limited and diminishing effect on life-satisfaction. Each person's value for money determines their attitudes and choices with regard to study, work, career, and money itself. By investigating and concluding which of these values more accurately reflects the truth, we can determine their relative ranking. Those that are more reflective of the reality are considered higher values. When it comes to those whom we respect, the values that we see exemplified must necessarily be one that we share. For example, if we meet a person who deeply respects the life and person of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we can immediately infer (in general) her attitudes towards race, racism, racial equality, etc. Whereas, a person holding antithetical values, who considers racism a reasonable attitude and segregation sound policy, could not respect Dr. King in the same way: he would respect those standing up for racist and segregationist attitudes. Thus, we respect those people whom we see as embodying our own values. Self-respect can be seen as functioning in the same way. Respect for oneself arises from living in accordance with one's own higher values: the higher the values we live up to, the greater the self-respect. To put it another way, we lose self-respect when we fail to live up to our own higher values, thereby experiencing regret, guilt, shame. This may leave life seeming uninspired and mundane; we may experience a pervading anxiety over discovery and reprisal; we experience disappointment in ourselves, which can devolve into toxic shame or self-hatred. These emotions become a wall erected between ourselves and others. Even family and friends are psychologically pushed away, thus creating isolation and loneliness. HOW TO LOSE SELF-RESPECT Guilt or regret arises in the personality when we perform an action that does not conform to our own moral code, to our sense of right/wrong. As contemporary Indian philosopher A. Parthasarathy states: When you act in the world against your own conscience your mind becomes disturbed. The action rebounds and hurts you. You feel sorry for having acted thus. In reaction to your own action you suffer regret and remorse. An action creating such a response is termed a sin. Sin therefore is not in the action but in the reaction.2 (p.206) Correctly understanding this requires first an understanding of the anatomy of an action. Action is executed by the body, but the body cannot act by itself. Action is propelled by the desires of the mind, the reasoning of the intellect, or a combination of the two. This motivator of action is intention. The nature of the mind is indiscriminate: it has no capacity for self-understanding or self-governance; its desires are not based in logic, and bear no necessary correlation to our continued well-being or sense of right/wrong. The intellect's nature is discriminate: it functions on reason and logic, and questions everything. Sin refers to the mental disturbance experienced after performing a certain type of action, and not to the action itself. No action is sinful per se: it is the intention behind the action that determines sin. Intention is the cause, mental disturbance (i.e. sin) the effect. Conscience refers to the moral compass that every human being possesses. It recognizes our highest, most selfless value and calls on us to follow It. Even the most heinous criminal possesses a conscience, directing him towards the morally correct action. The question then is, why would one act against one's own conscience, thereby inviting guilt or remorse, and thus diminishing self-respect? When the mind's desires are not aligned with the conscience, they guide us towards experiences that we would otherwise not consider worthy objectives. Such desires may be termed 'lower' desires. Those that are in alignment with our conscience may be termed 'higher.' Thus the intellect must be developed and applied to question the nature of the desires, and thereby guide the mind effectively. However, when the intellect is undeveloped and unapplied to life, the lower desires remain unquestioned, unexamined. In the absence of scrutiny, we do not recognize the lower desires for what the are, only the immediate gratification that they can deliver. They exert their influence on our choices, we act according to their dictates, violate the conscience, and suffer guilt and loss of self-respect. We lose self-respect when we act against our own conscience. We act thus when we live an unexamined life: when the intellect fails to question the desires and intentions that propel us into action. Therefore, intellectual development and application is essential for harmonious living. HOW TO GAIN SELF-RESPECT The function of intellect is to discriminate. When it comes to exercising our choice of action, the role of the intellect is to determine whether the action itself is in line with our higher values. We need to question two aspects of action here: the values within that are demanding expression as action; and whether these values are worthwhile holding on to (for more on this, see here and here). Thus we can ask ourselves before engaging in an activity, What am I considering doing? Why, what am I getting out of it? For whom am I acting? Is the action selfish/unselfish/selfless? What are the consequences to this action, and for whom? What is my obligation in this situation? What aspect of my personality am I expressing? Is the attitude healthy/unhealthy? Is this the person I want to be? Who do I want to be? What value or belief am I adhering to? Is this underlying belief true/false? On what basis do I say it is true/false? This investigation is carried out by the intellect, and therefore the most important activity in life is the development of one's intellect. We can then apply our critical thinking skills to the choices we make moment-to-moment, and to the general course that we chart through life. Self-confidence We can begin to understand self-confidence by investigating its opposite. To lack self-confidence is to be doubtful or uncertain of one's ability to attain or live up to certain goals, and to consequently experience a pervading anxiety that can range in degree from mild to crippling. This anxiety may be compounded with suppression as we naturally continue to entertain desires, yet avoid activities and environments that demand effort for their attainment. Where we do act, the mental agitation inhibits our ability to think and concentrate, making assessments of people and situations inaccurate, plans and strategies flawed, actions poorly-executed. Thus the desired outcome is rarely achieved, and our lack of self-confidence becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Having goals per se cannot cause disruption to our mental peace. Life cannot be lived effectively without a range of goals to achieve. However, goals become a burden to self-confidence when we relate to them wrongly, i.e. when we develop a personal attachment to achieving them, become dependent upon the outcome. For example, consider a casual tennis player, enjoying the game as an occasional way to exercise, relax and share the company of friends. While she intends to maximize each stroke towards winning, there is no pressure, anxiety or feeling of vulnerability at the prospect of failing. Now consider a professional tennis player with a slim lead in the final set of an international tournament. His loved ones and fans line the court; cameras are poised to beam his every move to millions of viewers; his reputation and millions of dollars in prize money and endorsements are on the line. He too wishes to maximize each stroke towards the win, yet may feel a weight of expectation that is too great to bear, experiencing an unsettling lack of confidence in his ability. The swirl of mental agitation makes the whole experience unpleasant, and contributes to the possibility of choking under the pressure. Note that in both cases the uncertainty over the outcome remains: indeed it can never be removed. The difference lies in the attitude each one has towards the outcome. The amateur knows that the outcome of play is of no serious consequence; the pro believes that there is no matter of greater importance. The amateur is emotionally free from the result; the pro is attached to and dependent upon the result. It is attachment to results that cripples our self-confidence. Attachment is a purely internal phenomenon, and thus each of us is responsible for the attachments we hold. Although we may be striving to satisfy external expectations (e.g. those of parents or family, schools, religions, political affiliations, peer groups, advertising &amp; media, etc), ultimately we are responsible for our attitude in the activity. Genuine self-confidence is untouched by circumstances, it does not change with time. Consider for a moment: if our pro ranks number 1, and his confidence in life relies on his skill and prowess on the court, what happens when an injury ends his career? What happens when time catches up, and he is no longer the most agile, powerful, and accurate? As the skill diminishes, so does his confidence. Genuine confidence cannot be assailed by life's inevitable changes. Thus it is not gained by embodying or possessing particular qualities or attributes, nor by achieving particular results, but by eliminating the dependency upon doing so. Thus we directly eliminate the cause of anxiety. The process of eliminating attachment in life is self-development, the growth of the personality into greater maturity and stability (summarized in more detail here). HOW TO GAIN SELF-CONFIDENCE The primary emphasis for our effort to build self-confidence should be in developing the intellect to gain deeper insight into the principles that govern life and living. To return to the example: the amateur's emotional freedom and absence of anxiety arises from her knowledge: that winning or losing is not ultimately important in life; it's just a game; there are much more important things in life. It is the insight into the true value of sporting prowess ('nice to have, but not important') that liberates her from the attachment to it. Imagine combining the professional's skill and years of training with the amateur's relaxed attitude and emotional serenity. Self-confidence then is not the certain knowledge of what we can achieve. It is the certain knowledge of what really matters in life; and that we will be unmoved by the outcome. Win or lose, we retain this insight. Thus, when we identify with higher values we drop our attachment to outcomes. We then engage in the range of life's activities and duties with freedom and alacrity. When self-confidence is gained in this way, we naturally accept our own nature, living in harmony with our tendencies and inclinations, strengths and weaknesses. We continue to push our boundaries, growing and improving in all aspects of life, but without feeling incomplete and awkward at any stage. As A. Parthasarathy states, ... learn to accept yourself as you are. Everyone has a distinct place and purpose in this world. None is big or small. Important or unimportant. Understand that. Live by it. You will then be free from the menace of complexes.3 (p.110)"

Think of it as adding your voice to the groups protest against PMO addiction. Dont lurk, dont struggle alone. We are here for you. I am here for you. Upvote and comment on other peoples posts. You have no idea how uplifting it is to see every upvote and comment. It helps each of us feel less alone. Make an alt account if you have to (I did). Sharing freely and talking through the pain will help you make sense of all the anxieties and urges swimming around in your head. Knowledge is a kind of power; addiction robs you of knowledge; recovery restores that power. Its not a super power, but it feels like one when you struggle every day and lose hope. PMO addiction comes in part from loneliness and anxiety. Youre lonely when youre not communicating. Youre anxious when youre not able to turn your thoughts into decisions and actions. Participating in this community will help you communicate and think for yourself again. But your success depends on your ability to be vulnerable to some extent. Vulnerability strengthens your character if you use it to address your flaws and try to improve upon them. Tell me your story. We can do this. I believe in you. I love you."

It was only 2 and a half months but she and I really clicked right away and were able to share alot of vulnerability and laughs. It was the mutually the most healthy romantic thing we've ever had. But unfortunately she felt pulled in another life direction that didnt include me, and it was a painful but amiable ending. We just had our final conversation tonight, just talking about the aftermath of it and how to go forward. It hurt, but it brought alot of closure. But now I find myself alone now, and so tired and sad and I just need some extra motivation to push back and not relapse 138 day streak. Thank you."

Im pretty new to Reddit, but Ive been sharing my NoFap/Semen Retention journey publicly on Instagram for the past 42 days. To give some context: Ive been trying to overcome my porn addiction for a few years now, but without much progress. My longest streak was over a year ago and it was 17 days. Until now :) Long story short: I had an epiphany which led me to believe that sharing my struggle and my recovery journey publicly through daily video updates could help me recover. One contributing factor was this quote from Carl Jung: One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. Needless to say, I did it. Well, Im doing it as we speak. And its been the best decision Ive ever made. Being vulnerable was scary and awkward for those first few days, but I grew in confidence and the support from the NoFap/SR communities has been incredible so far. Vulnerability, accountability, and sense of community have been significant factors in my recovery so far. I encourage you to consider sharing your own journey in the open. Its incredibly healing and motivating because it truly harnesses the power of the herd. Either way, youre welcome to follow my journey: @mbp1992. Ive shared videos on how to prevent urge triggers and how to deal with surprise attack urges. Theres some practical advice in those. Ive also discussed topics like the role of dopamine in porn addiction, the low vibration energy of the porn industry, and the importance of self-forgiveness. Feel free to say Hi or ask me anything and Ill get back to you ASAP  In the meantime, I wish you the best on your recovery journey. Onwards &amp; upwards! All the love, Tim"

19,vulnerability,NoFap,Redefining my goals and mindset (50 days),1,ggkjxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ggkjxq/redefining_my_goals_and_mindset_50_days/,2020-05-10 04:17:41,"So this post is like a reminder or maybe like a description/setup for myself, to redefine my goals and mindset after some time of reflection. If you would like to, feel free to leave a comment but mainly I created this post for myself. **The Past (quarantine)** The story of this streak began really sad actually... I relapsed on around day 30 during my last streak even if it was one of my best streaks, not concerning the days but concerning what I have accomplished. Corona made me sad, I got too much into it and didnt see much sense anymore in holding my current situation under control. Like everytime I felt horrible after the relapse but at least I recognized that I got too much into this Corona thing but now I wanted to see it as a chance to etablish new hobbies, habits and routines in my every day life. I began to see this new chapter as a chance for a better version of myself. But I did exactly the opposite. Waking up at 12 AM, showering, making breakfast, going for a walk, sometimes workout but after it I was just playing video games for the rest of the day. Every night before sleep I said to myself: *This time I will go to bed earlier, so that I wake up around 8 or 9 AM and start to accomplish my goals, start with those new hobbys and etablish healthy habits in my every day life.* But after around 5 weeks nothing has changed. I always knew doing those unproductive things make me feel sad and akward but I... just didnt change it. I mean I wasnt that unproductive piece of shit I described there... maybe I exxagerated a bit. I took a cold shower every day, ate healthy, went for a lot of walks and exercised almost every day during the last 2 weeks. But I eather wasnt the person I wanted to be or did the things I wanted to start with. But after a while I recognized my problem. Like I said before I played a lot during quarantine. Not like 8h or more every day. But it was still too much. I uninstalled the main game that caused this ""addiction"" but also my other games. I did a really big step here and really was about to change something but it was hard to see something good in this black hole of 5 weeks wasting my time. But still, I had good NoFap streak, not concerning the things I accomplished but concerning the days I abstained. For sure NoFap alone wont do anything but being on about 35 days still felt a lot better than nothing even tho it was one of my only leftovers from this quarantine time. I spent the 2 weeks after recognizing my problem collecting ideas for new habits and reflecting myself. I still didnt start with some of the things I wanted to accomplish but for the most part I made steps in the right direction. Now I am sitting here, trying to sort the things I learned from the last weeks and months and redifing what I want to accomplish in my next weeks or months. **Why I could never go through with my routines and NoFap streaks** I really dont know how often I heard this sentence: *Its not a run, its a marathon....* But I never really understood it. I though I did but now that I really do, I think that I never even tried to get used to this idea. A really big problem for me is to stay motivated and consequent all the time. Im more of a person that suddelny gets a burst of motivation and then tries to do all that stuff he wanted to accomplish in only the next few days. I make a routine and diary entry for next day, wake up early, motivated, energetic and fullfill my time like I should do almost every day. But even on the second or third day, most part of this energy is gone and the story of ""being the person I dont want to be"" starts again. Overall what Im doing here is just disappointing myself again and again but not consequently going through a balanced routine (not too much at once). And this problem is almost the same with NoFap. I am too impatient. I always try to get quick results and get too much into the things that happen at the moment (what isnt wrong in itself) but I often dont see the big picture. I am doing NoFap since around 3/4 year and my biggest streak was 57 days. I dont think this isnt bad at all but there is still a lot of potential left. Also the reason why I relapsed during my biggest streak were mostly the same. The urges catched me in my worst moments, where I didnt see much sense anymore in keeping all those things that should help me becoming a better person, alive. Moments, where I am just searching for any progress but cant find one thing that actually got better. Maybe its that I wanted to etablish new hobbys, habits etc. but never started with or that I train my ass off but see no change in the mirror. Then Im just asking why am I doing this thing right now even if Im still feeling as horrible as before. So I relapse.... but then I recognize that I actually was doing better and feeling better than I did before. But I just couldnt see it in this moment before the relapse. So what I learn from here is that I need to be more patient for sure but also to always remind me that these moments of pure darkness, where I dont see any sense in doing NoFap etc. are just temporarily and that its just my mind trying to trick me into relapsing. I really wanna know how I will develop while my NoFap streak is just getting bigger and bigger. I know that there will be moments where I will feel like getting no more benefits from NoFap but I know that as soon as I relapse, almost everything of the progress will be completely lost and I have to wait again and again. **Redefining goals** I have a great physique and I exercise a lot. But... I mean its just a great physique for a ""normal"" guy. Nothing comparable with bodybuilders or genetic freaks. But it still plays a really big part in my daily life, together with nutrition. The problem is that Im stuck at it... it is like the only thing I do productevily. If I dont do it I feel bad about myself. But the thing is... i dont do it because it makes me hella fun. I know its good for me and Im good at it. But being productevily means training 6 days week for me and I cant even enjoy it. After a while I dont even see any sense in fullfilling my time only with exercising. This cant be my only hobby, so here is my first point. * Variety 1. Going different ways --&gt; different paths, areas, clothes, doing the same things but under other circumstances (a.ex. meditating outside/high/under the shower) 2. Different hobbys --&gt; photography, dancing, singing, cooking, boxing, drawing 3. Education --&gt; documentations, reports, reading, articles, earning money 4. New perspectives --&gt; Being more open for new things (also things that seem to not interest me) This variety thing is a really big point because it makes the life so much more colourful. But my second goal should gain as much attention as my first one. After a long enough duration of fapping around and isolation, I forgot how to make friends, how to maintain good friendships and overall how to connect with people. I mean I have friends. But of these relations arent really that deep like I had before 2 years. During the time I developed a bit of a social anxiety. I never was this extroverted dude who could lead a good conversation with a stranger within a few seconds. But I also never was this social distancing guy, sitting in the corner and feeling lonely. Still sometimes I do and its hard... but I know thats something I wasnt born with and that Im able to change it for good, so here is my second and last point for now. * Getting better with people 1. Leading good conversations with strangers --&gt; a.ex. learning smalltalk 2. Strengthen active relations with friends 3. Giving something to others --&gt; not being the nice guy but just making someone else smile :) 4. Being more involved --&gt; not letting this social anxiety thing overcome me (what if he/she says no, what will he/she think of me...), so just taking risks --&gt; no fear of rejection 5. Social independence --&gt; being carefree of what others think and not changing myself for the wish of acceptance **Methods to achieve these goals** Surely I could try to accomplish these things without any strategy but I think having a plan of not only what to accomplish but also how to do these things for maximum value and efficiency is really important. * Being honest --&gt; not just to others but also to myself. Being honest is a lot harder but also much more worth than pretending to be someone else. Im not really a lier but I think being honest goes much deeper than just not lying. Its not about getting asked something and telling the truth. For me its about standing up for myself, sharing my story, my opinion, my feelings, telling if something goes to far for myself, telling if I dislike something/someone, the meaning of another person for myself, showing vulnerability and not finding excuses for everything. Being honest is so much more than just not lying. * 3-2-1 --&gt; I often have these moments, laying on the bed and just watching youtube videos but not being able to stop and doing the stuff I actually want or need to do. Sometimes I just do something without enjoying it actively but I still cant stop doing it. Counting 3-2-1 sounds sooo simple but its damn effective. * Not too much at once --&gt; like I said before, my routines and streaks often didnt last that long because I planned so much but didnt have the energy or motivation to do all those things, which led to some disappointment in myself. I need to accomplish these things step after step, there is no reason to stress myself out. * Breathing --&gt; just meditating/breathing while doing something is so enjoyable. I feel less stressed, more concentrated and focused. I can just feel the moment, focus on the here and now and reflect my current situation. * Bringing my aggressions under control --&gt; Im not that super aggressive type of person but sometimes I tend to react really impulsive. Im sure getting myself under control by reacting more chilled and relaxed during situations I could actually scream and destroy something, would be much more helpful to solve the actual problem. * Concentrating on one thing --&gt; sometimes I tend to do multitasking, like tapping on my phone while watching videos or even movies. Or watching netflix while exercising. But I need to concentrate and focus on those things Im doing at the moment, so I can do them more efficiently and they are much more enjoyable. Even thinking about other activities instead of the current one can make them less fun and reduce the efficiency. * Being enthusiastic --&gt; we all have things to do that dont enjoy or interest us. But at least trying to enjoy those things is a chance that they can make more fun. You cant pretend being interested in something or having fun at something but it is worth a try to enjoy more things. I also do a lot of things which I dont really enjoy but I also cant say that I hate or dislike doing them. A.ex. brushing the teeth or loading the dishwasher. Im sure such things can be at least a bit more enjoyable while just pretending or trying to have fun with it. * Being alone with my thoughts --&gt; Im always surrounded by anything. If its Youtube, Netflix or just music. But I need to take some breaks of all these.... Just me and my thoughts. * Seing the bigger picture --&gt; like I said before, Im often fixated on the bad things that happen right now or things that doesnt go as well as supposed to be. But most of the time it is just irrational to get a bad mood from those things. Sometimes the progress stucks or it reduces. Thats fine, it can happen. But there is much more outside of this inner cage of bad thoughts. There is always something good hiding in the corner. So thats pretty much what I have reflected on in the last few weeks. It is a lot. But this is the person I want to become. For sure there are some things I didnt think of yet and I also could have gone much more detailed in some of these points. But this discription builds up my foundation for the better version of myself. Lets start a new chapter!"

For me, nofap is a central part of a self-improvement journey that I've been wanting to start for a long time now. Honestly, I never considered myself an addict. After all, PMO is so trivialised nowadays that I didn't think much of it. But it doesn't fucking make sense! I want real connection with real women. We're all lucky as we're supposedly programmed to desire and facilitate this. But, by masturbating, we're effectively replacing this desire with a shitty, low form of pleasure that ultimately makes us feel empty and disconnected from life. As for porn, do we even need to talk about it? This week, I've been taking only cold showers, exercising (cycling and running) and reading at least 1 hour a day. I've downloaded a habit tracking app on my phone which keeps me accountable and proud of my achievements. I also am making sure I go out every day, at least for a short walk. Ugh, for the first time in my life I really want to go sunbathing. Lockdown restrictions are expected to be slightly eased soon where I live, so I'll see if that's possible. All of this is making me more proud of myself and confident. I'm trying to hold eye contact better and speak more clearly. I'd say I'm doing well! I also texted my girl best friend two days ago to say I really missed her -- she had to move because of the pandemic. I've always struggled showing vulnerability and affection so that's a good first step I think. Guys, stay strong. Decide what you want in life and stick to it. You need to work for it. Abstaining from PMO will do wonders but don't expect it to be some cure-all that automatically sorts your life out for you."
21,vulnerability,NoFap,Today I begin !,1,gh0kkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/gh0kkh/today_i_begin/,2020-05-10 22:23:43,"I want to free myself from lust! Ive made attempts in the past but today I make the decision to fight against the urge.. Before I share my story please respect my anonymity.. Prob gonna delete this post and account in the near future...just wanna get this off my chest... So... I was exposed to porn at a young age... That lead to having these sexual thoughts as a young boy. Sexualizing my teachers. Thinking of having sex with the girls in my class.. I was a good kid, just had these sexual thoughts in the back of my mind from time to time.. When middle school came thats when I started to watch porn a lot more and masturbate. I sometimes fapped while thinking of girls in my class (this was the MySpace era). Sure it might be normal for someone at that age to be hormonal, but looking back, I dont think it was healthy to watch porn and sexualize the girls in my class like I did.. It was a bigger problem than it seemed. Once I was talking to a friend about some girl that sucked and swallowed. She said it tasted like salt.. My idiot self ummm..released on myself and got a taste..she was right...but I thought to myself . What the hell am I doing?? This isnt me...Im not gay... I felt shame and super grossed out at myself.. That was just that one time.. Fast forward to 8th grade.. lost my virginity. But the experience wasnt anything special like you might expect. Snuck in a girls house, so couldnt be loud, plus I didnt really know what I was doing...didnt cum. Walked away with blue balls...lol Had sex with some other girl. Took her v card so had to be gentle...wasnt enjoyable...didnt cum.. This was all in middle school.. Honestly feel I shouldve waited for someone special ... High school comes. 9th grade no sex. Just fap and porn. Wasnt that obsessive about it but the problem was there nonetheless. 10th grade, met some girl..that was kinda crazy..due to crazy life.. But my idiot self cared for her because I was just so damn nice. So nice I blinded myself from the fact she was not my type and no good for me. I kinda knew that from the start though.... But We had common interests which was prob the real basis of our friendship/relationship. But I was there for her, she was there for me if I needed to vent about life.. My first REAL experiences were with her though. I made out for the first time with her. Really felt on a girls body for the first time with her. We almost ended up having sex..but I didnt have a condom.. Me and her were on and off..we split up at one point..she loses her virginity to some other dude..they break up.. She comes to me..my idiot self takes her back.. We finally ended up having sex. And I cummed! Lol That moment felt like I had sex for the first time...plus I had feelings for the girl so it just felt real to me this time. This on and off relationship lasted till the beginning of 12th grade.. Being close..having sex...then being enemies ... then repeat Wasnt healthy ... Even when we were together having sex, I would still watch porn and fap every now and then. It was less often at that point thats for sure. Only now I realize I was only with her for the sex... I didnt really like her as a person... I was just a ppl pleaser, and so damn nice, and scared to be alone I guess She didnt make me happy really..only added to my misery really.. But how else was I gonna have sex? (My young subconscious mind thought) Wasnt worth it now that I look back. Apparently there was girls in my school that liked me, but I was so caught up with this girl. She made me feel so shitty and insecure about myself that I couldnt even believe other girls liked me.. My dumb ass was too blinded by craving sex... After high school, I was 18, and had way more free time... I got lost in my head and lustful thinking. Which means more fap and porn. After watching and watching hung guys giving pleasure and being orally pleasured by women, I started being turned on by big..uhh.. u know.....even though I didnt want it to... this is the point I started losing control and the problem became real to me.. My mind seeked for more...I looked up self sucking... After stretching and stretching, I finally pleasured myself (talk about fapping to the extreme) It was back straining and wasnt worth it... I dont think Ive done any crazy damage but my back is def not the same as it was. I could feel sharp tension on certain areas of my spine... Anyways...you would think the back pain that comes after would teach me a lesson but nope! I was so hooked to the feeling of orally pleasuring myself... And Im pretty average so it took a lot more for me to actually do it successfully.. I even swallowed.... I feel shameful to even write any of this..so bare with me.. Honestly its sad how someone can be that desperate for pleasure that he would  break his back to do so.. I even had these thoughts in the middle of doing it... Like why am I doing this. Why dont I just go dating and try to get a female to do this.. I think the fact that my ex from high school barely gave me oral, made me obsess about it.. Through porn and eventually with the whole self sucking thing.. From 18, Fast forward to 22... Wasnt having as much sex...maybe a few times a year with random girls from dating apps...if not...no sex at all really. I was deprived compared to the amount of sex I had in my high school relationship.. So I was still definitely fapping and watching porn... Only self sucked on rare occasions cause it was just too much stretching and back straining for me to even do it.. I had to really be feining for the pleasure to do it... Anyways, I met this girl through a friend at some point. She invited me to a hotel, one thing led to the other and we have sex. Since that day, me and that girl had sex almost everyday for like 2 months straight. My ex from high school left me insecure, but this new girl gave me my confidence back! Only problem is, I would still fap sometimes. Just because or when she was on her period.. Addiction to pleasure and porn was still an underlying problem for me I guess... I even went out my way to self suck a couple times, In between the time I was talking to her Which makes no sense to me! Why in the hell was I so compelled to pleasure myself when I had a girl to pleasure me. It pleasured her to give me oral. And she even gave me oral on her period. Yes she swallowed... But yet my addiction got the best of me.. Regardless I knew me and this girl was gonna be a just moment. I knew we wouldnt last. At first it was nice and looked to be a real potential relationship. But I know sometimes things are too good to be true. She eventually lost interest and went to another guy. That kinda brought me down, but I got over her pretty quick. But this led My addiction and led me deeper in the abyss though... I got to the point I made secret dating accounts, and messaging guys to meet up, enabling these toxic fantasies in my head. I actually meet up with someone in their car at like 4am. I backed out of giving oral cause, I felt shame, guilt. Couldnt even look at the guy cause I felt so wrong... I just went home. Its funny cause I was on the messages talking like a freak lol but that wasnt me. It was the lust talking. At that point I truly realized that I needed to stop what I was doing.. I let the lust get too far to the point of controlling me to be somebody Im really not.. Its hard to think straight in the moment of feining for pleasure, but after ejaculation, I feel like an idiot, shame, and guilt. After I cum, any erotic thoughts of men goes away. I get turned off and grossed out. Like yo wtf am I doing lol Ever since I met up with that guy and almost did something.. Ive been trying to fight Im 24 now, Ive made attempts to rid porn of my life entirely. Ive been successful but would relapse. I used IG models as a replacement for porn. I read that fantasizing of women and using your imagination is better than watching porn. So thats my reasoning I guess It can be just as bad though because a lot of IG models are fake..fake bodies...fake lifestyles...trust me..they are not looking out for your best interest.. They want to thirst trap you to lure you in with lust for $$ Its a very evil business motto in my opinion... Capitalizing and enabling mens addiction and vulnerability to pleasure... Anyways, Ive rid myself of IG models so I disassociate IG with pleasure.. Since I got rid of porn and lusting on IG, I relapsed recently, looking for an alternative, and thats when I found nsfw threads on reddit.. Again IG models..fake..so I figured if I relapse let me look at real girls and fantasize about them as a healthier alternative... Honestly, it didnt help... Although real girls was a pleasure to look at, fapping and being lustful, only triggers my thoughts of pleasuring hung men. Its not me though. Cause like I said right after ejaculation it all goes away. I dont always have thoughts of men but its in the back of my mind if I ever get too deep into lusting... I WANT IT ALL TO GO AWAY THOUGH! I SPENT ENOUGH TIME LURKING ON REDDIT! THIS IS NOT ME. THIS IS NOT WHO I AM OR REPRESENT! Just another man trapped in this crazy world of the 21st century... Its so easy for someone to get sucked into lust. Men AND women. Just look around. Sex is everywhere. And it seems everything is being sexualized more and more nowadays, no matter where you turn! BUT I WILL FIGHT. I WILL RESIST!! I TOLD MY STORY.. BUT NOW ITS TIME I TAKE CONTROL OF MY LIFE AND MY MIND. TODAY I FREE MY CONSCIOUS AND TODAY I FREE MYSELF FROM FAP, PORN, AND ADDICTION TO PLEASURE! Wish me luck yall!!! Hope my story helps and inspires others!!"
22,vulnerability,NoFap,My story,1,gprvly,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/gprvly/my_story/,2020-05-25 01:46:33,"Hi everyone, &amp;#x200B; I suffer from porn and sex addiction, and in the past also from drug addiction. I've been trying to quit my compulsive sexual behavior since about two years now, and I've been receiving professional help for over half a year now. To be honest, I haven't made much progress with abstinence. In a conversation with my therapist I came to the conclusion that I feel too bad too often to be able to dedicate myself sufficiently to changing my behaviour. I suffer from emotional ups and downs, my therapist says it could be a bipolar disorder, but I'm not a big fan of the disorder diagnosing, I try to look at my inner world personally, sadly I frequently have suicidal thoughts, and during these moments life seems just pointless to me. At this point I could have told myself to do al kinds off things, but I just can't seem to care. But even though I still frequently relapse, I have made progress in other aspects of my life; I do sports 2 or 3 times a week, I've created a healthy rhythm of eating, meditating, stretching, learning to program, playing guitar and writing in my diary at the end of the day, this has been helping me a lot lately. I want to keep going and be free from this compulsive behaviour. I'm going to have a talk with my mother soon, I want to repair the fundamental relationship with her, she has hurt me immensely in the past, so has my father, and this makes me fear to show my vulnerability to people, as I've hidden it for years to protect myself. For years I wasn't concsious of my feelings of sadness and loneliness, and I had no idea it would help me to have a look at my own emotional needs. Nobody asked ever asked me what I needed. Now I know though. I need to feel connected with other people, I want to be able to show the true me to others, and I surely don't want to look for intimacy in having sex with prostitutes anymore. I still have a long way to go, but I feel my life is slowly improving. Im trying to keep the bigger picture in mind; I want to learn to code, work hard for a few years, save some money, buy myself a nice property out in the country, or maybe even a sailboat, and sail around the world or just live on my property with a beautiful wife and kids, enjoying music and literature in peace. &amp;#x200B; Thank you all for reading. If you've been feeling hopeless, all I can say is this; keep going. Even if you keep relapsing, you're life WILL change for the better if you stick with it."
23,vulnerability,NoFap,Quitting should not be the goal here...,1,gq6mew,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/gq6mew/quitting_should_not_be_the_goal_here/,2020-05-25 17:31:35,"So what happens when you focus on quitting a bad habit/activity? That activity becomes perceived as more powerful than it really is. Im pretty sure 90% of the dudes on here , first got interested in no fap because there was a time they couldnt get their dick hard when they were with someone that they were really attracted to. Thats one of the most painful experiences a dude can go through, and I know that because its happened to me a lot. Bare with me here. Its kind of like a reward pathway feedback loop. When you are in a good relationship, you start to have lots of sex. You get comfortable, you go into autopilot, you lose your vulnerabilities and you start to really get good at sex with your partner. Then, you break up. If youre smart, when you break up youre already with someone else that you know you enjoy having sex with. If youre not smart(arguably) you break up without having another branch to grab a hold of. What happens? You now cant have sex every time you want. You must go out and look for a new partner. With that, youre obligated to expose your vulnerability, your insecurities, and try and fuck a woman that you dont know anything about like Johnny Sins. With alcohol, this sometimes works. Even sometimes without alcohol it works. But at some point or another the process of having to expose yourself to new women repeatedly only to have mediocre sex starts to become more and more uncomfortable. Pair that with increased porn consumption, and boom, youre probably gonna find yourself with a limp dick at some point. Ive been there a lot . And I always wonder about why, why is my dick not raging hard, if I can watch a woman that looks like the one in front of me (give or take) on a porno and bust a nut in no time. There are a lot of things broken here. Porn is just a part of it. Porn is not the devil unless you make it be. If you put no Fap on a pedastal, youre missing the point. Its not just black and white here. Your dick may not get hard because it misses your ex. It hasnt found anybody it feels as safe with as your ex. It might not get hard because its kind of weird to have sex with strangers some times. I think no fap is a good idea. But I think a better idea would be replace fap or  forget fap Like try and live a life designed around the things that you want to do in your life. Dont try and live a life based on avoiding things. How about instead of setting a goal to avoid masturbating for 30 days, you set a goal to work out for 30 days. Or play a guitar for thirty days. Or meditate. Or go to counseling. I think on some level, no fap is really genius, because humans love to idealize things that are seemingly attainable and always close. We start to think that no fap is going to change us into a new person. We think that just that one thing is going to fix every problem we have. But if you just stop masturbating, but continue to eat junk food, never exercise and be unemployed while playing fort night all day long, well, you aint gonna see much spiritual evolution. I just made it 20 days, and it was a good experience, my longest to date. But I was thinking about all the time I spent those 20 days thinking about my dick, and how I wasnt gonna touch it. Id like to do 20 days or more again, but not fantasizing over it. Id like to go 20 or more days without masturbating, because I go travel, start a company, find work or a hobby that gets me passionate. I think masturbation is a reflection of a different problem than porn-we are living lives that are utterly unsatisfactory, and we dont have anything more important to distract us. Not that porn isnt a problem, because it is. But porn comes into our lives always when there is something else missing. So dont focus so hard on no fap. Focus on what get you happy. What makes you more excited than porn. And If porn is the only thing that gets you excited, start imagining a better life for yourself, and start doing the things you need to do to make that real. No fap is good, living passionately is better."

I had unrestricted internet access from the time I was maybe 12 or 13. It was so easy to hide away, being the only person in my household with knowledge of computers, and drown myself in every type and form of pornography on the web. Im 34 now, and still fighting this battle. It has affected me most of my life, it was one of many problems that lead to the failure of my first marriage. At the time, I didnt acknowledge that. I didnt understand how much it can actually affect your mind and concentration, or your ability to keep intimate connections with other people. I masturbated almost daily, sometimes more than once. I would sneak out of bed and stay up late hours into the night going down a rabbit hole, towards some unattainable piece of fantasy to best the last thing I looked at. Never really filling the void, just finishing and putting off the search until next time. Its like this object in the distance that you feel like will be the be all end all. The trick is it isnt real. What we're really craving is intimacy, acceptance, and vulnerability with another person. That temporary rush is just that, shallow and empty. An endless void. My marriage fell apart after she had a physical affair, multiple actually. I felt devastated, demolished into nothing. Worthless. Porn was my friend, it was there for me when my wife betrayed me. It felt like the only release I had. It didnt judge me, or make me feel useless. It didnt seem harmful, it seemed redeeming. Fast forward, I met an awesome new girl. She had her share of demons and I worked so hard to give her my support and help lift her from her darkness. We prospered together in so many ways, pressing each other forward to new challenges and adventures. So much was so good..... but there was this problem between us.... my sex drive was empty, or so it seemed. I didnt put it together. I danced around the porn issue, I denied it to myself, I made excuses, I lied... meanwhile, this woman who I worked so hard to win over and to help confront her demons, was suffering by my actions. She was feeling hurt, unappreciated, unattractive, all the ways I felt when my exwife had cheated on me. I honestly believed she was over reacting. Im fine. Theres nothing wrong with jerking off daily and having sex once a month at best..right? I was so naive. We since got married, bought a house, had two beautiful babies, got new careers. Kicking ass at life, taking trips, not stressing over bills. Still this darkness follows us. She feels it, I deny it, we keep doing this dance. Well, its in the open, Ive been giving all my sexual energy to porn, and at some points even cam girls, and withholding from my beautiful, loving, awesome wife, the mother of my beautiful children. Im hurting her, Im driving her away. May have done too much damage already to repair..... time will tell.. I just want to heal, to help her heal, and to keep my family together. I feel like my whole world is slipping through my fingers, and still Im sitting here fighting this darkness of release. Why is this so hard? It feels so dumb.... Sorry if this is scatterbrained, just needed to get it out."

Then, I was laid off from a job I loved, and it hit me hard. ***I knew something had to change***, I was so hurt and I felt like I couldn't take anymore pain. I deeply reflected and asked some hard questions and quickly realized alcohol gave my negative self-talk a megaphone, and fueled my depression and anxiety. It gave me nothing worth keeping. Now I'm recently single and I find myself in a similar place of pain and the inability to continue with things as they are currently. I'm now asking myself some hard questions again, and I'm in an open and vulnerable place. What is my relationship with porn? When did I first experience porn? What is porn giving/taking from me? I have many early memories of porn. It made me feel thrilled, dangerous yet safe, alive, comforted, and it satiated my constant curiosity. I wanted to see people naked! PMO was me time, free of shame. We live in a world with so much shame. I was raised catholic and porn was the opposite of everything I was taught, and it felt so much better than being told god is ALWAYS WATCHING/I would burn in hell. I work so hard all the time. I'm a people pleaser. I hold stress and anxiety all day every day and fapping has been my single vice and already I'm feeling hesitant and in denial about it ending. It has become so routine for me, like I view it the same way as brushing my teeth or putting on shoes to leave the house. **I'm asking for your help**.

27,vulnerability,NoFap,Theory: PMO as an outlet,1,fxmxfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/fxmxfz/theory_pmo_as_an_outlet/,2020-04-09 15:57:30,"Ive got a theory, or something of a revelation upon reflection of my own actions, as well as those of some people in the media. I think its pretty dark but very relevant to nofap. Many of us turn to this addiction as an outlet for stress: sexual, personal, professional; an expression of fear, optimism, hatred, love. The evidence is there and I advise a lot of you true addicts find the darkness that implores you turn to this self-destructive habit. Ive come to realise, on top of a degree of crippling social anxiety, a lot of the porn fetishes I adopted over years of PMO were actually derived from my personal life. For example, when I was heart broken, rejected (which I took as not being strong enough as a man/provider for my girlfriend/crush), I tended towards content that honed this. Inversely, when I was feeling down on myself (ugly, worthless, self-hating), the videos I watched exude the opposite of this. What Im trying to say is, where there is a suppression of true emotion in real life, or as I see it, failing to address your feelings and who you are as a person in that time, there is an inevitable, natural, human tendency to sub-consciously act out in defiance. We see this in highly-regarded politicians becoming corrupt, or conservative, holy public figures committing unthinkable acts...People becoming exactly what they hate. Essentially, balanced human beings are not self-destructive. They dont need to watch porn. They dont need to masturbate as an escape. I think there is a lesson in this for all of us: Find that dark side, and address it. Come to terms with it, or better, accept it. Address your emotions- trust how your feeling, identify whats going wrong, and fix it. Accept you are not always going to be 100% you, and roll with it. As men, we tend to expect so much of ourselves; we need to be there for the women in our lives, show no vulnerability. Release this vulnerability in a healthy way- not porn. Putting emotion into art, or pent up sexual energy into sport has worked in so many nofap success stories...theres a reason for this. Channel your energy, transmute your sexual urges. It can catch up to you, otherwise. The greatest men to ever live werent porn addicts; they were great. Nofap is just the beginning of greatness- it truly comes from within. Peace and love brothers."

This time, didn't have the urge to watch a video, but I did have the urge to masturbate for the first time in 2 months. I remember my commitment was to not watch porn, so I perused some reddit threads about masturbating to a significant other, and many people said it was normal, so I proceeded to masturbate to the thought of my girlfriend. Even typing that feels weird, and I have some shame about it, but I was wondering if this shame is something based on my old habits, or if it truly is something I feel guilty for.

Often times the person you love most is who you want to confide in, who you wish you could be vulnerable with, often times time the harsh reality is that same person will be the first one to use that vulnerability to her advantage. For years i was forcing a toxic relationship, now that we are ""best friends"" i realize how fake she is. Valentines day I was blocked because i didn't take her out, mind you she loves to constantly remind me that we are ""just friends"" but that sure isn't how she acts on the phone at 2 AM. I feel like i'm a placeholder to boost her ego. No human is perfect and we all deal with things, i just wish she could be vulnerable with me instead of manipulative. Now i've realized that whenever she is around another guy she will block my number so my name doesn't pop up. I didn't get mad but honestly relieved. This fantasy girl is not real, this best friend is not genuine, I was let down for a reason. Life is pushing me to complete this reset and go about my personal journey.

32,vulnerability,NoFap,The secret power of daily routines.,1,figejd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/figejd/the_secret_power_of_daily_routines/,2020-03-14 21:35:17,"In the late 19th century a Texas man, [George Dullnig, got mad when he discovered oil](URL on his property, since he had *really* just been looking for water! At the time, land in Texas was selling for nearly nothing. And almost overnight, big areas previously seen as boring wasteland were selling for millions of dollars.in the open spaces, people started finding treasure  and a source of great power. The same might be true for you. For any of us on this journey, it's understandable that lots of attention goes to the moments *directly connected* to porn or other unwanted sexual behaviors. From triggers and urges, to a setback itself, all of this can take up quite a bit of mental energy. What about all those OTHER moments when we're *not hit* with an urge or a trigger  when we're just living our lives? Its pretty easy to overlook all THOSE moments as somehow unrelated to our recovery. What if we started taking more advantage of these moments  the gaps of time *between* struggles  digging down to discover what kind of untapped power the rest of our lives might unleash? Get this: You will have about 500 hours this month when youre awake  and nearly 6,000 hours over the next year. No matter how stuck youre feeling, only a *small fraction* of these hours are going to be directly touched by porn, right? *So what are we doing with the rest of our time?* That might just be your million dollar question! Some military leaders have found that what wins a war is the time *in between* battles when youre *not fighting.* Some of you may have days or weeks in between struggles. Others may have hours. Regardless, the question is the same: what can we do with *that time*? Look: there are *all sorts of things* we know are good for us  from exercise to getting unplugged to family time. But how many of us live these good things on a regular basis? One way to do that is to gradually build them into our automatic, habitual way of living  or in other words, our schedule or routine. A lot of people have never established a daily routine. Others have only followed a schedule *others* have given them. And then there are schedules that change a lot. Think back to the last time you that you kept a chaotic or unbalanced schedule  with sporadic sleep, random meals, infrequent exercise or no quiet time. Compared to a steady routine, many have found that this kind of random lifestyle can actually set them up and fuel vulnerability. This makes sense given the research on habit formation  specifically, how strongly our many habits are tied to surrounding environmental cues and rewards that reinforce certain actions over and over again. If the *only thing* we changed was creating new cues or rewards in our daily schedule, its possible to literally engineer all sorts of habits that can move us toward freedom. If this is true, maybe its time to get serious about a daily routine. Even though most of us have *some kind* of a schedule, its a whole other question whether that schedule is helping us move in the right direction. Check out your own schedule  asking yourself whether any of the following are true for you: \-How about the **Big Three: Food, Sleep and Exercise**? How are you doing with those? As best you can, try to keep meals, when you go to bed, and when you wake up fairly consistent. And of course, even *a little* regular physical activity can make a huge difference too. \-**Quiet Time.** It seems harder and harder to find any consistent time to un-plug, disconnect or ponder. Do you prioritize things like going on a walk, reading a book or meditating? \-**Connection time.** What about spending time connecting with other people  outside of social media  and working on *real* relationships? \-**Passions.** Its so helpful to find time for your passions, your talents and your hobbies  whatever they are. Too often, we set those aside as not important. For the foreseeable future, also find regular time to mark your Battle Tracker and check in with your allies or the people you trust. You might find it helpful to write your schedule down and maybe even check things off when youre done with them. There are plenty of great apps and planners out there  so do whatever works for you! Now this doesnt mean becoming rigid, of course. Schedules evolve as we grow and change. Have some fun as you experiment with a daily schedule that is a good fit for you: \-If you need more time to exercise or time to yourself, try waking up earlier. \-If late nights are wearing you down, put your electronics away, put your phone down and do whatever it takes to get in bed a little earlier. That doesnt mean adjusting schedules is always easy. Anyone who has tried changing their sleep schedule, for instance, knows it can take some real determination. But dont let that stop you! Even (and especially) when we struggle to be strong with pornography, we can draw strength from *other habits in our life.* As we become consistent in areas of our life we *do* have power over, our power in weaker areas can actually grow. So play around with the routine that is just right for you. And once you've settled on a good schedule, try sticking with it  no matter how you feel! It's time to strike oil in your own backyard. You've got thousands of hours ahead. *So what are you going to do with them?*"

I used porn to self medicate, to mask the negative emotions I was experiencing and to gain a temporary relief from unhappiness, boredom etc. The problem with this is it is very temporary, like any addiction you need more and more to get the same effect, the more you get the more you beat yourself up and the worse you feel and round and around you go. I repeated this same cycle for over 20 years, slowly but surely loathing myself more and more. Eventually a couple of months ago I just reached a point it didn't matter how often or how much porn I looked at there was no relief any more. I couldn't suppress the negative emotions or continue with the self denial about how out of control I was or unsatisfied I was with my life. I stopped looking at porn, started NoFap, started meditating and exercising, started socialising with friends and I've felt stronger emotionally than I have in years. I've since been arrested in relation to my internet activity and this has been a huge blow, I'm now more depressed, anxious and stressed than I've ever been. Suicidal thoughts even enter my mind when I contemplate the consequences but you know what I still feel stronger and more free than I ever have. These thoughts and emotions I now experience are so painful I feel myself welling up with tears at random times of the day, just now sat at my desk at work as I type this, but you know what now I embrace it all, at last I know that I'm alive and I don't want to hide from my emotions any more. My mind is no longer numbed either by using porn or pre-occupied with when I can next look at it. Porn used to be my life, if I was at work, out with friends or family half the time I'd be counting down till I could go home and watch porn instead of living for the moment. Porn still pops in to my mind and I would be lying to say all temptation has gone. I have images in my mind I wish I had never seen and that I could erase but my thoughts no longer linger on porn I've seen or that I want to see, when a thought or image pops in to my mind of porn I think of all the negatives consequences no matter how painful and dismiss the urge, for the temporary relief it would bring I would not exchange one minute more of my life, I realise now it is too precious. Life can be full of happiness, joy, love but also pain, sadness and heartache, embrace it, embrace your vulnerability, survive and grow stronger, then you can truly come to appreciate the life that you have and savour the happy moments when they come."

It's not easy and today I did peek at an Instagram model for roughly couple of minutes before closing the page. I don't personally count this as a relapse as I am yet to PMO exactly and I know that real PMO would mean visiting a P site. That being said it was not okay that I looked at something soft core so I regard this as a small slip/vulnerability. It definitely doesn't make life any easier when I am working from home during the COVID-19 outbreak. I think what I do from here is really important. If those actions are any significant I will eventually end up relapsing to actual P which may lead to MO. This is just my confession and I'm not willing to lose to these urges. I want to fight back and get myself back in the game as I approach day 25 shortly. Any tips and advice to prevent myself from ending up at back-to-square-1 would be well appreciated!

I hope many already do. Here's my response to someone who had a relapse after realizing if they aren't well rested, they're more vulnerable to relapse: ""Good job identifying tiredness as a vulnerability for relapse. 12 step groups will teach that you are always vulnerable in any of the acronym HALT (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired). It's helpful, because instead of just trying some random activity to ""distract yourself"" when you feel urges, choose an activity that addresses one of those issues. If you're really hungry and it's making you weak and you don't feel like fighting, urges from your addiction will come. So close the computer, turn off the phone, and go eat. If you're tired, and in a position where you have the opportunity to relapse (at home alone, in bed, no one watching), you probably also have the opportunity to sleep, so don't relapse, just go to sleep. If your angry or resentful, address those feelings with the person or someone who cares about you and get the feelings out If you're lonely, call someone, hang out with someone, come to nofap and chat with us. There is always a better answer than relapse. You just have to find it"""
36,vulnerability,NoFap,Excerpt from Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules For Life which reminded me of NoFap's effects on my life,1,f88nvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/f88nvc/excerpt_from_jordan_petersons_12_rules_for_life/,2020-02-23 23:08:23,"Since I quit nofap a few days ago, I've been trying to read the books which were once bought and left unread in my room. This is one of those. This chapter argues how our posture is a reflection of our inner condition, i.e. that of stress free happiness/satisfaction or that of low status/stressed out painful being. And how forcing ourselves to maintain a straight and shoulder back posture can counter those negative perceptions of ourselves. As I read through the chapter, I realised how negative my overall body language and posture has been since as long as I can remember, and how that was due to the shame I carried with me from PMO. The following excerpt best summarises how I feel now that I have quit and it reminds me of the voluntary struggle that we have taken upon our shoulders as part of this community, so that we all may walk without hesitation with our shoulders back: ""To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality (it means acting to please God, in the ancient language)."""
37,vulnerability,NoFap,Reframing Your Femdom-Based Urges,1,f8migj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/f8migj/reframing_your_femdombased_urges/,2020-02-24 16:28:08,"Hi All, I don't expect this post to be accessible to all of you - there is a certain degree of open mindedness required. The information has been helpful for me, and I hope some of you find it helpful as well. Jung famously said ""Until you **make the unconscious conscious**, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."" The post below tries to make light of some unconscious forces in your psyche that the P industry manipulates. I use Femdom based porn as an example below. I think we can all agree that Femdom P in its very hardcore forms are porn induced. **Being Judged by Groups/Society:** This is one of the most primitive fears that govern our actions. It is actually quite irrational that most of us walk around with the fear of being judged by groups of people or society at large. You may not be aware of it, but this fear is subconsciously affecting how you interact with the world. Psychologists theorize that this fear is exactly why masses of people are mostly drawn to symbol of Jesus on the crucifix. I'm not arguing the existence of god - I'm merely highlighting that one of the most popular symbols to captivate the world is rooted in the shame/vulnerability associated with being judged by society. The P industry knows that this fear lies within you - and knows that you are quite unaware of it. As such, it has created an outlet for you to provide this fear some relief. It is the reason why so much of Femdom based porn involve more than 2 people. There is always a 3rd viewing entity that fills the role of ""societal judgement."" I won't list the types of porn these may be, because I know the words are triggering for some. **Dominant vs. Submissive:** You need to forget these terms. They are hypertriggering, unimaginative, and terms that reduce the spectrum of both male and female sexuality. Replace them with ""Active &amp; Passive"" or ""Lead &amp; Follow."" You may or may not be primed towards one style of love-making, but you are capable of both. If you've ever tried ballroom dancing, you'll know that there are girls are eager to take the lead, but are happy to let you do also. It is the same for you. Maybe admit to yourself that you want to ""follow"" because you are anxious or have less experience as a lover, but don't let the P industry capitalize on than fear to sell you the idea of being ""dominated"" by a mistress because you are weak and/or pathetic. **Your Mind is Actually Telling You Something:** You can actually take these forces and reorganize them to break your addiction. You fetish is actually telling you what you need to do. Objectively speaking, if you watch Femdom P, you are rewarding yourself through the fantasy of being put in a vulnerable position to please women. Here's the kicker - psychologically speaking that is very natural. Women are the gate keepers to intimacy and they have final say on whether your genes get to survive your death. Asking the pretty girl to dance is to put yourself in a vulnerable position. You are allowing her judge you. You are allowing everyone in the ballroom see you get rejected. Stand in all those fears and anxiety that consume you. Get rejected - who cares. Know that you can handle it AND THAT **NO ONE IS WATCHING OR CARES.** Which brings me to my last point. **Femdom P is capitalizes on a deep desire for commitment** \- so much of it has commitment undertones! The more comfortable she feels around you, the more she feels safe to let out her adventurous side. Who can blame a guy for being into that?! But the trick is to make her feel comfortable, not to buy P's idea of admitting you have no power or masculine presence."
38,vulnerability,NoFap,Being honest with myself - resetting my counter from 238 days,1,elpew4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/elpew4/being_honest_with_myself_resetting_my_counter/,2020-01-08 18:16:11,"Yo guys. I hope you all read this. A week ago, my good buddy posted a success story on here and outlined his blueprint to &gt;240 days fap free. Its a good read, link below: URL In this post, my buddy mentions that he had an accountability partner to keep him on track and to reinstate motivation during times that it lacked. This is me. We independently discovered the concept of no fap only later to realize that we were fighting a common fight. At the time that we started opening up about this to each other we were both constantly relapsing. Daily. We wanted change and improvement in our lives. We demanded change and improvement in our lives. We were both able to get a true handle on this thing ~240 days ago. Until recently, my streak was neck and neck with his. In late December I lost my diligence and I lapsed during a period of vulnerability. Even after seemingly getting out of the vicious cycle, after reaping the benefits, after making changes and improvements, I took a major step backwards. I have the following insights and advice based on my experience: 1) find yourself an accountability partner immediately. Do not be embarrassed and do not hold back. Do be honest and do check in. Do not stop checking in 2) Do not ever let your guard down. I let my guard down and I got burnt. We will always be vulnerable. Drug addicts can never casually use again. Carry and apply this mindset 3) Reflect and note your triggers. Remove triggers from your life when possible. Pay attention to the way you use social media and evaluate the impact it has on your life. Make a change if you need to 4) Get sleep, drink water and be active When you do get a handle on this and you enter the domain of a lengthy streak, you will notice benefits. Ive seen numerous posts on here with people doubting the benefits and questioning the legitimacy. This is nonsense. My most profound benefits have been: 1) A strong desire to connect with people. What I mean by this is a strong desire to engage in meaningful conversation, to ask questions and to learn about others 2) Confidence. So much confidence. The life of the party, the story teller, the guy that makes people laugh and speaks loudly 3) Mental clarity 4) Energy  I so badly wanted to deny this recent occurrence and pretend that it didnt happen. But it did happen. I pledged to be accountable and I am doing exactly that. On a final note, I hope that you all succeed with your resolutions and goals in 2020. But I truly feel that the foundation of your wellbeing starts here. Get a handle on this, and the rest will unfold. Gain some fucking momentum and never look back."
39,vulnerability,NoFap,War on Porn Addiction,1,emgrss,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/emgrss/war_on_porn_addiction/,2020-01-10 09:01:31,"I hate porn. I hate what it has done to my brain overtime. I hate how it makes me feel about myself. I hate how it degrades women. I hate everything I hear about how the actors and actresses in porn have horrible self esteem and depression and how the system abuses and takes advantage of their vulnerability. I hate how it has warped part the way I look at sex. I hate how it detracts from and stands in opposition to some of the best parts of me and my character, especially the part of me that values true, meaningful, loving, and selfless relationships. I hate how its affected the people in this subreddit and how it keeps them from being the men/women they want to be. And yet somehow I end up watching it again and again. I take responsibility for that. its been my choices. Sometimes my motivations to be better fail me. Im done with that. So this is me, declaring a war on pornography and my addiction to it. Im officially dedicating myself to destroying my desires for this fake bullshit. Not only will I win, but porn will lose. It will lose when I choose not to watch it, it will lose when I encourage people on here to keep battling there addiction, and it will lose as more and more of its viewers realize they want more for themselves. We got this guys. Lets keep up the fight."
40,vulnerability,NoFap,Learning to be OK with being a powerful person,1,enqctl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/enqctl/learning_to_be_ok_with_being_a_powerful_person/,2020-01-13 04:29:32,"I was just discussing this in a post with a person but I felt it to be so worthwhile that I thought I'd elaborate and turn it into a post of its own. Tl:DR- there is more to the struggle than just not touching your dick or not orgasming. to succeed at nofap you have to learn to embrace your power and reach your highest potential, which is fucking difficult and IMO is the true difficulty of nofap. The less you fap, the more powerful you become. Many people just can't handle past a certain level of power, myself included. However as I work on self-empowerment and being OK with being a powerful person, it's easier to get bigger and bigger streaks. A 21 day streak will have you like, super powerful. You might find yourself opening up a lot to people (experiencing more vulnerability), talking to people, taking risks, being daring, etc. (also I should note that when I do streaks, I'm not just doing nofap. im also avoiding caffine, alcohol, weed, drugs of all kinds, tobacco, excessive social media, excessive social content, video games, anxious rumination, and isolating from friends. nofap is just one leg of my success table) That can be scary to many people. So it's not like the only issue is to avoid porn, or to avoid masturbation, there is another issue that most nofappers have no idea about and **it's learning to be OK with being a powerful person.** If you can't stand your own power, or have limiting beliefs like ""i am weak, i am small, i should stay small and weak, i am unworthy, i am powerless"" etc, then as soon as you get on a big streak you will have conflicting feelings and will want to relapse. Working on beliefs and your mind can probably help you a ton in your streaks. It has been very helpful for me. \- new tangent- imagine this. That the YOU (me, I) that can see far into the future, and has a very high level of sight and vision, isn't the only you. Imagine that there is another you that is much much more concerned with the short term. this other you, lets call it body, has a great deal of power in decision making and influencing willpower and actions. So the body is only seeing immediate and near immediate cause and effect, long term effects are not prioritized much, if at all. It knows that when you stop fapping, you become more open, you are more at risk for confrontation, for vulnerability, for taking responsibility and action and a million other things that are not easy to handle. And on the other hand, it knows that by fapping it gets to avoid all those things, experience great pleasure and euphoria, an intense orgasm, and gets to look at pictures of the most beautiful women available, women that would never show their nude body to them in real life. If you could sit down, and really weigh those odds. which would you choose? Something incredibly easy, like fapping and avoiding your power, life, and responsibility? or not fapping, and learning to become empowered, full of vitality, learning to chase dreams, AND FAIL AT THEM, and fail at a million other things because you are not afraid to try? its easy for me to see why I have such an issue with fapping. It's not just porn or masturbation, it's that when I stay fapping I can avoid 1000 other things that I would begin doing if I stopped fapping. like chase dreams, stand my own ground, be powerful, etc. Things that are very scary, difficult, and could result in pain, tragedy, loss, failure, etc. &amp;#x200B; What I'm trying to say is it's not fucking easy. Not fapping isn't hard, it only takes about 10 seconds of will power when you get an urge. Not watching porn isn't that hard, again all you have to do is take about 10 seconds of will power and redirect yourself. **Learning to be your best self, to chase your dreams, to face failure, vulnerability, and a thousand other things that you will do once you are not fapping. THATS FUCKING HARD.** Ok rant is kind of over. This other bit from an earlier post is something else I noticed. \--- its possible for people to have more power than they can contain. it results in a bit of going crazy or kind of like, going off the rails or something. People who have more power than they can contain become aggressive, combative, malicious, manipulative, anxious, fearful, paranoid, vain, and many other things. building power is only half the battle, knowing how to maintain it is also important. and knowing your limits is helpful. In the beginning of my self-empowerment journey I just kept trying to build and build and build but I would just explode after a certain point. Eventually I learned my limits and now very gently expand them so that I still grow, it's just at a more peaceful pace. another way of saying it, there must be a balance of inward flow of energy and outward flow of energy. Certain practices build your energy, others deplete it. It's not healthy to only do things to build build build without giving back the energy or putting your energy out into the world in some way. Common ways of getting energy back into the world are work, community service, making and expressing art, making youtube videos, posting on instagram, etc."

My bestfriend and I were not in school yet. We would play video games and watch Tom and Jerry and do natural kid things, One day we were messing with the T.V and i dont know what we pressed but one of My friends fathers porn tapes got turned on, I remember how deeply in shock we were. we were frozen, we couldnt move, and i still remember so vividly the tape, it was a blonde woman performering a blowjob on a man, his mother came in and saw us and quickly turned it off, i remember sitting on the couch in complete shock, this is my earliest experience with sexual things. In the past I never noticed how much this affected me but now I believe that did something to my psyche as I was a very sexually minded young kid. I had pushed that to the back of my mind tho. Fastforward to being 10 years old I was extremely obssesed with sex and wanting it and learning about it, I began to ""do things"" and see if I was able to release, one day I did and it was like a world was discovered. one day on a day alone I decided to look at pornography. when I did it was like the biggest rush of dopamine and crazy feeling, my heart was beating fast feeling it was wrong to do so but the feeling was so overwelmingly strong that I loved it. my family was going through hard times at this point because my older sibling became pregnant and lost her child at an extremly young age. this deeply depressed my family and put us through extremely rough times, me being the middle child I feel as i had the lowest amount of attention due to my older siblings terrible pain she was going through and also naturally my youngest sibling was extremely babied and looked after, I began my escapisim through video games, skateboarding and of course pornography. Looking back every year that passed with me using pornography got darker and likely made me a more anxious and insecure person. Judging how I was before such heavy use and then later on in my porn addiction career with the current knowledge I hold now I can definetly see the difference. eventually at 14 i lost my virginity and became even more deeply obssesed with Sex, all I would want to do is have it and when I wasnt I'd be using pornography. things took a really dark turn 2 years later, I began to experience PIED. I began to feel all the negative effects of this addiction, I would surf omegle for hours looking for someone to exchange sexual things with. I became a completely twisted individule. I would watch so much pornography to the point Id have a beautiful girl in my bed and i couldnt acheive an erection for the life of me. this made me question and hate myself alot. Long story shorter about late last year I found no fap and now I am on the path to recovery, I managed to reach 59 days and blindly relapsed, this was one of the toughest things in my recovery process due to the chaser effect and the difficulty of getting back on the horse, if you are deep into your recovery process DO NOT allow yourself to relapse it will make things 10 times harder. I am now nearing 40 days and I have full intentions of continuing. My feelings are becoming a lot stronger, two days ago I ran 8 Miles in one day, during this process I've biked up to 13 miles in one day.

44,vulnerability,NoFap,Joining today here is my story,1,egu3rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/egu3rz/joining_today_here_is_my_story/,2019-12-29 05:20:49,"Hello everyone. I wanted to share my story in hopes that it will strengthen my resolve. I am 26yo dude who has been unknowningly addicted to masturbation since I was 11. I never thought much about it. I learned to wank it and just thought it was a normal thing. Like most my first relationship ended poorly. I was 12 and thats when I got my first bj. I really liked the girl and she cheated on me with a close friend. Ever since then I have kept a protective distance in my relationships, Like many I thought, why bother with all the pain and heart ache when I can just jerk off. I still had sex with girls but never felt close or emotionally connected out of fear of vulnerability. I was also often concerned about performance and how good I was, did they cum? Fast forward to 6 months ago. I was dating a girl who had been raped at a young age. Sex had been a taboo thing for her and she never really got over it. It wasnt until then that I realized how I was viewing women. She sensed that I objectified her and just wanted to fuck her brains out and due to her emotional trauma she felt really uncomfortable. I wanted to have sex with her the first time we hung out. We slept in the same bed and she fell asleep on my chest. I was stunned, how could anyone do this and not want to bone. 2 months later I kinda made it clear I really wanted to have sex and she reluctantly agreed (not a good setup) She freaked out and got super tense and nervous and I couldnt get hard. I regret pushing her to have sex but I also regret staying with her for so long and just accepting her sexual issues. She made it feel like it was all my fault. She made me feel like a sexual predator for wanting to have sex with my girlfriend. It was fucked up and took me a long time realize this. Next my yoga teacher wants to hang out while I am dating this girl. So I break up with her deciding I cant deal with it anymore. All along while I couldnt have sex with my ex I was masturbating, regularly. So finally I meet a beautiful girl that wants to have sex. I am shakin up from dating a girl who wants nothing to do with sex and I am just lost an utterly confused. Sure enough, my new girl friend wants to have sex and I feel nothing. I can barely get hard enough to penetrate her and I feel awful. Like wtf, am I cursed. I am so confused as to why this is happening and after trying again I decide I need to figure out my shit before I fuck with someone elses head. All these experiences made me realize masturbation has been the cause of my loss of interest. For a long time I had wet dreams, almost lucid where if there was any remotely attractive girl in my dream I could have sex with her and wake up and need to clean myself off. This on top of watching porn and jerking off made me a complete weirdo. I was seeing women as these objects to fuck and never cared for anything else. I eventually made a compromise I will jerk off in my bed and not watch porn. A lot of the times waking up in the morning and wanking it before starting my day. Now realize there is no difference as I just thought about the same porn I jerked off to. So I am 26 and attractive I can get a lot of girls but I dont trust myself. I have little desire to flirt and dont know if I can get hard in the bedroom anymore. I have so much shame around this I just want to move forward. It took me a long time to even consider masturbation was a probable cause. I have been trying not to jerk off and know I should not; however I did this morning which led me to finding this reddit page. You all are inspiring and I wanted to say thanks for sharing and your encouragement and struggles. I am joining the no fap community as of today. So thats why I wanted to do my part share my story to encourage others to not make the same mistakes I did. I see all the posts from younger dudes on here and I gotta say I wish I had the courage you guys do when I was your age. Cheers and thank you"

I really wanted to get hard, because she was clearly into my touching and I had enjoyed seeing her earlier before we undressed, but I just couldn't. I felt so dead inside. We talked and shared emotional intimacy, which I think was positive. I know I love her and I want to make her happy and enjoy her body as I used to, but with more emotional investment that I had previously allowed myself to make. I feel that my sense of vulnerability is bringing me closer to her emotionally, which I think will have positive effects whenever I get my libido back. I trust her; she has always been faithful and she clearly shows she loves me and would never want to be without me, even as my penis is a bit of a flake right now. Please help me, my friends!

A constant tug of war between my current self and my old self. Every day that passes, I feel the tether weakening, but I've come to realize that I must remain self-aware. Once I let my mind slip or get comfortable, the tether will just pull me back to my old self and I'll have to start all over again. The road is long, but each battle won is a star you can put on your sleeve and feel proud of. Each battle won means one step closer to freedom from your old self. I always tell myself to take it day by day, trust the process, and try to learn more about myself. Real growth comes increased self-awareness which will lead to a positive snowball affect on my life. I kinda think of NoFap like a phoenix because we break ourselves down, learn more about ourselves over time through vulnerability, address the vulnerabilities through persistent effort, then come out a better version of ourselves in the end (rise out of the ashes). No real point to this post outside of just speaking my mind. Overcame a huge urge today so I'm proud of myself. One day a time."
48,vulnerability,NoFap,I'm Afraid of Love,1,dfpga2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/dfpga2/im_afraid_of_love/,2019-10-10 10:36:14,"I went out to celebrate my friend coming back or something. Whole night goes good at the club. Pregamed but didn't drink once I got there. While I was leaving some girls were talking about ""I don't think you understand the drinking rules in this state"" I said ""Zero Tolerance"" while looking at one girl. She smiled and went on to talk to her friends near their car and I talked to mine over elsewhere. Our friends were leaving with other girls and didn't want to take a uber with us so we were stranded. The girl walked past us and I asked her can she drive she said yes come on. Her GF left her. We walked to her house which was like a mile away and I sat in the backseat because an acquaintance called shotgun. I made sure they got dropped off first and took the front seat. We talked the whole 40 mins back about I don't even know what there were a lot of topics. We get to the military base and she has a military card because of her parents. We park the car and I'm saying you should probably take a nap here your sleep deprived. Couple minutes of me playing the sleep here I'm worried about your safety jokingly go by and she leans in really close and I basically have to kiss her. This make out session was really intense for 2 people that just met. After I continued trying to convince her to nap but I guess she really did have work in like a hour and a half. So I take my ass up stairs and fall asleep. I wake up and im on cloud 9 like what just happened. I haven't kissed a girl in 3 years. Im nervous to snap her i was drunk and socially lubricated that night now. I snap her if she wants to come over today. She said I would if I could but it's family day at the pumpkin patch. I told her I'll take her on a date instead another day. She said haha ok. She wasn't really responding. I know texting can kill a vibe so I was just trying to see her. The next day I text her how her days going. She said she just got off. I texted her like 30 mins later ""Do you want to come over today"". Went unread for like 5 hrs and otw back from the gym I just kindve kept driving past my dorm and blared music to possibly get me out of my head. Nothing was working so I just deleted her snap. Have no way to get back in touch with her Trying to understand what made me do it. Part of it was feeling she was out of my league. I was scared of a upcoming date because how would I top the first day we met you know. I just wanted to have sex with her so I could be calm and have some power over her but every second of vulnerability drove me insane. I was finding myself latching on to her and I could feel infatuation taking me over. I couldn't hit the gym hard I was infatuated and becoming soft. She was all I thought about and I just wasn't comfortable having love take me over. She is really pretty and has a deep country accent like me. I only knew her for a hour and a half and it was one of the greatest nights of my life. Yet it felt like I was having my soul slowly stripped away from me by a stranger I barely knew and it scared me. I'm also insecure in that she could be a immune to emotion slut because she's a waitress and her snap story had cleavage which is how all the girls look at that bar. That paired with a unread message, insecurities, and being engulfed and drowned in a mixture of love and infatuation made me mentally paralyzed and was just terrifying. I did not want to give her power over me. I have goals and the only way I found it possible to focus is if I just let her go. I've only texted her a day and a half after the first night. What I've learned: Free your mind don't expect outcome. Don't be distracted by what is happening externally look internally. Keep your mind in the right place. Put yourself in a position to be her man. Girls want to be loved deep down not treated as sexual animals. And don't delete the girls number you just made out with to break free of ""infatuation"" it's prime time to overcome insecurities and grow  Now roast my ass"

In Mark Manson's highly recommended book [Models](URL he brings up the idea of a masturbation and porn diet to increase sexual and non-sexual motivation. The diet consists of ending consumption of pornography and *limiting masturbation to once a week* (or every two weeks, etc.) The idea of abstaining from pornography isn't foreign to this subreddit, but I wonder how many people have had used a limited masturbation schedule like this. I used this diet for a little while after ending abstinence and I would like to give it another go. I find myself spending too much time and energy masturbating even without pornography. It feels like a drain of energy and makes me less socially in tune. With this diet I hope to experience an increase in energy levels, an easier time falling asleep and waking up, and more motivation to express vulnerability with women. This post is a public statement of commitment to my diet of once-weekly masturbation. My first post definitely helped in my most successful reboot, and I would recommend it to anyone struggling with sticking to a goal in the beginning. If there is interest in this concept I may post some updates as the weeks go by. Have you tried a similar diet? What was your experience like?"

Many of your stories inspire me to keep fighting this addiction. Anyway I been fighting my porn addiction for the past three years and while I am frustrated I relapsed tonight I am proud of myself as 29 days has been the longest streak I ever made on my nofap journey! This is encouraging that though it has been slow I am making progress. Plus unlike my other relapses I actually made a discovery of why despite my best efforts I keep coming back to porn. Yes there is just its innate addictive property because it is designed to be alluring and an easy dopamine kick but I thought there is more to it. I realize it is my fear of intimacy and vulnerability. Sex is amazing yes but it's also just very daunting and if you have felt a lot of shame about your body growing up it can be one of the most vulnerable things you ever do. And if you had a really bad sex experience like I did and it makes so much sense for why porn is so very inviting despite knowing logically how very bad it is for you and will also make you feel shame about your body It's bad but at least you can keep your armor on and can do it privately. This may seem very obvious to some but knowing this gives me something to strive for. To one day be okay with that vulnerability and intimacy because one day I will find someone who will love me and my body for what it is. Even if that someone is just me in the future who finally conquered his porn addiction and embraces a type of vulnerability I never thought I achieved. Hope this resonates with someone and thank you again for anyone who takes the time to read this.

54,vulnerability,NoFap,Nofap and sexual shame,2,d8ual0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/d8ual0/nofap_and_sexual_shame/,2019-09-25 08:09:29,"Im piecing together how nofap makes it easier to talk to girls. Lots of men have internalized shame about their sexuality. Society tells us it can be creepy and often unwelcome to hit on girls or express sexual interest in them. I used to feel like there was almost no time when a girl wouldnt cringe at the fact that someone would be interested in her. I was a nice guy, and would never do anything that might make a woman uncomfortable. And I think pmo becomes an addiction when it is done out of sexual shame, done in secret, the only way to scavenge some dark crumbs of what you so desire. The act becomes a source of shame, and your entire concept of sex can become taboo, something to be hidden and seldom talked about. So instead of seeking real sex, which requires vulnerability, commitment, and facing social anxiety, I would pmo. I used pmo as a cover up for uncomfortable emotions for a long time without realizing it. Much of the uncomfortable emotions came from that sexual shame. I had a desire for sex, and every time it came up I had to push it down, lest I realize how lacking I was. How i was sabotaging any attempt at getting it. Not to mention the deep, heart-wrenching sense of loneliness at my core. Just as I pushed down my own emotions, I could not bear to allow anyone else to have uncomfortable emotions about me. I felt an urge to agree with everyone, to please, and certainly never do anything that would possibly discomfort a (holy but terrifying) woman. So nofap removes that shame and allows your natural sexuality to blossom. It also forces you to cope with uncomfortable emotions, which in turn allows you to cope with rejection other people having uncomfortable emotions about you. Therefore, as you nofap, dont forget to focus also on the positive expression of sexuality. And removing the shame. Talk with male friends about your porn use. Go to a SLAA. (Sex and love addicts anonymous) group. Open yourself to the fact that your sexual desire is normal and natural and you are not alone in your struggle. It is totally normal for you to want to talk to girls. And they often want that from you! Start small, just a hello once a day. Hell, just start with talking to ANY stranger once a day."

For many days Ive been on and off about nofap But I knew, this cant be the real deal. For a man like me, for a person with my inner life and character. I made sure that I nurtured my spirit with ambitious thoughts and words by people like David Goggins, David Deida, Tony Robins, Jocko Willink among many many others. It started with MMA in May. I learned my ego and my pain threshold. I was afraid to get punched in the face. Recently I added a 15km run, at least once weekly. My face is a punching ball now if you land a punch, but Im good on the rebounds. Then I increased my music endeavors. Past connections got me into a position of playing multiple shows in the last few months and the next few months. Then I finally, after many setbacks achieved 14 days. It was hard but at a point I was so busy with life I just forgot to fap. Then I got into dating and women more. Bumble is a great app for starters, Tinder is mostly hiding the good leads from you so that you pay gold. But Its going proper now. Nice weekends. I mean, when you get though all that shit. Depressions. Codependency, anxiety, ED and all that crap. Its not worth it. I mean, when you start to experience the amount of pleasure and bliss that you create with another person when having sex is in no fucking way comparable to pornography. It doesnt matter if she is average or pretty or she is a fashion model superstar. I will not trade that moment of real world intimacy, vulnerability and ecstasy for a fucking jerk off. Neither should you."

and now the floor is open to anyone who wants to say anything, keeping vulnerability and honesty in mind feel free to raise your hand and we can also switch to passing an object if need be because i talk a lot and have plenty of stories about during my time as a porn addict having experienced drugs now like weed and alchol, but definitely a thing i have a story about as a society we have to admit our biggest vulnerabilities and many generations since the event of high speed internet (pending research on still images idk??) men we as a country are producing more and more feminized men. our sperm is getting weaker. as an entire nation. and i think that might explain the current trans rights explosion, no judgement im the gen that just is attracted to certain aspects of those issues, but point is we have to admit our invulnerabilities as a individuals and as a nation in horder to honestly address the system men are so depreived of sex as a result of this porn addicted nation. its soured many minds to shame and to live from that shame as a nation, and its so apparent were phasing out women by turning to men as a species more and more often now. ya know its a common trigger to be up after a certain hour and or using phone late night, we need to be honest with ourselves, and call that what is is. a trigger. now its up to us to recognize our triggers and muster every ounce of ourselves to decide against it, a trusted friend really helps (try to shake a few hands, and please we trust you to wash them) and close that window, exit that software, leave the computer, remember to turn on your alarm clock and do anything you can to cancel that paranoia of failure of willpower, you control if can win, because lets be honest,at some moment you cross the line and you decide ok well i put up a good enough fight, or just push it from your mind trying desperatly to enjoy the vids to suffocate the moral thoughts of my actions and images in my head to the point of recognizing that i have done something i believe to have a negative impact on my life but am suppressing it with watching porn. thinking about why this is wrong??(i try to watch the videos in a desperate panic almost like to run away from the fear of my own morals being fought by my behavior. trying to outrun my guilt &amp;#x200B; why is jerking off wrong? well honestly its not if its not a problem for you, however if thats the case you could very well be in the minority, men men feel as i do about it and thats why were here is to acknowledge in a trusted place and move on past it. and holy india is just now connecting to this tech, ive also been inclined to watch porn high and sometimes so much so that when i got high i jerked off just cause it was that laziest easiest switch to let flip in your brain. like a fight was had, but i t was just barely had. you only put up a fight as much you were REALLY gonna say oops, you beat me a gain darn guess i gotta jerk off now. i tried jerking off on molly, i tried sniffing bras which while smelled really nice to feel close to a boob, was nothing erotic even though i did try a few times sorry. please forgive me im weak and you were pretty and i know its wrong now. i also when i was kid jerked off to imagining a girl in my class. i didnt really know what i was doing but i was just a young dumb kid trying to do what everyone else may or may not be doing which was the only real draw at first when i was young, and then later on of course it became a habitual problem &amp;#x200B;

But youve been warned.) I figure modeled. And for me, it helped to alleviate the need for sexual expression in a safe, non-erotic, non-NoFap-streak-ending way. Figure modeling is NOT for everyone (and having your member shrivel in the middle of a flatline will make it even MORE intimidating) but for me, Ive had an easier time staying away from temptation ever since. Not so much easier really, as I havent even thought about the urge to relapse. Again, everyone will be different. I fell into porn by trying so hard to be abstinent that what I really became was fearful of vulnerability. (Im still a believer in waiting for marriage, but also that anything can be taken to a point of excess.) I personally needed a balance. I do not know if Ill draw someone else in the nude, for my recovering eyes sake, but I do feel more prepared even to do that without the curse of PMO addiction soiling the experience, and I certainly look forward to modeling again. The artists were all so mature (this was not a college course, most everyone was mid twenties to 60). Years ago, when I was in college, even then porn had a grip on me, even if it hadnt peaked yet. But I remember having the potential to admire nudity in art. It can be sensual without being erotic. Even classic Greek and Renaissance works capture this. And I remember too the capability to separate sensuality and eroticism/pornographic experience. This modeling job was an unexpected re-experience and re-learning of how to separate those things from each other, and it did me a lot of good. This was one of my more different encounters through my NoFap journey, one that Im on for life. Just thought Id share."
58,vulnerability,NoFap,"Today I realized that I have a masturbation problem, and I need to cut it out of my life",2,coa8x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/coa8x9/today_i_realized_that_i_have_a_masturbation/,2019-08-10 09:23:21,"After college, I found myself very lonely in a hometown where my friends moved away and I was working a dead end job. I wasn't meeting women (I've been on one date in over a year since I finished college), and was masturbating a lot. I've masturbated a lot ever since I got into college. However, I'd usually masturbate to fantasies of girls I liked in my head. Nothing extreme, just regular sex or hooking up is what I thought of, but I did it a lot. There were days where I'd crank it multiple times a day, with no breaks in between. I was very shy, had low self confidence, and was sexually inexperienced when I went to college, so I was nervous about actually meeting women. I ended up hooking up with girls at school, like most boys in college do, but I was masturbating far more than I was dating or hooking up. It felt safer that way, less risk for vulnerability, less risk for heartbreak and/or disappointment. But way less satisfaction, which is why it took me doing it so much to make me feel calm. I have a very high sex drive and I'm probably a person who would benefit a lot from having regular sexual partners and dates, maybe even a committed relationship. But my piss poor self-esteem, questionable choice in women (I have a knack for going for girls who seem easy to approach, but are real toxic once you get to know them), and fear of vulnerability and rejection have made it very hard for me to connect with women. There was one time I had hooked up with a girl, the chemistry was incredible. We knew each other's bodies and what we wanted so well without even knowing each other beforehand. Never had a hook up like that in my entire life. We kept talking afterwards, and it was totally fluid and natural. But I got so nervous about getting close to her due to past experiences and my lack of self confidence that I let it fizzle out. She's a bit of a drama queen I've learned, so in this instance I don't think I missed much, but that attitude and mindset is a shitty one to have, and I know I'll eventually let someone good go if I don't address that way of thinking. But rather than address that way of thinking, I covered up my sexual desires and feelings by numbing them to hell and back by masturbating. In college, and prior to college, my masturbating habits predominately, glaringly, skewed towards healthy mental fantasies of people I knew. I'd be masturbating a shit ton, but at least the fantasies were grounded in reality, with realistic depictions of women, and realistic sex practices and courtship scenarios. After college, with a huge decrease in women around me, my sex life, and human interaction in general, I eventually slid into watching porn. I had only experimented with it fleetingly a handful of times when I was a kid, and could barely get off to it. But as I burned through my mental fantasies sexually, and as my real life got duller, I eventually sought porn for more powerful orgasms. It worked, but I felt like dogshit doing it. It felt so empty and numb to watch porn, but it got me off, and it was the most exciting shit I'd do all week. The porn binging hasn't last for long, but I also went in watching fetish-y stuff that made me feel like shit. Not because of what I was seeing, but how the women were being portrayed. They were basically just avatars for men's satisfaction. They barely looked like they enjoyed what was happening, they just did it. It felt awful to look at, but I was so horny and so lonely that I didn't give a fuck. But then, the fetish-y but heteronormative stuff got a bit burnt out in my mind, so I experimented with transgender pornography. It got me off to see a woman sexually dominate a man. No matter how much I tried to rationalize in my head that their bodies were surgically made and they were born men and are biologically male, I just didn't give a fuck. Their penises didn't really turn me on, but the sexual power it provided them over men was incredible to see. It was better than watching pegging too because there was mutual stimulation, it wasn't just a one way street for a woman to get a man off without them enjoying it too. Initially I felt so weird and confused by this, but I just don't care. I still think I'm straight, or maybe I'm some kind of like pan-ish kind of deal. That's not what bothers me, and I'm fine with saying I'm attracted to transgender women, when they look like women. But I didn't like how these videos, to which I admittedly watched very few of and actually masturbated to only one of, but did so twice, portrayed transgender women. It was so fetish-y and creepy, I felt so goddamn low watching it. Not because they're trans, but because the whole video revolves around them being trans. I wouldn't care if I was having sex with a trans woman, but why does it have to be the focus? Why is it such a selling point? To me, a convincing trans woman is just a woman. I'm a man, I'm sure as hell not taking t-blockers and augmenting my body to embody a woman. I don't want to, and men don't want to. But why can't these porn videos just recognize that, instead of making these women out to be some kind of zoo animal? Even the titles were just disgusting. I suppose it's the same reason so many porn films come off as abusive towards women, to feed male ego and raw carnal desire for sexual dominance in men. Or to tap into taboo ideas for men who maybe need an escape from the confines of masculinity that surround their sexuality, like who is acceptable to date and what is acceptable for men to do in bed. But by giving dishonest, unrealistic, and more than often toxic portrayals of these sexual encounters, it completely numbs you the fuck out from sexual stimulation. THAT's what sucks, and I realized pornography and masturbation had sucked me down a rabbit hole of increased sexual fetishism and toxicity that would not only continue to numb my sex drive, but would inevitably get more perverse over time, and would detach me from real life sexual pursuit and contact. I'd live in my fucked up mental fantasy land of sex encounters, avoiding real women at all costs. That's not good. That is why I came here to post this. Sorry for being so overlong, but man, masturbating has almost ruined my life. I'm still a young man, and I want to quit doing this for good, and when I'm horny, actually have healthy sex, and with a woman I care about. I'm very good at staving off addiction, but I just never considered pornography an addiction until I've really sat and looked at how much goddamn masturbating I've been doing, and how off the wall the porn choices have been. Some of the shit I watch isn't even something that, from experience, I enjoy in real life. Like I'll try it, and I hate it. But in fucked up porn land, I like it for some reason. Pornography has made me so jaded and uncaring about sex, and has enabled me to hide from connecting with women. It may have taught me that I don't think I care if a woman is trans or not, though I would prefer a woman who is post-op in this instance, but even then, I'd rather meet a trans woman who is a normal human being that I actually connect with, as opposed to watching porno that makes them look like science experiments. I also wouldn't go out of my way to explicitly meet a trans woman, but if I did, I wouldn't dump them because of them beings trans. With that said, I start school up in the fall. After a completely aimless year of post-grad life that has led me to being incredibly isolated and lonely (I literally have no friends who live locally and can count the amount of times I've gone out since I graduated college), I committed to going to get a professional certificate in a postgraduate program to get me into a more lucrative line of work. I want to spend the next two months detoxing from pornography, and kicking it for good. Like I said, I'm very good at dropping things that I feel are taking over myself. I cold turkeyed cigarettes in high school, I flushed marijuana before when it became to prevalent in my life, I throw junk food out from holidays if I feel like I'm indulging too much, and I've been pretty much sober aside from holidays since I left college too so I could work on my mental health and overall wellbeing. I know I can do it, but it will be hard. After two months though, and I hopefully build some sexual sensitivity up and I get my mind off of fetish-y porn, I want to start dating and hooking up again. I don't mind on finding someone within these next two months, but I don't think I'd actively be looking for a partner until two months are up. Before then, it'd be up to chance. I'm in my 20s, and I want to use the rest of them (I'm still in my early 20s, so there's plenty of time), cultivating real relationships with women and exploring my sexuality with an actual fucking human instead of my right hand and my laptop. I'm sick of numbing myself out, which is a constant uphill battle that only sucks you deeper into a rabbit hole of perversion. Cis or trans (though she'd have to be post-op), any kind of race, height to an extent (below 5'0"" is too short for me, and above about 6'3"" is too tall. I'm a tall man so 6+ isn't a problem), really even weight to an extent (anorexic or obese builds are turnoffs, but everything in between is fine by me), I don't really care. I just want to meet real people, and connect with them as a real human being, no matter how scary that may feel. Thank you all for checking this post out. Spent like a half hour writing it. Hope it may encourage some other people to finally own up to and embrace who they are, and recognize their problematic masturbating habits."
59,vulnerability,NoFap,"Two days into NoFap. Today I woke up at 4AM with intense cravings. Instead of caving in, I did my laundry and went to the gym, and it felt so good I almost cried",6,cp35a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/cp35a2/two_days_into_nofap_today_i_woke_up_at_4am_with/,2019-08-12 08:05:47,"I woke up at around 4-4:30AM today feeling insane cravings to masturbate. You guys know the feeling. It's not horniness, it's that achy need to numb yourself. It was crawling through my damn body, and I was even humping my mattress a little from it. I was reading stuff that was almost like erotica, and was about to cave in and masturbate. I felt so anxious and sad. But instead of thinking I wanted to do this and feel good, I thought about why I wanted to masturbate. This wasn't due to horniness, it was due to sadness, hopelessness, and loneliness. I hate my job, I wish I was making more money, I wish my work environment wasn't so toxic, I'm scared of the vulnerability of human interaction, and I'm bad at being lonely for too long because I get nervous. Instead of covering that up with masturbating, I went downstairs and just breathed, sat with those feelings, and thought of ways I could relieve the physical stress and tension I was feeling. It was my gym day (I work out 6 days a week, have done so since middle school), so instead of going to the gym after work, I went to it before work. I ate a good breakfast, I did a load of laundry, and I packed up my work clothes and got dressed for the gym and headed out. Working out today felt amazing. I felt so goddamn alive doing it. I didn't even realize until I did it how incredible working out feels. The last time I felt that exhilarated through working out was my freshman year of college. When I felt like I couldn't finish a set, and pardon if this sounds graphic and/or cheesy, but I'd channel that...orgasmic, since I hesitate to call the depraved masturbating I've been doing sexual as sexual stimulation is good when done safely, energy into lifting. Like I felt my skin tighten and my muscles ache and my heart race and lungs tighten the way they do when I'm about to orgasm. It was to a lesser degree obviously, I didn't come in the gym lmfao, but I felt a kind of physical euphoria that I hadn't felt in years today. It was amazing. And the music I was listening to felt so colorful and vibrant. I felt like, joy, for the first time in what must be years. It's only been two days and that's already something I noticed. My mood is better, I enjoy things more, and I just feel more alive. Like the lack of numbness is really overwhelming right now, and that's why I almost cried today, I was so overwhelmed by senses and emotions all day, and I realized how much I missed them. But it feels incredible to get these senses back. I've also even noticed my libido beginning to improve. Like, I notice women more, and I'm starting to very slowly begin to unplug from the deluded expectations and numbness I've built up through masturbation. I sometimes have to calm myself down because I start to get noticeably hard when I see someone I think is attractive, which hasn't happened to me in fucking years. I feel like a kid again. I understand that this fluctuates It hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows though, obviously. The come down was real, and denying myself from masturbating for two days has made me really depressed, anxious, and sad. It's sad to look at how much damage this shit did to me, all the potential partners I robbed myself of because of how numb I was from masturbating, all the joy I sabotaged from it. And all the while, I thought it was helping me. But whatever the case is, I'm happy I'm making the change. It's hard, and I'm really low right now, but feeling alive again for the first time, no matter how shocking or overwhelming it may be, is so goddamn worth it. I will absolutely never turn back to what I was doing and who I was when I was watching porn. I'll cry, scream, run my ass off, have a breakdown, puke, I don't give a fuck. I never ever ever ever ever want to feel like this again. Withdrawals are a bitch and feeling perpetually numb is even worse, and I'm genuinely willing to do whatever it takes to move on from this. I've gotten over other vices, including a few that could've led to hardcore addiction, and I know that I can do this. I won't do it alone, and it will be hard, but I have to be strong because going back would be horrendous."

I does help more than anything else witnessing everyone making progress. I feel like I am a part of something bigger than just confronting my psychological problems that costed me this toxic habit. Social norms deeply ingrained in upbringing methods betray innocent people in many ways from very early on in life that most of them spend their lives without once noticing the damage done.

61,vulnerability,NoFap,485 days later,4,cuqazl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/cuqazl/485_days_later/,2019-08-24 17:11:44,"Throwaway account so obviously my counter isn't showing, but this is something I've been wanting to put on paper for a while. Fair warning, I apologize for the small book below. I know there are many posts on here talking about success stories/tips and tricks/experiences that are probably much better written than this, but this community definitely made a difference for me so this seems worth sharing even if it's just rambling. Like the title says, it's been 485 days. I never really intended to keep track of the number, but I put a note on my calendar the day that I truly started so that I wouldn't forget. Overall, the addiction started when I was 13. At the time it was curiosity and something even deemed normal by friends and family since I was a hormone filled (pre)teen. However, the problem arose as the sometimes unpleasant experiences of middle school began to decrease my self-confidence. Obviously, that's no excuse but I think that at the time it made PMO seem normal and safe. Because it started at this age, it just kind of always seemed normal as I got older. Fast forward many years and I was in college. I was dating a great girl and making friends, but as things started to settle down after the initial transition to life at school I started to realize that I still had this quiet habit of PMO lurking in the background. Since I was dating someone I was able to stop for a while, but eventually I got bored and fell back into the habit. At this point though, I started to really feel the guilt about it for the first time. I definitely couldn't bring myself to tell my girlfriend, but that just made me feel worse and worse about it since I was hiding it. Eventually it came out and I was sure that she would break up with me, but unfortunately she chose to help support the habit to keep us together. The key here is that it wasn't her fault, it was solely a choice she made to try to save the relationship from a problem that I wasn't addressing. Eventually the relationship ended due to many other reasons, but this definitely triggered me to fall more and more into the PMO trap. About a year passed and at this point I was masturbating almost everyday. I knew it was a problem, so I would make these deals with myself that I could do it for longer tomorrow if I didn't do it today. While I could sometimes wait a day or two, I very rarely had control and almost always caved to what I thought were natural needs. It was only when I set a goal of not doing it for a week (and failed on day 1, 2 , and 3) that I realized there was a bigger issue. I don't remember how exactly it happened, but I stumbled on NoFap and read for 2 hours, realizing more and more that this was actually an addiction, but that I wasn't alone. For a couple days, the experiences that I read on here bounced around in my head until I realized how much the lack of control scared me in a deep place. I finally decided to be done. I didn't want to sort of be done though, I wanted to go all the way if I was going to do it. It was at this point that I made the note on my calendar (as mentioned above) and went to bed. The first few days were fine, but the end of the first week was brutal. I had trouble sleeping, and I would be sitting in my room feeling like I was losing it (I know this sounds way over dramatic, but fighting your mind is a pretty wild thing). At this point I started running. I was already in decent shape and running before starting NoFap so this wasn't some miraculous fitness overhaul, I was just running to find peace in my head. I also found that by doing things that scared me and caused adrenaline rushes (like adventure sports or public speaking), my mind was more stimulated and ultimately no longer needing an artificial source of stimulation. Meditation also played a big part in this as it teaches you to be alone with your mind and better understand it. Over time, by doing things that kept me mentally and physically engaged, the voice that used to control my head became quieter and quieter. That's not to say that it wasn't still there, I just knew how to handle it and shift my focus to real life and what actually mattered. I know that there are these ideas of getting special powers when you're doing NoFap and maybe that's true for some, but it was much more simple for me. By no longer dealing with this secret that I used to hold, I was just more confident. More confident in talking to people, in learning new things, and being willing to try new things. It wasn't some crazy transformation, it was just that things started to feel right and seem a bit more clear which at the end of the day is all you can ask for. There will always be rough days in life, but clarity and mental calm make those situations so much easier to handle. That's a lot of back story, but the bottom line is that it's possible. The bigger point to this bottom line is that it's possible for each person in different ways. You don't have to become a bodybuilder to do NoFap. You don't have to go on a million dates after you do NoFap. You don't have to become religious to do NoFap. You don't even have to call it NoFap. You just have to find the things and the people that make you feel alive and choose to pursue those on a daily basis. Coming here to read about other people's journeys is inspiring and can help tremendously when you're alone and not sure where to turn. However, having someone in real life who knows what you're dealing with makes such a difference. It's different for everyone, but personally it was critical to say it out loud to someone close to me. It's a pretty deep level of vulnerability and it's not easy to do, but having that accountability makes the process so real. All of this is to say that it's possible and it's worth it. You're probably not going to find superpowers, but what you will find is a passion for the things in your life that truly matter and the ability to build relationships that will last. I'm no expert at life, but at the end of the day I think that those two things are what it's all about. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR 1. Find the people and things that make you feel alive 2. Be honest with someone in your life about your struggle, it'll make it easier and more real 3. Use the resources on this subreddit, but know that every path is different 4. People are generally a lot stronger mentally than they give themselves credit for, use that"
62,vulnerability,NoFap,"DAY 28 : Wet dream, spontaneous emission, feeling good, motivated, aroused, standing on the edge of chaos.",4,cy8bcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/cy8bcl/day_28_wet_dream_spontaneous_emission_feeling/,2019-09-01 20:20:14,"&gt;\# I took some notes from the basics of rebooting, which I will mention along. &gt; &gt;\#""Subtler signs of a reboot are if you feel you have a clearer head and have stopped fantasizing about pornographic sexual situations. Perhaps you find real sexual relationships fulfilling for the first time in your life."" I wanted to go celibate for atleast a year and I wanted to experience the superpowers because I've seen people, who have acheieved it. There is a certain glow to their eyes, their faces and other overall personality. You just can't resist being attracted to those people. They exude the vibe of ""having life figured out"". And I'm eager to experience what they experience. So I thought that a 28 days reboot would be enough for me. And I started out well. I thought I've finally achieved control over my mind as I wasn't fantasizing stuff anymore, when actually I was just flat lining. So as it turns out, 28 days is not enough. Because I'm still fantasizing sexual and other self-pleasing scenarios. I kind of feel narcissistic. And I've learned from experience that this narcissistic feeling is what leads one to over confidence which further leads to a hard relapse, which then leads to low self-esteem and so on. &gt;\#""If you find yourself fantasizing about pornographic situations youve seen or having porn flashbacks, you need more reboot time"" &gt; &gt;\#""if youve achieved the goals you set out with, consider yourself rebooted!"" &amp;#x200B; Actually, I don't even remember getting a wet dream last night ( I remember swimming in a holy river, and having my stuff robbed or something) . But I ejaculated all the same. And now I'm going through the chaser effect. &gt;\#""The Chaser Effect is a period of significantly increased urges to look at porn that can follow an orgasm during a reboot."" But I want to discipline my thinking. I want to get rid of my habit to indulge in self-pleasing fantasies altogether and replace them with fantasies of monk mode discipline, self control, clarity of thought, action , focus, courage hard work. This new habit needs to penetrate my subconscious mind. &gt;\#""...Monk Mode rebooters might abstain from losing themselves in sexual fantasy by instituting a five second rule for entertaining any sexual thoughts."" &gt; &gt;\#""....Youll develop vulnerability and compassion when youve faced the pain of having to reset. By opening up and sharing your flaws with others, you learn that its okay to be vulnerable...."" &gt; &gt;\#""....Monitor your thoughts during rebooting."" &gt; &gt;\#""....Resetting is an opportunity for a rebooter to find their weak spots by examining what behaviors immediately led to the reset."" So I'm going to reset my count. Even though wet dreams, doesn't count as relapse for most people. &gt;\#""If all else fails, a rule of thumb here is that if you remain unsure whether to reset or not, you should probably just go ahead and reset."" Actually I'm having trouble focussing on my studies given the psychological effects of withdrawing from my bad habits of PMOing as an answer to all my problems. The harder I try to focus, the harder I'm hit by the momentary spikes of urges. Goes to show how inefficient I am as a human being in something as simple as controlling my own mind. I wasn't expecting this to be that challenging. But with patience and acceptance I'm hoping to get better with time. Any input/feeback/comment would be much appreciated."

Ive been doing this circle for the last nine months and I truly want to achieve the goal that I have set in place. No-fap lifestyle. I have been exposed to adult content since a young age, fluctuating the amount I used as I go through my teenage years, 20s and various relationships. Now it has come to a point that its only function is hurting myself and placing constraints from me living to the better part of me. Ive observed my mental well-being deteriorate quickly with paranoia, anger and anxiety. Traits that are associated with addiction. Ive been wanting to talk about this with my friends, my sister, even my partner but.. that level of vulnerability can be quite damaging in relationships if they cant empathize. So Ive turned to reddit. Sharing my journey one post at a time. Hoping that I can last 30 days without distractions."

I'm close to finishing up 30 days, and was planning to immediately celebrate by getting a prostitute, after reading up on NOFAP opinion of this, many people compared it to porn. I've waisted over $10,000 on prostitutes in the past, although it has tapered off a lot in the last two years (e.g. I haven't been with one in maybe 6 months now, or had sex at all either, just porn and masturbation), so yes prostitutes definitely became an addiction for me. Here is my problem, I don't want to go back to dating, and relationships, I've been burned bad in the past, and in the age of #Metoo and all that other crap, I don't want to suffer anymore going out their and chatting up women, it feels degrading to me. I'm worried, because if I can't see a prostitute, then my only other options are either lifetime celibacy or a return back to porn and masturbation. I don't know how to deal with this situation. I've promised myself I will never let a woman hurt me again. I can already see the comments that allowing yourself to be hurt is a choice, but relationships require vulnerability. Also the time and money invested in them upsets me. I'm mostly a loner these days, I work on myself and building wealth, I also work very very hard on my body these days. NoFap is making such a difference in my life, I don't ever want to go back to Porn and Masturbation, but at the same time I don't ever want to go back to the pain of committed relationships, and just the general courting process. I've done over 100 approaches in my day, maybe hundreds at this point when I was younger. I've done all of that crap, bars, coffee shops, co-workers, chatting women up, reading books on communication, working with dating coaches, none of that ever really worked for me and only made me more and more unhappy, I also took the path for many years of just stop looking, and focus on self development, so I did just that, and 7 years easily slipped by (no dating, no hookups) and I regressed to porn and masturbation, and around 2 years ago began seeing hookers. So yeah I'm not a weak man, I stand up for myself, I work hard on myself and my business, and I communicate pretty effectively. I've recently lost my closest friend as she did not like me wanting to return to seeing prostitutes after NoFap, and my refusal to get into a relationship. The loss of this friendship has really hurt badly as well, but I've just pushed on. What are your thoughts. I don't want to get back into a committed relationship, outside of #MeToo crap, their is also the risk of divorce, child support, and emotional abuse by the woman. Also you can never truly know a person, and people change, so acting like you can find the perfect woman who will never screw you over, is ridiculous in my opinion. Anyway please let me know your thoughts on how I should proceed after by reboot ends. Should I just return to prostitutes after I complete my reboot? I don't think I can be celibate for life. I think I could go for years possibly but eventually i'd crack. I'm in my mid 30's. Also this not a troll or anything like that, I'm 100% real and just not sure what to do. Any feedback is appreciated. Please just keep it respectful and constructive."
67,vulnerability,NoFap,Sexual influence has officially ruined my life,1,ccaogt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ccaogt/sexual_influence_has_officially_ruined_my_life/,2019-07-12 23:12:56,"So, time has passed and on the search about how to get my life back on track I've finally landed on the right place (or so I think) to discuss all that's been going on. Warning - since it's my life in the last years, I intend to tell everything in utter honesty, so that's going to be a long one. &amp;#x200B; It all started over two and a half years ago, but now I feel I've been making myself more than prone to such a life crysis for my whole life beforehand. And as you might have guessed, it's all about sex... or at least it turned out so. &amp;#x200B; I'm 18 now and have been alwasy a genuinely happy and excited person about life and all of its beauty. I had grades going more than perfect in school, was developing in every sphere in my life, had 9 years of sports career in badminton, was communicative and full of life in general. Had my plans, had my everything on track and couldn't cherish life more. All of that until a bit more than 2 years ago. Might sound too ostantetious, but at least that's how I feel about then as of right now through the perspective of memories and I want to optimally stress all the magnitude with which changes have been happening. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, it was all fine but I guess a dark vulnerability with unspoken potential to affect my life has been lurking all along that cheerful journey through life. And again you guessed it - that's porn and my happy little connection with it I felt so excited about at the time I discovered it around 11-12. It's been accompanying my life ever since then until recently. &amp;#x200B; I have always felt comfortable with my sexuality. I was an overall chilly guy with that sence of a male stability and having everything under control that every male seeks to experience. With all of that security in myself I didn't even need to demonstrate that much, I was that humble but achieving and ambitious guy that managed ot somehow stand out with everyting he got his hands on. And I was in love with who I was without getting too cocky or nothing. I was working on my image of a self fulfilled and optimal person. &amp;#x200B; All of that matched just perfectly with the first girl I seriously met in my life. I was almost 15 at the time we met, so simultaniously with starting high school we began everything basically as a child play. A classical story, I would say, we so to speak grew together. We had been through a lot and developed a real connection - with no doubt the most perfect thing I had achieved in my life, which was key to boosting my life experience and my self image to what I could now recognize a dangerous level of self esteem considering what's to come next and what I've been through. &amp;#x200B; I've been risen all my life with such values and after I had experienced that I can even now definitely say that this is the goal of my life (and it's not that uncommon). By far not my only focus in life, but for sure my expectation of a fulfilled live - love, family, children. That's what can boost my whole world with an unimaginable power and make me strave to the impossible. Or at least that's how it makes me feel. &amp;#x200B; But then, around the spring of 2017, the life I was building on and evidently expecting to have parted ways with reality. And as I can now for nearly the first time clearly observe, it all revolved around sexuality. It was just me never having been taught the affects it can have nor suspecting it can have such a major influence on my life. &amp;#x200B; We had troubles in our relationship at the time, we even broke up for awhile, but it was all okay in terms of general life experience - a normal human suffering that I knew would pass by. &amp;#x200B; All the horror began anyway when I firstly decided (and for sure knew and felt it) I wanted to have sex. We had had our attempts with my ex at the time and they were normally awkward and to some degree cringy given our early age so we never thought 'we were having sex'. But I knew every other aspect of intimacy as it was and that was making me feel great. But again, I had that tempting expectation to have my first sexual intercourse. So at the time we had just broken up, I felt such freedom and will to make the best of me and I thought that was a serious life experience and I embraced every aspect of that feeling. Never did I suspect that was my sexuality boosting me in such a way, but yeah, things matched and subconsiously I was driven by so much libido and my view of love and fulfillment I already knew I was having as a goal. &amp;#x200B; Needless to say, what happened with my ex and the things she then did were a major pain for my manhood and self esteem. It was, so to say, a painful area but one I had to make peace with. Then things went down naturally and I we got together again and there was a lot for me to experience this time in the negative spectre of life. I first had to learn to loose and forgive injustice, to control my urges and unconditionally devote myself to peace. I was growing, I just had to make peace with that pain and for some reason that's why I felt I had to do things til the end. It was going on well, although I was in something like an inner conflict but I felt peace with time and was growing. I felt great about it. But at that point all hell broke loose with that one single decision: I let my passion lead me to conscious sex with her. I was no doubt eager to get on it and announce myself sexually active. I was overwhelmed by that positivity and really it made everything look so light and happy. But that's when an unsuspected life change was about to happen for the worse. &amp;#x200B; In the climax of passion we started having sex. That was where I was about to imply all the gathere manhood and all of my very existence like led to it. I will never forget that excitement and all the great experiences associated with the anticipation. That's what I want to experience and to drive my life. &amp;#x200B; But what began to happen instead was a constant inability to have sex due to premature ejaculation. At the beginning I wasn't paying attention since I was fully aware of its normality. But on the inner side I felt something was generally not okay with the way it happened. I thought it would pass by and was initially chill and it didn't affect my libido nor my will to have sex. But then this kept happening for months. After the third month maybe I was already majorly affected with that state and the utter inability to last more than optimally one pump, sometimes even without that. &amp;#x200B; Knowing what passion we were capable of, she then began bringing up the topic and I really began feeling uncomfortable about it. Needless to say, given the rather delicate state of our relationship at the time, this was a major cause of insecurity and obsessive thoughts of her leaving me for goot as a beta. I began to lack security on a deeply disturbing level and even started having dreams of her mating with others, which I thought at the time was normal on the background of our state. We kept trying, but I began losing my drive, any will to have sex and generally all things were leading to the point when, this time really, all hell broke loose for literally a night. I started exeperiencing full block erectile disfunction and after a couple of times that happened that officially unleashed all the horror I've been through ever since. &amp;#x200B; I started discovering a whole new spectre of human existence I'm not very proud of. I started what I felt like rotting away in soul. All of my self esteem and the visions of me were irrationally making it worse and worse as I was putting such an enormous weight on myself about it. I started experiencing self pity, envy, jelaousy and self hatred. I had subconciously labeled myself as defective and uncapable. That's when I came to know all kinds of self destructive human behaviours - oversleeping, overeating, letting it out in all forms possible to regain some self worth, pleasure from life. Of course, I was also more intensively focusing on the constructive things in my life like education, work, love for the little things etc. but I then felt that nothing could fill the void that started to consume me. I had lost it and I could feel it even at the time then. One year later I finally broke up with that gf of mine in a very destroying way. But she was already grown so cold as nothing was going well. A must-mention here is that we were having sex but it was like the core of all troubles. That's where I felt the worst, but intially obliged to do it by myself and, like, everything I had know like a self image. After coming to terms with ED I got stuck in a vicious cycle that's my reality ever since. Sex was emotionally painful, a place to pityfully compete with myself and never succeed. I was and still am suffering a lack of natural erections and delayed ejaculation (DE). It's like nothing was left from my normal sexual function but was instead replaced by a numb panick-stricken reflex that was getting me hard but I could not feel anyting. My emotional state would go bonkers as well. I was frustrated, genuinely filled with hatred and that's where my reality skewed the most - sexually. &amp;#x200B; All sorts of things started to fall apart in my life in that one year. Then I gave up 'having' to do anything and let go of our relationship... if I could still call it a relationship. I began to struggle with everything ever since because for the strongest part of me the world had come to an end... in a way. Or at least that's how it felt and still does. I. COULDN'T. FUCK. I had to go through the nine circles of hell to come to the point where I can say I'm the most clear with myself. After the first year, I then literally began to exhaust every known source of happiness I had ever known. Isolating myself due to the constant feeling of a self pity and desperation had become my daily routine. No words could suffice for me to express all the changes in my view of the world, behaviour and everything but for the most part - the pain I carried within myself. Something more than neurosity, something more than simply depression, something horrible. The best I can describe it is the following: I felt like the alpha I had raised within myself wanted to kill me. Namely that alpha I coulnd never be again because of the active sexual blockage I was and to a degree still am experiencing today. &amp;#x200B; I came to the point of suicidal behaviour. Couldn't get up, couldn't walk, couldn't breathe, couldn't think straight, couldn't talk. Irreconcilability, frustration, anger, guilt, sadness, emptiness. A complete mess. Something was tearing my chest apart to the point of whole body pain. I won't even try to describe my emotional state and how I responded to the world around me... I've never planned or done any suicidal stuff, but apart from the active self destruction I was fully consciously aware that I can't live my life like that and could fully relate to every suffering human being ever to have decided to end their misery in the most definite self-sparing way. I'll never forget what my life looked like. That was the means of a strong spirit fighting against an anonymous terrorizing status-quo. Never finding peace. Then I had to learn that mental health is to never be neglected. Never had I ever imagined myself in such a state given the perspectful person I was building. I had to commit into finding out how to fix my life, but I was wrecking against a constant wall. A main needle in my heart was a very certain and strong part of my life - namely my love life. It felt as forever gone under the weight of some unknown unexplicable suffering. I knew for sure that feeling the way I was forced by myself to feel around women made it all to hell. It was my fix obsession and my view on girls in particular became so sickly skewed that I can't even describe it. &amp;#x200B; I went to a psychiatrist, was on medication for a few months, they didn't work. Then he told me I wasn't ill and must focus on life improvements. I visited a couple of endocrinologists and they had suspicions about malfunctions or syndroms I might have (including Cushing's) but that was also negative. I was desperate at that point beacuse deep inside I already knew my problem wasn't an illness - it was my spiritual beliefs kicking against all of me reality at the moments. And on the deepest level every bit of myself was dragging me back to the misery. &amp;#x200B; Countless times have I tried to listen to my pain, to find the answers within me. I've prayed, I've been talking to people, I was searching for answers. At the end of the day I would be left alone with the life-eating monster within my chest that would consume my every thought and emotion. Nothing on the outside, it's all an inner fight. &amp;#x200B; This februar I finally decided I can't manage that on my own so it was time to let somebody into my head to help me unknot this mess. I went deep down every bit of my misery and now I must proudly confess I'm sure of one thing being the very cause of all the suffering (with the bonus influence of the other developed factors also considered, of course). &amp;#x200B; It's all a very well established depressive mechanism of our minds. Summarized it's the expression of the death of a well-fed belief that's bein forming your ideals, goals, behaviour and has been working until a given point where it collides against a bitter reality. For me that was my most precious - my sexuality. Which on it's side is such a specific human-definig energy that doesn't underly any conscious control that sexual disfunctions can easily become the perfect male depression. And indeed, all along that nightmare I've been wandering around with a stone in my chest I silently developed a parasitic addiction to porn. I would masturbate to find relief, although I felt the same exhausting numbness and even pain stroking my penis. The excitemend and horniness would be canalized to a greater pain, but at least there was a sensation of relief and stabilisation of male energy at some point... It was making me feel alright, as it always has, so there must be nothing wrong with it, right? Yeah, guess what... &amp;#x200B; For a long time I thought that this disfunction was just the most painful expression of an illness I was quasi doomed to carry with me... or at least that was my initial year and a half premise after the things I've experienced. Now I atleast can focus all the pain in a given point and life really seems to be able to heal. So to say, I'm able to breathe and move around the elefant in the room. My mission as of right now is to find the way to rebuild my sexuality, all of my perceptions, my flow of energy. I can describe in detail the point of blockage that I haven't been able to solve for these two years since it's been a fact in my life. Not being able to 'have normal sex' is what has been frightening me on such a deep level all the time and in a sick way still is after I've managed to acknowledged a reason for all the suffering. &amp;#x200B; That's the point in my story where I'd like to get some experience from others who have possibly been through something like this hell. I'm not sure to what a degree porn has established false expectations, but it makes perfect sense to me now. I've read all the literature I could find on the topic and it really seems like that's the main issue going on with me. I've subconsciously shaped my sexuality according to a f\*cking fake maquette on a twisted show under the premise that it's ""healthy, normal"". As I think of it, for all of my conscious life I've been exposed to pornography as 'that interesting new age thing that's natural and funny to play around with'. As little kids even we would sneak out in the pause to occasionally watch some porn on someone's 'new phone'. Then it became a habit. I've been on nofap since the beginning of July 2019 now (i.e. almost two weeks) but not for a challenge or stuff, but for the sake of my life. I need a reboot and hope I could help myself that way. &amp;#x200B; As of right now I'm feeling stuck in a very strange middle state. I've come to terms with all of the suffering in a way and already try to get on my feet. I just graduated and was about to devote some additional years to fixing my life, but in the last moment decided I couldn't postpone my life so I went on to studying abroad and really hope to renew some of my horizons and social skills there (as I have had lots of them before that fucking pain got stuck in my chest). &amp;#x200B; I really am viewing my world in two bipolar ways now. One is the pain I'm still carrying, the other is the man I want to become and he's been showing himself recently. I couldn't be more happy to be even able to dream about the way I'll overcome this. And I know the key! It's all that undescribable sexual distortion. When I get to the bottom of my pain I know one thing - I can't find peace with sex. I can't find peace with my libido and moreover - with all the boundaries and heavy restrictions I've been relating it to. I even tried to experiment with my approach to girls (which, needless to say, was absent in its right form for the past two years, although I made some pitiful attempts for relationships but I won't even go there for now...). There's that one struggling centre of pain in my reality and it's been the same all along, I just wasn't paying right attention to it since I was busy wondering why my life is falling apart and how to save it in the conventional ways. &amp;#x200B; What I most precisely and devastatingly experience now is a sort of prison I need to overcome: on the one side I can't even approach the thought of sexual intercourse with a woman in the real world due to my persuaded 'disfunction' (that's where the most chaos kicks in, simply a panicking alert saying I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO, EVEN IF I KNOW, I CANT DO IT everytime I think about anything intimate or sexy... that thought is directly striking all of my vulnerability and puts me in the most painful state... even if I control it, it's atuomatically erasing the possibility of any enjoyable action with a girl). That's the ""forced beta behavioural response"" as I've come to name it. It's the killer. On the other side I have the perpetuum mobile of that behaviour which I hope to have finally discovered - it's the root of all that blocking beliefs persuading me that ""I simply can't"" and therefore my male worth is nonexistent. It's not that I'm lacking female interest or had some other issues or complexes throughout my previous relationships. It's not that girls don't understand or have been rude to me in some way. The problem is not even a thought, it's not even related to any events from my interaction with women. I've tried talking to girls before and after having sex, they're all chill but it's me being stuck in my hell. I can't experience anything near pleasure because of these strikes. As I said above, it's like the old skewed alpha in me just keeps me in that state and is turning my life upside down about it. It's a way deeper nested crushing feeling manifesting itself in many health forms - mainly a killing hyperventilation, panick attacks, psychosis episodes and severe depression. It's that constant painful void in my chest that's weighing me down wherever I turn my look to. I've been dreaming about what's making me ache and everytime wake up with what feels like a torn hole in my chest. A constant grip on my throat, heavy tough breathing, headaches, feeling of weight in my whole body, nausea... whatever you want, just name it. A complete mess. The most scary part was how I'm consciously healthy and aware of the world around me, but this state skews it all sensibly. I can't turn to do anything, nothing appeals, things looking ugly, even creepy and disgusting, seeing only misery in people... as if I could imageine every bit of pain someone or something could experience and in my reality, it was all messed up in the worst way... All of that must have its roots and I really hope to have finally debunked what's been making me so sick. It's not porn only, but the whole picture of skewed culture of cynicism and the fake values that are being attributet to sexuality these days. I was prone to adopting that and really hope I can clear my mind of all that misery. I can see it.... in order to flurish I simply need to get rid of all the 'musts' around sex and be able to believe that I can have sex for 10 seconds and still be proud and feel manly about it. That's what kills me in front of new girls and I seek some ill comfort in girls I know (yes, that's been expressing itself in inaproriate urges against female friends and close girls...). I need to get rid of all the disgust and dirtiness, that's been dubbed into my head surrounding sex. I need to once again unleash its natural beauty and overcome the fact that I won't fuck as I thought to. Only then will I be able to gain some more normal experience and continue with my normal life... But I feel so stuck as of right now and am carrying a killing bourden that's taken so much of my life now... &amp;#x200B; Is there any way to reboot? Has anyone experienced anything like that? I really need help to get on my feet right now, but I can understandably find little application of all that horror in my everyday life around me... I really hope to get some results abstaining from pornography, but I find it so hard to turn my libido towards the real world again due to the sensations I'm experiencing around sex. Any piece of help is greatly appreciated! Your brostronaut needs some hope, shared experience and motivation... &amp;#x200B; Love you all guys! Stay strong... &amp;#x200B; P.P. English is not my native language so excuse me for eventual mistakes in the text."

I have learned this this hard way - 45 days I went without PMO and I was feeling better than ever, then after one relapse I have found myself relapsing at least once per day. This journey doesnt relent, the addiction will continue to feed off vulnerability until we ourselves finally decide enough is enough and kick its arse. Its hard, its very hard, and its worth baring in mind that this is me speaking with post-nut clarity. In about 2 hours I will be craving that dopamine hit again, only this time I will be ready to fight the urge."

Ive worked on it my whole adult life hoping it would go away. My faith, marriage or therapy have not succeeded either in ending this. So I drive it down into a hidden part of me and pretend alls ok in the world when Im secretly eroding inside. When I get stressed, or doubt myself, or think somebody doesnt like me, or feel like Ive failed at something, porn is there with an endorphin filled hug and the soothing/acceptance my brain/emotions crave at that time. Then the familiar fallout. It never really went beyond that until this week when Im away with work in a hotel - there, Im not a husband and Im not dad, Im just that part of me thats hidden, hurting and lonely and after too much alcohol, I called an escort. When people say it just seemed to happen, you can find it hard to believe them. But it did. The reason it happened though is that Ive been setting a scene in myself for all these years, of how I deal with life, manage my needs and hide my vulnerability in case it comes across as a red flag towards my compulsion. And all of those choices over the years rose up and took a chunk out of me this week. I feel like fucking shit. Physically and emotionally. This thing is destroying me and could ruin my life. It makes me sick thinking about my wife finding out. One thing that Im taking from it though is the resolve that I need to make some big changes, no more excuses and putting things off. I need to get back to therapy, I need to stop drinking, I need to get fit, I need to take care of myself, I need some friends and meaningful relationships, I need Jesus (although Im terrified that means having to confess to my wife). If anyone out there had any encouragement, Id really appreciate it, it feels so lonely carrying this stuff."

So basically I was thinking, theres so much bs in this world and this is one of those rare places where people can come together and actually help each other as were ALL here for the same reason; to improve ourselves and overcome this addiction. Now Im sure most of you (if not all) know Steve-O, he comes from a family full of addicts of booze and drugs and after being addicted and on the verge of death MULTIPLE times, he overcame all of that, celebrating over 10 years!! Steve-O went into a Sobreity house with other addicts who all came together to help each other (this page can be that for us) My main take a way from his quotes and videos was one hugely inspiring and motivational one - of which Im sure you will all relate to! He says, and I vaguely quote in a house full of addicts, not everyone is going to have the urge to relapse at once this is so important because Im sure youll have felt that vulnerability but also on the contrary, felt equally as motivated to quit the addiction and become better! This is why, if we stick together and help those when they have an urge, ourselves will also be helped when we have one by others who come together. This is the community we need!! TLDR; Make this a community page to help those when they have an urge and equally be open to being helped to prevent a relapse. Take inspiration from Steve-O, if he can do it, we all can!"
71,vulnerability,NoFap,You Aren't Addicted to Porn. You're Addicted to Repressing Your Emotions,15,clczze,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/clczze/you_arent_addicted_to_porn_youre_addicted_to/,2019-08-03 11:39:57,"**Porn Isnt The Problem** &amp;nbsp; Ive seen a lot of people offer a lot of different reasons for why people struggle with porn addiction. &amp;nbsp; Ive read that its the medias fault, and how theyre forcing sexualized content into the minds of the people, causing them to become addicted. Ive read that its the porn industrys fault, and how they continue to produce more and more *free*, addicting content in order to keep us coming back for more. And Ive read that its the governments fault, and how theyre trying to keep us as a society, dumb, lazy, and lost in the world. &amp;nbsp; Ive done a lot of work on myself over the years, and overcoming an addiction to porn was one of the hardest. I used to believe, and love marinating in the idea that it wasnt my fault that I was addicted to porn. It was somebody elses. Mass and social media, the porn industries, the government, some secret, evil society underneath the world we know. &amp;nbsp; The more I struggled, and the more I experimented, the more I found myself using these other outlets as a source of my own failure. Sure, Id relapse, but it wasnt *really* my fault. I couldnt help it. These powerful organizations and groups are doing their hardest to keep me down, and its difficult for one person on their own to break the programming of so many intelligent and evil people. &amp;nbsp; But the further I got in my journey, the more that shit didnt make sense. &amp;nbsp; When we look to successful people, and ask them to share their secrets of success, so that we may join them in the ranks of the elite, one of the first things they *all* mention, is taking responsibility for yourself and your actions. Dont blame others for your failures and shortcomings. Take responsibility for your losses, and learn from those mistakes. *That* is how you succeed. &amp;nbsp; People eat that shit up. And constantly regurgitate it back up on countless motivational social media pages and YouTube channels. &amp;nbsp; Why would it be any different for overcoming addictions? &amp;nbsp; Its easy to point the finger at someone else when you fail, and say its their fault. It feels safer that way. You dont have to admit anything to yourself that would cause you to look at yourself and be disappointed. You can just say, I fought, but its their fault I couldnt win. &amp;nbsp; Is it though? &amp;nbsp; Are mass media and social media really shoving sexuality down our throats in an attempt to keep us ignorant to the world? Or are they simply giving us what were constantly searching for? You have to think, if there was no market to be had in promoting sexuality, it wouldnt be promoted. It wouldnt be abused. Because there wouldnt be any money to be made. &amp;nbsp; Are porn industries really giving us free and progressively more intense porn to watch because theyre trying to do whatever they can in order to keep us addicted and wanting more and more? Or are they simply capitalizing on an artificial need that a large amount of people have? Is the fact that its free really some huge conspiracy to get us while were young? or is it because there is simply more money to be made in that practice? &amp;nbsp; Are governments pushing pornography onto us as a society, in order to keep us stupid and lazy, slowly destroying ourselves? I mean, really? Is it really easier to believe some group of people are forcing this addiction onto you, than to believe there is something within *you* thats causing you to screw yourself over? If it was really the governments fault, wouldnt they do a better job in censoring those outlets that are used to bring awareness to porn addictions? &amp;nbsp; I think porn addictions, and general addictions overall, like drug addictions, alcohol addictions, and sex addictions, are much simpler than that. &amp;nbsp; ____ &amp;nbsp; **The Reason We Become Addicted** &amp;nbsp; Porn in itself isnt *bad* or *evil*. The way its produced, and the way people are treated in the industry certainly isnt good, from stories Ive heard, but porn in itself isnt bad. Its the same thing with drugs, alcohol, and sex. These things can be handled irresponsibility, and they certainly have negative effects and consequences when abused, but on their own, theyre just *things*. Actions or substances to be experienced, and in some cases, enjoyed. &amp;nbsp; So why do people become addicted to these things? And end up ruining their lives, and the lives of those close to them? &amp;nbsp; Well, Ive found it to be an emotional cause. Strictly inward, and nothing to do with mass or social media, industries, government, nothing outward at all. Chances are, if I told you to go masturbate and watch porn *right now*, you wouldnt do so. Im sure you *could*, given a little bit of time and preparation, but your mind isnt on porn right now. Its on reading this post. &amp;nbsp; Yet its probably true that you suffer from a porn addiction. Youve probably tried numerous times in the past to quit, and continuously relapse and fail. You may have even relapsed before reading this post. Youve searched throughout this subreddit, and all over the internet for a solution, and youve been suggested countless fixes to your addiction. &amp;nbsp; Youve tried working out more. Youve tried eating healthier. Youve tried waking up earlier and taking cold showers. Youve tried blocking porn from your devices, youve tried making promises to friends and family. If youre at the point I was, you may have even promised your soul to the devil, in hopes youd scare yourself out of the addiction. &amp;nbsp; But nothing works. You always break. You always have strong days where you beat an unbearable urge, only to lose to a seemingly lesser urge a few days later. You only last a few days, and even when you can go weeks or months at a time, its always the same. You succumb to the addiction. And you dont understand why. &amp;nbsp; You arent addicted to porn. You arent addicted to masturbation. You arent addicted to drugs, to alcohol, or to sex. None of these things control you in the way youve believed them to in the past. &amp;nbsp; Youre addicted to the feeling you get from porn, from masturbation, from drugs, alcohol, and sex. Or better put, youre addicted to the *lack* of feeling you experience when you indulge in these things. &amp;nbsp; If you can remember far enough, you may remember the first time you found porn. You werent addicted to it in any way. It was just something new to you. I remember as a little kid, Id watch porn like it was a show. I didnt even start masturbating to it until 7-8 months later, when the subject was brought up in school, because I had never masturbated before, and didnt know you could combine it with porn. &amp;nbsp; The first time I masturbated with porn, it felt nice. But I still wasnt addicted. It again, was just a new experience. A new feeling. Something that felt great, and it didnt hinder my attitude or composure as a child when I left home. &amp;nbsp; The addiction didnt start until I started using porn as an outlet for my emotions. I wasnt comfortable opening up and expressing myself to my parents, because I was raised in an environment where that type of vulnerability wasnt encouraged. &amp;nbsp; So, when I had a bad day at school, being bullied, failing a test, or getting in trouble, I didnt have an outlet to express the emotions and feelings I felt. And since I wasnt able to express those emotions and experience them properly, they built up within me. I forced myself to push them down, and repress them, ignore them, and wait for them to go away. &amp;nbsp; Until one day, I mixed the two together. Repressed emotional turmoil, and the *bliss* of masturbating to porn. &amp;nbsp; I felt better. At least, better in comparison to how I felt previously. Instead of trying to hold down the anger I felt for my bullies. The embarrassment I felt for failing a test. The disappointment in myself for getting in trouble, I could distract myself with pornography. I could feel something other than anger, embarrassment, and incompetence. I could feel relief. &amp;nbsp; And so, the solution to *overcome* those specific emotions is built. &amp;nbsp; When youre feeling anger, when youre feeling embarrassed, when youre feeling inadequate, masturbate, and feel bliss, a release, a calming of the mind. As with all things, through repetition, its easy to see that this will develop into a habit. &amp;nbsp; But people dont stop there. I didnt stop there. As I grew older, I began to experience newer emotions and feelings. Desire for women, aspirations I wanted to achieve, expectations I was expected to meet. As my world grew, so did my emotional capacity. I began to experience rejection, uncertainty, fear of failure, fear of success, loneliness. And as I continued to try and repress these emotions, bottle them up inside me, the more porn became an outlet of distraction for those negative feelings and emotions. &amp;nbsp; I didnt become addicted to porn. I became addicted to hiding from my own emotions, because I didnt know how to express them, or who to express them to. So, my life gradually became harder and harder. Because I was never actually dealing with those emotions that were built up over the years, I was just constantly ignoring them through pornography, because thats the habit I built over the years. The feelings I experienced when watching porn gave me a sense of release from the darker emotions I was afraid of, and didnt know how to handle. &amp;nbsp; Its the same with you. And its the same with people who struggle with different forms of addiction. They arent themselves addicted to porn, drugs, alcohol, or sex. Theyre addicted to the habit theyve developed in dealing with their emotions and feelings."

Just like all of you, I was under the influence that jackin off to some porn wasnt a big deal. Its the normal thing to do. Then I came across nofap, read about the benefits, and thought Ill try it for a week and see what happens. I am currently on my 10th day out, without porn or busting any nuts. Let me tell you something brothers, this shit is forREAL. Dont get me wrong, I get big urges to go back and beat my shit to some porn, but I have bigger urges to go make something out of my life. BUT, the biggest thing that Ive realized is my spike in CHARISMA. I have always had an introverted side to me, where Id enjoy days and nights at home playing video games with some buddies or smoking some weed and doing nothing. But now Im out and about, always finding myself wanting to be around people. And when I am around people, I seem to be the center of attention/leading the group conversation (Im not saying this to flex or brag about how great I am). This is crazy to me because I usually dont like to be at the center of attention or anything because I would be anxious and self-conscious. The best part is that all of this comes naturally and everything just seems to flow. I find that attraction from women come naturally with this aura/charisma that you bring; women of all ages seem to gravitate towards me and find ways to start conversation (shy girls will stare and look away when you see them, but this is just a free-easy sign to go talk to them). And when you conversate with women, you become genuinely interested in them rather than their bodies. The biggest change in my life is that instead of looking for any pussy I can get, I start talking to certain girls and realize that they arent that pretty or they are annoying/weird. You start being decisive and looking for qualities that you want, rather than going for a girl because she is a girl. Also the eye contact. You will stare right into the depths of their soul as you have flirty/friendly banter with them, and they feel a sense of vulnerability, but this turns them on because they feel a masculine-intensity from you. This is amazing. Try it out guys, imma keep yall posted. Im so glad I came across this community."

As I arrive in her apartment, I pay her the money for 15 minutes. She asks me what do I want ? At this point I had to be very careful of what I say and do because the vulnerability of relapse was very high. Instead of requesting any sexual activity, I just said cuddles would be fine. So as I'm sat on this very attractive escorts bed, I'm holding her and feeling her body. She kept asking me whether I would like more than just cuddles. Deep down, it was so fucking tempting but I kept saying to myself 51 days of semen retention is gonna be over in few minutes. And I need to stay on NoFap or else my summer body goal will become unachievable. 15 minutes were ticking by and in the last 5 minutes, she tried unzipping my trousers and I had a quick flashback of pure guilt the last time I busted a nut and that feeling to this day remains in my mind, so at this point I did a runner. As I get back in my car and drove home, that feeling of not relapsing was fucking heaven. Guys if I go to a escorts apartment and stick to NoFap, you guys have no excuse to relapse.

Over the years my habit of masturbation has developed from being something fun and enjoyable to feeling like something that now controls me. I have wrote myself a hall-pass for too long by telling myself that the specific content that I was viewing (things like wrestling, cat fighting, etc) wasnt the same as porn (more specific sexual scenes). My behavior and habit continued and over time I have found myself on too many occasions attempting to quit and finding myself right back where I started. After being caught by a partner over the past few years I have even convinced myself that viewing different content would bypass me acknowledging I have an addiction, I am heterosexual and have even desperately masturbated while viewing content relating to the same gender in a psychotic attempt to convince myself that that wasnt the same as porn or that it wasnt still wrong to my partner(female). After years and years of masturbating to specific content, I question if I have a fetish now, however I understand that it is most likely simply a result of nerves firing together for 10-15 years regularly. I am ready to quit and ready to be done. I am making incredible progress with my partner and am convinced she is the one. I struggle with vulnerability and emotional closeness, often due to my addiction that I spend so much time and energy concealing. I am exhausted with this addiction convincing me over and over again that its ok to view porn (of any kind) and to masturbate. It seems to always find a way to slowly break me or to talk my subconscious into thinking things like oh its ok to masturbate and view content as long as I dont orgasm. More and more crap like this. I am looking to find an accountability partner(s) to work with and keep each other on track and hold each other accountable.

I believe my longest streaks were 2 weeks. I rarely went on streaks though. I was hooked in PMO since I was about 12 years old. I am 27 now. Moving on. I also had a bad habit of eating my nails. I don't have to tell you how bad my self esteem was. I decided to change all this. I knew that I had failed many times whenever I tried to stop fapping. So I made my first nofap badge here to count my progress. And I started on July 20 last year. I tried to stop eating my nails as well. After 55 days, I had sex. That triggered my urge for masturbating and I relapsed that same day. I felt bad. I relapsed for another 2 weeks and then I started again. My next streak was for 30 days and I relapsed. The next streak was for about 20 days and I relapsed again. By December I had given up. Although I successfully stopped eating my nails. I saw how beautiful my nails were. That gave me the courage to try nofap again. So I decided to have nofap as my new year's resolution. I set my timer again on January first. January was a good month. I read two books and tried to be productive. I was also open about my addiction to a girl that I had a crush on. She kept telling me how proud of me she was. That gave me some confidence. Unfortunately, my flat line started on February first and it lasted for about 6 weeks. I felt like shit. I lacked motivation. It was like my mind gave up on me. But persevered and got through it by letting my crush know about my sex urges and what was going on in my head. She kept encouraging me and telling me things that I should try doing. I reached 90 days on April first. (My crush is not my girlfriend, I asked her out about a year ago and she said no. I'm gonna try again soon.) What I learned about nofap is that you need to persevere. You will fail many times, you will feel like shit many times but it will prepare you. Just keep going, try again and again. This is a test of your will power. Addiction kills will power and the only way to get it back is by getting back up whenever we relapse. In time we will overcome. Also, yo need to be open about it to someone. I suggest being open about it to girls. It feels better when girls know what you are going through. They respect you more for trying and being open. I think girls like guys who have a sense of vulnerability. Anyway, there is something about being open to girls about my PMO that kept me going. I think this is what people are lacking. Very few people are being open about PMO and fewer people tell girls about it. I realized that girls make guys strong, they can connect emotionally and that makes them perfect for this scenario. We need more girls to advice us in this nofap community. I'm sure I 'm not the only one who likes reading female comments on nofap. I am presently on 142 days now, and I am still moving forward. Thank you for your time."
76,vulnerability,NoFap,Day 1: A New Journey Begins,1,bstiu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/bstiu7/day_1_a_new_journey_begins/,2019-05-25 21:34:21,"Greetings fellow Fapstronauts, &amp;#x200B; Before I really start, I want to give a little background about myself. I've been using porn for over a decade now and have been addicted to it for a good portion of that time. During that period, my addiction has indirectly damaged my relationships, caused me to bomb several courses in university, made me lose my sense of motivation, lowered my self-esteem, and enforced other bad habits like video game addiction and overeating. Recently I've decided to take a stand, but after my last relapse I knew something had to change. After all, doing the same thing over and over again with the expectation that the outcome will differ is the definition of insanity. So, this time I'm taking real steps to combat this addiction, and one of them is this project. In my pursuit of a 365 day reboot, I'm making a commitment to post here at least once a week. In my posts I will include updates as to how I'm doing, points where I've struggled, lessons I've learned, and advice for my fellow Fapstronauts (along with perhaps the occasional motivational quote). My motivations for doing this are to have a sense of 'public' accountability, to encourage others through my own victories, and to help others by giving practical advice for defeating this monster. Thus, the content will fluctuate between journal, (non-religious) devotional, and advice column. Whatever the form that it takes, if it is of benefit to anyone else then my efforts will not be wasted. So, with that out of the way, let's get started. First thing I'll mention is the practical steps I've taken so far to fighting this beast in my own life. I have both a desktop and laptop. I've started by installing the emergency button in my browser and by keeping my laptop in my car at all times since that's usually the device that is used for searching porn. Furthermore, I'm endeavoring to keep my door open at all times to lessen the temptation, as I live with family. I've also gone to the trouble of installing the reddit app on my phone so I have access to this board anytime the urges are strong. But perhaps the biggest changes are in the productive things that I've started doing. I've started taking several online courses over the summer to learn more about the skills involved in my career field, and I'm now deeply engaged in several hobbies which include language learning and game design. Furthermore, I've begun exercising daily, eating healthier, and getting up at the same time every single day (5:00 am in case anybody was wondering). In short, I've been earnestly pursuing my career, hobby, and health goals while becoming more disciplined and focusing on my character. Despite recent setbacks in the arena of porn addiction, I'm more motivated and hopeful than I've been in a long time. &amp;#x200B; **Practical Advice**: I know much of this will be familiar to those who have been fighting addiction or pursuing discipline for any length of time, but hopefully the following will be useful to somebody. Weakness is your biggest enemy in fighting addiction. Resisting pornography isn't hard when you're feeling strong and motivated, it's difficult when you're at your most vulnerable state. So, one of the most fundamental pieces of advice I can offer is to *avoid vulnerability at all costs*. What are these states? I'll tell you. **Tired**. **Hungry**. **Frustrated**. **Depressed**. **Horny**. In these states, you are most vulnerable to urges, because in these states you are at your weakest and are not thinking as clearly as you ought to be. So, what should you do if you find yourself in one of these states? Well, before I get to that, I should mention that the very first thing you need to do is learn to recognize these conditions when they arise. After all, you can't fight the enemy you don't know. So, train your system to set off red flags immediately whenever you enter one of these states. That may take time for some people, but it's an essential step in removing yourself from a vulnerable state. The next step depends on exactly the state you're in, however most of them are fairly obvious. *Tired*? Either get some sleep, or, if it's not too late in the day, drink some caffeine. If chronic fatigue is an issue, you might need to consider seeing a doctor or taking supplements for vitamin or mineral deficiencies in your diet. And when in doubt, drink more water: a lot of people are probably dehydrated and don't even know it; and being dehydrated will really sap your energy. Don't be afraid to take naps either. Taking a short nap may be a slight disruption to your schedule, but the fact of the matter is that you're not going to be as productive as you could be anyways if you're exhausted, so you might as well spend that time resting so that the rest of your time can be more fruitful. But furthermore, fighting a war demands sacrifice. If you want to achieve ultimate victory and self-discipline then you need to be ready to be uncomfortable and to inconvenience yourself. Otherwise, you've already lost. *Hungry*? Get something to eat. And I don't mean junk food. Eating garbage will just leave you feeling terrible later and will probably just delay the state of vulnerability. Instead, eat something healthy that will keep you satiated and energized until your next meal. If you need to, bring snacks to work or school. And if you know you regularly get hungry at a certain time, then plan around that so that you can avoid being in that state of vulnerability for too long. Packing lunches and snacks might be somewhat of an inconvenience, but again, if you aren't ready for that then you aren't committed to the fight. *Frustrated*? Give yourself some distance and some time to cool off. If you find yourself regularly frustrated or angry and you don't practice meditation regularly then maybe now is the time to start. Meditation need not be a religious or spiritual experience (although it certainly can be). It can be as simple as taking a few minutes during the course of your day to stop what you're doing, be still, and clear your mind. Doing so will help you relax, take your mind off the things that are causing you stress, and put things into perspective (most of our problems become laughable when we realize how small they are in the grand scheme of things). To paraphrase Jack Sparrow, most of the time your issue isn't the problem, it's your attitude toward the problem. Learn to see obstacles as challenges, defeats as lessons, and conflict as an opportunity for growth. *Depressed*? Whether it's clinical depression, sadness, or loneliness, being depressed is a dangerous state to be in. If you suffer from chronic depression, then you should consider seeing a therapist or psychiatrist. ***Furthermore, I am not a medical professional nor have I ever suffered from long-term depression, so take the following advice with a bucket of salt***. Perhaps one of the most beneficial things you can do in the moment is seek out support: whether that be in the form of face-to-face interactions (probably the most ideal), online discussions with remote friends or a support group, or talking with friends and family members over the phone. Whatever you do, don't isolate yourself. Beyond seeking company, it can be beneficial to take some time away and make an effort to do something that normally makes you happy or cheers you up: whether that be hiking, eating at your favorite restaurant, painting, watching a movie, or playing a game. There's often no magic bullet for depression or its symptoms, but sometimes the best thing you can do is be around others and engage yourself in something at least moderately enjoyable to take your mind off of the negativity and to remove yourself from a state of vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; *Horny*? GET UP AND MOVE. Whatever you do, do not stay in your chair just hoping the feeling will go away. Because I've found that more often than not it evolves into a slow downward spiral that eventually leads to porn and relapse if not handled appropriately. One of the best things you can do is get some exercise. It doesn't matter what it is - walking, hiking, jogging, running, weightlifting, calisthenics, push-ups, etc. - just something to get you up and out of your chair and focused on something else. And when all else fails, go for the cold shower. You'll find countless people testifying to the wonders that they work in kicking urges to the curb. If exercise sounds uncomfortable or difficult, then refer to my earlier point. One last method for dealing with this state, when it's particularly severe and long-lasting, is to contact an accountability partner or find a friend to hang out with. This advice isn't limited to this state alone, but when things get really tough, don't be afraid to lean on someone else. It's what friends are for. &amp;#x200B; I hope this post and the ones that follow will be of use to anyone deciding to join me in this journey to freedom. It will be a long road and a hard one as well, but I know that it's doable and that it's worthwhile. Good luck fellow Fapstronauts. I'll see you on the battlefield. &amp;#x200B; Jack Hoffman signing off."
77,vulnerability,NoFap,Toolbox from Therapy Part 1 - Bahavioral Analysis (DBT),3,buszdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/buszdo/toolbox_from_therapy_part_1_bahavioral_analysis/,2019-05-30 23:10:47,"I thought about providing a couple of psychological tools I use to the community. Unfortunately they are in german so I have to translate them one by one which will take time. I'll try to post at least two if them every week. Vote up if you think its good so more people can see and benefit. I have the luxury of good therapy access but most dont so I hope this helps. This is a Tool called ""Behavior Analysis"" from Dialectic Behavior Therapy that can help identify circumstances that have lead to problematic behavior or relapses and find a strategy to cope with urges. I found it very usefull and it has proven efficient with addiction for many years in clinical enviroment and studys. Use it as a form, take your time to go through all the questions even if its hurfull or embarassing... and sometimes birjng. Its not intended for sharing the content, except with a therapist if you have one, but feel free to do anyways if it helps. Note that its a general tool and some questions wont apply to PMO. You can also use this if you have a tendency to hurt yourself or others. 1. Problematic Behavior (relapse, but feel free to apply it to any behavior that troubles you. From now on called PB) decribe your PB detail What did you do? where? Who else was involved? Describe in such a detail that a actress or actor could replay the scene in a play. 2. Trigger What event preceded the PB? What did you do, think or feel or which imagination did you have before the PB Which body sensation did you have before the PB? When did the PB begin? Which of those preceding things was in your opinion the most significant? 3. Vulnerability Factors (Its important to acknowledge that things that drain our energy, or lack of regeneration, strong emotions and other factors make us more vulnerable to triggers, or weaken our ability to find balance after stressfull events) Which Factors made you vulnerable to the PB Consider: disturbed eating or sleeping habbits, injuries, sickness, use of drugs or alkohol, misuse of medication, stressfull events in your enviroment, intense feelings, some own behavior that you found troublesome. 4. Consequences: (Keep in mind some questions apply more to problematic behaviors in general than relapses) Identify everything that resulted out of your PB This includes your own emotions, thoughts, body symptoms and behavior? How was it directly after the PB and later? Did other people react directly or with delay? Which effect did your behavior have on your enviroment? Which consequences did your behavior have on you and other people? 5. Solution analysis Go once again through your behavior analysis. Identify the aspects where you could have avoided the problematic behavior if you had acted differently. Which skills and coping strategys could you have applied or can use next time? What kept you from using those Skills? Which kind of consequences would help you to get the PB under control next time? 6. prevention strategies How could you have lowered your vulnerability for the PB? What can you consider in the future to lower your vulnerability? 7. make up for things you done. Which options do you have to make up for things you done? (in case you hurt others)"
78,vulnerability,NoFap,"60 Days: My Experience, Results and Tips",1,bc8qp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/bc8qp2/60_days_my_experience_results_and_tips/,2019-04-12 12:59:01,"I've been a lurker here attempting to break my addiction for almost than two years, as far as I can remember. I'll be 20 years old in a few months and I've been watching porn since I was in middle school. Looking back, I can see the bad effects it had on my life, like towards the end of a relationship with my ex-girlfriend when I started caring more about her sexuality than her personality. However, after relapsing hundreds of times and giving up just as much, I've finally hit sixty days going strong, and I'm cruising all the way to 90. Here's my experience with NoFap, my lessons learned, my tips for all of you fapstronauts, and how I feel I've changed over this period of time. **My Experience** The first month after moving in to college, I actually did stop PMO, because I was always out and was now sleeping with a roommate. Then a few weeks into the semester I relapsed and masturbated in the bathroom. The rest of my freshman year was pretty much limited to a streak of two or three days. I forgot about this subreddit and watched porn regularly. Over the past summer, I went on vacation and following that I hit a streak of two weeks. That's where I really started to get serious about NoFap, because I knew then that I had it in me. I downloaded a DayTracker to count my streaks down to the second, butI wouldn't get my next big streak until No Nut November. I went the entire month without fapping, but I still watched porn when I was alone and gave in to my urges. After the month was over, I relapsed and continued to masturbated for several months. Until February 10th, at least I think. I don't know if that's the last day I watched porn, because I just kind of stopped. That's one of the things about quitting, is that for me at least I always told myself that ""This one will be the last one"" and ""No more after this one last video"". After hearing that go through my head again and again, day after day, it became meaningless. I didn't mean what I said anymore. And that's why I don't know when I stopped, because I wasn't focused on stopping, I was focused on being a better me. A week after my presumed quit date, I went to a party and noticed a change in myself dramatically. I spent most of the party talking to this really pretty girl and I felt more confident than ever. Before, I would've been nervous and probably kept to myself, but everything was just feeling right in my head (contribute however much of that to alcohol as you wish). After that night I really felt amazing. I started to get back heavily into my lifting program, talked to people a lot more, and just felt great. So much has changed in the past 2 months for me, it's been a recent high point in my life and I can't wait to keep going. One of the things I learned is that it's not about magic powers that come to you; girls don't become magically attracted to you when you stop fapping, and you don't gain superhuman powers. The biggest thing for me is what I already mentioned before: Confidence. Being able to see yourself as a champion is the first thing to come, and it's what catapults you to big streaks. Believing that you can be yourself around others without consequence, because your self has nothing dirty beneath its sheets. Thee second result is actually a way to stop PMO: Productivity. Think about fapping for just 5 mins a day. Thats over a half hour every week, 2.5 hours every month, and 30 hours every year. Think about what else you could do with all that time. It doesn't have to be a 5 hour hike or getting a term paper done; start small. The thing I did the most was make my bed every morning. Its quick, easy and after 30 seconds my room looks 1000 times nicer. And besides, who wants to jerk off and ruin such perfectly folded sheets? Basically, there is no magic switch that you'll flip after 3 days, a week or a month. People won't see you differently because of what you don't do in the bathroom or in bed. But they'll see you differently when you see yourself differently, and that's the key. **My tips** * Make your bed in the morning. I know I said this earlier, but for those who are just scrolling to the tips, I can't emphasize this more. It's fast, easy to do, and looks nice. But most importantly: you've done something productive at the very start of the day. * ""Urges are addiction leaving the body"" I don't remember who posted this, but I saw it a couple weeks ago when I was having an urge, and I can't thank you enough for posting this. This phrase has been my mentality ever since, and it's the most helpful phrase I've heard in my entire NoFap journey. That's the mindset you need to have, turn your moments of vulnerability into your moments of greatest strength. * Get out and laugh. It doesnt matter if you are sending memes between friends or having the most stupidly hilarious conversation with them. Laughter is the best medicine. Scientifically, the hardest part of breaking an addiction is the dopamine withdrawal. Finding a healthy alternative source of dopamine will help with quitting. It doesn't stop at laughter either. Do what makes you happy, and stick with it. Put that satisfaction where your fapping satisfaction used to be. * Forgive yourself. This is extremely important. You HAVE to be able to look at yourself and say that you aren't a failure, that you relapsed, but that it's okay, because you're making progress. That week will turn into two, and then another relapse but the next streak will be a month. I relapsed countless times, but I only made progress on them when I forgave myself afterwards. If you look at yourself as a failure every time you relapse, you'll only make yourself depressed. You'll stop loving yourself, and then it's impossible to quit an addiction. Because you're doing this for you, and no one else. I don't really think there's anything else to say, other than if this post helps one person get closer to quitting, it will be worth it. Good luck to all of you, stay strong and fight those urges."
79,vulnerability,NoFap,Interesting anxiety - thoughts,1,bffp5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/bffp5c/interesting_anxiety_thoughts/,2019-04-21 04:55:46,"Was surprised to feel anxious this morning because I felt relaxed throughout my routine. I realized I had been sharing my thoughts about something with my girlfriend and was feeling anxious about abandonment. I think this came from my dad because I was alone as a kid at home most of the time. When we spent time together I think I felt desperate for understanding and support, but I had to earn both of those through appeal and discourse. I was often unsuccessful in gaining favour, and additionally wounded by feelings of abandonment and rejection, despite the efforts of pouring my heart out. Experiencing that vulnerability again with my girlfriend feels triggering, like Ill have to endure the pain of my feelings being ignored regardless of how dire they are. Im capable of taking care of myself if I empower myself to be patient and accepting - its intimidating to feel alone and hopeless, but that experience is unrepresentative of my abilities and how my life has changed."
80,vulnerability,NoFap,Day One,1,bmdlxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/bmdlxe/day_one/,2019-05-09 11:16:49,"Sometimes I feel like if it isn't the depths of a porn binge, it's food, or video games, or drugs, or whatever else delivers a potent state change as quickly as possible. Is it now an addiction to letting go of my self worth? How can I be aware of this for years and still not decide to stop? Why am I writing this here and is this just another clever distraction from truly caring enough to change myself? Is this just an appeal to competitive suffering, a cry for help? I feel like the pattern is so much deeper than seeking pleasure. It's closer to washing away an unbearable pain with the numbness of self loathing. It's like I host a demon who knows that all it has to do is choke my mind with the things that I don't want to face until I put it to sleep with dopamine. Every time I abstain from one thing, it demands another and I allow it rather than relying on the endurance of my paper thin willpower. Sometimes I feel like this will never change no matter how hard I push or how far I get. That dark side of me begins to fill the cracks of my fatigued psyche and it waits for my vulnerability to grow with it until it wins me over with loving reassurances that ""it's *just a little taste"".* Then I feel even weaker when I press reset and resent yet another attempt at being a man who values personal responsibility. Nonetheless, I want tomorrow to be another day one. I want to count those days for longer than I did before. I suppose some of you might understand so I'll leave this here because maybe like me, you feel like struggling alone only makes it seem like it's all in your head. I mean come on, *""it's just a little porn, right*?""..."

I dont want to ramble on too long. Ive been wanting to do this and have tried before. But this is the first serious attempt Im making at this. I watch porn everyday, and masturbate at least once usually twice a day. I masturbate to pictures of girls I know, amateur porn, gangbangs. You name it, Ive done it (well... maybe not I suppose). Its desensitized to sex and ruined my first sexual experience. My only sexual relationships have had no feelings involved, and this has potentially ruined sex for me entirely. Ive become to complacent in my dating life and havent tried hard enough. I have anxiety talking to attractive girls, especially sober. I have commitment and vulnerability issues that have ruined any chance at a relationship Ive had. My hopes in NoFap are pretty clear. To improve my dating life and my sexual experiences. To bring more joy to my life that Ive loss. To lessen my anxiety and depression. With this comes a better diet and more rigorous and regular gym routine. Ive come to a realization that I want to improve my life - and NoFap I believe is my starting point. I plan on updating my profile occasionally with progress"

It is impossible to go through life without experiencing stress, dissatisfaction, and loss. Even in moments of happiness and triumph, some tinge of suffering exists because that moment of bliss is only temporary. I suffer because everything I love, and ever will love, is temporary, as everything in the universe is, including myself. **Suffering rises from attachment to desires** Whenever I experience suffering, I fap to relieve myself. Fapping gives me pleasure, and pleasure helps me temporarily forget about my suffering. Because it gives me relief from my suffering, I grow attached to fapping. The more attached I get to fapping, the more I do it; the more I do it, the more I need to do it; the more I need to do it, the more I suffer the need to do it, the more I suffer the need to do it, the more I suffer; and the cycle continues. My struggle with fapping is my struggle with life itself, summed up by the buddhist concept of *samsara* being the default mode of existence for most people. Samsara roughly translates to ""a cycle of aimless drifting, wandering, or mundane existence."" Of course, beyond myself, fapping and buying women perpetuates the cycle of suffering for others. One quick browse through YouTube and you'll hear about stories of women in recovery from having been used and abused by pornographers and sex traffickers. Whenever I sit down for dinner and watch the news, there are countless new victims of rape, child molestation, child rape, incest, and other horrendous crimes. As I sit there condemning them in my mind, I am reminded, ""Hey you hypocrite, you watch porn, and most of these girls you watch are virtually kids who are just hungry who are being exploited by the insatiable greed of the porn industry, fueled by YOUR insatiable lust."" That does a number on the soul. **Suffering ceases when attachment to desires ceases** This is the crux of my NoFap journey - learning how to *live* *with* desire, but not be *lived by* desire. I am not doing this reset for the sake of accomplishing it, but for the sake of learning as much as I can about what healthy sexual desire looks like, instead of what I've learned to do throughout the years which is to virtually or literally buy women. **Freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the Eightfold Path** For now, it is a commitment to: 1. Right view: For me, this means changing my view on women, seeing them as rare and beautiful human beings worthy of love and respect, rather than objects for my personal sexual gratification. 2. Right intention: For me, this means learning how to put the welfare of others beyond my need for personal gratification. 3. Right speech: For me, this means practicing honesty and vulnerability through my journal posts here on NoFap, and being open to feedback when someone calls ""BS."" 4. Right action: For me, this not only means doing NoFap, but also making choices to be to be a more loving, more compassionate, and more joyful human being. 5. Right livelihood: For me, this means completely abstaining from buying people (women), so as not to contribute to the growing number of sex traffickers and sex-trafficked individuals worldwide. If there is no demand, there will be no supply. 6. Right effort: For me, this means sleeping on time, eating on time, working earnestly, exercising, and constantly working on bettering myself. 7. Right mindfulness: For me, this means surrendering to the fact that a Divine Mind is at work here, and that Godly desire can ultimately trump my own selfish desires, so long as I choose it, so long as I surrender to it. 8. Right concentration: For me, this means a ""fearless and searching moral inventory"" (quoting AA/ SA), to take time each and every day for major introspection, to put my recovery from porn and sexual addiction at the forefront of my daily life practice."

I personally hate the act of masturbating and see it as identical to excreting bodily waste. While I did in my early teenage years, In the past 2-3 years I rarely watched porn as I needed to trick myself into connecting with the female on an emotional level. This is why in the past year or so I started relying more and more on the attractive women in role-playing ASMR videos to fulfill my urges (given the personal level of this genre). &amp;#x200B; I am not in a position to take on a romantic relationship, nor do I want one at this time. I would like NoFap to decrease my emotional vulnerability to women, and possibly my biological one too. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR I do NoFap to: 1. Avoid dependency on ASMR 2. Reduce emotional vulnerability to women 3. Increase energy levels and productivity 4. Avoid a bodily function that I see as being incredibly grotesque &amp;#x200B; What about you? "

After the first few days /weeks of nofap you feel amazing. You feel much happier than you have ever been in a while. Then this can happen: if there is a moment of vulnerability, maybe at night (don't EVER sleep in the same room as your computer /device is) you could lie to yourself and think something like: ""Actually I'm pretty good, porn is not that of a problem you know... Everyone does it after all.. Maybe just let's do a quick one, after all I can control myself.."" You minimize the problem, but you fall into it and THEN you start feeling horrible, like shit. And then, because of that, you loose all control and just fap again and again and again and you fall into a really deep hole... And the worst part is that you feel even worse thinking about how good you were doing before. So DONT lie to yourself. There is not ""only one time"". I just wanted to share because I've been right there just a moment ago. I got to resist, put away the computer and go to bed. But it's so frustrating feeling how a part of me tries to tell this lies over and and over when deep inside I know the truth. I thought it would be nice to share. Keep it up "

In this fast, instant-gratification-world, filled with distraction, the time of other humans is very valuable. So is yours. Thank you very much. &amp;#x200B; I am Xerans, live in Germany, 20 years old, studying mechanical engineering. When I am not studying, with my buddies, my girlfriend, or my family, I'm lifting at the gym. &amp;#x200B; May I tell you my story, so you can answer my question with knowledge of the context? &amp;#x200B; I was really addicted to fapping when I was around 16 years old. I even was depressed. I read a certain fantasy-novel back then, in which there where some hot scenes described. I often spent the whole day in bed, reading, and yaking off 3-5 times. My mother was really concerned about me because I just spent the whole day in bed and went no longer out to play, I didn't even leave my bed to play. I just read it. And I also watched Porn. A lot. And also Jacked off to it an extra 1-3 times a day. I remember to not wanting to go to boy scouts, because I thought, all this running around and stress for only a little pleasure, compared, the pleasure my porn brought to me, was just not worth it. So I stayed home. &amp;#x200B; Then one day my older brother asked me very directly: &lt;&lt;How often do you yerk off?&gt;&gt; Until then I haven't even thought, I didn't count it until then. Then he told me about NOFAP and that really got me in this movement. So there my journey began! I had ups and down, of course, and my longest strike since ever has only been 15 days. I also began to take cold showers and other Personal development things, like sleep, nutrition, and exercise optimation. I am still working really hard on my personality to become the best version I can be for this World! &amp;#x200B; I really had success fast. After my first 7-Day NOFAP streak I met my first Girlfriend. I'm going to call her here Jana. I was so confident and funny, I had the typical ""NOFAP-Superpower"". I was out with my friends drinking and I just walked up to her and had fun with her and her girlfriends. I even asked for her number, and soon we had our first date. There I had my first make out and boob-grab after only a 7-day strike! Damn and then I was on nofap! Anyway, as I had this first Girlfriend, I still couldn't really free my self from the chains of PMO. I still fapped and watched porn. But less often. I was always between 1-3 times a week. I think that is alright. Of course, the goal is 0 but keeping this for a long time without major relapses its still an accomplishment, being a former porn addict. &amp;#x200B; Going on to my question: Now, with my current girl friend, I know what love is. I wasn't in love with my first girl friend. I just liked her and of course, wanted to have the company of a hot girl. While being together with Jana, we could only see each other once or twice a week. I thought, that, when I have a girlfriend, my lust for other women would go. The contrary was the case! I felt so much lust and attraction to other girls, and I really was ashamed of me. Anyway, 6 months later we broke up because she had betrayed me. &amp;#x200B; So then I no longer felt bad for all my lust, attraction and fantasies. &amp;#x200B; Then, I met the woman of my dreams. The night we met, we talked for more than 5 hours straight and I was so fascinated with her. In the time between Jana and this girl, I had refined my craft. So I asked for her number and 3 weeks later we had our first date. She was still really interested, but didn't let me kiss her. I was so confused. Until then I had always made out on a first date, or it was over. Not with her. We kept the contact and had another date. And very soon we were a couple. As she was a virgin and Christian, she had me waiting for three months after we got together until we slept the first time together. When she finally gave me the gift of her vulnerability, it was unbelievable. I love this woman! I am still together with her, after 2 years and very happy with the relationship. I have very little time because my studies really require a lot of work, but she can cope with that. We only see each other once a week. We usually do some cool activities, like go to a comedian-evening, go mini-golfing, bowling or to a party. Of course, we sleep together and sleep in the next day. I really love her. She is gorgeous, and a great partner, that also accepts my weaknesses and supports me very good. &amp;#x200B; Now the problem: I have the same thing as before with Jana: I love my girlfriend and still am so attracted to all these other women out there. I feel so guilty for my thoughts. And fantasies. &amp;#x200B; And I found that fapping calms my fantasies, so I no longer feel so guilty and bad. But fapping in itself is contra productive. &amp;#x200B; I am kind of in a doom loop: Either I fap or I feel very guilty. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; So lately the guilt I felt was too much, so I searched for help. I read the book &lt;My secret Garden&gt; from Nancy Friday. After knowing what all those women think, I felt less guilty. But then I once wrote down my fantasies. And they were so perverted and wicked that I was like: ""What monster am I ???"". Well, then I wanted to know what other men think. So I read her other book &lt;Men in Love&gt;. This really relieved me. I am not a monster. I am simply a Man. But of course, after reading such material I had a crazy relapse, were I yerked off 4 times in a row (yes it's possible, but only if you're in certain stage). I yerked then off another 2 times that afternoon. Then In the evening, I went to a party with my Girlfriend and back home I came another 3 times the night and the following day another 4 times. This Sunday I was completely high, from all my orgasms, I tell you. After this crazy weekend, I had no more thoughts or phantasies about other women. For 3 days. &amp;#x200B; And then I was like: There has something to change! And now I am here. Yeah! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; My first question: How do you cope with your lust and attraction to all those women? I feel if I don't fap, I'm going crazy. &amp;#x200B; My second question, especially to the men who are in relationship: How do you cope with your attracktion to all the other women? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Your Xeranos II &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

Ive struggled with a porn addiction for a long time now and its taken me to dark places and its controlled me for too long. I have a friend who recommended this community to me after his own experience with all of this. At first I was hesitant I didnt really think it would help I thought quitting porn would be easy I quit cigs cold turkey why not porn? I was dead wrong this is nothing like nicotine the cravings and urges to watch porn is nothing like what the cigs were. I was on a 4 day streak a few days ago and I felt great it was possibly the longest I had been without it in about 4 years. I didnt even realize how much it was changing me until I broke it...everything came crashing down all the pain in my joints and anxiety in my head just flared up and I just wanted to cry and punch a hole in the wall. It was awful but I thankfully had my friend there to help me and explain to me his experience with ending a streak and it made me feel better but I was still so disappointed in myself. Everything I was doing to be better in life was thrown away for 15 minutes of looking at naked women it made me mad that I would do that to myself it made no sense it wasnt worth it so why do it?? I made the vow to never do it again but unfortunately 3 days later here I am again the feeling of disgust and disappointment weighing on me the pain and vulnerability surging through my joints its awful I did it twice today...twice! Why? I just want to give this up for good I want to live a life where I dont even need to think about porn i want to be healthier but this porn shit is stopping me...my biggest regrets in life were caused by this porn addiction and Im ready to kill it I hope I have all of yalls support on this. Im nervous yet excited at the same time Im ready to get serious its time.
87,vulnerability,NoFap,REALISE THE POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS AND NO ONE ELSE'S,1,ax8u71,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ax8u71/realise_the_power_is_in_your_hands_and_no_one/,2019-03-05 03:14:41,"** Fyi this is a long story so sorry in advance ** Just a little background information on my individual nofap story/background. I definitely from the very beginning had a very unique experience with quitting porn and pmo. Definitely was far too arrogant and took nofap for granted from the start as you'll soon find out. Hope you can all learn from my mistakes and make the most of your journey! I originally started nofap by accident (how ironic). This was about 4 months ago at the start of October and I was going out (clubbing) for a friends 18th. I had also just realized I hadn't properly kissed a girl for 9 months. Yes, 9 whole months, since the very first week of 2018. This was due to lack of confidence and insecurities about myself; that I'm sure many of you can relate. So I had decided not to masturbate for 2 days before going out to see whether it would make a difference in me being able to talk to women? Turns out I was right and it helped me because I hooked up with a random girl in the city (with the help of mdma but that's a whole other story in itself lmao) and was very proud of myself because progress was progress. I ended up going out the next two days as well as having work in the morning both times and I found myself at 5 days of no-pmo. I found myself talking a lot to women at work in a confident yet relaxed way I hadn't ever before?? Was especially odd due to the fact I was very hung over and coming down from alcohol and other substances (3 day bender). I then looked it up to see whether anyone else was talking about this phenomenon (that was how I saw it anyways). I had scrolled past a few nofap videos and things on the internet before so I knew where to look per se. After seeing nofap on Reddit and several videos on YouTube I quickly tried to soak up as much information as I possibly could. Less than a week in and I saw big improvements that I never knew could've existed; I could only imagine what going 90 or 180 days could produce after reading success stories etc. So I continued on this journey and everything else that people report happens to them, happened to me. I then found myself on 21 days on my first streak ever, only to lose my virginity to a random girl from a random club that was also a virgin. We connected instantly and told each other how we were virgins etc within the first 5 minutes of meeting. This only enabled my streak to get larger and larger til I had sex again with her after meeting her in real life only for the second time. I then went on holidays for this thing we call ""schoolies"" in Australia. Which is basically a holiday to celebrate finishing year 12 (senior year etc). I found an older girl there who wasn't there for schoolies and we clicked even more than I ever thought I could with another person period. We had sex several times in the 36 hours of meeting her and stayed up all night talking about our lives, insecurities, fears and deep conversations in general etc. Was a very emotional experience in of itself and I was able to be extremely empathetic towards another human (and receive it) in ways I couldn't even comprehend. It was also the first time I realized that there was another person out there that would ever even want to be in a relationship with me. I told her all this and she told me that I was the first guy she was attracted to after breaking up with her boyfriend of 6 years. Only thing was we lived in different states. A 2,000 word essay couldn't even summarize that experience, but this isn't a love story thread so I won't bore you any longer. Fast forward a few weeks after getting home from that trip and I accidentally relapsed. Two days later I slept with a girl I'd just met at a club (was also very fucked). I definitely didn't regret it and would have done it sober but I didn't realize(in the moment) that it would be bad to emphasize the fact that I had sex with a girl 2 days after masturbating. I then masturbated a few times until Christmas Eve where I ended 6 day streak and told myself I wouldn't do it again. I then also hooked up and slept with another girl I had just met a few days after that same relapse. This only caused me to think that it was fine(for me) to watch porn and masturbate infrequently if I was having sex. Boy was I wrong. Fast forward 2 weeks later and I have another one-night stand after masturbating at least several times a week. Over a month after this, that same girl I had met on schoolies was coming to my state. She had said from the start that she was going to come here so we had kept in contact the whole 3 months we hadn't seen each other. That meant a lot due to the fact that I am very bad at keeping in touch online, with anyone. Anyways when she came with her friend I was on an 8 day streak (longest streak since my 1st relapse). To summarize her coming to my city, I wasted almost all my money I'd saved (just quit my job at maccas), got far too emotionally invested in those 3 months, put in far too much effort when I wasn't receiving it, got lied to continuously and got my heart completely crushed. A whole thesis couldn't explain how much I got fucked in these few days she was here and how much this destroyed me; as 3 months of expecting something to be something and it turned out to be very much the complete opposite. 0 to no closure whatsoever and was treated like absolute fucking garbage. I was on about a 12 day streak at the worst part of this situation (the exact same day she left to go home) and I hadn't felt this sad, depressed, frustrated, angry and many other things in as long as I could remember. But I also remember being able to rationalize the whole situation in a way that was almost funny(due to being at such a low), by watching motivational/inspirational videos on YouTube; including some nofap videos. Then the next few days were much better than I had thought they would've been. I was able to pick myself up very instantaneously when I had negative or destructive thoughts. Obviously this being the highest time of vulnerability for a relapse, I also equally acknowledged how I wouldn't have been able to cope so well and give myself so much self-worth so soon after something this bad happens. Somehow I didn't relapse and it only gave me more strength to continue with this lifestyle of no-pmo and rebuild my whole life even better than it was before this crushing situation with that girl. I ALSO had one of the most unproductive summer holidays of my life after planning for it to be the opposite (planning whilst on my one and only 78 day streak). Also FYI You wouldn't believe that catastrophe with that girl only happened 8 days ago and I have bounced back in ways that wouldn't have been possible without the help of nofap. I am here to tell you this nofap story to make sure you don't make similar mistakes to me. Don't fall for the old ""once won't hurt"" or ""fuck it I've lost my streak I'll just binge"". Make sure you make your self accountable and just know that there's no one else who can take control. You might be going through things, several very hard things. Even though now many be a rough time, I promise you you will be stronger if you start during that hard time. It will give you very strong foundations for your nofap lifestyle. Who's to say you couldn't have a streak of 10 days or 10 weeks or 10 months?? Exactly 10 days/weeks/months away from now. The only person not letting that happen is you. Why on earth would we not all utilize a FREE, powerful and unique tool that helps our lives in every which way?? We need to realise and soak in the fact that the only reason why we're not becoming the best no-pmo version of ourselves, is because of ourselves. We life one lifetime, so make the most of it and go out there and achieve whatever the fuck you wanna achieve. Whether you haven't been past 36 hours or you haven't been past 100 days it doesn't matter because today is always a new day and opportunity; seize it. Picture yourself at triple your highest streak. Then picture yourself at triple that. If some average-joe can go on a 78 day streak for the first time, after pmo-ing for 5+ years; then sure as hell can you. It doesn't matter whether you've been watching porn or masturbating for 1 year or half a century. There's nothing inside me, that isn't in all of you. Ironically I am writing this 4 hours before I have to wake up for my first day of university lmao. If you don't quit, just like with anything else, you can't fail. Stay strong to all of you and remember that no matter how much you feel like you want a short term burst of dopamine, you'll thank your past self for NOT doing it in the long run. That I will bet my life on. Wishing you all the best on your journey to success! P.S. Sorry if I come across in an all black-or-white fashion in terms of pmo or not pmo. Any progress is progress period, I just strongly believe to the core that anyone and everyone can turn their lives around drastically and instantly, regardless of their pmo/sexual background. It might be harder for some people, but I think it's possible for EVERYONE. At the very least don't make the same mistake that I and many other people make; binging after a relapse. Make the best of the worst situations. Let it make you stronger and more driven. Without the dark there's no light. Be grateful to be one of the small amount of people in the world, who understand the full potential of this amazing tool."

(Also, if there is already a thread like this, please link it to me in the combox) I ask because I want to start on this journey for myself because of my partner. I cant hold an erection or even really get one fully with her and I have come to think that it may be because of my porn/fap habits. (note: emotionally I feel very connected and physically connected-we have a good relationship, even to the point where I can talk about this stuff without shame and in vulnerability, so it isnt the physical/emotional piece) So in sum: can anyone share their experience (in a limited fashion) about their ability to perform? For example: how long did it take for you to heal and perform better. Or how long did it take for you to feel sexually connected to your partner? Hope that makes sense: also, today Im beginning on this journey, so send some good vibes this way. Thanks!"

Share yours! To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality (it means acting to please God, in the ancient language). - Jordan Peterson"
92,vulnerability,NoFap,IGen - this includes about 24% of all Americans and all of us,1,akjqme,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/akjqme/igen_this_includes_about_24_of_all_americans_and/,2019-01-28 15:13:53,"Who is iGen? Excerpts from an Article by Tony Reinke Kids between the ages of 6 and 23 fall into a generation now getting labeled Post-Millennial or Gen Z or iGen. I want to introduce you to the research on this generationTo be honest, I dont know which is worse: the arrogance of speaking in generalities about an entire generation, or the ignoring data-trends. iGen is a recent label given to those born between 1995 and 2012. It is 74 million Americans, or 24% of the population, and the most diverse generation in American history. It is also the most digitally connected and smartphone-addicted generation. iGeners were born after the Internet was commercialized in 1995. They have no pre-Internet memories. Each entered (or will enter) adolescence in the age of the smartphone. As parents face many challenges guiding these teens in the digital age. Trends Among Teens -Jean Twenge, a psychologist at San Diego State University, has written the most systematic study about iGen. She ran the datasets, conducted the interviews, and has now voiced her concerns  first published in a feature article for the Atlantic, under the bombshell title Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation? The article was an excerpt from the book that soon followed, iGen: Why Todays Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy  and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood. Teens are statistically less likely to go to parties, drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or experiment with sex. If Tom Hanks represented a generation in the movie Big children impatient for adulthood  iGen is the exact opposite: children with the ability to postpone all transitions into adulthood. Twenges extensive study summarizes the observations: iGeners are safe. They are the first generation to grow up with active shooter drills at school since kindergarten. They are the most protected generation by parents. By preference, they are the most self-cloistered generation of teens. Taking all the evidence together, iGen teens are more likely to be homebodies. Compared to previous generations, iGen teens are statistically less likely to go to parties, to go on dates, to get their drivers licenses, to drink alcohol, to smoke tobacco, to ride in a car without a seat belt, or to experiment with sex. Now many of these trends are good, and we should celebrate the turning away from foolish behavior. But as Twenge says, taken together, these trends offer a portrait of behaviours that mark a generation of delayed adulthood and prolonged adolescence. iGeners are spending less time working jobs, volunteering, engaged in student activities, and doing homework. The result: theyre spending massive amounts of time at home and online. Theyre virtually never offline  driven to their devices by social promise, by friendships, and by relationships. By far, the most concerning takeaway from Twenges research, and confirmed by others, is the spike in teen depression. Between 2012 and 2015  in just three years  depression among boys rose 21%, and depression among girls rose 50%. These upticks are reflected in suicide rates. After declining during the 1990s and stabilizing in the 2000s, the suicide rate for teens has risen again. Forty-six percent more 15- to 19-year-olds committed suicide in 2015 than in 2007, and two and a half times more 12- to 14-year-olds killed themselves (Twenge, 110). Between 2012 and 2015, depression among boys rose 21%, and depression among girls rose 50%. It is the paradox of iGen: an optimism and self-confidence online that covers a deep vulnerability, even depression, in real life, writes Twenge (102), going so far as to say, Its not an exaggeration to describe iGen as being on the brink of the worst mental-health crisis in decades. Much of this deterioration can be traced to their phones (source). Who is iGen? They are woke. They have ambient awareness. They appear confident online. They are never offline. Technology conveniently buffers and brokers their relationships. And technology feeds their loneliness and the toxic comparison that hollows meaning from their lives. Parents know most of this. They saw these problems long before we had books about iGen. "
93,vulnerability,NoFap,I came while attempting to retract my foreskin for the first time in nearly 20 years,1,alhear,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/alhear/i_came_while_attempting_to_retract_my_foreskin/,2019-01-31 07:58:06,"Its nearly 5am on my side now and Im extremely fatigue so I want to make this as short as possible so please pardon me for any phrasing here that may sound incoherent. I just discovered what a foreskin is 2 nights ago while browsing the internet. And when I looked into phimosis, turns out Ive a very extreme case of it to the point that my foreskin had NEVER retracted once in my entire life time, and that I never knew that such a thing existed on the male human body. For the whole of my life Id thought my foreskin was actually the primary layer of my penis. For the sake of understanding and context, it is important that I emphasise to make this clear: my foreskin IS extremely tight. So it occured to me about 45 mins ago that I have never actually seen my own real penis, that whatever I thought was my manhood was only the cover for it. So I sat down on my bed, whipped it out, and for the next aggravating 15 mins or so, tried hard to pull my foreskin back. While I had no success in the first 5-10 mins, I soon found that a better way was to roll my skin back instead. It worked better, but it was kinda painful and I only managed to get it down by about 5% of my penis? And when I saw the very tip of my real penis for the first time, I couldnt believe it. My own body suddenly felt foreign to me - it was like discovering another side to a close family member whom you thought you knew well, but it finally hits you that youve never ever had any encounter with their other side. Due to my tip having been covered and never having been exposed to the outside environment for the whole of my teen life, it was extremely sensitive to the point where I could feel the air around it and it gave off a sense of.. I dont know, vulnerability? My skin was already feeling sore and it was really starting to hurt, but stubborn me wanted to see the full thing, so I tried rolling it down further. And that was the last straw: I came instantly on the spot, and I made another shocking discovery: I wasnt attempting to masturbate but I shot a huge load that was WAY more than Ive ever had even on my horniest days, when I was on a 2 month streak of nofap. Turns out Ive been masturbating WRONGLY my entire teenage life and as a result, what I thought was my greater loads was only a fraction of what I just shot. Aa a result I made a (unexpected) mess of my room and I had to change my shorts and wipe up after myself. Right now my foreskin is still extremely tight and doesnt retract easily, and my penis is definitely not ready to be fully unwrapped. I have a bunch of mixed afterthoughts but the main thing that bugged me was, should I reset my counter? I hated myself immediately when this thought came into my mind, because I was on a 4-5 day streak (it aint much) but I wasnt trying to masturbate, only trying to do something that most males can but is apparently very foreign to my own body. I need to get to sleep soon for an early morning class later so Ill check back in again when I have the time. Thanks for reading. "

Tonight I was having **huge** trouble getting to sleep... the urge to fap is strong and unyielding. So I decided on a few steps... 1) Commit to myself that no matter how tough it gets, I won't be resorting to MB. 2) Start writing... ""What feelings/thoughts/truths am I trying to avoid by MBing?"" 3) Come to NoFap for support/inspiration. Part 2 was interesting... got quite a long list of honest truths... some of these are obviously 'made up' and just the stories I'm telling myself, but this is definitely the list for me to work on next... let's stop numbing, let's start taking action for my future self. Here's the list in the interest of vulnerability and honesty... \- I am wasting my life \- I have no courage \- I don't connect on an intimate level with myself or others \- I haven't earned a respectable income for 2-3 years \- I don't know what I'm doing with my life \- I deserve punishment for some unknown crime (maybe the crime of just 'being me') \- I am not able to give or receive love \- I am not honest with myself or others \- I am not good enough Like I said... I know most of these are false, but it's the truth that I'm feeling them (if that makes sense?). So this is my list to examine, to figure out what is truthful, what is helpful, and to find ways to let go of thoughts that are just plain false and do something about those that contain truth. Interestingly... just by opening up to myself like this, I already feel like a lot of anxiety and weight has lifted, and the urge to fap has reduced to almost nothing. I feel like I now have something to work with."
95,vulnerability,NoFap,Defeating the Shame - Tell People!,1,a77a1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/a77a1l/defeating_the_shame_tell_people/,2018-12-18 14:34:25,"I've had a PMO habit for around 30 years and been trying NoFap on and off for maybe 8 years. I'd talked to counsellors and coaches who weren't helpful at all. Last month, for the first time, I spoke with a real human who is close to me (my brother) and that has set off a chain of events. Yesterday I told a group of friends... we meet every month and hold each other accountable to live our best lives... I brought up this subject for the first time. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable but they were really accepting and supportive. And having told them, I told my wife about it all last night. She was a bit less supportive, finding it more funny than anything (although she seems to be ok with it... ""I thought that was just what all men did?"") The effect for me is that sooooo much of the shame has lifted. Shame makes things seem much worse than they are. Shame makes us shrink into ourselves instead of seeking help. Shame is toxic. But the good news is that shame is mostly an illusion. Last night I wrote the ""truths"" I was trying to avoid with PMO: 1) I am wasting my life 2) I have no courage 3) I don't connect on an intimate level with myself or others 4) I haven't earned a respectable income for 2-3 years 5) I don't know what I'm doing with my life 6) I deserve punishment for some unknown crime 7) I am not able to give or receive love 8) I am not honest with myself or others 9) I am not good enough Tonight I revisited those statements wrote my new feelings... they are so different already: 1) I AM good enough 2) I have courage (lots of it) 3) Intimate connection is easy - just step through fear 4) 2019 is my year. Time to DO, and time to earn 5) I was afraid to follow my true calling 6) I deserve no punishment for anything 7) I can give and receive abundant love 8) I have been brutally honest with myself and others over the last 24 hours 9) Vulnerability and courage shift shame 10) Say whatever you're most afraid to say This has helped me dig into a deeper level of my fears and insecurities... I *strongly* recommend shifting any shame you're feeling about PMO. It truly is an illusion. Step through the fear. Have courage."
96,vulnerability,NoFap,Motivational: Do not let the prospect of exploration let you give into temptation!,1,aazqkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aazqkb/motivational_do_not_let_the_prospect_of/,2018-12-31 07:58:47,"So I completed something that's been hanging for 2 weeks now. When I'm lazying on the bed, I'm recall the porn images out from impulse, I'm abstaining, sure, but that doesn't mean I'm still not a horny idiot. To counter more powerful images, I've turned to [shitty drawing](URL to counter the urge, and it's been actually quite effective, and in a weird way quite motivating. However today I went to look at the start of a story where things begin innocently enough and escalate dramatically into weird disfigurement of all kinds. That's just what I've escalated my consumption to over the years. But that's not even the real urge I'm talking about, but something much more insidiously innocent, something fundamental to our being as mammalian creatures: exploring the unknown. Meaning that I looked at the artist's patreon, and everything is properly blurred and censored behind a paywall, looked at their bio and found link with their relevant art. Now, I'd love to just blaze through all of it, because it's novel, it's new, and I'm deadly curious about it! Nobody has to know, it will only be a single night, I might just post a relapse confession here to fend off shame and guilt, reset my counter and start again, I'll still meet my 90 day goal, and I've made progress already. I wrote my assignment so I deserve some kind of reward as I am home without any prospective contact, unless you count my cousin, who's 11 years younger than me and has quite the character to her, on top of being almost as big as me! And besides, I won't be looking for a partner until I get rid of my university duties! Again, it's just for tonight and no more, my curiosity will be sated, I have the experience of abstaining effectively, draw and burn a few more pages, and done. I don't have to take it *that* seriously as it doesn't intrude on my real goal: having proper sex with a partner. And my view is that it's not for fun, so it won't be on the 3rd date either. So yeah, why not just do it, it's nothing serious and you have these conditions supporting your call to exploration. **WRONG!** If I let the impulse of my curiosity destroy my progress, then what was it all for? I'll have to make shitty drawings in secret again, and I would have gone back on my own word to my own conscience! Just because it's appealing to see something new and novel I've never seen before but well aware of its nature, on top of sexual relief as well. This isn't about porn or sexuality at this point, it is about *discipline*, it is about impulse control! I want to see it so badly because I've always be voraciously curious for all kinds of information, it takes a bit more for me to be disgusted and deterred rather than fascinated and questioning. And worse of all, that sense of discovery is *fulfilling* to me, like a lego brick clicking into place. This makes it an even more potent drug than the orgasm because it can be achieved much more frequently without physical exertion and it doesn't make you feel tired afterwards, but fulfilled, the *positive* aspect of the usually vicious, brutal conscience that screams out insecurities to you that make you act pathologically foolish to save the ""grace"" of your ego! What kind of man doesn't have the balls to brave that vulnerability confront and conquer it! Keep to your word, keep to the order you've established dammit! Yes, chaos is interesting, fascinating even to explore, but what will be the reward? Relieved curiousity? Orgasm? A brain blasted with 100s of new images which you'll have to draw to stop further urges and relapses? Was that not humiliating enough 3 times already? Is it that hard to abstain from a simple desire you exhibit but also rationally ignore all the time. But not in this case because you already did it? Because it's easy and convenient to do? And the resulting fallout is hardly as easy to deal with! So stake on your fucking word and abstain from looking you idiot! Because the point of abstaining is to cure your erectile dysfunction, to reboot your libido, to have a drive towards virility! Yes, you're taking it too seriously, but fucking hell does it establish the boundary of your conscience, that same conscience you've been neglecting for 6 years and are still a boi at 24 as a result! You know the bad consequences are not worth, even if the conditions allow for it! Your life is messed up as it is to waste time on reducing the Chaser effect fresh off relapse! So keep it in your fucking pants and keep your hand away from the stove too, BOI! Now, instead of doing that, I'll be going back to faffing around in NieR:Automata with 2B's skirt on because the frills are much more pleasant to me than her running bare ass. Also, I want to play another character ASAP!!!"

But the urge was coming back to me again and again. So i decided to relapse, yes you read it right. I decided to relapse but without porn and it was only like 2-3 minutes and woosh all of the urges gone and i thought about it, why in the first place I got that urge, then i realized that if you are even watching a kissing and cuddling scenes of a movie then you could get arouse, this is degree of yours mind's vulnerability when you are watching porn and maturbating all time. This is what porn do to your brain, it rewires your brain into thinking only about sex and lesser your confidence. So my only request to people who are taking this challenge seriously will be that don't watch any adult movie you can watch other stuff but while your mind is recovering from PMO then don't give your mind another reason to matsurbate. I still have to break my 108 days Streak of no fap and this time i am damn sure that i will. I have relapsed only 2 times this month, so i could also take this as an achievement but with caution. My total relapse so far in 2018: 23 And yes when i look back it does feels like an achievement. :)"

I find it easy to pretend that I am a robot instead of confronting my emotions. As a result, I am terrified of anything that forces me to confront my vulnerability be it NoFap, a person who can read me like a book, a kids innocence, certain kind of psychological movies. This fear again stems from Poor self esteem causes me to reject myself before anybody else could in order to Protect Myself, but it instead makes it worse. Besides, some of my friends are artists such as musicians, actors, writers and poets. Although I admire them but I am also terrified since its a part of their profession and personality to force their audience to confront their emotions owing to which they can connect (Yeah, sometimes Entertainment isnt the only purpose. I am not sure how to confront them. Any advices please?"

There was spoke posted a photo earlier here showing he is in the park listening to a song and being alone and I think everyone here can relate to it.

102,vulnerability,NoFap,This is what helped me to get to 70 days,1,9oombl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9oombl/this_is_what_helped_me_to_get_to_70_days/,2018-10-17 02:24:05,"You have to really know why you are making a decision to quit PMO and then you have to realize that all of the excuses you make to yourself is just your addicted brain trying to get it's fix of dopamine. WHEN YOU FEEL AN URGE DON'T FIGHT IT. EMBRACE IT. ENJOY THE FEELINGS OF THAT SEXUAL ENERGY AND FEEL IT CHANNEL UP YOUR BODY UNTIL IT INEVITABLY PASSES. DO NOT FIGHT THE URGE WATCH IT COME AND WATCH IT GO. And when the urges do pass that energy LITERALLY manifests into other forms of energy like creativity, confidence, goals, you name it. And when you do this every single time that you get an urge you get one step closer to your goal. But be careful not to relapse after you have reached your set goal. If you make a goal to not PMO for two weeks and you finally reach that goal decide to commit to another two weeks and continue that cycle so you don't make another excuse to yourself. When you go two weeks to a month without PMO you see the MASSIVE benefits it has on your well being and when you relapse it is really a wake up call. You will feel the anxiety and emotional/vulnerability in yourself, you will see your lack of confidence to go up and talk to people. You will feel the low energy that prevents you from doing what you really want to do and be who you really want to be. And that in itself should make you realize why it is never worth going back."

Waiting patiently for your fall. And that is what i am feeling right now. The surge in the urge, the vulnerability to the sight of beautiful girls, the temptations to indulge in sexual fantasies; all make me weak in my knees. To make matters worse, my colleagues kept discussing their erotic experiences and enticing my spirits of indulging in one myself. But i stood my ground. Stronger than i can believe, i warded it all off. One by one, with calmness and a smile. Took a deep breath, realised my priorities and goals. Consoled myself that being sexually active will not make my worries disappear. And held onto the thought that if it seems tempting, you gotta be wary of the consequences. Day 5- Not Out!"
104,vulnerability,NoFap,Deep into nofap but still have crazy urges? Read this.,1,9rftuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9rftuu/deep_into_nofap_but_still_have_crazy_urges_read/,2018-10-26 11:16:00,"Have you been on nofap for 30 days? 60 days? 90 days? And still feel the urges to masturbate and watch porn? Let me tell you something that you should know. First, for some credibility - I have been on nofap for 67 days and have zero urges to masturbate and watch porn, zero desires to relapse. No. I'm not gay I am attracted to women (even strongly now but not in an objectifying manner) If you feel urges for sexual activity, it's absolutely normal. We are meant to reproduce. Our bodies and brains are wired to put reproduction as a priority - to ensure a continuity of our species. So it's normal if you want to fuck woman but there are some things you have to reflect upon. 1. Are you taking fap as a guilty pleasure that you are holding back? If yes, then the urges will be strong. That's because you are restricting yourself &amp; telling yourself that you are staying away from something good. This is why you get urges deep into nofap. Change your mindset. Fapping isn't good for my self-discipline, motivation &amp; drive to achieve my goals. It's not positive. It is pleasurable in that short moment but it is ultimately destructive. I stay away from it because I don't want it. This shift in mindset will nearly eliminate the urges to return to fap. If you still think fap is BAD GENUINELY &amp; still wants to fap, it makes no fucking sense. Are you a masochist? 2. I want to fuck any women I see. Their breasts their butts, all of that calls out to me. I want to fuck so bad. Well, this is normal but I want you to think about this. Instead of thinking of woman that way, begin to think of them as feeling, dreaming &amp; thinking human beings. Each of them have their ambition, their passion, their joys &amp; their sorrows. instead of wanting to simply fuck, think about how you can talk to them, connect with them &amp; hang out with them. Our days of admiring woman's bodies from afar are long gone the moment u left fap behind. We won't just look at woman on screens anymore. It's time to take action - make friends with woman, talk to them, get to know them, ask them out &amp; connect with them. Sex is more than just creature reproduction. It's about emotional connection, vulnerability and being HUMAN. Don't just want to fuck for pleasure. Sex is even more amazing when you do it with someone you feel an emotional connection with. Begin to see things in a different light and it will change how you feel about things. If you need to cross a river everyday , don't swim across it every time. Instead, build a bridge. Work smart. Not hard. I wish you guys the very best. "
105,vulnerability,NoFap,Week 1 completed [Log for future self],3,9fcvg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9fcvg0/week_1_completed_log_for_future_self/,2018-09-13 09:31:16,"I don't care much for the daily log idea, but I figured a weekly log would be interesting to look back on, or perhaps alongside specific notable days. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Current state of frustration/libido: So far this time around, for the most part, it just feels like I'm living, which I think is helping significantly. When you're not thinking of nofap as some grand battle or struggle, instead just existing as per normal where you happen to not be masturbating, the tension is mostly lost so you think about masturbation significantly less. I have noticed that when I'm in my pajamas (Easily dick access), I'll go from scratching-&gt; grabbing on occasion, in which case I simply stop before it even starts to feel good. Then, just like a meditation, I go back to existing, knowing that I've chosen not to masturbate/view porn etc. My buddies in the midst of a divorce, so I acted as a general enabler for his escapism a couple nights ago. Part of which involved going to the strip club, I dislike that I opted to go along with that, but it was nice to discover that outside of a couple moves I was entirely in control of myself. Not acting like some crazy person obsessed with women. I do generally feel.. some kind of tension or energy more often lately. Maybe that's a tension from not masturbating, but generally, I choose to believe it's just a feeling of happiness/excitement/general confidence. Kind of a tie into the 'masculine energy' post I read on here a while back. I find my mindset- perhaps due to this 'nofap existence' frame of mind that I'm in- generally doesn't project about masturbating in the future. No recurring thoughts of how great it'll be when it ends, or even masturbating at the end. I do remind myself of the 90 days occasionally but normally I barely even think of an ending. Perhaps that's for the best. On the rare occasion, I do feel an urge/ large build up that's distracting me, I do pushups/sit ups/ shadow box etc. Imagining that I'm using the energy with each exercise. Seems to work to mute it a little bit. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- General self discipline/habits: I'm currently taking a cold shower every morning, again, just kind of relaxing into it and accepting that as a state of existence. Meditating semi-regularly, Though I should ensure that changes to continue towards daily meditation. (Using the app headspace, on Basics level 2.) semi-regularly doing mobWOD, which is good. I think it helps I'm not eating incredibly unhealthy foods, but I've certainly found myself eating more. I suspect I'm doing this because I'm focusing on doing well with a number of other areas, so I'm not wanting to stress over diet and exercise. For right now my bodyfat % is maintaining itself steadily, so until 21-30 days are reached I think I'll allow it. Doing NBack occasionally as well. I have no idea if it actually helps with fluid IQ or not, but hey. Might as well give it a shot. So far I'm up to 4. I watch 1 or several videos from 'the natural' or 'charisma on command' a day. I don't think either is perfectly right about how to interact with people, and I specifically find the concept of 'negging' pisses me off, but thinking about the kind of mindsets for myself that naturally result in these charismatic and/or attractive behaviours seems useful. I won't take them as truths, but it's interesting for an idea set. It should be interesting to see how I develop them into my own ideas about people, the world, and my place among them. Need to learn more about psych for socializing/attraction/arousal etc. and discover the arguments for and against evolutionary psych/bio. I also started using a timer to limit my access to sites I procrastinate on, to get more work done. So far it seems to be working. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Changes to make: I'm also currently not working out, using my knee and lack of knowledge as my primary excuses. Need to actually read the book on kinesiology/biomech. that I have and get in the gym. I'd like to/ should begin: Read about body language/make some new body language flash cards every day. Read some cognitive psych and or some philosophy every day. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Other notable changes: I generally find myself thinking about approaching women more often. It seems I have a desire to move toward that. I've finished my interview for volunteering. Desire to organize/ clean up my environment. I should stop drinking. Having a hard time with the idea though, current battle with myself is if I have it as a social crutch. Pretty sure I do and am scared to admit it/ don't want to stick out where I'm not drinking and everyone else is. Mindset is changing though, so I think I'll stop. Definitely some tension over it though. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mindset changes: No matter what happens, I'll be fine. Life may turn to shit, but based on that girl's reaction to my past life apparently, I should be an emotional wreck, yet I feel better than ever. It's all in the mind and the actions that reflect that. If it feels awkward because I'm going against the grain, percieved or real, love it. It means I'm acting for myself. If I'm worried about social rejection, then it's exactly the time to accept that and express myself. The main focus should be living by my character, make the decisions that make the man in the mirror respectable. I don't need to try to prove/qualify myself to others. Again, live by and for my character. Everyone is, first and foremost, just another person. Fundamentally we are all of value. I don't prove myself to others, or worry about being 'rejected' because no rejection is taking place. I offer a positive world where others can step into it, and from which point we can develop and explore a connection together. Sometimes people simply don't want to take part in that connection, and it's fine. I'll still keep existing as usual for the occasions that others do care to cross the bridge. I find I still feel stress over the concept of rejection- maybe because it's something so deeply instilled in us as people to worry about. But I think the less I worry about it, the more loved I'll become, specifically for who I am. Acting honestly in accordance to what feels right for me also means having the freedom of choice to lead within my social circles. By uptaking this responsibility obviously some consequences and work come with it, but so do a mass of benefits. Don't stay in the backseat, hoping for something and never saying it. Take control and let others enjoy when you do. Be honest when it's more fun, true to myself, or morally correct. If I'm ever thinking about how I want to get away with something, stop. Be honest about peoples positive perceptions of you too. You're just another human, and a pressure comes to live up to peoples positive ideas of you. I know for a fact I've chosen not to break those perceptions because it felt good in the past, but that isn't right, they apply pressure too. It's best to just be me, whether I expect the consequences to be negative or positive. Be comfortable with vulnerability and non judgmental of others. Thats how true connection can take place. Again, everyone is human. I'm sure there's more, but at this point I feel I've typed enough. Hope you've had fun looking back on this future self, or any others who've stumbled upon it. "

But going through this NOFAP journey, I'm slowly starting to face some ""dormant demons"" I never had the sensibility before to be aware of because any feeling of uneasiness or anxiety etc. that came up, I would numb it with PMO when it poked its head. Now that I don't have this crutch I'm realizing some things. I'm finding out that I lean very heavily towards dismissive/avoid-ant attachment were I simply didn't want to open to women with fear of rejection so to mask the natural human longing of affection and vulnerability i would suppress it with porn making the excuses ""I don't need a woman I am independent i don't need anyone"" ""I can get the satisfaction of sex myself online with naked women with PMO, I don't need a woman"" If i saw a girl i liked i would try to avoid being around her, or making sure i exhibited no emotions around her ( being avoidant to the possible negative stimuli that i perceive as showing feelings and being vulnerable) . I would then suppress this by watching porn later after the encounter. Therese are just some thoughts i would share with myself but fuck it, I had to release it. I know you don't ""NEED"" a person to feel a void. I'm just realizing this stuff as I get stronger each day without my crutches (porn). I'm continually improving the person I want to be so that I am ready when the time comes for someone special.

107,vulnerability,NoFap,Relapsed last night after the second time edging. How do I not allow this defeat to become a justification to binge or start drinking and smoking again? I just need some guidance.,1,9jo04v,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9jo04v/relapsed_last_night_after_the_second_time_edging/,2018-09-29 01:36:55,"Hey folks, This is a cross post from r/stop drinking. I've been sober from alcohol and weed since my birthday on Aug 20. That same day I'd also decided to quit looking at porn and masturbating. I dedicated myself to monk mode. This was another destructive addiction I'd been struggling with. I was going strong until a week ago I followed links I knew I shouldn't follow, and looked at images I shouldn't be, and I started edging. Thankfully I had the willpower to stop myself before finishing, and at that time I was proud of that accomplishment. But this was only the beginning of the end. Last night the same thing happened again and I stopped myself. In my anxiety riddled mind now I was worried whether that counted as a relapse or not. I read other people's similar stories and many did consider that a relapse. And just like that the switch was flipped (I realize now that I'd allowed it) and I said fuck it, the dopamine was already released, I might as well finish the job. And I am so sad I did. I feel fucking awful. Almost immediately felt nothing but regret and shame. And it's like this demon in me sees this vulnerability in my willpower and is now trying to claw me back in. I don't want to go back to that life. Even last night as I lay there, I kept saying to myself, you can't do this, you can't go back. You can't go back. I know this isn't r/stopdrinking or r/leaves, but addiction is still addiction, and I just need help staying sober and abstaining from PMO. I'd go to a meeting right now if I didn't have to work. The damage is already done, I'd already reset my badge. I just want to stay sober and not use that relapse as some flimsy justification. I was even considering abstaining from reddit and the Internet just to avoid triggers and the temptation. I feel as though I only have so much willpower left. When I gave in last night after fighting temptations, a war broke loose in my mind. I thought, you already broke the seal on one addiction, might as well break the others and then just quit them all at the same time again some day in October. How do you handle living in such uncertainty? How are you all so strong? How do you handle battling so many different addictions when one gives out, the others grow stronger? All I know is that I am sober right now and I want to stay that way. And it's back to day one of monk mode. But my mind has such a sinister way of turning onto itself and I'm afraid of just saying fuck it, and heading right back to using and binging. And I know I'd regret it so badly. This all or nothing, black and white mindstate I find myself in is the real villain. I know recovery is a process, and that my ideas of purity or strictness are not realistic. All we have is today. Sorry for the rambling. I'm just barely hanging in there."

Like in drug's addiction, when the most people is in a sort of social vulnerability or other kind of emotional problems and fragility became more sucetible to addiction, and in porn is the same. I do PMO since my 12 years (I'm 21 now), I've developed PE because of that, and recently I've notice other problems associated with it: I living far from my family, my college is in other city. There, far from friends and the lifestyle that I was used to, I get into a stressfull and rushed study/work routine and the PMO habbit get worse . I've found Nofap 7 mounths ago, when I was in a depression crisis, all day long just doing PMO and lying in bed without hope. Since that, I've became aware of my problem, I got 60 days clean without relapse, meeted a girl, make more exercises. But, some months ago, my mother get sick, my money start to run out, and so I fell back to a even more stressfull reality again. So, the only reliaf I've found in these chaos: PMO. So, I geted down in more extreme and grothesque types of porn, even thinking in all that hard work before, all those days of strugling, but I just thougth: ""I don't have time for a good life, is the only way to relief the pain and tension, it's easy and fast"". Not so easy, not so fast. I've already knew that, but the pain obscure the vision, the addiction blow our minds, but it start to consume ourselfs, and we became more and more far from the real problem: We're in a life that we dont want for, and the illusion that watch strange girls in a computer screen will make it better, NO WAY, IS JUST AVOID THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MAKE THE CHANGE. Is what I've been doing, hiding in a fragile shell of ""I can't do anything, just relief the pain"" but no, we are human beings , just look all things we builded, all art, science and technology. We have the power to make change, we just need get the life with our hands and choose the life we want. Is hard, but we need to realize: we were in pain when we fell in addiction, but with it just make everything worse. Sorry a so lengthy text and the bad english, I just felt that need share it with u guys and make a personal mark of my return to fapstronaut adventure. Lets build the life we want for. Day 01"

I never thought that I would be so unable to love her in a fundamentally important way, to the point that we cannot talk about it. I cannot talk about it. Because I have reached the lowest point in my recovery. It feels like rock bottom, my rock bottom. At the bottom, I cannot see the light that is my girlfriend. I cannot notice her subtle hints at needing intimacy. I've spent so much time in the dark that I am blinded by her beauty and love for me. She dresses a certain way FOR ME, she presents herself a certain way FOR ME, and the only thing I can say is WHY ME? WHY was I chosen? WHY does she want me? How does she want me? Does she really want me? Does she want the real me? The real me who hides away my sexual urges, who hides in the dark so my pain is invisible, so that my vulnerability cannot be exposed? I think I know who wants me. The naked girl on the internet tells me she wants me. She's not subtle. She's doesn't want romance. She doesn't make me work toward an intimate relationship built on trust and hardworking patience, love, honesty. She doesn't want me, really. But I'm stuck staring at her whenever I feel alone, whenever I feel anxious, whenever I feel frustrated, stressed, maybe even depressed. I've restarted my recovery counter so many times that I just stopped caring because it didn't matter. I know the counter doesn't really matter, not like that, but it's a form of evidence I can hang on to when life gets hard. It's the minimum. I'm tired of the minimum, but it's all I've been able to give myself. Why can't I give myself more? I've gone to therapy. I've tired processing the deeply rooted memories tied to my addiction. I've made little progress. My therapist tells me my progress may not always look like progress. I've told others that progress may not always look like progress, but I still cannot see it for myself. I'm risking the realness and quality of my relationship with my significant other. I'm risking the realness and quality of my relationship with myself. Why can't I love myself so that I can love others as equally as they can love me? Why am I so afraid of living? Why am I so afraid of failing? Of falling off the wagon? Of getting bruised and feeling genuine relationship? I'm so stuck, so crippled by grief. I need help, but I don't feel like I can leave this whole. At least here I can lay down. At least here I cannot get burned. It's cold down here. Hello /r/nofap, This is something I wrote earlier today in a moment where I felt I needed to express myself honestly. It's written partly to be spoken word, partly a way to just share what I'm going through right now. My girlfriend knows about my history with porn, but she thinks it's no longer an issue for me. I relapse couple of years ago and have not been able to be honest about my recovery since. I was going to therapy until recently. I feel so stuck. I feel so ashamed. I wrote this post to try to get some empathetic feedback, some support. I appreciate your reading this. I appreciate any comments you leave. I want to come clean. I'm afraid of the consequences, but I'm working toward it. Sincerely, Me"

113,vulnerability,NoFap,"Smoking study: ""Surprisingly, the alterations in dopamine synthesis capacity normalized through abstinence."" Also the first three months (90 days) the patients were the most vulnerable",13,8yz6im,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/8yz6im/smoking_study_surprisingly_the_alterations_in/,2018-07-15 14:22:26,"Any thoughts about comparing smoking addiction dopamine levels with porn addiction? Recovery of dopamine function emerges with recovery from smoking Date: July 28, 2016 Source: Elsevier Summary: A new study reports that smoking-related deficits in brain dopamine, a chemical implicated in reward and addiction, return to normal three months after quitting. The normalization of dopamine systems suggests smoking-related deficits are a consequence of chronic smoking, rather than a risk factor. These findings raise the possibility that treatments might be developed that normalize the dopamine system in smokers. According to first author Dr. Lena Rademacher, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Lbeck in Germany, a major challenge in understanding substance-related disorders lies in uncovering why only some individuals become addicted. Researchers think some people could possess a trait that predisposes them to addiction, and suspect that brain circuits involving dopamine may be involved. Drugs of abuse release dopamine, and addiction to nicotine is associated with abnormalities in the dopamine system. But researchers are uncertain if smoking induces those abnormalities or if they already exist and contribute to risk of nicotine addiction. Senior author Dr. Ingo Vernaleken, Professor at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, led a team of researchers examining dopamine function in chronic smokers before and after long-term cessation. The researchers used a brain imaging technique called positron emission tomography to measure an index of the capacity for dopamine production in 30 men who were nicotine-dependent smokers and 15 nonsmokers. After performing an initial scan on all participants, 15 smokers who successfully quit were scanned again after three months of abstinence from smoking and nicotine replacement. The initial scan revealed a 15-20% reduction in the capacity for dopamine production in smokers compared with nonsmokers. The researchers expected this impairment to persist even after quitting, which would suggest it could be a marker of vulnerability for nicotine addiction. ""Surprisingly, the alterations in dopamine synthesis capacity normalized through abstinence,"" said Rademacher. The role of dopamine in vulnerability toward nicotine addiction cannot be excluded, but the findings suggest that altered dopamine function of smokers is a consequence of nicotine consumption rather than the cause. Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry, noted the implications of these findings for developing better ways to help smokers trying to quit. ""This study suggests that the first three months after one stops smoking may be a particularly vulnerable time for relapse, in part, because of persisting dopamine deficits. This observation raises the possibility that one might target these deficits with new treatments."""

At least it feels like it. I've been playing video games almost daily since 1998. I smoked cigarettes for 14 years, I have now quit for the last 2 weeks. I realized today that I fap maybe 3 times a day. I deal with rejection poorly. I have social anxiety, depression, a fear of success, and a loneliness that is just barely superseded by a fear of closeness/vulnerability. Any objective analysis of my life shouldn't reveal that I have any of those. I used to [do this](URL for fun, but I haven't been to the mountains in Months. I've been places, suffered hardships, and done things that are worth bragging about. But...I don't feel any self worth. I've spent the last year fun-employed, and I'm now trying to start my own business as a Home Inspector. My finances are dwindling FAST, due to some unexpected expenses these last couple of months. The hardest part of starting the business is that I need to ""sell myself"" and I suck at sales, but I used to be kick-ass at it. My first ever meeting with a realtor went fantastically, but the following two went so poorly it crippled my ability to go into a new meetings. They went baaaad. I've driven 30 minutes to Open Houses to meet realtors, sat in my car trying to psyche myself only to drive away from anxiety. Once I'm doing the technical work, I perform fantastically. Enough is enough. I've been reading for years about ""X, Y, and Z cause addiction"" and the negative effects of addiction. I can't do it anymore and I'm spending the rest of the afternoon figuring out the rules to this when I should be sitting outside of an Open House trying to psyche myself to go in. But, I smoked weed a few hours ago and now I'm terrified they'll know I did and that I am unprofessional. Did I mention that weed is legal where I live? I'm starting my reboot tomorrow, by waking up at 2am to go hike Longs Peak, the time I have been going to sleep the past few weeks. I'm worried I'm biting off more than I can chew...But, if I never try I'll never know. I'm going to cut myself off of each thing for a different period of time. Things that must go: - Fapping - I want to leave the possibility for spending time with a Lady open, but given the way things have been going it will be a PMO. **90 days** - Video Games - I'm going to uninstall them all. I can't cut out computer work all together. Hopefully if I use my computer it will be for legitimate projects I've wanted to work on. **90 days** - Social Media - I want to, but I'm not sure if it wise to lump this in with the rest. All of my real life friends coordinate via FB, and most of the special projects I want to do have tons of helpful information on Reddit and Youtube. Plus, my business requires a social media presence. **30 days** - Weed - The King motivation killer. **30 days** - Movies / TV - I don't remember the last time I was excited to watch something. I'm contemplating deleting my 15 year old, 3 TB large media cache. Which...has no porn in it. At all. I really don't want to though :/ **30 days** - Playing the victim - I don't want to do it, but I do. I must not. **60 years** - Smoking - I already quit. This is only on here for resolve, I guess. I won't be smoking again. Conventional medicine tells me I'm not through the honeymoon period yet. I still won't be smoking again. **60 years** - Uncleanliness - Calling my place filthy would be a stretch. Clothes litter my floor, Coke cans and weed ash litter my desk. The rest is presentable to company at any time. Speaking of... - Concentrated Sugars - I love Coke, Kit-Kats, cookies....you name it. I eat like shit. It is not only cheaper, it tastes better. $6 for a pound of salmon and some rice+veggies, ooooor an energy drink and a kit-kat for $6.50 That's all I can really think of. I wanted to write it down. Type it out I guess this is. Maybe I should write it down. I start my #NoFap now, but I'm jumping in the deep end tomorrow. On that note if anyone lives in Colorado and wants to wake up when the bars close, climb a 14er, and race a thunderstorm back to the car shoot me a message. It isn't as dangerous as it sounds, and is guaranteed to be an exhilarating experience. It is the standard mountain experience in July."

I can go over useless jargon about how I'm a victim, collect my pity, and throw out a glib promise of a better future, and have the same thing happen again. Evaluation is imperative. I'm going to quote South Park for a second, as this quote is a great reflection tool; ""If you constantly make yourself the victim, you can justify being awful."" After every relapse, I wanted to believe that I was struggling in the fight against my mind, seemingly triumphant. That's not the case. Falling a victim isn't the problem, it's believing the omnipresence of a spurious vulnerability. So many idiosyncrasies we try to plead can justify our actions. It's NOT true. The black and white text you witness may have lost its reliability, yet in these sentences hold such invigorating sentiments. One which holds the light to a mind curious in all evils and tribulations. My minutes of euphoria proliferate a lifetime of agony. I've promised to make this a big deal, and in doing so, I subconsciously told my mind that something was being stripped out of my life, and now I realize that I've taken the wrong approach. My longest streak was maintained by a simple conscious commitment to come back every day able to reply, and I'm reverting back to the efficacious promise. I'm coming back tomorrow, and all the way until 90. I'm not a victim, I don't want pity. I'm coming in a cognizant person. Sentience will see me through the tribulations, and will see me to the end. Never expect to see another relapse post from me ever again. A cease of these lugubrious pleas is all I can ascertain."

I feel like I need to take massive action to change my life. 2.) I made a relapse recovery program for myself. 3.) I've started approaching girls everyday to overcome my fear of vulnerability and to start learning how to express myself sexually in a healthy way. Late on this post, but I have a good reason for it -- I spontaneously decided to go see an EDM artist I like with a couple good friends last night at a club, which was fun and great decision. Anyway, lets get into it. If you only read one thing in this post, I would say read the Relapse Prevention Program. Post Format: 1.) Feelings and thoughts from the last two days day. 2.) Relapse Prevention Program 3.) 100 Women in 50 Days First off, I felt pretty emotionally charged today. Ive been really leaning into and exploring this idea that came to me -- that Im a hypocrite. I have accumulated so much knowledge about how to lead a healthy and happy life, but I havent done anything with it. I havent acted, or at least not totally. When the opportunity arises, I will gladly regurgitate words from a stockpile of other peoples ideas and realizations about how to alleviate your suffering, overcome bad habits, and lead the life you want that I accumulated over the years I have spent listening to and reading this stuff. So few of these ideas or realizations feel like my own, however; they are not based in my direct experience, and the words were not formulated by me. Speaking of regurgitating other peoples ideas, I listened to Jordan Peterson talk about how Nietzsche described the kind of people who do this as Mirror People, or something along those lines. Mirror People reflect everything that comes into them, but produce no light of their own -- no original thought or expression. As a result, these are the exact people who mistake the menu for the meal, and the map for the territory. They are voyeurs, watching life go by without every jumping into the dance themselves. They also are not people who have led an authentic life and have original ideas, they are people with a commentary on other peoples lives who are owned by ideas. Thats precisely how I feel currently -- Robin Williams might as well have been giving that famous Good Will Hunting speech directly to my soul. Having explored, at least a little bit, how this idea of being a Mirror Person applies to my life experience, I feel this build up of energy, like I know that I should act and at least try -- even if I fail miserably, make A LOT of mistakes, embarrass myself, and probably cause some damage unintentionally -- to sort my life out and start living how I honestly feel I should live, but I really feel nervous and afraid. Im afraid of being vulnerable. Im afraid of being alone, and having my loneliness be made worse by acting and making the inevitable stupid mistakes that I will make. Battling with my fear, however, is my desperation to change the way I relate to my experience of life. Something in me does not want to live in fear and anxiety any more, it wants to act with honesty, bravery, and vulnerability. It wants to be bold, and laugh, and play, and love openly. It wants to relieve me of the tragedy that is a life lived too seriously. Kind of ironically, I seriously want to give everything to this thing in me that wants me to live like this. And thats what Im starting to try to do now. Secondly, I'm developing a relapse prevention program that I'm pretty excited to share with you guys and see what you think. I'll be posting that in the next few days. Thirdly, 100 Women in 50 Days is a challenge I'm putting myself through inspired by /r/seduction where I have to approach two girls every day, at minimum, for 50 days. This challenge is about learning to overcome a fear of vulnerability and the anxiety and excuses that come with it, as well as learning how to express my sexual intent comfortably and in a healthy way. I should say, I've approached girls a handful of times in my life, but very few. Approaching is terrifying to me, and its certainly not something I feel I'm skilled at in any way. Today was day 2 of this challenge, and the following are the first 4 women from the first 2 days: Woman #1: Oxana I do Capoeira, and I went to a class Thursday afternoon where there was a stunning new girl. I took initiative and went and asked her what her name was, introduced myself, then asked about her history with capoeira and what brought her here. We had a short but good conversation. Honestly, it was a pretty comfortable format where that sort of thing is expected, but it still felt good to take some initiative before anyone else and go talk to her. Woman #2: Random Girl at a Club Like I said, I went to an EDM show last night, and after getting on the dance floor I noticed a girl looking at me every few seconds. It was hard to tell if she was super attractive or not because of the light, and I started to get hesitant and nervous. After a few minutes of dancing around, she looked over again and had pretty open body language, so I moved closer and tried to say ""Hey, you and your friends look fun! What's your name?"" But as soon as I leaned over, she leaned in to and asked me if we (me and my friends) were all okay. I was pretty confused, since me and my friends were totally sober and were just dancing around pretty normally, so I asked her ""Huh?"" and she repeated herself. I just said yeah, then left the interaction because her body language and the way she was talking were giving me a weird feeling. Woman #3: Unknown This is my first clear expression of sexual interest with an approach, and I feel pretty pumped about it. I was on campus at m university today when I saw a cute girl working with a project group at a table. I had to go meet some friends for a movie, so I though I would approach her on the way out. My heart started pounding and I actually started sweating because I was so nervous. I didn't really feel like it was the format to start an in-depth conversation considering she was in the middle of a group of girls and was working (and I was nervous as hell), so I wrote my number on a piece of paper, walked over and said: Me: ""Excuse me. I know this is super random, but I thought you were really cute and I wanted to come say hi!"" Her: ""Thanks!"" A little surprised, but smiling. Me: ""Yeah, well I'm in a bit of hurry to go meet some people, but here's my number -- if you wanna go get coffee or something sometime, shoot me a text."" Her: *laughs* ""Uhm, yeah. Okay!"" Me: ""See ya."" I know this wasn't a great way to do things, but I'm super glad that I did anything at all. Woman #4: Shannon Committed to this challenge as I am, and only having approached one girl today, I went out to a local outdoor mall in the evening. This was a huge struggle for me -- even though its a great place to meet someone and there's loads of cute girls, most of them are in groups so the approach becomes very intimidating. I walked around for a while, went to a bookstore where I saw a really cute girl I should have approached but didn't, then walked around some more. I ended up going into a shop where a pretty cute girl was working. I said hi to her as I walked in, then proceeded to look around, but I knew I needed to approach. I took some time looking around, probably too much time, and then finally worked up the nerve to go talk to her. She was talking with one of her co-workers as they were putting clothes away, so I interrupted: Me: ""Excuse me."" Her: *didn't hear/see me"" Me: ""Excuse me"" a little louder Her: ""Hi!"" Me: ""I don't mean to interrupt, and I know this super random, but I thought you were really cute and wanted to come say hi before I left."" Her: *laughing/smiling* ""Oh, thanks!"" Me: ""What's your name?"" Her: ""Shannon."" Me: ""Hi, Shannon. Nice to meet you, I'm Nate."" We shake hands. Me: ""Are you in classes over the summer?"" Her: ""No, I'm not, just working!"" Me: ""Gotcha. Do you go to [local university]?"" Her: ""Yeah, I do. I just finished my sophomore year."" Me: ""Oh, very nice!"" Her: ""What about you?"" Me: ""I just finished my senior year, but I'm sticking around for a Master's."" Her: ""Oh, that's cool!"" Me: ""Yeah! Well hey, I gotta go meet some people so I'm kind of in a hurry, but could I grab you phone number and we can go grab coffee sometime?"" Her: ""Oh! Yeah, sure!"" Got her number Me: ""Cool, well it was amazing to meet you Shannon."" Her: ""You too!"" Me: ""See ya!"" First, I'm happy that I did anything at all because my heart was beating out of my chest and I was nervous as hell.

On NoFap, my brain does not have that 'safe space' to go to anymore, anytime I'm under stress(emotional or otherwise). Because of this, it searches for other emotions to latch on to. This vulnerability leads to so much chaos at times, it can get overwhelming. That said, when you move past that chaos and the mind settles down, it's the most incredible feeling ever!"

After an emotionally destructive and sexless relationship as well as a year of avoiding sex like the plague I've finally gotten to the point where I can expect an orgasm from sex. I had my first one about a month back but then was unable to successfully repeat the performance until last weekend. Since then I've Pmo'd thrice and masturbated to thoughts a few other times. A very low self control week for me- but thats ok I'm trying not to be hard on myself and will continue on my own nofap journey. I was actively working to fix this problem from march until now, Obviously adhering to nofap is the best bang for buck with this issue. It's not quite that simple as I was previously very horny but still suffered from ED. The best thing to do is nofap, but for me it didn't feel like i was doing anything so I began washing my p***s with a gentle facial scrub and moisturizing with a vit e cream to help soften the skin and break down callouses. I also ate raw garlic and drank pomegranate Juice on days when I knew I would be having sex for the nitric oxide which helps with blood circulation and therefore erections. And then focused on eating lots of sunflowers and foods high in b vitamins and micronutrients. This isn't nearly as helpful as not fapping but it helped me feel better when I relapsed as I could take action to help relieve my negative feelings. Knowing That I can orgasm enables me to stay more in the moment and give my partner more love and more of myself. I have a fuller understanding now of how porn is robbing me of meaningful connection not to mention how much more validating it is for my partner to have a whole sexual experience. I'm not lasting quite as long as before and sex with orgasm leads to more vulnerability and connection but that's ok :) To those of you still struggling I'd like you to know that its all a process. Self love, understanding, patience and perseverance are key. TLDR: I made it. SEx with orgasms feels much better for both parties, fosters more connection and reduces anxieties. Nofap is the way to go, moisturizing and cleansing scrubs help accelerate the process of increasing sensitivity. know when you are relapsing and reduce harm, aka no deathgrip and lots of lube. then take steps to relive guilt and get back on track. To those of you still struggling I'd like you to know that its all a process. Self love, understanding, patience and perseverance are key. people here are very supportive and have been a huge help."

I felt great. It went great. I really wanted to continue but at one point i lost focus and thought ""fuck it, i will do it."" It wont harm me. I kept telling myself if i'm only masturbating once without porn, it would be not problem. And i did. No porn, no fantasies, just physical sensation. It was freaking phenomenal. But, as a real addicted, the next day i said the same. Just only today without porn, just physical sensation. It felt great. This continued for 4 days and then i started fantasizing again about porn. I stopped and thought everything went ok again. But then, a week later i needed to watch porn. I fucking needed it! So i did. I was only for 1 minute because i felt sick inmediatly; but there was the DELTAFOSB. It's namely not only the dopamine that get's us addicted.. Not only dopamine. It's the accumulation of dopamine in combination with deltafosB. That's the fucked-up part of addiction. If it would only be dopamine; it would not be that big of a problem because you wont get addicted. I quote ""Addiction neurobiologists have revealed that *all* addictions, both chemical and behavioral, appear to share a key molecular switch. Obviously, mileage varies, but in plain English (with more detail later), here's how this works: * You overconsume fatty/sugary foods, drugs or *high levels of sexual activity* causing [dopamine to surge](URL * Chronic overconsumption, and associated dopamine spikes, cause [FosB ](URL accumulate gradually in key areas of your brain. (FosB is a [transcription factor](URL i.e., a protein that binds to your genes and turns them on or off.) * FosB then hangs around for a while, altering [your genes' responses](URL bringing on measurable, physical brain changes. These begin with [*sensitization*](URL i.e., hyper-reactivity of the brain's reward circuitrybut only in response to the specific cues it associates with the developing addiction. * All of the brain changes initiated by FosB tend to keep you overconsuming or, in the case of Internet porn, riveted to what your brain perceives as a Fertilization Fest. According to researcher [Eric Nestler](URL &gt;*\[FosB is\] almost like a* [*molecular switch.*](URL *... Once it's flipped on, it stays on for a while and doesn't go away easily. This phenomenon is observed in response to chronic administration of virtually any drug of abuse. It is also observed after high levels of consumption of* [*natural rewards*](URL *(*[*exercise*](URL [*sucrose*](URL [*high fat diet*](URL [*sex*](URL Some research suggests that it takes 6 to 8 weeks of abstinence for DeltaFosB to decline.There's much still to learn. Even though DeltaFosB is no longer present, the sensitized pathways remain, perhaps for a lifetime. Remember, the purpose of DeltaFosB is to promote the rewiring of the brain, so that you will experience a bigger blast from whatever you have been overconsuming. This memory, or deeply ingrained learning, lingers long after the event. Addiction isn't damage - it's [pathological learning](URL The point is that everyone has DeltaFosB, and if it accumulates due to chronic overconsumption any of us can end up with the brain changes that lead to compulsion and cravings to use. In fact, the drive to overconsume when enticements are around is found throughout the animal kingdom. Animal nutritionist Mark Edwards points out, Were all hard-wired to consume resources in excess of daily requirements. I cant think of a species that doesnt. [Tamarin monkeys](URL have been seen to eat so many berries at a time that their intestines are overwhelmed and they soon excrete the whole fruits they are gobbling. So it is that the enticements in our environment play a large role in whether we overconsume, and today's free, ever novel Internet erotica is particularly enticingespecially for adolescents. Interestingly, FosB research also suggests why addiction is a greater risk for them than adults. According to [Nestler](URL &gt;*Adolescent animals show much greater induction of FosB compared with older animals, consistent with their greater vulnerability for addiction.""* Please, dont let porn/addiction fool you. And, foremost, don not fool yourself. Addiction wont stop if you are sober for just about 123 days. I managed to stop for 123 days, but the addiction was just slightly under the surface and showed up just at the point where i thought ""i'm healed."""

A\- When you use it to numb pain, likewise gaming can become just as much of an issue\(not quite but you get the point\) Masturbation is an old age habit so it cannot be bad in itself \(proven empirically by science\) Porn on the other hand I believe to be bad but that is not the discussion here it CAN be bad just like gaming depending on your relationship with it. It can be very destructive if introduced to a child/young adult without proper education on what it is. Anyway I digress. If you find porn is an issue in your life, assess any other forms of addiction/numbing and begin to strip those things away so for me I stopped porn but kept masturbating, I still game but stop when I no longer enjoy it etc Soon you will realise you need to face your issues head on. For me it was lack of connection, shame around sex and my identity as a male sexual being. Social anxiety blab la bla point is. If you need help, no porn is a good place to start but that might just be the beginning. A therapist will do you a world of good Also remember sex is not a need but a drive for humans to connect emotionally. Connection might be what your lacking your life. I recommend for some help listen to; Brene brown \(vulnerability, shame on audible\) Last note on self help, ive wasted years searching the internet for help for my coniditions \(nofap, anxiety, porn, self esteem\) if your not improving.

Any individual is mortal, flesh and blood, therefore can have a vulnerability for porn. I don't care what genre you watch, the only core truth is your sexuality in it's purest manifestation is a desire to reproduce with someone you love and respect. That's why porn is such an epic distraction - any aspect of porn or it's genres a porn lover could highlight is such bullshit rationale for keeping it up - usually it's a fear tactic. Most porn genres capitalize on your greatest fear. Love is about fighting despite your fears. Therefore your purest sexuality is having sex - ""me, my life, genes, are worthy of being passed on. I am a good person, I am worthy of love"". For some of us it will take time to reach a healthy point, but that's okay - just remember, no amount of disturbance or interruptions to your life can change your core. Obviously the main goal is freedom from porn, self-negation and other things, but don't let it rest on body/brain chemistry. Obviously those things are key to the time when you meet *that* partner, but spiritually, you need to set yourself right. Do you love life? Do you want humanity to prosper? Will you fight for those you love? If you can answer yes to those questions, you will beat the addiction."

There are women with whom something may happen and I'm not feeling the need to prove anything to myself. I know how I'd spit game, text them, set up a date and make that happen but I feel no urgency. I'm less inhibited when we talk. It's letting me get to know them better, build attraction and stay focused on my own things. They're farther from the objects of desire and conquest they might have been and closer to being objects of affection. Anyway I've been feeling a bit out of sync with some of the posts on here - I'm not viewing it as a stoic, strong act of undeterred manliness to quit, but rather one of self compassion: I have been feeling better on a day-to-day basis. I've been finding the process has, if anything, made me more comfortable with my vulnerability, more open and loving.

In many, I also see lust. Why commit to love someone emotionally if you can just use them physically? Fear, pride, and lust are the root of many problems that crop up in relationships. None of these drivers aim at love. Fear closes off and withdraws, but love opens up and gives freely. Pride will not tolerate the risk of exposing ones self to another, but love risks vulnerability for the sake of the other person. Lust tells the other person you only want the parts you can use, but love embraces the whole personon his or her best days and worst."

Go read it now, even if you've already read it URL It's actually really reassuring. I found the resetting bit the most interesting. (resetting is failing your conditions you are abstaining from for all those that didn't know that. Relapsing is actually slipping back into your old habits) ""Resetting a challenge is not the same as being a failure. In fact, there are several important virtues that are reinforced when you reset. One virtue is honesty. Each time you admit to yourself and the other members of the community that you need to reset, you show a commendable level of honesty. Being dishonest, by failing to reset your counter or otherwise misrepresenting your progress, will do nothing but hurt yourself. Another virtue is wisdom. Resetting is an opportunity for a rebooter to find their weak spots by examining what behaviors immediately led to the reset. Once these weak spots are understood, the rebooter can fix the leak, so to speak, to prevent the same thing from happening again in the future. For example, after resetting you look at what led up to your slip and realize you were browsing the Internet on your phone in bed before heading to sleep when you stumbled on some sexy pictures, which triggered your urges. Taking this knowledge, you decide to leave your phone in another room when you go to bed. Youll develop vulnerability and compassion when youve faced the pain of having to reset. By opening up and sharing your flaws with others, you learn that its okay to be vulnerable. And the next time someone opens up to you about their failure, you now have an increased capacity for compassion. Perhaps the greatest lesson you can learn from resetting is tenacity. Each time you reset your count, its an opportunity to get up and try again. Success doesnt come to people who never stumble; success comes to people who learn how to get up again. When you reset, the most important things you can do are share with the community that you have stumbled, and try again."""

This doesn't have to be the last time - although, I hope it is for you. It is exactly this mentality that stands between you and freedom, generally speaking. Success is a process ; a mode of Being. You are strong, I can sense that and you want greatly to be free from this addiction but you can't - can you? It seems you don't have as much control over your life as you would like - otherwise, just don't do it and your good! Fortunately for you and everyone on this journey here, you are past the point of denial and you acknowledge you have a certain resistance between your Will and your Actions. This is something my brain spat out yesterday, after many years of frustration. You will soon see this is not a small battle and that the over-arching conundrum is your resistance to discomfort and your inability to postpone immediate gratification in one or more of its manifestations. My hope in you reading this is taht someone, somewhere here starts believing in this radical idea that: What you do matters. It matters because this life, regardless of your philosophical position, touches you and those you love. If you are to be a great man, you must allow that which is disciplined within you to orient your direction in both action and ambition. This is the only logical position, otherwise how can you ensure proper growth of your mind, body and spirit? Change is inevitable; whether it is a degradation of the spirit or its rejuvenation is a decision dictated by your will and your will alone. Why choose a life of non-growth and banal suffering? One cannot happily adopt this with a sound mind when aware of the implications. But how to retain such awareness? After how many failed attempts does one finally relinquish the self-diagnosis of insanity? After how many days of redundant action, seemingly resistant to correction until one is finally mentally defeated, and loses faith in their own ability to change behaviour? These are good questions in that they increase the resolution on self-inquiry; a very useful tool if you are to become a great man - quite fundamental to the structural framework that will diffuse and transmute the chaos of your life and being. The last act in the play of self-deception is concluded on the proclamation of faith: Every attempt is progress; failure cannot exist, only progress. Under this logical structure success is forced into an eloquent design which can be characterised by the following definition: Success is a pre-ordained set of failures|attempts necessary to trigger a specified condition. Under this frame work the recursive and self-defeating mantra is allowed the necessary mental atmosphere to evaporate. In other words, one cannot simultaneously agree with both of the following statements at the same time: Failure(s)|Attempt(s) always precede Success. and The event of a Failure|Attempt triggers(justifies) a sound sense of discouragement. Note: A life bound by the confines of paradoxical belief is often chaotic, as it should be expected. It also ensures that the probability of success occurring behaves asymptotically approaching 0. This requires an injunction of spirit i.e. an act of Faith. Oftentimes, such syntax creates a sense of cognitive dissonance. A good lantern in such a fog is the self-reminder that the widely-accepted deductive proposition as to the origins of the Universe, Life, and Consciousness was an event called the Big Bang. I can think of no greater act of Faith! The Scope here is much more refined, namely the human-spirit relationship as it pertains to human behaviour, namely negative habits. Negative habits here is to be taken as those actions that create resistance to a certain flow of intent not dissimilar to current through metal wire. This resistance creates an auxiliary reaction in the being of an individual as frustration, waste of potential, and other heated emotions not dissimilar to resistances's role in creating heat in a wire, often-times red-hot. Thus, one is left with two very distinct self-identifying positions, either: One believes in the paradoxical beliefs stated above and continues to do so, insanely. or One sees the self-defeating nature of such beliefs and understands, intellectually, that Faith is necessary to create that meaningful life any decent human spirit yearns for. Thus, one choses to resolve those realities of relapse as progress and thus create a trajectory that expedites the traversal of their pre-ordained set of failures. Otherwise, one is forced to exist between the crashing waves of despair and disappointment along the jagged edges of reality, forever insanely - albeit bravely - attempting to strong-will their way towards the great expanse of freedom vaguely visible in the distance. No other sentience in the Universe knows you like one can know themselves, nor will there ever be another being that understands your Being because none other can Feel your body, Intuit from your mind, Love from your Spirit and Grieve in the catacombs of your|our Soul. Knowing a Being so intimately is a responsibility not to be taken lightly. It foreshadows a necessary relationship with the Self; you must engage with yourself as you would another for any chance at manifesting the best Vision of your Character. This implies sympathy and humility when your being is at the feat of perceived defeat. This also implies creating the necessary environment for growth in the many other dimensions of life, not dissimilar to the intermingled and complex conditions necessary for a Rainforest to exist; a catalysing environment for growth and adaptation. The ability to control ones behaviour is but one of the many interpersonal negotiations between Self and Being. Given ones adaptation of Logic and Faith into their WorldView, other axioms inevitably manifest: Obtain Proper Nutrition - starting with the knowledge necessary to be able to make such distinctions. Proper Rest - ideally, in line with the cyclical nature of the Sun and Moon i.e. rise with the sun. Healthy Relationships - despite resistance, vulnerability in relationships is a necessary precondition for connection; connection and its derivatives is the utility. Strenuous Exercise - Strong Mind | Strong Body | Strong Character Journaling - A canvas upon which patterns can be deduced, weakness-in-belief magnified and exploited, offers stability when Chaos manifests. . . . Do Not Lie to Your Being - Self-deception is incredulous. Thus, the importance of a profound sense of responsibility is paramount. Note: When feeling overwhelmed oftentimes sympathy and understanding for the limitations of your Human ability is necessary. A reminder that a journey of a thousand steps is only ever manifest as one step to Being. You must keep yourself accountable but you are also the very person in need of assistance|Being must be made the Observer, Self the Actor and God the Director| You must have Faith that you can be trusted and that your success is inevitable. If one maintains these axioms the following chain-thought can manifest: Every attempt at Success of some goal must be preceded by Failure(s). Thus, Failures must be interpreted as Progress. Success is inevitable when proper conditions exist. These proper conditions are the byproduct of interrelations between phenomena experienced within and without Self. In order to maintain these conditions, Being must embody the most superior position in ones power hierarchy of decision. In order for Being to manifest in such a position in life, clarity of Mind is a fundamental pre-condition. In conjunction with Clarity of Mind, one must expand the dominion of their current understanding through learning. Learning grows Mind as Water grows a Rainforest, Exercise grows Body as Learning grows Mind. A strong Will is a necessary participant in the Journey of Self through Life if one yearns for a Heroic|Great Life. Having a strong Body and strong Mind create the pillars upon which a strong Will can manifest. Upon cultivation of such a Will, True utilisation is ideal. Truth is a mental construct of Mind, thus an eloquent structure of Truth requires eloquent thoughts. Eloquent thoughts arise from ones Shadow of Being, the same Shadow that Chaos arises from, but it is the clarity of Mind that disallows chaos to remain. You are the Devil and God simultaneously. You feed both like a Human feeds two loyal dogs: Shadow and Athena. Enlightenment can only manifest after Chaos has manifested. Chaos can only manifest after Enlightenment has been established. Questions about who established the manifestations and when the manifestation of establishments happened are recursive and yet more subtle ways to slow the adaptation of True Responsibility. True Responsibility is that which occurs when one has allowed his Being to direct his actions|non-actions. To do a thing is simply to not-do a thing. To relapse is to not listen. To not listen is to imply there is Being to listen to. There is no Reason to be serious with Life. There is great Wisdom in being sincere with Life. To be sincere with another is to be Truthful, To be sincere with Life is to be True to Being. Your actions matter, Thus your thoughts matter, Thus the conditions necessary for Clarity of Mind are essential. Stop P.M.O. Create connection. Continue to more profound objectives. ~ Would love to help in any way I can, best of luck. P.s. the Cold is True."

I need to get some things out of my head and into the world (or at least cyberspace). I've been building this rant for the same number of days as my counter states. My last relapse was incredibly insightful, let me fill in the details. To try and gain momentum, I was trying to make a habit of posting here every day. Just a simple ""I will not PMO today"" post, you know the ones. Anyways, I get a huge surge of support in one randomly and it filled my heart. I also get some DMs to my inbox. Most are beautiful messages of support and connection. One innoculous message however read ""Hey brother, I saw your post and it helped so I thought I would return the favor"" with a link pasted below. Now I should have known better, but that link was a porn gif. I spiraled. I hated that I let this troll influence me. I relapsed. I don't blame my relapse on the troll, it was my own weak will that caused the relapse. It was my fault. It still really irked me though. I thought of this person and their motives. Why would someone lurk a sub and take time out of their existence to only cause negativity? To only attempt to do harm? Maybe they were looking for a response, a rise, a reaction. If they are still lurking they are getting that reaction now. See it or not, here is my response: Well done. You got me. You preyed on my vulnerability and succeeded in hindering my progress a bit. You made me question the validity of this sub and the environment it is in. You got a response out of me, a rise, a reaction. Here it is. I'm genuinely curious of how it makes you feel. My guess would be powerful, influential, rouge, whatever. I hope it lasts. Well done. Thank you. You showed me something in your actions. You revealed a part of yourself that I share. The part that uses unhealthy means to obtain temporary comfort. A sense of fulfillment, power, and control. You identified through yourself and your actions the toxic part of myself that I am trying to change. Bless you. There is no doubt you are in pain. That you are suffering. I'm sorry for that, truly. We all suffer and we all deal with it differently. You choose to attack the vulnerable to feel powerful. I chose to watch porn to escape my turbulent reality. We are really not too different. I'm extending a hand to hold onto, an ear to listen, a heart to feel. I would be happily surprised if you accepted, but I know this won't be the case. You see the community here and perhaps cannot stand the sight of connection, of brotherhood/sisterhood/humanity. I don't know and probably never will. I'm still very new to this journey and am probably approaching this wrong. There is one thing I'm sure of though, that joining together is the only way we will ever have a chance to elevating ourselves as humans. You chose to isolate yourself further by trolling me. I chose to isolate myself further by watching porn. It's time to change that. NoFap is just one piece of the connection that needs to be mended for me to reconnect to the world and humanity. I wish the best for you, but wishing never changes anything. It's your choice. If you've read this far, thanks for hearing me out. I am grateful for the community here. Even if things slip through the cracks and can be toxic, even if we are just connecting over memes. I don't think I would have the mindset for change and improvement if it was not for this sense of community. Thank you."

For people who have avoided a false day counting recovery with some lifestyle adjustments, their Day Zero is literally a ticket out of the addiction. Why? How? The ticket out is to finally accept whats going on, and STOP comparing yourself to people without addiction, or people in denial about their addiction (for alcohol addictions, these people are known as dry drunks).

137,vulnerability,NoFap,Big change begins with small details. (Word count: 454),1,80ty7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/80ty7u/big_change_begins_with_small_details_word_count/,2018-02-28 17:35:56,"There are many little subconscious routines, or triggers, that continue to tempt us to watch porn - and getting rid of them is an important step to your success. For instance - when I started NoFap, I moved my tissue box and laptop outside of my room, to hopefully make a difference in my night-time routine. But what happened? I adapted. I started using a rag instead of tissues, I started using my phone to watch porn instead of my laptop. And the funny thing is, although it seems rather obvious what happened, I didn't realize my habit had merely evolved until I stopped yesterday and consciously thought about what is causing me to relapse at this point in my journey. Yes, the amount of porn I watched has decreased since removing the laptop/tissues out, but I've still been relapsing here and there, and those relapses became somewhat habitual in themselves (even if not on a daily basis) So I threw away my cum rag, hid the app I normally use to access porn on my phone, and moved my phone away from the bedside. These things do make a difference. If there are certain entities you're following on social media that post sensitive stuff - unfollow them, block them, do what you gotta do. There will be times the simplest posts can catch you off guard and play on your sexual vulnerability. Despite my efforts, my unconscious mind continues to adapt. Sometimes the dopamine will strike and all conscious awareness disappears - I get up and start walking to the bathroom to get toilet paper because I'm horny and want to watch porn (and know I will need something to clean up the mess I make). This is why, in addition to removing triggers, you need to create at least one monumental anchor. It could be a song, it could be a simple thought. Something that will snap you out of the ""I'm horny and NEED to relapse"" unconscious daze that usually screws us up. A cold shower appears to be a common anchor. Dropping and knocking out a few pushups is another. It all depends on you, it depends on what you think will be enough to keep you from relapsing. It can be difficult to find a good anchor, so this is something you should really meditate on. Here are some of mine: 1. Quote: ""Don't be what they made you"" - Wolverine's last words to his daughter in Logan. Society aims to make us sexually compulsive animals. Heed his words. 2. Thought: The power of semen in unparalleled: it buys energy, it boosts creativity, it CREATES LIFE - why waste that precious power by squandering it for pleasure? Pleasure comes to those with power; it's a matter of patience. Patience, patience, patience. 3. Thought: You need food to survive. You need sleep to survive. You need fitness to survive. You DO NOT need sex to survive. 4. Song: Major Lazer - Get Free (Andy C Remix) Song: Linkin Park - Breaking the Habit Keep on keeping on folks."

And it's chemical (most guys don't know about the chemical part). Fear and shame are like A and B....C is the next point in the sequence. That would be hating yourself. When a guy removes fear he doesn't have shame and doesn't hate himself. Of course you have to have faith and stay in the game to stop using porn. The CONNECTION he feels with other people by daring to put old crap into the light is beyond belief...he even cleans up old shame by connecting (shame loves secrecy), and there's even less fear, and thus less shame, and more connection. You spiral up, up, up and out of addiction. That's why relapse feels so BAD. You go back to shame and the A-B-C. Here's what most guys using porn DON'T KNOW. The vulnerability and transparency of being able to ACTUALLY SAY ""here's my phone I don't use porn"" takes you out of isolation and changes your chemical processing.

I'm not a planter so much as an awakener. If you've got the desire, then remember that you're already ahead of the game by wanting to take action. NOW: TAKE A RISK and keep going! I will probably never meet you, but I'm confident that you're definitely better than me at something. If I met you, I'd be astonished not if you did something special, but if you did something ordinary with special enthusiasm! You can't rely on shots of dopamine in the brain to replace the joy and fulfillment that comes with a job well done. Sure, you might say, chemically speaking those are the same thing. One of them doesn't last, though. One of them fades out, like the rush you get from porn or binging something. Both can be addictive; one is destructive. Whatever dark place you're in, try this: it helps to get all your ridiculous thoughts out on the table. Spit out everything that's on your mind, either in writing or verbally. Then reflect on it. Your thoughts are no longer just thoughts, and here's a feeling that you CAN trust: those thoughts are wrong. THOSE THOUGHTS are the only obstacle that matters. You won't even SEE real obstacles if you don't push those mental ones out of the way. Finally, when negative thoughts surround you, don't try to silence them. You and I know full well that it doesn't work. You can't just shut those thoughts up. Instead, take in as many POSITIVE THOUGHTS as you can, and offset the ratio of bad to good. If you've got 5 worries and 5 good things in your perspective, don't try to erase the 5 worries. Find some good things and blow it up to 5 worries and 10 good things, 5 worries and 20 good things, 5 worries and 100 good things. It doesn't matter how small or large these good things are; don't discount something's value based on how you think others would see it. IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU, IT'S IMPORTANT. You can do this; you probably don't feel like that's true, so prove your feelings wrong. I don't care WHO you are, random reader, I believe in you. Don't hesitate to find help; cheesy, but sometimes the hardest thing for me to do is to admit that I need help. THAT takes courage and humility. Put your ego on the line, and somebody will help you grow. THEN you'll be capable, you might meet a friend, AND you'll be able to help others. It takes vulnerability, which sucks and brings both pain and happiness but is SO worth it in the long run. If you've hung on till the end, remember that your fingers are tired but stronger than they were before. I'm praying for you, random reader, go get it! Nate"

I still had some and even felt a little better now that I don't shame myself for having failed. I now realize also why I failed so many times repeatedly off two or three week streaks. Filters do not control you. You control them. So I set the filter but then it made me think most of the time how to make it better or block more. That would be fine but then I would find vulnerabilities in the filters. The first thing I would do when I found a vulnerability was fail. Also looking at sexy pics or looking up twerk videos on YouTube wasn't helping me at all. Cold showers help but I am sick right now so I can't do them at the moment.

There is a great deal of useful information beyond what Ive listed here. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Cant Stop Talking by Susan Cain Introverted doesnt mean antisocial. It only means social interaction is draining instead of invigorating. Using the excuse Im Introverted to justify a poor social life is a weak-minded cop-out. Introverts and extroverts often bring a great set of unique perspectives to similar issues. The Game by Neil Strauss Dating is a skill like any other. Its vital to note however that superficial goals and superficial confidence yield superficial rewards. Neil Strauss looks down upon the man he was during this time, and a lot of the PUAs he hung with are still unfulfilled bottom feeders today. Rules of the Game by Neil Strauss Doing things outside of your comfort zone is a great way to build confidence, even if its superficial. 59 Seconds by Richard Wiseman Self help books generally promise too much and are usually ineffective at building real life changes. However, there are a lot of little things that can be done in 59 seconds or less (each day) that can bring about small positive changes. All backed by various psychological studies. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg There is a reason smoking and porn addiction are so hard to kick. They are backed by long-established habit loops. These loops feature a cue, action, and reward. A cue is the dopamine kick when you see something familiar that signifies a reward. (The incognito window always made my heart race). The action is the process that follows (consuming porn). The reward is the temporary boost in happiness. Its possible to hijack your own habit loops by replacing the action. For example, anytime you hit a strong urge for porn, do something else that yields a reward like exercise. Eventually, the cues that initially made you want to use porn will be the same ones that drive you to hit the gym. Be wary of replacing one bad habit with another. Six Pillars of Self Esteem by Nathaniel Branden Recognizing the underlying factors that make up self esteem is an effective first step to improving it. Writing daily entries in a particular format have been scientifically shown to instil psychological changes over time. Models: Attract Women Through Honesty by Mark Manson Learning from generic pickup artists is at best a short term solution to dating. For long term success, finding the right women comes down to vulnerability and neediness. Find a place where you are less invested in what people think of you, and dont be afraid to be vulnerable. Dont avoid polarizing people. Develop strong opinions and share them openly. Anyone who runs for the hills is clearly not someone good for you. Work to build a more active lifestyle. Dont be afraid to express your sexuality in a healthy way. In essence, whenever you see a pretty girl across the bar, dont think, I wonder if Im right for her. Instead ask, I wonder if shes right for me. The difference is a backbone. Most importantly, it takes practice. There will be a lot of failure, and theres no quick/easy fix."
144,vulnerability,NoFap,1 Year Review - The Ups and Downs,1,7rxdvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7rxdvs/1_year_review_the_ups_and_downs/,2018-01-21 23:15:06,"Hi there! The Christmas of 2016 I found this sub while back home on break from university. I can confidentely say it's changed my life. I'll try to cover the last year of my life in hope that some of you might find it useful to read :) **Backstory** As many of us on here, I've been watching porn since I was a teenager (13/14 maybe), I'm now 22. I was never really aware of how it impacted my life, and didn't consider myself addicted. In October/November of 2016 I tried to stop watching porn, but unsurprisingly I failed quickly. During the Christmas of 2016 I started getting a bit worried that I actually might be addicted and started looking around the web for tips, which eventually lead me here. I thought ""Fuck it, I'm going to try it. I'm for a bit so that will help me get going. Let's do this!"". That's how my journey started. My first streak lasted just a little over a month. Once back at university, I didn't really have the willpower to avoid old habbits as much as I did at home. School is always stressful, and looking back, I'm actually surprised I made it a month. Then I had a few weeks with a series of short streaks. I started feeling depressed at this point. That first month had opened me up to all the feeling I'd been surpressing with porn, and when going back to porn, still with those feelings right beneath my skin...yeah...I didn't feel all that well. I got really mad at myself and decided to go on a long streak. This time it lasted two months. Those months were some of the best and worst months of my life at that point. I was full of energy, my feelings were all over the place, school was very busy and I started self-harming (I'll come back to this later). When that streak ended (I think it all just became too much for me to handle), I again had short streak of 3 days, 1 week etc. all the way until the summer of 2017. That summer I spent working as an intern in my university town (not going home). Staying busy with work was a good thing for me, and I started working out again, even eating reasonably healthy. The weekends were the toughest though...two days of being mostly alone in my room. I relapsed a 3 times throughout the summer, so again I had streaks of 1-3 weeks. When university started with its fall semester, I felt confident - I felt that I knew what I had to do in order to stay in control. Long story short, I didn't. When starting the new semester, all the old habits came rushing back. I don't think I ever had a streak longer than 3 weeks. Some relapses were quite bad as well. It even got to the point were I actually went home early one day just to watch porn. Even though I could feel myself losing all that I'd faught for the the last 6-8 months, I just couldn't seem to break out of the viscous cycle. School was still demanding, and I just felt that I didn't have the energy to fight this battle at that time. I decided to stop resisting as much, and rather focus on school, as that was what was most important to me as exams were closing in. I remember looking back to the Christmas of 2016 and thinking ""Let's just get through this exam period, get home for Christmas and reset my brain and body. I was able to do it last Christmas, let's do it again now"". I got through exams, headed home and started a new streak. I lost that 3 days after getting home. That night I looked at myself in the mirror before heading to bed. My one plan had failed...what now??!! I went to bed somewhat unsure of what my next step would be. I felt lost, unmotivated...just kind of empty. When I woke the next day, I didn't think about porn, nor the next day, nor the day after that. I started spending more time with my family; my parents, grandparents and cousin. I started feeling that burst of energy and joy I had felt exactly one year prior. I honestly cannot explain what had happened, what had changed in me in those few days, but something was completely different. My mind felt free, uninhibited of the ideas porn had led it to believe. I almost didn't recognize myself - I didn't feel like my old self...I felt ""reborn"" (very dramatic, I know, but that's how it felt). **Feelings** Prior to NoFap, I was a very closed-off person. I didn't really express myself to others except those closest to me, and even those people got very limited insight. I hadn't cried since I was about 12 years old. Whenever I felt those feelings surfacing, I would just suppress them. To me, crying was a sign of weakness and vulnerability - I despised that. After starting NoFap this has changed drastically. I've yet to cry in front of anyone, but alone I've cried multiple times, be it from wathcing movies or TV-series, reading something, or just my own thoughts. I'm also way more open about myself to others. I don't mind sharing what I find hard or difficult, what makes me happy and laugh, what worries me or makes me stressed. In the beginning, these feelings scared me because I was still of the mindset that it was a weakness to have such feelings. I also didn't know how to deal with them without porn. Porn had been my therapist for years, and being alone was scary. With time, it got easier, but I'm still getting used to these feelings being apart of the daily me. I wonder if they'll ever feel like a natural part of me, but I suppose only time will tell. To me, the most important thing is to let them surface and to let them be apart of me, even if it feels a bit weird at times. **Self-harm** *(some fight find this disturbing)* As I mentioned in the previous section, I found it very difficult to deal with my new feelings. I don't remember exactly the first time I cut myself, so I'll just write here what I wrote in my journal: ""Not everything is sunshine and rainbows though; for the first time in my life I harmed myself purely for the purpose of causing myself pain. I mean, I've thought about suicide before, but those were just thoughts. But back to the self-harming; I distinctly remember looking at the switchblade for about 10 mintues before picking it up . It is a truly surreal feeling...cutting yourself. I was scared, I'm not going to deny that. What I almost find funny is that for years I've been afraid of knives, and now I've used one on myself...ironic right...? Anyway, I remember feeling the blade almost caressing my sking before actually going through. I tried going both fast and slow; fast was scarier and therefore less effective. I didn't really bleed, it as more like a deep paper cut. At some point I stopped, looked at my left arm, freaked out and almost threw the switchblade at my keyboard laying on the desk in front of me. Then I sunk together and started crying. Yet, I did it the two following nights as well."" It's now been months since I last harmed myself, and I don't see it happening in the future. **Women** *(I'm a heterosexual male)* In the beginning I did this because I thought it would help me get into a relationship, which was something I wanted. For some this might be the motivation they need to stick with this; for me it wasn't. Now, although I wouldn't mind finding a girlfriend, it's not my main goal anymore. I now feel that I owe it to myself to do this. Maybe I find a girlfriend in my life at some point, and maybe I don't, but that shouldn't have an effect on how I choose to live my life. I'm doing this for me because I want to become a better version of myself - I deserve the quality of life that this journey has given me. Now, let's not kid ourselves though...there's no denying that my relationship with the women I know and the ""relationships"" with women I don't know has gotten better. Eye contact, smiling, being able to chat about random stuff without thinking about sex, etc. I always considered myself to be a person that treated everyone the same, no matter the gender. I think for the most part I was able to do this, but looking back now, porn cluttered my view of women and men, and their interactions with each other a lot. I do however think it's important to acknowledge and accept our primal urges. I think that being able to do this is a big part of what has helped me lately. I'm not trying to suppress my desires exactly, it's more that I've learned how to deal with them without letting them take over my mind and body. My desires aren't me, just apart of me. Personally, I'm not trying to become a monk - I just want to live a happy and enjoyable life, doing the things I love and being around those I love. **End** Wow, this became more than I expected! If some things doesn't make sense, or are a bit rough around the edges, I'm sorry. I wrote all this in one go, not really editing, as I feel I want to share the most genuine version of my last year with you all. What I want to finish with is that this is MY journey so far. I've had my ups, and I've had my downs. Currently I'm very optimistic about the future, as my current state does not resemble any state I've ever been in before. What I've talked about are MY experiences. What I did were MY decisions. Where I'm at in my life right now is because of ME (for both good and bad). YOU don't need to go through what I went through, YOU don't need to make the decisions I made, YOU don't need my motivations to motivate yourself. YOU need your own motivations, your own goal, your own decisions, your own struggles, your own ups and downs, your own feelings, your own way of dealing with yourself. This is why I don't want you to look at what I've told you a recipe of any sort. It's not a story trying to tell you how to get through this, because I'm still going through it myself. I'm not better than you, nor worse; I'm just me, and you are yourself, each on our own journeys. I wish you the best of luck, and that 2018 can give you something 2017 didn't! **PS.** 1) if I'm aloud to give one advice though, it'd be to buy a small book and write in it whenever you feel the need to express your feelings to someone :) 2) I have reddit blocked on my router, so I won't respond quickly to any comments, but I'll try when I'm at university tomorrow :)"
145,vulnerability,NoFap,The Truth: Quick Perspective from a 22 year old who has not watched porn in over a year and a half.,40,7lj66g,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7lj66g/the_truth_quick_perspective_from_a_22_year_old/,2017-12-23 05:13:50,"I've been on NoFap for a while. Have not posted though. Reading content here, as well as the book Your Brain on Porn, helped me understand and eliminate my relationship with porn. I've come to an important realization. It's not just about eliminating porn. You'll see what I mean. While it helps - and it does, so so much - it doesn't solve everything. We need to heal the underlying unhappiness or psychological trauma that drove use of porn. While I do think that porn is addictive because of the desensitization to dopamine that is involved in use of porn, I think that what initially drives that abuse can be unhappiness and trauma. It's important to create the best reality for yourself, be extra diligent about pursuing your interests and spend time with friends and family, in this time when these artificial distractions are so instantly accessible. In an experiment, when mice were given an awesome and fun cage, they found it easier to resist the drugs that the researchers made available to the mice. The trauma is important to eliminate. Many people have early adverse experiences: accidents, poor relationships with peers, parents with high expectations, abusive siblings, whatever, that make us insecure with ourselves - unworthy. Rather than beating on the past, younger self (that is really our core self) we need to comfort that younger self and tell that younger self that we understand, appreciate, and are there for that self. We need to be the parent of our inner self, and tell ourselves that we will be the future parent and supporter of our present self. This has made an incredible difference for me psychologically. Bullied for being very skinny when young, and for having little confidence from an accident I had early in life, I then bullied my younger past self, and that was actually shaking my core self - because we are our attached to our younger past selves. Instead we need to cherish and nurture that younger self that may not have had the necessary help from parents or friends. We need to love that younger self and care for it and know that we will be there for the mistakes that the current self makes. There is so much else that needs to be done to heal trauma but this is the most valuable thing I have done recently. I took time off from university to eliminate porn - to understand what was happening - and to reshape my life to minimize my vulnerability to these addictions. For more context, I worked at a Facebook partner in product management and was a student at UPenn. I eliminated porn, which is important because I think it's autocatalytic (addictive), but I had to then dig in and deal with the pains that I had been artificially washing away through porn. But without porn, my sensitivity to pleasure increased, making it easier to be happy while I was confronting the pains from within. I will say that eliminating porn has profoundly improved my mental state. I am much happier and have a much greater attention span. I don't know of any other change I made in my life at the time I eliminated porn that would otherwise explain the happiness and attention span. I think the reason is this: pornography streamlines access to novel sexual stimulation, which allows us to artificially heighten our rate of masturbation and ejaculation. We release sexual energy abnormally frequently, which we wouldn't if we didn't have the access to vast novelty. With less masturbation and ejaculation and visual overstimulation, I have much greater 1. energy and 2. receptivity to stimulation, which allow me to be much more enthused with my work. I also realized that my use of social media was fueling attachment to porn. This is because of the sexual content on social media, and the algorithms that can curate it very well for us (particularly on instagram). So I explored ways to reduce my use of social media in a low effort way. One was eliminating use of notifications. I let them pile up to 99 and come down to 0. While I miss certain things, I control my use much better now, and the benefit is worth the cost. This let me unplug from constant use of social media, whose exposure to sexual content contributed to porn. Really the struggle here, with porn and everything else, is to reduce our addiction to artificial stimulation, and to increase real world stimulation. While artificial stimulation may seem more appealing and accessible in the short term, the consequences we are all aware of (which bring us here) warrant resisting those and developing greater receptivity for real world stimulation (by cutting out the artificial dopamine) and MORE real world stimulation (by using the saved time to spend more time with friends, pursue interests and hobbies, etc). Spending more time in nature I found alleviates the psychological pain from the digital withdrawal, just as getting more real world stimulation does as well. A significant other helps, but I think you need to be comfortable with yourself first before getting into a serious relationship. While real relationships are important, you should not use someone else to help you get off of pornography. If any of you are working on eliminating porn and improving your inner life, I'd be happy to chat at any time, having crossed the line into a life fairly comfortably without porn as a 22 y/old male with early adverse experiences. I also am running a blog you can check out here that will give more high level insight on what is happening with technology, based on my work experience and research at Penn. URL"

Urges have been coming, and I've been hitting this forum up more and more. First. I'm super grateful for y'all. Your truth, honesty, authenticity, vulnerability, wit, comedy, courage. I could not do it without you. I swear. I accept that. I've had long streaks... a year plus. But I've never actually been active. I never posted regularly. If I would visit the site, it would always be incognito. I would post randomly when 'significant' events happened, if I relapsed, or if I had a wet dream, or if I almost relapsed. Like, when I needed it, I guess. Guess what? Right now, I'm using this in regular browser mode. You want to know why? Because I've just accepted that this needs to be a regular part of my life. Yup. No shame. (I guess that's what it was before, I didn't want people to know I had a Fap problem and I relied on other fellow FapAddicts to recover.) I use NoFap. And guess what? I love it. I'm proud to be here. I'm proud to be here with all y'all. Isn't that sad? I mean, where I was before. I used to brag to friends in high school about how many times I spanked it the day before. Brag? I don't know, but it was, like, not an issue, to talk openly about that stuff. How weird. Something really special and beautiful is going on here. Each and every day. It's so special. How could I have turned my eyes from it for so long? New posts, new struggles, new stories. It's amazing! Sorry. End rant. Thank you all. Much love to you all."

Gonna tell my story (gonna be pretty in depth but insightful) and have a challenge/proposition to make at the end. Backstory: - been struggling w pmo since like 9 years old, Im 26 now. One of my cousins was the one who introduced me to it at a young age and riding that wave through puberty was a very harmful experience looking back. - ive always been the type of kid to have lots of positive charisma and energy and to this day people would say Im one of the most inspiring people they would meet. I believe that I am one of the most inspiring and charismatic people I know as well, however we know I have this demon that I am in constant battle with. - since middle school/junior Ive always been in and out of different relationships girlfriends/talking/dating/ all of it theres just always someone there. I realize now that the lack of emotional connection I had growing up with my parents fueled this need to externally validate myself with women and pmo. - relationships took a turn for the worst in college where my senior year I was confused and didnt know what or who I wanted to be with. I was talking/dating 3 different girls at one time but emotionally making each feel like they were the only one, until I couldnt take it anymore and had to cut off two. I had already felt myself getting into a really weird place emotionally with feelings crossing over between people. I made one girl my official gf. I thought I loved her and she was the cutest girl Ive ever seen, but I had an expectation of her that wasnt true. I thought she was super innocent, and we got into the conversation of how many guys shes been with and when she said 22, and she was 18 at the time, I felt really hurt by that. I had been with 11 I think, but there was a huge double standard in my head. And the 11 were all relationships for me not one night standing. - pivotal point: I was already being sketchy still entertaining the other girls. That night she told me I went to one of the other girls and slept with them. Shame was at an all time high cause this girl opened up to me and was super vulnerable about her past and I straight up cheated on her. (Never cheated on my life, never thought of myself as the type of person to do that) I couldnt live with myself and was so sad and depressed but couldnt tell her why. I was stuck in the cycle of cheating for about a month until I had to break up with her and couldnt even give her a reason. - fast forward: that girl who I cheated on her with became my girlfriend for the next 2.5 years (we broke up 8 months ago) it started off rocky because of the situation but we built something pretty awesome with our relationship. - important point: throughout my life Ive always been passive. So passive that I LET things happen. Too much with the go with the flow mindset and this fucked me bad. The reason why I was in so many relationships was because we would start out as friends and passively turn into a relationship even though I wouldnt have actively pursued the woman. (None of the girls who Ive been with have I actively pursued and Ill tell you why this is a horrible thing.) - when youre passive with women or with our goals, we settle. Plain and simple. Ive never really been with a girl who I was madly in love with and Ive always desired that but at the root of It is fear. Fear of rejection and inadequacy which all is rooted in shame, which rears its ugly head through pmo, sex addictions and any other type of addictions. - shadiness hit an all time high. While I was in this relationship with the most recent the unspeakable happened to me at a massage spa. Super highly rated on yelp and well trusted. long story short the woman who gave me a massage w/o getting into the detail I was in a vulnerable spot and she started touching me and I couldnt resist and she went down on me and I finished. She said sorry ur just too damn hot or something like that. I didnt know how to feel. Violated or not! I passively let that shit happen. I was too damn weak to say no. I cheated again. And thats where the shame really starts for me. After that experience it felt so new and weird and different that I had sought out that experience and it happened 2 or 3 more times (still playing it off like it was passive but nah thats just in denial of how jacked up you are now seeking this out) - naturally Ive lost sexual interest in my gf cause of all thats happened. Stopped treating her great, stopped being a man, more passive. We broke up. And for the past 8 months Ive been going through a serious transformation/renewal of my life. - Im working on being vulnerable like being open with my shortcomings and owning up to my mistakes and being engaged/present in the moment. Currently: - Im on a good stride 53 Days in hard mode. I could never break the 3-5 day point, but what really helped me in the beginning was to remove myself from the trigger location. It would usually be at night before sleep so I made it a point to take pre workout at night, so I would HAVE to workout and go to the gym. To be able to fall asleep from the caffeine i would kill it at the gym as hard as possible. This was really game changer to get the ball rolling. - I am actively pursuing a girl. First one in my life. Taking it slow and focusing on vulnerability and communication. Not too fast just right. Pro tip for getting the woman of our dreams guys: place a mission/vision at the highest priority. (Mine is self actualization and becoming the best person God created me to be) since thats my #1 everything else falls underneath, including women. Now with this perspective it shapes our decision making very easily. Any action in life will be challenged with will this benefit this life mission I set for myself. (Side note before I met this girl I wanted to be the best version of myself and was already almost a month into hard mode, and our story is THE MOST magical romantic story Ive ever heard of and its happened to me and Im so grateful and speechless, will save this story for a later time, might become a Netflix series of How good it is, currently season 1 just ended on a cliff hanger) - I am still battling the shame of my past. slowly but surely Im able to accept it. A good practice for me is when those feelings or thoughts come of shame guilt and inadequacy. I simply say thank you for reminding me that I am not my past or that person anymore thank you because you help me and continually propel me to be the greatest man on earth. Thank u because without this struggle I wouldnt appreciate conquering such a strong enemy. - future goal: I desire to be a MAN. I want to be who Ive dreamt of becoming. I want to fulfill the potential I saw in myself and what everyone had seen glimpses of. I WILL NEVER become a man if I cannot defeat the enemy of lust within. Im 26 and Ive committed to 1,000 days of hard mode I like to call the enlightened 1,000 by the time I turn 30. This hard mode consists of nothing remotely sketchy, no one is touching me in ANY sensual way except my future wife from now on. Not even myself. I am redirecting all this creative energy into my career and being an inspirational figure to others. - Im on day 53 now. The urges fluctuate but can be utterly insane Ive been a super sexual person this whole time and its ridiculous strong and laughable sometimes But I think that just means I have a lot of creative potential. You do too! I overcome insanely strong urges by simply noticing it, being thankful for it, and smiling because now I got all this energy to utilize. - 1,000 Days is a lot and hell of a goal, but by the time I turn 30 Ill become the man Ive always wanted to be. So join me in this 1,000 day journey and lets change the world for the better. Lets become men In a world of boys. "
148,vulnerability,NoFap,Am I too weak? [Vent + question],3,7nwqev,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7nwqev/am_i_too_weak_vent_question/,2018-01-04 05:52:04,"I've been masturbating for around 5 years now. I usually did it 1-4 times a day. However, on December 29 of 2017 I decided to stop. Now that was the first time I attempted nofap and I mostly did it to boost my self-confidence. I always thought my willpower was too weak to stop masturbating. And I was very inspired to stop doing it by cold turkey, despite the fact that masturbating was basically part of my daily routine. It's been 6 days since I stopped. Yesterday, I couldn't fall asleep until 1:30 am (I usually sleep at 10). That is because I really needed to fap. I had to do so many things to calm my body down and convince myself that I can sleep without masturbating. But today, I gave up. I masturbated 1 hour ago. I'm ashamed of myself for being this weak. I couldn't even last a whole week. I didn't set a goal for myself previously as I had planned to stop cold turkey. Throughout these 6 days, I was always scared that I'd imminently succumb and fall to self-deprecation and severe regret because of it. And I have fallen to self-hatred. I literally couldn't function since I started nofap as masturbation was occupying my mind half the time. I did feel proud for going 6 days clean as that was my high score for a long, long time (quite sad). But now I feel like all my effort has gone to waste. I feel like I betrayed myself. The regret and shame is destroying me. I really hate not having control over myself. And I especially hate that my sexual desires control me. My inferiority complex stems from the vulnerability my sex drive is making me have. I'm not a control freak, but the fact that I don't have control over any part of my body really makes me scared. Thankfully, I'm not a porn addict. I very rarely browse porn. Maybe some hentai every once in a while but it's not much of an addiction. But my intense addiction to masturbation makes up for it. Do you think I'm too weak to go cold turkey? I need self-esteem now more than any other time in my life. I can't believe I failed such a thing. Am I weak for only lasting 6 days? Is it possible for me to actually end masturbation once and for all? I don't even want to think about masturbating anymore. It makes me ejaculate way too quickly and that makes my confidence even lower. Is there hope for me to ever go on living a clean life without having to worry about masturbating the next day? Without having to worry about regret? If so, does anyone have good advice? I hope this didn't sound bad, cringeworthy, or stupid. I really thank everyone who has read and/or answered from the bottom of my heart. "
149,vulnerability,NoFap,Don't do what I did. Don't sacrifice real love for PMO.

It took a string of bad dates before finding nofap and my first attempt (77 days) with a lot of lifestyle changes to realize I ended my loving and amazing relationship with a beautiful girl 2 years ago because of PMO. I made some bullshit excuse about distance but I was just addicted to novelty, to release, and I needed it instantaneously, CONSTANTLY, so I couldn't wait 1 or 2 or 3 weeks to be with her again, the first girl I ever really loved... I left the most wonderful girl, who I loved and who loved me for a cold, dimly lit screen and the deepest rabbit hole I could throw myself into. I've gone 77 days my first attempt, I'm at 7 now on the second run and its a whole lot easier now but lately I've been thinking if I'll ever be able to be in a relationship like that again, I betrayed someone who gave me their love and their soul. I smashed them into pieces and for what? An endless supply of pain? A conveyor belt of novelty? Constant, unneeded release? My fucking soulless incognito tab? What kind of a person does that? What person in their right mind would ever give something so beautiful up? Apparently me, I did and I don't want to ever do it to someone again so i'm afraid. For now I don't focus on trying to find the right girl, I focus on trying to be the right man and maybe down the line the universe or god will give me another chance to feel that love again and hopefully by then I'll be ready, I'll be better, I'll be the best person I can be and I'll give them my all.

I woke up feeling sick today, called into work, and I did what I used to do which was pmo when Im sick. I set myself up for failure but i didnt feel it was wrong at the time because my brain was so familiar with it. I had no thoughts of my goals or stopping or anything. I know its weird, it makes me forget about the sickness feeling in my stomach though. Needless to say it didnt help anything, because now not only does my stomach still hurt and I feel sick, but anxiety is in full swing magnifying everything. Im pretty upset with myself. Not beating myself up just upset. I explained it to my wife about an hour ago and she never had an issue with my looking at p. Now that she understands the gravity and connections of everything she is full swing I need to get it together. I believe the only way I will make it through this is through structure. I am really not looking forward to this weekend and short work week for thanksgiving. I tried leaning on that 2 day streak as fuel to keep going, but we all know by this point what happened there. I never realized this was a problem until Ive tried to quit. I wish I never watched a second of porn. Such a stupid fucking juvenile addiction that seems to have such impulsive power over me. Im starting to rant but these are just some lent up feelings Im experiencing and Im sure my wife doesnt want to talk about it currently. About a month or so ago I had a 76 day streak going - cold turkey. I ended up downloading the chive app disbarring my hesitations. The soft core stuff was enough to trigger urges which combined with imagery was the perfect scenario to throw my streak away. I set myself up for failure there and I need to be more attentive on what my brains intentions truly are. Pmo isnt worth the shame, anxiety, sense of guilt, and that feeling of vulnerability for the next 48-72 hours I will be experiencing until I get it together again. Im tried using the restrictions setting on iPhone with my wife setting the passcode. After trying a search for a freezer from Home Depot it wouldnt allow me to view it. I told her, she turned it off but I cant help but think that I cant trust myself as that pmo zombie like state is grounds for critical failure. My take away from today will be I need to keep myself occupied over the weekend while my wife is at work mainly get out of the house and surround myself with family. Come Monday I will begin working out again at least 4 days a week. That worked extremely well for me during my initial 76 day streak. I need to return to church and pray. I am the person I want to and see myself being without pmo. I refuse to let this relapse cripple the best of me and I will continue to further my efforts in becoming P free. Tomorrow will be the start of day 1 and thats 1 day toward my goal soon to be in the books. "
152,vulnerability,NoFap,I think I found the root cause of my PMO Addiction. Please share your experiences.,1,7fqknw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7fqknw/i_think_i_found_the_root_cause_of_my_pmo/,2017-11-27 10:02:15,"**Introduction** By no means am I a clinical psychologist, but who knows the self better than the self? I am hoping to share this realization that I had with this subreddit in the hopes of finding individuals who share similar experiences so we can together discuss and brainstorm solutions to this root cause...because if you relate to what I am about to write, you will understand that NoFap by itself is not enough as a stand-alone solution. **Background** I'm 25 years old. I always thought there was something wrong with me sexually, so I didn't start masturbating until 4 years ago (when I was 21 years old). The first few months were like an awakening. I've never felt so empowered and I felt in touch with my masculinity. But little did I realize as a then-21 year old that I was about to get trapped in an endless cycle of addiction since the act of PMO was going to soon be an obsessive behavior that would unfortunately fill a void in my life. For the rest of my 21st year, I became a zombie with the life force sucked out of me. Someone actually compared me to Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars since my face looked like the result of dark-side degradation. Mid-way through my 22nd year (January 2015), I discovered NoFap and have been attempting streaks the same way ever since: Get Angry with myself after a relapse, worship a picture of Darth Maul or Vegeta, and tell my self that I am going to crush it, dominate, obliterate anything in my path, listen to aggressive music, and fight like a man. Im an INFJ, and if you know anything about personality types, you will know that my aggressive pursuits to obtain a high NoFap streaks were hopeless initiatives which were completely misaligned with my personality type and who I am as a person. My 23rd and 24th years of life saw no change in how I approached NoFap. My best streaks were 30, 25, 28 days (I know counting days isnt necessarily the best, but please just respect my system because its how I track my progress). Im sure Ive had at least 25-30 streaks of &lt;10 days. Clearly, this strategy has not been successful. My life has been torturous since January of 2015 when I first began trying to end this addiction. But now, in my 25th year, I have come to a big realization after having read an article by Mark Greene. In fact, I actually got really fucking emotional when I read this article. Because I believe a big part of what this article discusses is the root cause of my addiction to PMO. **Realization** The article I read is by Mark Greene and is called ""How a Lack of Touch is Destroying Men"" To summarize what the author said: **1.**Men (particularly Men in America) are suffering from lack of platonic touch in their lives. This is a type of touch separate from romantic/sexual intimacy. This is the kind of platonic touch that we (both boys and girls) experienced as children. However, as boys grew up, the cultural standards for male behavior were forced on us and it was no longer socially acceptable for boys to hug or touch in a platonic manner to express companionship or compassion. **2.**When men hug or touch other men in a platonic manner, its seen as either weakness/vulnerability or homosexuality. Its taboo. **3.**When men hug or touch women, it is always suspect because of the assumption that men are dogs, men cant control their physical desires, etc. **4.**With points #2 and #3 above, men only have 2 options: either get a girlfriend because the construct of platonic touch for men has unfortunately been intertwined with sexual intimacy or completely give up platonic touch altogether and prepare to deal with touch starvation. The fact that men have only those two options is a real shame, because touch is a real physical need. Obviously food/water are needs to sustain biological function, while shelter/clothing are needs to sustain our safety. But humans have other needs as well: belonging, physical touch, emotional intimacy. If you are one of the many men like me who is a real loner and has never been good with women due to our excessive PMO use, you understand that you probably dont get both the platonic touch and emotional intimacy that you need. I definitely related to Mark Greens article in terms of lack of physical, platonic touch, but Ive also had minimal emotional connection as well since adolescence (including virtually no deep friendships that I crave for as an INFJ). I think both of these coupled together is the ultimate demise particularly for someone like me who is hardwired to be compassionate and care for others. When I first started PMO at 21 y/o, the feeling of physical pleasure immediately filled the void of lack of physical touch/emotional intimacy for me and I was fooled. But once I read this article recently, Ive realized that the reason Ive been struggling so hard and so long to battle my PMO addiction is because I am lacking from basic human needs: physical, platonic touch. Again, that coupled with the lack of emotional intimacy is a demolishing combination. But Im sick and tired of being sorry for myself. Lets talk about solutions. **Solutions** These are not vetted solutions, but rather a list of my brainstormed ideas for men who share similar experience as I do (lack of physical platonic touch and lack of emotional connection). Whether you relate to my post or not, feel free to comment on these proposed solutions that I have to alleviate the lack of platonic touch (I might need to make a separate post on solutions to alleviate the lack of emotional intimacy, but for now lets focus on platonic touch): **a.**Shake hands with a co-worker on a job well done. **b.**Give a co-worker a high five for a job well done. **c.**Get a full body massage (NOT FROM A CO-WORKER). Ive only had one of these before, and Ive noticed that this kind of satisfies my skin cravings. **d.**Give yourself a scalp massage if you dont like strangers massaging you. **e.**Play a pick up game of basketball (depending on where you go and if you play more aggressively, you can definitely get the platonic touch). I know this sounds kind of creepy, but Im not trying to be. This is simply for the physical contact that men need. Though this is not the gentle platonic touch that Green discusses in his article. But at least its something. **f.**Hug family members whenever you have the opportunity. Whenever I visit family, I take the opportunity to hug them tightly as often as I can. When I leave, its almost as if I am going to a different planet all alone, because I know I am going to have to deal with touch starvation for a while (I only see my family once every couple of months). **g.**Join a sports team...especially if you do well, you can high-five each other and do a bro-hug after a big win. This is all I can come up with for now as a pretty solitary dude who does not get the platonic touch that he needs. What are your thoughts? **TLDR:** Touch sickness/lack of emotional connection is the root cause of my PMO addiction. I give a bit of background on my situation. I discuss a realization I had after reading a very insightful article. And then I propose solutions to the best of my ability. "

The only time I will probably ever masturbate is if I find that I'm lost and nothing can be achieved in life after all my efforts... I want to be freed from this humiliation, degradation, even though the last handjob at porn 1 month ago simply felt ecstatic...! Such girls, such sweetness, nakedness, vulnerability...! I mean, that was definetly good, and, to be honest, the masturbation and porn itself are far more better than any fulfillment and accomplishment feeling. This is simply true. I am currently on a 34 NO PMO/ NoFap streak without edging or nocturnal emissions (but today I have peed a litle sperm... Shit). Compare how you feel at a handjob with the accomplishent of a long amount being commited to PMO/ NoFAP. Jerking off is simply superior as experience. Yet, the abstinence or ceasing it make you feel like a true man, respecting yourself and having integrity, to feel that you are not a %100 loser that is masturbating all day while others guys inferior to you by any means are simply sleeping with girls that you'd love to be with... And that's extremely painfully. At least, you don't give in... You're neutral to this shit. Even though you are alone. You choose to respect yourself however good the porn may be. But notice that if you masturbate frequently mentally you might he destroyed. Your self-estrem might be severely damaged especially if you are alone and others have sex with other girls. That's callous, because if you cannot doing anything beside NO PMO/ NoFAP, you are condemned to unfulfillment and celibacy. That's mental, and callous. A very dirty mental and unreal game (that's why is almost impossible to win...). Sometimes life just seems so inhuman, harsh, cold &amp; malevolent. Beside this, with every ejaculation your body eliminates proteins, vitamins, zync, pothasium, magnesium, etc. So why give in useless...? Edit: I might make a post in the future about aborting other addictions, but I'm not so sure on that. I mean, the masturbation seems by far the easiest one."

155,vulnerability,NoFap,A sense of self,1,73vg0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/73vg0d/a_sense_of_self/,2017-10-03 07:24:06,"Listening to The Tulips and Bob Dylan Today, I keep randomly seeing sexualized women. In music videos, billboards, etc. I know the point of sexuality for my mammalian brain at least is procreation. I dont like what porn offers me 90% of the time. There is a 10% though that I really like. I dont mind my own fetishes, and I like the outlet if their is a woman in my life that is really turning me on, I can go into my home, masturbate, and then stop thinking about her as much. I dont feel shame, because realistically most everyone with a mammalian brain has thoughts of attraction to people other than their partners. For me a lot of this subreddit assumes that porn is the cause of way too many societal ills. I tend to think (similar to alcohol) that it isnt really porn that is the problem, it is the interaction of porn with certain brains, mindsets, and routines. I have a friend who has casually told me he masturbates about once a week, and then he doesnt really get distracted by his own sexuality. That is how I am with certain drugs. Anyway, I am kind of sad that I dont appear to be one of those people. I wish we lived in a society that didnt objectify women as much; one where sex wasnt viewed as a male conquest leading to so many horrible consequences. I wish sexual relations were more open. I wish that there was less shame, but at the end of the day similar to Brave New Worlds protagonist, I think a world where people were open enough to have sex often with a lot of people, it might be just as superficial. I do wish that more people would be open to the idea of having a few partners. I think I would personally enjoy the ability to have an un jealous partner (who could sleep with others if she wanted) and the ability to flirt with, kiss, and infrequently sleep with other people. When I write it, ironically, I feel like I wouldnt actually have sex with many other people if at all. I just dont like feeling like I cant expand or experiment with my biological urges, especially since pornography seems to be a dead end for me. This is an idea Id like to explore more in the future. I also had an urge today to go to a strip club. Ive never been to one. The idea was super appealing, but now I think why start a new set of routines when I dont really want to deal with them or the consequences. Fuck that. I want to work on the issues I already have. Last week I spent the vast majority of my time being productive to the point where I got a cold. I realized that viewing my life as solely a way to be productive was almost as unfulfilling as pmo. This week Im doing the opposite. I am still using healthy routines, but I have lumped all my school work subconsciously into a category of not obligatory. This all or nothing paradigm makes decisions less difficult. But it also doesnt really work long term. I dont want to be constantly productive. I dont want to not be productive. I want to have faith in myself to make daily decisions about what I want to do. This certainly wont make it easier, but this is the fulfilling sense of self-efficacy that I really believe is worth working on. After writing this, I want to get some damn schoolwork done. Same with tomorrow. Maybe I dont want to give up pornography for life. Maybe that is difficult to commit to, because I dont really know that abstinence is for me. I want my life to be more about the moment, and maybe if I had a strong sense of self-efficecy and willpower, pornography wouldnt represent such a problem. Dont get me wrong, I am committed to no pmo for one year, but afterwards I dont know. While I know this message might not be motivational for others, let me add two things: 1. I think in our culture vulnerability is seen as weakness, yet it is usually necessary for any concept of non-superficial love. I look at the tree outside my window and see it blow and move in the wind. Our culture with its fear of vulnerability mine as well be represented by the stone wall next to the tree. It is very difficult to start a goal without spelled out parameters, but as I said I want to have faith in my ability to eventually decide what is right for me without all the rules. I think with a good amount of work and a year of abstinence, I might be able to be someone that uses pornography minimally without prioritizing it over all the other wonderful things in life. Or I wont care for it. I want to have faith in myself, courage to be vulnerable, and not think that all it takes to destroy the person I am growing to be is finding a video online. 2. A friend of mine who is a recovering drug addict told me one day, I just keep thinking, why not try this abstinence thing out. If I dont like it I can go back to drugs whenever I want. They arent going anywhere. Lets try it together."
156,vulnerability,NoFap,"Porn isolates you from yourself, and everyone else!",4,74e2a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/74e2a0/porn_isolates_you_from_yourself_and_everyone_else/,2017-10-05 16:52:37,"""[When we ceased acting out the addiction,] We came to find intimacy with ourselves, intimacy with God, and then intimacy with others."" *This post ended up being a lot longer than I thought it would be. There is a TLDR at the bottom.* Again, the word 'god' still makes me a little uncomfortable, but this quote makes a very good point by repeating the word *'intimacy.'* Porn trains us to seek sexual gratification without intimacy. What is intimacy, you ask? Excellent question! The Cambridge Dictionary defines intimacy as ""The state of having a close, personal relationship or romantic relationship with someone."" Having a close, personal relationship is *necessarily* a two-way street, give and take, strength and vulnerability, in equal measure. Without some level of emotional vulnerability, sharing, and giving, intimacy cannot exist. So, for example, an intimate relationship with the self would *necessarily* include an acceptance of one's faults, flaws, negative feelings, and failures, as well as one's successes, good features, and assets. I believe one of the main reasons I use PMO is because I have a deeply seated fear of the negative emotional aspects of my own existence, and subconsciously I just want to run and hide from those scary elements of my being I never learned to deal with as a child because I could hide from them -inside PMO. Then we come to the different levels of intimacy in this quote: with the self, with God, with others. This is a big can of worms, skip the next section if you're not interested in my fledgling philosophical concepts. A. One must be reasonably knowledgeable about oneself to construct an adult, non-subordinating concept of God insofar as God can be defined as an archetypal, higher-order morality that exists outside the realm of pure human reason and conscious, rational understanding, often taken as a priori by some thinkers, but which is really predicated upon a set of unconsciously agreed upon higher-order axioms or archetypes gained by abstraction from observations of human behavior over millennia. Therefore, in order to access the higher-order morality which some people call God, one must first establish intimacy and relative understanding with the self. B. In order to establish intimacy with others, one must have some intimacy with the workings of that society and the likely motivations of the self, and be able to extrapolate likely motivations for others from the previously achieved self-consciousness, and the unconscious awareness of archetypal axioms. This requires an (often unconscious) intimacy with the higher-order morality governing the actions and motivations of each individual, as well as an (often unconscious) intimacy with the self. C. Therefore, in order to gain intimacy with our fellow humans, we must have intimacy with ourselves and with some sense of higher morality, by which I mean a governance of our actions based on (often unconscious) truth and an (often unconscious) awareness that one's reason does not possess all the answers, especially for cognitive and behavioral phenomena, but one can accept the fact that there are patterns to those phenomena and there is a morality governing the patterns of those phenomena which is often just outside the realm of rational, conscious articulation. **TLDR** Stop using porn and instant gratification to cut off your relationship with yourself, and everything else will fall into place."
157,vulnerability,NoFap,There is cure to PIED,3,74z84r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/74z84r/there_is_cure_to_pied/,2017-10-08 13:29:28,"*I wrote this all in one go and have not had the chance to edit it for spelling and grammar. I apologise in advance* It has come time to write my story. I am a very long-term lurker and have vowed one day to write about my journey on here one day when I got over my PIED. I am 30 and its been a long journey indeed, but I can finally, with confidence answer one of the most nagging questions of my life. Yes, there is a way to overcome porn-induced erectile disfunction. So settle in and let me tell you my story. The first time I saw pornography was around the age of 13. It was late at night and stumbled upon a porn flick on Showcase. That was some 17 years ago. Soon after, I discovered that you could search 'xxx' on the internet and it went from there. I was about 14 when I started to download porn, first on KaZaA and then eDonkey. By the time I was 15, I was downloading a lot of nasty stuff. BDSM, FemDom, Fetish, etc. etc. etc. At was around the time I 'discovered' masturbation. And so began the years of numbness. I was about 19 when I got my first girlfriend. It was a month or so into our relationship, when one evening at a club she finally said, 'Let's do it'. Fantastic, I thought. We both were a little drunk and went back to her place and the little guy didn't get up one inch. I was dumbstruck. In my everyday life I was jerking off 4,5,6, sometimes 7 times a day, but for some reason, it blatantly refused to work. Was I too drunk? I heard of whiskey dick, maybe that was the problem. Was she not attractive enough? Maybe. And so began my years of misery, insecurity, self-doubt and fear. We tried to have sex a few more times: nothing happened. Ashamed, I did not discuss this with her and found a convenient enough excuse to break up a few months later. A year later, I started going out with another girl. She was a virgin and wanted to take things 'slowly'. I was only too happy to oblige. By this point, I was watching porn and masturbating multiple times a day, with increasing vigor, intensity and frequency. I was actually 'proud' of the fact that I was numb to the world. I wasn't really interested in chasing tail. I was 'above' this stuff. Girls had to 'earn' my attention. But I digress. The second girl was attractive by any standard. Yet, when it came to having sex with her, nothing happened. No erection, no movement, no nothing. I was less than a man. My brain went into overdrive, trying to rationalize this away. She is not your type; she is boring; she is immature. I started to avoid women. The look they give you when you can't get it up, that sympathy, mixed with pity, mixed with judgement was too much for me. I graduated university. I finished grad school. And on the day I turned 24, I hit my rock bottom. In retrospect, nothing particular happened. About 20 of us went out. I got drunk. Hit on some women at a club. Went home alone. Woke up in the morning and jerked off to some porn (pony play, domination, femdom, who knows anymore). And as I finished, I felt disgusted. I felt like I've hit the rock bottom. I clearly felt that porn was ruining my life. And so I stopped. I gave up pornography cold turkey. This was before the days of NoFap, and Reeboting and PIED, at least for me. I do not remember much from those days, except that I was still masturbating and reading BDSM stories on the web. In retrospect, it wasn't a real rebook, only a start of a long journey. Nonetheless, 3 months later I met a girl and fell in love. Our relationship started out long-distance. About a month into 4-hour long Skype sessions, we started having Skype sex. I still remember the day I showed my fully erect penis to her over the web. It was so empowering. It was the first time anyone has seen it like that besides me. I moved back to my home town a few months later and we started living together. She was a virgin, so it took about a month for us to start having sex. She was more worried about it than me and I was happy to take it easy. Someone, the little guy got more and more comfortable over that time and started getting more and more erect. I had never discussed my previous problems with her and was elated that it just worked. Did I enjoy it? I was relieved more than anything. I was not broken after all. However, I was in constant fear that the next time we have sex it will not work. And so when it did, I was relieved. That was enough for me. It was more than I could have asked for a year before. She was happy and so was I. One positive side effect I noticed was that I could go on forever. I could never finish inside of her, but boy could I go on for hours. I moved away about 5 months later and we broke up. Here, I will interject slightly and write from my current (today's) point of view to make a point. I unequivocally believe that porn induces ED. Equally, fear plays an important part in this. Fear of failing, fear of women, fear of vulnerability, fear. One can only deal with the porn part by not watching it. One can only deal with the fear part by talking about. We never talked about. I never shared it with her and so, although I could get hard, I was still afraid of sex, afraid of failing and afraid of living. I was not 'cured'. Now to return to the story. Over the next 2 years, I had a few unsuccessful one-night stands and mainly stayed away from women. The fear of failing, of 'it' not working was as great as ever. Each time it, I, failed, only added to this. I returned to porn. Slowly at first, and then with more vigor than ever. I was back. At least, I wasn't a virgin anymore. The day I turned 26, everything changed. I won't go into much detail as to the cause, but needless to say, I had a mental break down. I completely redefined my relationship with the world. I began to read and believe in spirituality, masculinity, vulnerability, purpose, destiny, fate. I threw away pickup books and began to meditate. I traded relationship advice forums with NoFap. I began a long process of healing, of discovering myself, of reconnecting with the world. I began to deal with my anger, fears, pride. I began to listen to my heart. Over the next year I changed jobs, careers and countries. I gave up pornography and masturbation. I began the Reboot on hard mode. I went through all of the classic stages. Extreme horniness, then complete lack of it and then very very very slow recovery. I began to follow every post on here. Sometimes I failed and had to start again. I relapsed into watching porn several times. I went for 95 days without masturbating. At a certain point I realised that NoFap was doing more harm than good and stopped reading it entirely. That was about 1.5 years ago. About 6 months ago I met a girl. I fell for her, hard. I was afraid. We had mutual friends and the fear of my friends discovering my problem was up there with the fear of death. Sure enough, the first time we tried to have sex it didn't work. The pressure of it was too much (girl I like, my previous experiences, friends discovering). So, I did something I have never done before. I talked about it. I told her the whole story - from the beginning, much like I am doing today. And then we took it slowly. Very very slowly. First just touching each other. Then, just a bit of penetration (it would go soft otherwise). Finally, after a few weeks, I was able to keep it hard. And then, well, I won't go into too many details. In all my years of visiting these forums, I was only ever interested in one question: Can you cure PIED? Am, I cured today? No. There is no such thing as a cure. But, I believe I have found the path to dealing with it and I believe it is universal enough to share on here: First, quit porn and quit masturbating. Quitting the former set me on the path to recovery and moved an enormous source of poison from my life. Quitting the latter, gave me immense benefits to pursue my passion in life; to have the energy and stamina every day to conquer the world. Second, meditate and discover yourself. Learn to deeply and truly love yourself. Learn to accept who you are, with your imperfections, PIED and the rest. Learn that you deserve happiness in life. Third, when you meet the right person, be ready to share everything with them. Share your deepest fears, share your true story. Open yourself up. Chances are, it will be immensely difficult, so practice it in every day life as well. Talking about fears makes them less powerful and lessens their hold on us. The more you share your problems, the less of a problem it becomes. Will everyone understand them? No. But, the real point is to heal yourself by talking. Chances are, your deepest fears and problems will seem trivial to those you are sharing and they will react with understanding. They may even share back and that is what will deepen your relationship with that person and create intimacy with the loved ones. Four, learn to remove the pressure. Porn is harmful for many reasons. It is poisonous to your brain. It is poisonous to your soul. It also really does create unrealistic expectations. You are not suppose to get hard instantly, on demand, all the time, or even some of the time. There may be some times when it doesn't work. If you are with the person you want to create intimacy with, they will accept. They may not understand (and may have issues of their own to deal with), but they will accept. Start slow and work from there. Share in small joys and successes along the way. It may seem childish, but, so what? Finally, I will leave you with one more though that I wish to share. At 20, you wish you didn't start watching porn when you were 10. At 25 you wish you had started the Reboot at 20 and had not started to watch porn at 10. At 30, you wish you had followed the advice at 25, started the Reboot at 20 and didn't start watching porn at 10. Regrets always accumulate. Do not let your fears allow to accumulate regrets in your life. Good luck on your journeys everyone."

I was just taking in information I wasn't truly interested in, not engaged in. Just the obsessiveness of approval from others. THE ONLY PERSON YOU NEED TO PROVE TO IS YOURSELF&gt;&gt; The three self help books I recommend to read that has changed my life personally and inspired me to take ACTION are: 1.How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie: Not regarding towards no rap, but it helped me work with people in general. It adopts a generous and caring attitude, resulting in the name of the title. And it is a action book, meaning you have to apply the principals to get the full benefit. 2: Awaken The Giant Within by Tony Robbins: This is the book that made me make the true decisions to let pmo out of my life. It's nothing magically, it's something real. We have this greatness within us, we are the captain, in charge of our destiny. It provides principles to life by for mental well being, financial freedom, and revealing our destiny. 3. Attract Women Through Honesty by Mark Manson. The reason why I recommend this is because it also helped me get out of the phase of self help. It made me gain confidence as a man, be less needy of improved of others, it's a complete ACTION book. ---My Advise---- These books I have provided are completely ACTION books, let me repeat that, ACTION! You want control of your life, action. Not fapping is an action, expanding your mind is an action, approaching that girl you find beautiful is action and courage, demanding your boss for that raise that you deserve is action. That is something we need to do, let go of our bad habits and reveal the greatness within us. Currently I am learning Spanish, looking into poetry, success with my clients, engaging in college activities, expressing my vulnerability with women.

159,vulnerability,NoFap,The psychological significance of sexual intercourse,2,76m2oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/76m2oq/the_psychological_significance_of_sexual/,2017-10-16 09:06:15,"Foreward: This is a long, essay style post that I made in regards to the idea of how important it is for humans to find connection and stability through loving relationships and the impact that the act of love making has to the psyche of an individual. The purpose of this post is to encourage fapstronauts to pursue love as a goal and mindset in order to stay away from deceit and lust (porn). Once again, this is a long post, but if you have 15 minutes to spare, I encourage you to read this. Hopefully this can have a positive impact on our community. {Love-making} We, as humans, naturally search for purpose, or meaning. It is the result of our survival-based filter which is rooted into our very existence. It is important, functional, essential for our continued existence. However, love-making is different. There are many common ideas. The biologists emphasize reproduction and continuation of the evolutionary process. The classical folk will point out emotional desire and a need for connection. Dopamine chasers will describe immense pleasure and stress release. I would argue that sexual intercourse has been socialized to the point that originality has become nearly non-existent. We have been brought up at a young age to expect sex as a necessary act. However, me mustnt talk about it. How ironic, that the most fulfilling and meaningful activity in this life happens to be considered taboo, or too dirty to discuss normally. This particularly confuses children and adolescents. I believe it can be psychologically damaging for one to misunderstand sexual intercourse. The result of misunderstanding the point of sex, are things like prostitution, and porn. These are all perversions of the true meaning behind the act. They are masks, which try to deceive those who are vulnerable, and steal (most often in the form of currency) from them as well. Its easy to categorize sex as, merely, a biological impulse, which is too strong to merely ignore. Shakespeare enthusiasts would commonly and, quite enthusiastically, disagree with such a simplistic, and particularly polarizing explanation. Some consider it ludicrous that sex could possibly mean anything more than the biological-scientific model. After all, if sex wasnt required for life, then it would be logically useless, right? The same could be said for sunlight exposure, exercise, or meditation. These are functions which serve physical, and biological needs. However, this is only half of the puzzle. A scientist often overlooks the other aspect of life, the psychological perspective. After all, its impossible to look at the world objectively. We are all naturally biased, in our subjective, survivalist-based perceptions. Looking at these activities from a psychological point of view, it becomes apparent that these physical activities have a tremendous impact on the mental perspective of a subject. Regular exercise, promotes mental well-being, and improves cognitive performance. Sunlight exposure allows the body to absorb an essential vitamin (b), which plays a role in mediating mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. Meditation, which is perhaps the most psychological out of these activities, allows the subject to have an influence on focus and attention, which results in improved self-control. But what about the act of sexual intercourse? Where does this purely physical activity come into play psychologically? Sex, the purest form of emotional connection, is transformed into love-making through vulnerability and trust. Let me explain this thoroughly. When you are vulnerable, you have completely abandoned your psychological defenses. You have lost touch with your defensive ego. By relinquishing any care about embarrassment or negative emotion, you are in your most vulnerable state. This is also the same as surrendering your emotional attachment to fear. To allow the act of sexual intercourse to become something more, a transformation must occur. The transformation of mind. Love-making results in a pure, emotional connection. A transition from two individuals, into one whole, one being. Words cannot accurately describe the fulfillment and passion that occurs. No words can truly describe the naked warmth of your partners skin. Someone might be normally afraid of judgment, or subject to harsh, emotionally degrading criticism. But, love-making allows you to forget about these negative emotions. You now have no capacity for such unimportance. All that matters are here and now. The bond being created, the connection being formed. That is what is important. The two souls merging into one. The eyes are the communicators. Pure ecstasy, and a euphoria that is unmatched in purity will overcome you. Love is honest, and your deepest desires and emotions will emerge. She will request what turns her on. You will learn how to please her, how to satisfy her. Love-making is giving up your own pleasures, to ensure that she is fulfilled. In the middle of the act, you will lose yourself. You will get lost in the pure energy, and raw passion that accompanies it. Theres only love and connection. Casual love-making doesnt exist. Love-making is; struggle, power, dominance, acceptance, fulfillment, creation, and raw emotional energy. Sex is for pleasure, but love-making, in its purest form, occurs when the gentle hearts merge into one. It is only fulfilled when lust is cast-out, abandoned. Love accepts the imperfect person for who they are, while lust is the imperfect filter, the deceiver. Love satisfies the others desires, while lust remains selfish. Love-making is a bond, in the purest form. Its the rawest, most powerful expression of I love you. Its indescribable. It endures pain, and suffering. Its a perfect form of energy. It rewards with fulfillment. The deceived will try and substitute love for temporary pleasures (to no avail). Lust will make a perversion(s) of sex. The results, are substantial amounts of deceived individuals who attempt to reach fulfillment through perverse means, such as; porn, prostitution, clubs etc. Dont allow yourself to become deceived. Aim for the purest, and most honest goal. Work towards a loving and fulfilling relationship. Love-making is our God given gift to fulfill the emptiness of the soul. We mustnt take it for granted. "

This text is awesome.. ""Wherever you look, there is the common belief that female sexuality is like a mystical, secret garden, an art form, while male sexuality is like a simple algorithm. Women require hours to orgasm (if they orgasm at all). Men need a tight grip and 5-7 minutes of in and out. Women need emotional safety for letting go. Men need a tight grip and 5-7 minutes of in and out. Women need to be treated like a goddess, with incense, foreplay and massage oil. Men need a tight grip and 5-7 minutes of in and out. You know what Im getting at there is an imbalance! Im asking: is there really? Or might we be looking at male sexuality in the wrong way? I think we are. When the media writes and talks about male sexuality, they are talking about a very superficial part of it. Having approached sexuality open-mindedly for most of my adult life, and having experimented with various set-ups, techniques and traditions, I would say: there is much more to male sexuality than everyone talks about. So what is everyone getting wrong? Multiple things. There Is a huge sensitivity issue One of the major problems I see in mainstream sex is that men are disconnected from the sensations in their penis. Yep, exactly the same issue that many claim is the case for women and their vaginas. The cause is a different one though: men have bad self-pleasure habits. Way too many men suffer from one or another state of the death grip. And thereby they have lost precious sensitivity in their penis from masturbating too frequently with a too tight grip. The problem is all over the internet. But most act when its already pretty late read: when they cant come from vaginal or oral stimulation anymore, but only from handjobs (preferably given by themselves, because their partners grip is too weak). The second consequence of bad masturbation habits is too frequent ejaculation. As much as men hate to admit it, everyone knows its true. Remember the times when you didnt ejaculate for a week and then had sex? An entirely different experience! Ejaculating less frequently is not an option for most, because in mainstream sex, ejaculation equals orgasm. And thats a very limiting belief that we have to work on. More on this later in this article. Stimulation happens mostly locally Very connected to the lack of sensitivity down there, is the fact that male sexuality is often limited to happening down there. Women need to warm up their entire body before they are ready for genital stimulation. Men are born ready. But what men need instead of foreplay is afterplay. Or duringplay. Basically, full body stimulation and sensations during or after high states of genital arousal. A Tantra teacher first introduced me to this phenomenon, and I find it super interesting If you want, its a reflection of the anatomical structure of the genitals: For women, its going from the outside to the inside. From full-body stimulation to local stimulation. For men, its going from the inside to the outside. From local stimulation to full-body stimulation. Thats pretty magical! And almost no men do this to themselves while masturbating. Nor do they ask their partners to do it. Try it, its an incredibly easy win! The impact of gender roles After generally not being very sensitive, another reason for male sexuality being viewed as limited and simple is the impact of gender roles on our sexual behavior. Most men enjoy being the penetrator, and take on the more dominant role that comes with this. A role that is, at least emotionally, very simple. And theres nothing wrong with that  I personally also enjoy it a lot, and practice it most of the time. But that isnt everything. The entire emotionally vulnerable aspect of sexuality, that is very present in female orgasms as we know them, is also available to men. But almost every man is blocked from accessing it. A man starting to cry while making love is unfortunately not something humanity seems to be ready for. But its beautiful. And only one facet of a high bandwidth of emotions that men tend to avoid. Men are also able to surrender into the process of making love, but gender roles often still prevent them from doing so. Ejaculation does not equal orgasm Now comes what I think is the most important point of this article. And the previously made points compile beautifully into this one. Everyone underestimates the complexity of male sexuality. The main reason for the limited beliefs is that, in common knowledge, ejaculation equals orgasm. This is unbelievably sad. And unbelievably wrong. Like women, men are capable of having different types of orgasms. Shallow orgasms, deep orgasms, peak orgasms, multiple orgasms, full body orgasms. And not all of them include ejaculation. Limiting the male orgasm to the common ejaculation orgasm is like limiting the female orgasm to a clitoral orgasm. Its just limited. So why is this limiting belief out there? Honestly, I have no idea. Im actually quite flabbergasted by it. Its not that no one is talking about it and teaching other ways. Theres Mantak Chia with his best-selling book, The Multi-Orgasmic Man. Theres Barbara Kesslings How to Make Love All Night: And Drive a Woman Wild! Theres Tantra and Taoism, which have been teaching it for centuries. There are many contemporary sex coaches helping people get there. Let me tell you from my own experience that its not a walk in the park learning it. Because we have to deal with all the struggles mentioned within this very article. I cant go into the concrete hows at this point. But check out the above-mentioned books or Tantra workshops in your town. Theres so much more to it Okay, lets look back at what we now know: Most men suffer from low sensitivity in their penis due to non-beneficial masturbation habits. Men are stimulated locally. They dont require foreplay per se, but rather full-body stimulation during high states of arousal. Most men cant let go and show their vulnerability while making love due to gender roles and societal restrictions. The common belief is that the male orgasm is limited to the ejaculation orgasm With these points in mind, its not surprising that male sexuality is generally seen as very primitive. But imagine these three issues being resolved. That would mean men actually feel sensations in their penis. Able to feel vaginal walls. The swollen G-Spot. The entrance of the cervix. It would mean that men can spread orgasmic sensations throughout their entire body, instead of only experiencing them locally. That would mean men can surrender and let go during making love. Instead of being limited to being a mechanical penetrator. It would mean men are able to have multiple orgasms. Men could choose to ejaculate, or not to ejaculate. There is a huge variety of orgasms available to them. Under those circumstances, would you still claim that the male orgasm is simple and mechanical?"" URL"

The absolute best. A virtuoso of confident living. If John relapses, however, he **needs** to come to terms with an important fact: he needs to accept the fact that, for the next 2 weeks (or longer), he will now be facing the world using just the beta version 0.0 of John. And beta_version_John fucking sucks. You won't believe the lag and glitches it has. The fog of relapse puts John in this headspace of denial, denial, denial. And in the denial headspace, John will non-chalantly make plans to just ""pick up where he left off."" This leads to a false sense of security that will almost always end in John's re-relapse. All I'm saying is: John can't *hack* his brain into thinking he's ""John v.10.0"" again immediately after a relapse. But somehow his brain will trick him into thinking he can. This is just not how discipline works. Before he can commit to anything, he has to realize: He is Beta_version_John now and no amount of cold showers, meditation, or whatever can immediately alleviate that fact. The Beta John is vulnerable and reacts with volatility towards literally any negative emotion. He needs to be aware of this vulnerability and **FULLY** come to terms with it before making the attempt at NoFap again. I realize everyone's different. These are just my two cents no one asked for. NoFap is tough, but a relapse is fucking miserable. So I want to offer up some stuff I've learned that works for me. Maybe it'll help you. (I'm John if you couldn't tell) TL;DR: If you relapsed, stop the denial. Realize and accept that you're now (temporarily) the *worst* possible version of yourself. But don't stuff that feeling away: embrace it and then move onwards. "

I would be so desperate to even get to hang around a woman in a group of friends. After experimenting with numerous women the last few years, now, I'm ending a relationship with a wonderful girl, but whom ultimately I almost know and sense I won't FULLY connect with. NOFAP and new habits have changed me significantly for the better, but we're all human and have moments of vulnerability. I first saw this girl, and developed a crush while on a 100+ day hardmode streak. The hopeless romantic in me already classified her as a ""perfect girl"" at this time. Fast forward to now, we've been seeing each other for 5 months, I've purposely abstained from sex but she is very sweet an understanding - she still wants to stick around and is hooked on me. I pleasured her in different ways - she is also the type that COULD (but probably doesn't want to) wait until marriage. Either way, I've come to really admire her as a person, but NoFAP has given me an insane amount of self-control and dignity. I came to realize she's not even close to someone I would get along with in the long-term, even though we have become very close in many facets and would remain very good friends. I can definitely see the progress I've made on paper, but sometimes in moments like these, I truly feel the gravity of the changes that have taken place in me. A girl like this 5 years ago would be a distance dream, now it's a raw and almost cumbersome reality. It's a waste of both our time, and ultimately not fair to either of us. For the two years I've been fully focused on my business, going from an average salary to grossing well into six figures. My business, my goals, my social life and my health are all top priority - I'm not willing to sacrifice any of that for just anyone, but I will when I find the right one. The last 5 months ironically, have seen a dip in all these things as a result of this, but she is not someone I want to spend my life with so I will not allow that any further. All these concepts of self-worth being tied to getting married, having a girlfriend/boyfriend, losing your virginity, are all so bloody toxic and inconsequential. So a message to all the guys in their early twenties (or those who are worried about these concerns) they literally mean NOTHING to NOBODY. What gives you purpose in life is what defines your own esteem and self-worth - make it a beautiful thing you love the rest will follow. TLDR; NOFAP will give you the self-respect of a lion"

Your storys of success and failure in striving have inspired me. I'd say I have had a sex addiction for most of my adult life. Coming from an abusive upbringing didn't really give me the best start and because of it I was never really taught how to be a loving person. I have spent most of my life learning right from wrong as most of us have I'm certain, though dealing with trauma in amongst all of this has lead to some serious confusion. My longest streak of NoFap is about a week, and thats for as long as I can remember. I've massively cut down my use though; it used to be the I'd induldge 3-5 times a day minimum. Recently its been more 1 or 2 in the entire space of 24hrs. I'm excersising more and more, writing daily, reading daily, eating healthier and for once I seem to be holding down a job! Recently I feel head over heels in love with a woman who I blocked all contact with because of the vulnerability I felt. I'm no longer wanting to find my happiness from another person and I felt like trying to make a connection blossom without having fully came to my senses myself was a bad decision. This addiction has steamrolled through my life as it has often taken the reins and pulled my mind into its turbulent journey. No longer though! I will overcome my addiction and I will be the best person I know I can be. Thanks for reading and to each and every one of you thank you for choosing this journey of betterment. "
167,vulnerability,NoFap,Breakthrough: Anxiety Has Been Hijacking My Recovery and My Life,2,68byda,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/68byda/breakthrough_anxiety_has_been_hijacking_my/,2017-04-30 07:54:59,"Today I realized that anxiety has been making recovery (and the rest of my life) more difficult. It's amazing how being clean, daily meditation, and pursuing intimacy/vulnerability with my partner for a few weeks has given me much more clarity and perspective. My breakthrough started here: The School of Life [Why We're All So Anxious] (URL YouTube video Here are my take-aways. Some are redundant, but I find it helpful to formulate ideas in multiple ways. * Anxiety exists because we have to make most decisions with incomplete information. It is a holdover from early human development that protected us from animals and other threats. * Most people think ""when ____, then I won't be anxious."" They plan vacations and buy things to thwart their anxiety, but it is always there, even after their wildest dreams have come true (or more likely, when they're old with debt and tons of junk they don't need). * It's okay to have some anxiety. Be aware of it, but don't spend your whole life trying to escape it. It will always be there. * When you feel anxiety about something, don't treat it as something that shouldn't be present and has to be fixed. It will always be there! The real problem arises when you run around and do everything possible to eradicate it. If you just observe it without judgment, it loses its power. * Anxiety will always accompany everything in life, but it doesn't have to control everything. Once you accept that it will always be there, hitching a ride, you can enjoy life and accomplish things with the anxiety still there. If you stop enjoying life or pursuing your goals to fight/escape the anxiety, only then does it hurt you. * Don't take the presence of anxiety to be an indicator that something's wrong. The anxiety of recovery is no different. It's natural to be anxious about the unknown path of recovery, so don't let that get in your way or hijack your journey. One thing I struggle with sometimes is a FOMO about porn. What might I miss out on if I totally cut porn out of my life? There's an anxiety about not ""keeping up with"" porn. As [The Minimalists] (URL pointed out in a podcast once, you will miss out on roughly 100% of the ""things"" out there, despite your best efforts, so do things out of love, not out of fear. Life is too short to take part in things ""just in case"". So I learned that I just have to let that anxiety be there and pursue recovery anyway. Part of my recovery will be applying this principle to other areas of my life. I realized much of my life has been a diversion from my real goals in an attempt to quash anxiety. Realizing that it will always be there frees me from this endless pursuit."
168,vulnerability,NoFap,A 19 year old college student's experience with NoFap,5,68tvu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/68tvu6/a_19_year_old_college_students_experience_with/,2017-05-03 01:42:18,"Hello fellow fapstronaughts, Ive seen many posts of people sharing how their lives have been changed by NoFap and I figured I would contribute mine. Before: Im 19 and am a student. For most of my freshman year I was in a miserable, codependent relationship that I was too scared to leave. It never felt like I needed porn but I know it caused some issues. I never really wanted to have sex and was more excited about porn than my own girlfriend. I had very few friends and wasnt satisfied by the life I was living. I had many insecurities that I was doing nothing about. I felt like I constantly had to be right and I wasnt comfortable opening up to people about how I felt because I was afraid of how they would view me. My relationship, despite being the biggest source of unhappiness in my life, was comfortable. The constant fights and fear were easier to deal with than improving the rest of my life. I wasnt secure enough to set boundaries in my relationship because the rest of life wasnt great, my life wasnt great because my relationship consumed all of my time. In December 2016 I finally ended my relationship of 15 months. The Change: I went home for winter break and decided to make some changes. I wanted to be better at interacting with girls, I wanted to be confident, I wanted to be secure in who I was. The two resources I leaned on were r/seduction and r/NoFap, I stopped watching porn and only fapped once per week. The coffee shop became my training ground and I started approaching girls. The first few weeks of NoFap felt amazing, the superpowers were definitely real and I felt almost euphoric. Once I went back to school I continued to approach girls a develop my confidence. After a few weeks back at school I hit the flatline. I felt more depressed and anxious than I ever had before, admittedly it wasnt as bad as others have struggled with but it was still new to me. The friends I had drifted away from me and towards my ex, I really felt alone. I kept approaching people, kept going to the gym, kept eating well, and stayed away from porn. I also began seeing a therapist at my college. So far it has been 108 days since Ive watched porn and 78 days since I masturbated with no relapse, this is where Im at now. After: I approached an amazing girl on the bus one day and got her number, weve been dating for about 3 months now. On our second date we ended up having sex in her car, this was the first time she had ever had sex with someone so quickly. Her explanation was that she found my confidence and vulnerability incredibly attractive and simply wanted to have sex with me. I was still struggling with some erectile issues due to the flatline but those have since gotten better. We now have an amazing sex life, this is when I stopped masturbating. I honestly dont think masturbation is a massive deal when done on its own, porn is the greater evil in my book. I really love this girl and can see myself being with her for a long time, despite that Im secure enough to know that I would be fine without her. I now have a growing circle of friends and have taken up several hobbies such as climbing and guitar that I really enjoy. I still think Im on the tail end of the flatline but I have no doubt that my life far better than it was 6 months ago and will continue to get better. What helped the most: I would definitely recommend Feeling Good by David Burns. Even if you arent depressed, the practice of questioning emotions with rational thought is really helpful. I also found a lot of good information on r/seduction about social skills as well as building confidence, I would definitely recommend it. Lastly, stoic philosophy as a whole was quite helpful for me. Ive learned that the way I react to events in my life is my choice and my responsibility, this has helped me be less anxious and get more done. So thats my NoFap journey, I hope some of you find it helpful and I wish you all the best of luck on your journey. "

I've been masturbating and viewing pornography regularly since I was 11 and am now 28 and lately have really been thinking about how much time and energy it's taken away from me. I do it out of such strict habit that it's frustrating how quickly and mindlessly I turn to it. First thing in the morning, last thing at night, and sometimes in between. And it seems that the main way dudes talk about masturbation (even as you get older) is essentially just encouraging each other on. No one ever talks about the struggle that can often come along with it. I've been trying to make a lot of positive changes in my life and reading through these posts is helping me not only put my masturbation habit into perspective but other bad habits I have as well. I love how open this community is in talking not only about the daily struggle and sometimes moment to moment struggle of having this urge but also how compassionate everyone is to failure. It's very refreshing to see and something I need desperately in my life right now. To be able to remind myself that bettering yourself will mean that you are going to stumble and fall a lot. But that's only because you haven't had a lot of practice in challenging yourself to do things better. Anyway, I just wanted to pop in and say that. I hope to be coming back here often for inspiration. Thank you for providing a safe corner of the internet for people who recognize this as an issue for themselves and are earnestly trying to make a change. We need more communities like this not only online but in the real world as well for all sorts of different things people go through. Thanks for the inspiration. Day 0 for me. Here I go!!!"

I took a pledge to get out of it but I didnt know it would be so damm difficult. I relapse on an average of 7-11 days streak , and in those streak I experience all the benefits what people talk about and yes they are real.My longest streak is of 23 days. Since previous couple of weeks , I have been greatly introspecting of why I am not been able to succeed , I have watched so many videos on this and read articles too. I discovered how I got into this hole , its because I loved a girl , like really loved her , the kind of love you find in the books. Since she and I went seperate ways as she didnt reciprocate the same feelings (she did love me too, its complicated), I fell into this hole of PMO just to fight those feelings and vulnerability. Recently I have started to miss her more since I have realised this, maybe now those repressed feelings are coming back. Yet I am unable to abstain completely. Just now I watched a video of Terry Crews where he talks about porn addiction. One of the things he told was to talk about it , let your dirty secret out, hence here I am to get myself naked infront of you all (rather than infront of some illusionised reality) and show my scars. I wanna fight this but I guess I was fool to believe I could do it all alone. Guys I need your help , I have got big dreams , big shoes to fill , I need to get out of this. I am an ambivert , I have an army of friends yet I cant talk about it to anyone , I am ok with girls , but I am here for me. And I need you all to back me up please. I have a problem with expressing emotions thus Porn addiction got hold of me tighter, she was the only one I was comfortable expressing to , now these repressed emotion are channelizing through PMO. Here I am a 22 years old male , all naked and vulnerable infront of you."

Most people absolutely hate this feeling and avoid it as much as possible. Being vulnerable hurts. It's difficult. Even can be embarrassing. And as a result, these people don't learn new things or improve the old ones. This is NoFap. Buffing your banana just lands you back where you started. More often than not, it's holding you back. At the core, it's all some sort of sense of comfort for yourself. Realize you need to embrace this initial pain, this vulnerability, welcome it.

I'm addicted to porn. As hard as I try to fight it, my body goes on auto-pilot and looks up stuff when my body craves it. I crave it because I'm depressed. It's something deep in my soul. A hole that will never be filled. I've carried this weight with me my entire adulthood. It's just a truth about me. I self medicate. Weed, drinking, PMO, sex. Pleasure. They help me escape this inescapable pain inside me. But I am trapped by pleasure. Sex transforms from a beautiful experience of connection and love into an energy-draining, tiresome, repetitive feeding of my insatiable appetite for avoiding my darkest inner demons. My superpowers are gone. I can't face the demons. The only time I felt equipped and energized enough to overcome them was on a 3-week monk-mode streak. I'm in a relationship now, and she's absolutely wonderful. She feels like my soul mate in a lot of ways. You would think having a great relationship with amazing sex would be my goal all along, but now I wonder, am I meant to become celibate in order to achieve a higher spiritual state? A state that is able to resist my depression? Last weekend I shut down. Depression stormclouds filled my sky and blocked out all the light. I withdrew. I had no interest in seeing my girlfriend, or having sex. Too much effort. Too much emotional vulnerability. I was feeling hopeless. But I wanted to escape it. I broke down and bought weed with intent to dull my conscious mind enough to relapse on porn I had been browsing and collecting all afternoon. Somehow I resisted, but it has exposed just how strong my addictions are. I don't know who I am or what I want. Everything seems to be reaction to depression or anxiety.Everything is just a form of avoidance or self-medication. **tl;dr** Coming to terms with your psychological imbalances makes it hard to find yourself. I'm addicted to avoiding the pain I have inside me. Why am I still burdened with depression when my life is going decently O.K.?"

I've been doing pretty well so far on my streak, but in recent days I've been having issues getting up in the morning. I usually snooze for a bit and resist getting out of bed when I wake up. This has led to a risky vulnerability where I've started viewing P before getting out of bed (Luckily I've managed to resist O, but I know I can't keep that going). I think tonight I'll put my phone somewhere far enough that I have to stand and walk to get it. I think I'll also find an alarm clock with no snooze button. But besides that I'm trying to be more productive and energetic in my morning. I have an opportunity to really make the most of it, but getting out of bed has become a really big problem lately. I was wondering if anyone here have techniques or advice on waking up and having the willpower to stay out of bed. Thank you very much!"

181,vulnerability,NoFap,Day 365. The downside of Nofap,532,5h211c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5h211c/day_365_the_downside_of_nofap/,2016-12-08 06:43:59,"After 14 years of various streak, I've made it to day 365. I've been lurking Nofap for years but this is my first post on Reddit. (I am in a rush so excuse the formatting and the minor errors) One thing I have not seen that often, is the sideefffects of Nofap. Everyone who held a streak for more than a week sees undeniable benefits. The longer the streak, the more potent the benefits become. The community mainly focuses on and shares the benefits and the upsides. As most of the posts are focused on superpowers, health and social benefits of Nofap, there are some negative side effects that are not touched upon. To create a realistic expectation for all those who are new to Nofap, I want to shed some light on these negative side effects. Sometimes, in your weakest moments, that's the only excuse you need to relapse if your not prepared. Everyone is different so your experiences might be different. These are the side effects I've felt: ""Increased sense of vulnerability"" I've used PMO to deal with most stressful and painful situations in my life. It was my main and sometimes only coping skill. Now on this streak and all the streaks before, I experience a feeling of emotional nakedness. A deep rooted feeling that something in my life is missing. A void is replaced by the pleasures of PMO. I have not developed natural ways to fine tune my emotional immune system. So I was constantly on an emotional roller coaster. I know that theres a huge list of ways to deal with this feeling (meditating, cold showers, etc.) which I've earnestly done. If I didn't have the time or energy, they became very difficult to do. I guess that's what happens when I've shotgunned my brain with dopamine, on a daily bases, for 14 years. ""Mild depression"" Have you seen an addict leave rehab happy or excited? Not as often as the ones leaving depressed and lost. When you've abused your reward system for as long I have, it's extremely unrealistic to expect superpowers after going 90 days clean. Now, you've taken away the main tool your brain uses to regulate its pleasure mechanisms. Sometimes, your highly intelligent brain does not react to that by giving you superpowers. So that fake sense of happiness will be replaced with emotional emptiness. This has sometimes developed into mild depression. ""Feelings of being lost"" This is the way I saw it. I had a great life going for me. Supportive friends, loving family and a hot girlfriend. I had school, my responsibilities and my future to take care of. Then I go to prison for 14 years. Once I'm Out, I'm expected to immediately pick up where I left off. PMO is that prison. Once you are out you will have years of accumulated responsibilities staring dead into your soul. I've fapped away my entire early adulthood to avoid growing. Because of that, I've built no intrinsic skills to deal with life. When I first picked up momentum with Nofap, the feelings of being lost and helpless was insanely dreadful. After being gone for so long, how would u know where to start? ""Sensitivity to all the damages done"" Only in the first month I realized my life was going no where with my life. Had no friends, socially awkward, had a laundry list of mental issues caused by PMO, and girls couldn't stand me. Even the lowest scumbags on the bottom of the social pole looked down on me. Not only that, all of this realizations blew up in my face all at once. Sure you won't be this person anymore because of Nofap. You will however live with the fact that you once were. To the crimes you've committed against yourself, there is no one to answer to except yourself. You will have so many moments where you slap your forehead and say ""I can't believe I was like that."" Oh well, no use crying over spilled tea. Progress is the only way forward. The only way to atone for your past is with future accomplishments. No amount of sadness, grief or regret can do the same. ""Superpowers won't last"" The ""superpowers"" are amazing and they will come. You also have to realize that it too shall pass. You are only being sensitive to to all the skills, strengths and ""regular -powers"" you already possessed. Sad to say, for the average guy with no PMO issues, ""superpowers"" is just another Tuesday. So don't be distracted by the benefits. It's your brain's way of telling you everything is alright, it won't hurt to fap anymore. Naturally, your addiction is blowing them out of proportion. Like porn, your brain will eventually desensitize to these superpowers. However, It will only pave the way for you to develop your ""regular-powers"" From what I've learned, this is caused by the fact that you've addicted your brain to PMO. The only way it regulates emotional and mental mechanisms is by using porn and fapping. So It will constantly look for ways to justify making you sad and miserable, only to get you to fap again. When your brain needs its fix, IT DOES NOT HOLD BACK. Since it won't rest, neither should you. Persistence and steadfastness are your only allies to create this new lifestyle. After months of not PMOing, there will be times you feel worse than when you fapped. You are still a human being with inadequcies. My advice, don't get attached to the benefits and accept the side effects. Take the good with the bad. Edit: Grammer, Formatting. Edit: I don't mean to discourage anyone from Nofap. I had an amazing journey with quitting. It improved my life beyond what I could've imagined. That being said, there were some dark dark days in my journey. I feel who ever is committed will see both the light and the darkness of their addiction. So despite the negativity, I only wrote this hoping to help. To help you brace for impact when you fall from years of PMO."
182,vulnerability,NoFap,Well I've done it. 90 days,42,5hsyp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5hsyp5/well_ive_done_it_90_days/,2016-12-12 09:48:09,"Long and short of it. I feel good. NoFap has been interesting. Porn was always something I took completely for granted and never considered to be something someone could be addicted to. The larger theory of dopamine abuse makes sense for how porn, or really anything, can become addictive. But in understanding that, and applying it to porn and masturbation it's not difficult to see how much more easily PMO can be *abused* and taken to unhealthy extremes. Forget about 'benefits' for a minute and there is a great value in taking time to assess and consider your behavior and the choices you make. NoFap has helped me to own *my* decision making better than before. As well as to simply give me a template for identifying things that I otherwise might have been oblivious to. I intend I'll finish out the year and then re-assess what my relationship to PMO will be moving forward from that. I maintain that Masturbation isn't inherently wrong or evil or bad for you. Infrequently and for the 'right' reasons, anyway. It's fine. Porn is more damaging. It's hard to imagine a scenario where I'd want to look at it again. A point about NoFap that I feel needs to be said. Is that it isn't unlocking any greater mystical truths of the universe or tapping into some superior natural way of thinking. I keep reading posts where people take this concept to extremes or try to use it as a bludgeon for their own pet beliefs. Textbook case of ""When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail"". It *is* a useful tool for self-improvement. PMO tends to be done secretly and with some sense of shame or embarrassment. Removing that from your life is a productive and positive thing. Alongside this, there *are* a bevy of 'benefits' that appear apparent to anyone who has stuck it out long enough. But try to keep things grounded and within reason. It is one thing. There are many others. It is important to understand what NoFap is and what it isn't because running away with the sort of fantasies I see people posting here is every bit the self-serving dopamine abuse that porn is. Be wary when people try to co-opt this community to service an agenda. People come here to prey on vulnerability. Stay focused on *your* goal and *your* self-improvement. Visiting NoFap itself can become a habit of its own, so stay mindful of what you're even doing, and remember how easy it was to slip into the porn addiction and the mechanisms by which it occurred. Personally, I feel that social media addiction overall (including reddit) is similar to Porn addiction but more difficult to deal with. Porn is more one-dimensional and removing it is comparatively easier because it is already something you did in secret. Approaching the internet or social media use overall requires more decision making and more willpower. Broad abstention is probably untenable, but strategic improvement and active processing how it is used is probably viable. That will be my next project moving forward, anyway. Anyway. It's been good. Hope everyone here can learn something from it as well. "

Thank you all for all of your comments and your vulnerability to be so honest with your experiences. I wanted to get some advice from you guys and will do my best to make this as short as possible, though there is a ton of information to fit in, so here it goes, and thank you for reading! Also, I have just recently done 100 days no ejaculation, no masturbation, and no porn (I broke the no ejaculation streak with a hook-up at 105 days.) So I'm committed to finding the answer, but still feel I have a ways to go. I've masturbated as far as I can remember (3 years old?). In fact, I would get a lot of flack from my oldest brother about this growing up, because I'd get caught doing it a lot(maybe this caused subconscious sexual insecurity?) Regularly started looking at porn pictures around 12 years old (I was like 5 when I saw my first hustler..some super zoomed in pic of a chic with a dick in her mouth....I was like that's awesome!) Started regularly looking at porn pictures and short video clips throughout high school, and really started to ramp up the porn viewing from the ages of 20-26. I moved to Los Angeles from the Midwest just over 2 years ago. The day before I moved to LA was the last day I've viewed porn, and I'm very proud of that. Though, I had a giant support network back home, and my move to Los Angeles has been very stressful. In fact, I became suicidally depressed earlier this year and had to travel to another state to get therapy for a lifetime of issues which I won't go into for this post. As of today, I get compliments all the time on how healthy I look and girls complement me all the time. I'd say I'm an objective 7/10, but with my charm, I seem to attract very good looking women. One of sports biggest celebrities recent exes gave me her number without me asking, and we went on a coffee date. I've always been super sexually charged, and masturbated on average probably 2 times a day to porn for 6 years I'd say. I never did anything with a girl until I was 26 and lost my virginity then. Since, I have hooked up several times, but still no relationship. The fact that I've never had a relationship in my life haunts me. I just recently had dated a girl for a couple weeks. She would compliment me about how good I was in bed, and would always send a follow up text when we were done hanging out. One night she came over tipsy/drunk and was shit-testing me and I wasn't having it. While I was very irritated and she knew it, I kept a low, calm voice when I told her we don't communicate on the same level and she ended up leaving. That was the end of that. I've only had morning wood a couple times a month for the last several months. I think I was just so damn comfortable and conditioned to get a raging hard on with my porn habit and now that that has been gone for 2 years, my body just doesn't know how to get super aroused without it. Like by myself I was so use to really letting go, but now I think I feel weird and/or self conscious doing that in front of a girl. I have more of the gentlemen in the street/freak in the bed thing going so maybe my ego just doesn't let me really let go in the bedroom because it clashes with my mysterious, hard to get, chill guy street personality. I do feel I need to start lifting heavy weights again and join a boxing gym or something. I stay active by jumping rope, hiking a lot, and doing light weights, planks, mobility exercises. I work with only women and a primarily women clientele, which on one side is glorious (these women are gorgeous). On the other side, it's too much estrogen, and I've had to learn turn my libido off while at work. It was getting to a point where I had precum all day, because these girls are quite flirty (and so was I until recently). When I moved to Los Angeles, I told myself I wanted to live out a lot of my porn viewing fantasies with real women. I was a dirty tinder dog for a little over a year and just deleted it last week (maybe the Tinder browsing never let my brain rewire from porn?). I had several hookups, but with those came the pressure and anxiety of performing. It usually took me a while to get an erection, and the girls were understanding for the most part, but I'm still wondering why I'm not able to pop an erection with a real girl at the same speed as my porn watching days. I was also able to maintain the erection as long as possible while viewing porn, but in sex, I can hold it sometimes for a while, but the instant I feel bored, it just goes away. I'm lost as to how much of this is hormones and/or psychological. Ive never been tested for hormone levels, but I'm usually pretty damn firey, intense, and punch walls regularly because I get angry or really amped up about life. I would think my T is fine. My thoughts are that I'm still in some weird rewiring phase. It's really hard when you spent your whole life alone in a room jacking it to porn, then pulling that out cold turkey but not having a relationship to plug that sex drive into. All the hookups I've had were either one night or the dating only last a couple of weeks. I've always wanted that fairy-tale relationship, but I'm so confused and scrambled as to that being bullshit or a possibility. I've read up on ""being a man"" for the last 7 years and there's so much conflicting info. I was raised by my mom, who is amazing, but really conditioned too much of my feminine side. I have a ""manly, dominate"" side, but often times it comes out from an unbalanced, rageful state. Anyway, what are your guys experiences and/or opinions relating to my issues of fear of intimacy and feeling a bit concerned about my lack of morning wood and random erections? I just had a relatively good erection last week, so it seems it can get up strong, but when it used to get rock hard multiples times a day during the porn years, and now down to a couple times a month (maybe)...it just seems...weird... Though to be fair, the composure I have most of the time around women is pretty boss since quitting porn, so that's a benefit. It's like my mind/body is in a confused state and doesn't know how to handle my arousal because there simply aren't outlets constructed to handle the sheer level of sexual drive I have. I do a lot of the things mentioned in this forum when I'm tempted to masturbate to instagram pics of girls (go for long walks, read, cold showers, I played guitar heavily for 7 years but lost my passion since moving to LA). I mean, I sometimes will get home from a full shift at work then go for like a 7 mile walk and still come back bored and not tired. I use to have a really great social life in middle school (LOL that was forever ago). I know I need a social life, but I feel institutionalized from my isolation the last 10 years. It's like, you know what you need to do, but it feels like punching under water to get any kind of result. Baby steps is an understatement here. From the outside, I appear very confident, composed, and healthy. People say people love me. People say I'm funny. Others think I'm a wise monk. But, on the inside...I'm terribly alone and haunted by my fear of connection and regular friendships/companionship. Thank you for reading and any constructive criticism you may have. "

What basically means is that you avoid looking in the mirror totally or you stop being self critical by analyzing your appearance and just briefly look in the mirror to see you don't got fucked up hair or stuff like that. But the key here is stop posing in the mirror like your on the cover of GQ lol. Their is a spiritual aspect to this to because it allows you to focus more on your inner self rather than flesh and bone that makes up your body. Looking back on life I've had the problem of always staring in the mirror and trying to perfect my appearance especially after being bullied for how I look. I know it happens to everyone at some point but to those with the vulnerability it can have a compounding effect. But yeah, my hatred towards my body appearance is definitely one contributing factor to my fapping addiction. Escaping through sensual pleasures. So I would say to those on the spiritual path or just trying to be more accepting of yourself this could be of great help. Just another tool to destroy the pain of ignorance that afflicts us lol. "

In realizing the damage PMO is causing us, we tell ourselves it's wrong, bad and we become shameful of our action. Even going as far as creating NoFAP or using the shame to motivate us in it. We struggle in this addiction to make sense of it. We call ourselves perverts, we fight society in its constant use of sex sells. But what's really going on? PMO, or more appropriately, porn &amp; sex addiction is far much more than just about porn or masturbating. It's us as humans using addiction to mask emotions, feelings, damage. Whether it be an abusive upbringing (physical of emotional) a matter of circumstance, or a hiding from responsibility and the world (fantasy), we forget to really delve in the real issues at hand. The underlying issues. NoFAP is only going to be beneficial to you if you're ready to face your demons and ready to change. Not just changing your hand position and the content you browse on the internet... But the shame you put yourself thru, whether it's shame from the past, present or future is irrelevant. Letting go is hard. And this journey you may be embarking on... New or ongoing... Is the hardest thing you'll probably ever have to do. You must be open to change... Open to emotional growth. For me, this journey has been learning that for 18 years I've pushed aside my emotions and feelings for the addiction. Now that I'm in recovery, I'm learning how hurtful vulnerability is... How infantile my emotions and feelings are, because at the root, I resented my family for never teaching me or showing me heathy emotions. This isn't just a choice. It's a lifestyle. It's a complete overhaul of your life. We don't look at porn just for the instinctual quell... We do it because we can't be bothered to put in the real work it takes to have a connection, to love, to have sex. We do it because we're hiding from life. We're in this together. Stop shaming yourself and being sad, take ownership and responsibility for the damage you've been through. Only you, as a man and adult, are responsible for yourself. You're not a bad person. Of course we've all made bad choices, made mistakes, even done bad things... But we are not bad people. We are loved. You are loved. Good luck on your journey. "

It was my first coed large group interview. At some point, a young man in his early twenties explained how he had recently divorced his wife after coming back from serving in the military and finding out that she was havind an affair. He said he wasn't surprised because he never felt ""good enough for her"". He explained that he constantly asked her what she needed and wanted, and that every time he got close to meeting her needs, she ""moved the goalpost another ten feet.""* *A young woman in the class spoke up and said, ""Guys are the same way. They're never satisfied either. We're never pretty, sexy, or skinny enough."" Within seconds a conversation broke out about body image and sex. The discussion was mostly about how it's so scary to have sex with someone you care about when you're worried about how your body looks. The young women who started the conversation said, ""It's not easy to have sex and keep your stomach sucked in. How can we get into it when we're worried about our back fat?""* *The young man who had shared the story of his divorce slammed his hand down on his desk and shouted, ""It's not about the back fat! You're worried about it. We're not. We don't give a shit!"" The class fell completely quiet. He took a couple of deep breaths and said, ""Stop making up all of this stuff about what we're thinking! What we're really thinking is 'Do you love me? Do you care about me? Do you want me? Am I important to you? Am I good enough?' That's what we're thinking. When it comes to sex, it feels like our life is on the line, and you're worried about that crap?""* *At that point, half of the young men in the room were so emotional that they had their faces in their hands. A few girls were in tears, and I couldn't breathe. The young woman who had brought up the body image issue said, ""I don't understant. My last boyfriend was always criticizing my body.""* *The young vet who had just brought us all to our knees replied, ""That's because he's an asshole. It's not because he's a guy. Some of us are just guys. Give us a break. Please.""* ... *""I sat down with a therapist who had spent more than twenty-five years working with men. He explained that from the time boys are eight to ten years old, they learn that initiating sex is their responsibility and that sexual rejection soon becomes the hallmark of masculine shame.* *He explained, ""Even in my own life, when my wife isn't interested, I still have to battle feelings of shame. It doesn't matter if I intellectually understand why she's not in the mood. I'm vulnerable and it's very difficult."" When I asked him about his work around addiction and pornography, he gave me an answer that helped me understand that issue in an entirely new light. He said, ""For five bucks and five minutes, you think you're getting what you need, and you don't have to risk rejection.""* *At the end of my interview with this wonderful and wise man, he said, ""I guess the secret is that sex is terrifying for most men. That's why you see everything from porn to the violent, desperate attempts to exercise power and control. Rejection is deeply painful.""* After reading this I hope that some of you have changed your view or convinced yourselves even more, that pornography is not the way to meaningfull relationships with your partner or with other people!

Tired. Sleepy. It's probably because of a high carb breakfast, even though I drank matcha after eating. Still low energy. Caffeine didn't work. *** ##**Resolution** It's time to go full hard mode. No excuses. I was planning on doing it after 60 days of no MO (without relapsing of course), but shit happened. No point wasting my time blaming myself. I've been relapsing over and over since beginning this journey last year. I'm almost reaching 2 years of Nofap, yet 56 days is the longest I've ever been without MO since childhood. These days, I've been walking a life full of problems and disappointments. Frustrated for not having a job for months now. I do want a freakin' day job with regular days but I kept on getting offers from jobs that require irregular and graveyard shifts. This may sound as if I'm picky and all, but I do have a plan. The reason why I want a day job is because I want to study at night to preparing myself for a career that I really want. I can't do that with a irregular days with graveyard shifting. Those stress was probably the reason why I still look up for porn even though I'm not masturbating to any of it for 56 days. I thought I was over it. I thought I was in control. I thought looking or peeking in for a bit (once or twice a week) wouldn't do any harm. Well, it didn't. If it did, it was subtle. It took form when I was vulnerable yesterday night when a thought came over me. When I woke up this morning, I realized how stupid the idea was. I nearly caused a relationship breakdown with my girl best-friend because of my sexual frustration. I wasn't thinking straight. And that was bloody embarrassing. Well, no more. Hard mode it is. If I do this now, I'll be in 78 days by the end of the year (if my calculation is correct). Not bad for a new record. Also, without MO was an improvement, how much more without porn? I'm curious what would happen to my brain without total abstinence. Any insight guys? By the way, does any one of you fappers out there have a reactive hypoglycemia (low blood sugar even though you're not diabetic)? Does it go away? Any inputs would be awesome and appreciated. Thank you for reading. Have a nice day."

You all seem lovely. I'm not quite sure of the vibe here, but I'll share some of my story anyway. I'm feeling a little ashamed and so I'm going to try and overcome that with vulnerability. Right, here we are. About 14 hours since the last fap. I've been a serious Christian for the last few years, and a missionary for most of that, and while I was in an incredibly supportive community, things were great, fap-wise. But now I'm outside of that and I've realized I need that community. I love my God but I'm not always good at seeing how harmful my short-term thinking can be in the moment and really, I selfishly put myself first. I need a support group and I don't get it locally, at least not right now. I'm new in my area and most people I know don't really care about stuff like this. So I'm looking to you guys and gals for that. If you can post your personal best practices that might not be listed in the FAQs, I'd appreciate it. Thanks all."

My biggest fear was that she told all of her friends how I couldn't get it up with her. That time of my life seemed like rock bottom, and may not be as bad as some of your experiences, but here is how it's changed! SINCE DISCOVERING GARY WILSON AND NOFAP 2ND SEMESTER JUNIOR YEAR: (keep in mind my main reason for doing this is no longer just for women). 1.) yes i have seen all the benefits orhers have mentioned which includes nore authentic conversations and interactions with women. 2.) my "" hatred"" mindset for women was warped by my father in addition to porn, but I am beginning to no longer see them as sex objects. 3.) FRIENDSHIPS: this was huge because a lot of guys hated my guts for pussy things I did, but to make it worse i was just in denial for mt actions, and i never actually apologized. Now that i am on nofap, i am up front and honest about what i did wrong, and people respect the shit out of me for taking responsibility for my actions. 4.) i've discovered that hiding my true self was not only a matter of hiding my porn use, but every inch of my being, which made people subconsciously not respect me. I fixed a relationship with a housemate because of something disrespectful i said months ago, but we're aready back on a good track.

I'm not sure my biggest point i wanna make here guys, but just know that yeah i have gotten better with women, but i urge you to stay persistent in the quest because you'll discover that the conquest of women is not the orimary focus in life, nor should it be. I've taken up guitar, started playing sports again, lifting, getting better grades, and got a raise at my job!!! For some who need some motivation: ""Some of us scramble to the bleakest worst-case scenario when joy rears its vulnerable head, while others never even see joy, preferring to stay in an unmoving state of perpetual disappointment"".

The say vulnerability is the key to success, so here goes. 2016 marks the year that I finally woke up and realised the effect chronic Fapping has had on my life and its thanks to all you guys, but I feel like a complete idiot! Like really f*cking stupid! Im 35, unemployed, living with parents, overweight, broke, in debt, single, I have social anxiety and for the past 6 years at least Ive been battling severe depression. Cue violins. I started Fapping when I was 11 and remember getting erections from the age of 6 and having to hide them. My porn addiction started at 12 by cutting out and keeping pics of advertised softcore porn videos in the back of Sunday tabloids which resulted in me having a rucksack full of cut-outs that Id hide under my bed. By 14 I was spending hours in the bathroom jerking off to these pics and sometimes it took me less than 10 seconds to cum. I bought my first porno mag at 15, not being IDd and briskly walked home with a boner that I tried to hide and with my heart pounding so hard it felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. And its this feeling Ive realised that Ive been trying to seek and re-create ever since. Unfortunately it led to buying way too many mags, videos and DVDs. I finally got my first kiss at 18 and despite the fact the person I was kissing was stunningly attractive I remember not being able to get a boner and wondering why. When it came to my first (and onlyso far) relationship a year later me having ED was a massive problem, not only for my partner but also for me psychologically. I had no idea that porn and chronic Fapping was to blame, I just thought there was something wrong with me physically and that Id have to accept never being able to have proper sex or being in a relationship. During the relationship I masturbated regularly and it was a constant source of arguments  I couldnt see that I was the problem! What a dick I was! Needless to say the relationship ended after 9 months. Of course then when the porn tube sites started around 10 years ago I was still in ignorant bliss and never looked back and like many others its resulted in me spending increasing hours of each day looking at more extreme porn and things that would never turn me on in real life, but my brain wanted me to get that rush that I had back as an early teenager and Ive rarely been able to get there. Some days Id be jerking off 9 times a day until I had nothing left. Even on family holidays Id be jerking off in the bathroom or be late for stuff because Fapping was a priority. I used it for stress relief and I used it to get to sleep at night. But NEVER until this year did I realise how much of a problem it was. Im pretty gutted thats its taken me this long to understand the problem and most of my life since the age of about 14 has felt like Ive literally been walking through jelly: brain fog and underachieving. But despite all this Im optimistic that I can change all this  I want connection with someone so much that Im now on day 5 of NoFap and my head feels clearer than ever. Yes Im flatlining a bit and yes urges to look at porn do come strongly (I guess old habits) but already Im starting to sort out bits in my life that Ive put off for many years because I seem to be more motivated. Im not expecting miracles (Ive managed to get to day 5 twice in the last month but relapsed), my brain may never fully recover, I've probably got a sea of emotions to battle but its comforting that Im not the only one going through this like I originally thought, and that theres an amazing support network out there. What's frustrating more than anything is that when I'm busy I NEVER think about Fapping, but when I'm at home something seems to take over me. The desire to Fap becomes stronger than anything else I want in my life, until now. Sorry for the long post (my first one) I just needed to write some of this down to see even clearer. Thanks to all of your help Im rebooting my life, I'm determined to succeed and I feel amazing. I've never gone more than a couple of days of not Fapping in over 20 years until now. A long journey ahead but PMO all the way!"

You've deleted your porn collection. You haven't fapped for 90 days. Hell, it's *beyond* 90 days now. You're a machine. A god. You've done the unspeakable. Okay, let's not go that far, but shit, you're making strides and it feels *damn good.* Fast forward. You've made the first kiss. You've played your cards right. You're attracted to her, she's attracted to you. She's hot. You're hot. *It's on.* You're both alone. The starry night sky hovers above you. The chirps of crickets permeate the warm summer air. She looks at you with those *pleading* eyes. The ones that say *""Please. I want you now. Please.""* With that seductive combination of power and vulnerability you *know* you can't resist, despite being all too aware it'll end up as your undoing. Then there's the *breath* between you. The slow damp heavy breath leaving a tension so thick you could almost see it. The tension between you is electrifying as your tongues becomes locked in a dance of two snakes joined together in the flames of desire. You lose yourself. The outside world falls away as the dance *builds* and *builds* until reaching its inevitable climax. The burning flames growing stronger and stronger, engulfing you within their motions, like the crashing waves of the hot tropical sea. How much time has passed? 5 minutes? 30? An hour? It doesn't matter. She's amazing. Totally hot yet completely ordinary, a catch in every way yet humble, deeply intelligent yet playful. The dance. It's beautiful, it's exciting, it's unpredictable, **it's everything you ever wanted.** Then you begin to lose who you are. Just *little by little*. It's almost imperceptible at first. You spend 2 days a week together. Then 3. Then 4 as you meet day after day to dance and to play. Normally, you're on top of your shit. You've got a routine. Wake up early, meditate, do a little yoga, go for that run, read that book, hit the office early and conquer the workplace. *But things are different now.* **You've got a new partner.** ""Staying up until midnight isn't *that* late."" ""It's not *that* bad if I get up just an *hour* later."" ""I suppose if I miss *just one* day of working out it won't kill me."" Next it's *two* hours. Then *three.* Before you know it you're going to bed at 4 am every night. Waking up 10. You haven't worked out in two weeks. You don't even remember your goals. How did it come to this? You wake up. She's resting her head on your chest. Breathing lightly. She is beautiful. You do care about her. You do. But do you still care about yourself? *Do you remember who you are?* **Is this what you want?** **Don't forget who you are.** Just because you get the girl, the *battle doesn't end*. **The battle rages on.** Embrace the beautiful moments in which you are allowed to rest. Be grateful for them. Be grateful and recognize how far you've come. Reap the benefits. *Enjoy them. Make the best of them.* **You earned it.** **But the battle is never over.** You are a *man.* You are *committed.* Because there are things that are *bigger* than getting the girl. *Bigger* than sex. *Bigger* than being comfortable. You've got *goals.* You are a *warrior.* You've got a *world to conquer.* You've got a **vision.** You know there is a man in there who's been struggling to break through into the world since the day you were born and by god, **you're not going to let him down.** After the day's battle is done, by all means *enjoy the life you've got.* Relax. Crack open a cold beer. Take a dip in the pool. Get a massage. Go dance with your women until neither of you can move any longer. Go dance all until the sun comes up. Dance until you're both drenched in sweat and panting, and neither of you can even bring words to your lips because you just broke all your oxytocin receptors with the most earth shattering orgasms either of you has ever experienced. But *never forget.* Never forget who you truly are. Never forget the battle you're here to win. **Not just for you. But for all of us.** The night after you dance, get your rest. Then get up early that next morning like you committed and go *fight that battle.* *For yourself. For the man inside. For the woman you care about. For your family. Your friends.* **For all of us rooting for you.** **The Battle is Never Over.**"

Huge amounts of energy, projects are closing ($$$) and I feel dominant without feeling apologetic about it. I'm losing weight like crazy (it feels good to be cut and fit into my old suits). My skin is returning to it's Italian Olive tone like it was when I was a boy. I successfully sobbed this past weekend, felt amazing. Even buying a Land Rover next week (CPO is the way to go). For the past few weeks, I found myself napping all the time, between NoFap, Keto and 2/day exercise I don't yearn for naps any longer. Maybe it's a run of good fortune. Despite dead dick, for literally months (it remains dead), I'm starting to have urges but they're different. With PMO they had a dull tone, seeking the neurotransmitters like I would answer the door for an unwelcome guest. Today, urges have a dominant peacefulness to them, I feel in control of the situation but I'm still attentive. Dead dick had the benefit of no urges, I'm cautious about the temptation. I don't feel done healing/growing and I'm curious what the urges will look like when I'm done (if being done/plateauing is even a thing). As the urges mount, I'm not sure if I'll end up accumulating enough distractions that I'll use it as motivation (like President George W. Bush &amp; alcoholism) or if the vulnerability of downtime will bring me to a new level of discipline. Maybe this is what my nervous system is like without PMO. I successfully sobbed a few days ago, I feel more at peace and more alone than ever before but I still yearn for more growth. Is it ever over? "
195,vulnerability,NoFap,Not carrying that feeling of guilt is worth all the struggle you go through. Here is my story so far.,81,4ppkqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4ppkqb/not_carrying_that_feeling_of_guilt_is_worth_all/,2016-06-25 08:22:59,"Hi guys, my first long post on Reddit ever. For starters, a little background info on me. I am a 19 year old student who has watched way too much porn in his high school days. I discovered internet porn when I was around 13-14 years old and usually PMO'd 3-4 times a week; sometimes more, sometimes less. I discovered this sub around a year ago and the supportive vibe and promising stories on the NoFap subreddit instantly drew me in. So then I decided to try it. Just as a lot of you guys I had a lot of trouble getting a proper run going for the first time. I couldn't go a week without PMO. Eventually, after about 10 failed, short attempts and reading lots of success stories on this sub I managed to go 27 days without it. The month after 26 days, and after that streak I went on to two months of no PMO. I felt some changes, but the (end of the) flatline got to me on every streak. I would start browsing erotic pictures, which of course escalated and led me right back to jerking it to porn. LPT: don't ever browse for pics that are meant to arouse you sexually. You can't handle it, period. After the streak of 60 days, I struggled and had a couple of short streaks, which ultimately led me to my current one. When I started my ongoing streak I thought it was time to make more changes in my life instead of just abstinence from PMO. I began lifting at the gym even more than before, started leaving my comfort zone regularly and have made cold showers a daily routine. This is a must, NoFap alone won't give you the change you want. I have now gone 80 days without PMO, and I don't intend to ever go back to that shithole. Where I was still a little doubtful of the effects of NoFap before my current streak, this one has completely changed that. Enough about my NoFap history, let's go on to what you are truly interested in: the benefits and stuff I improved on. You guys most probably know that feeling of shame when talking to a girl when you PMO regularly. You feel disgusted, it clouds your thinking, etc. This was a major problem for me, because it had a big effect on my social interactions and anxiety at school, in college, at parties or in a club. I couldn't keep a conversation going well enough, girls or guys. I had trouble not giving a shit about stuff I had no control over and leaving my comfort zone was something unheard of for me, besides the couple of times I had consumed some alcoholic beverages. Of course there were good times, but this was not because I created them. I can now safely say there is nothing left of that feeling of shame and it is fucking amazing. This alone is worth all of the effort you have to put in NoFap. Just last night at a house party I was talking to and joking around with a sweet, beautiful brunette, who is definitely into me. Not once did I think of porn or anything related to it (besides the fact that I obviously want to fuck her brains out). I was purely in the moment and only focused on fun, and that's certainly something that has attracted her to me. I had a great night with her and I am certain there is more to come in the nearby future. This was at a house party with around 25-30 people (including at least 10 girls), and I had never met most people who were there before. It was a strange reality for me, because never had girls thrown themselves to me like this on this scale. It was ridiculous. They were hovering around me, initiating conversation with me, flirting openly and there was lots of touching. The weird thing is I put absolutely no effort in trying to woo them or pick them up. I was just being myself, and NoFap made that possible. I have also noticed that I cannot walk down the street without girls ogling me. Hitting the gym and a getting good haircut and a clean stubble have improved my confidence but I don't think it's just those that cause all those girls gazing. The science behind this phenomenon is not convincing enough (yet), but I can certainly say from my experience this year that when on NoFap, I have been far more attractive to women than when I PMO frequently. Another huge profit is that I am comfortable being more vulnerable now. I have always been somewhat afraid of intimacy, as in sharing personal stuff about myself or physical contact wit people. This trait or skill of vulnerability is something I'm still very focused on improving, so this is more of a long term thing. This leads me to leaving your comfort zone. This is a must guys. If you want to improve your self esteem, you have gotta stop keeping yourself on safe grounds all the time. Leave your comfort zone once every day. Start a conversation with that stranger sitting on a bench in the park. Take cold showers. Go do shit on your own. Make a fool of yourself in front of other people. Take the lead more often. Oh, and approach that stunning girl in the bar. Anything that makes you uncomfortable. Contrary to other reports on here, I have not noticed any big changes in my facial hair, simply because I hadn't payed any attention to it on my first streaks. I don't plan on testing it, for obvious reasons. I must also add that at the moment I'm still flatlining (although not very severe), and I have been taking ceterizine pills against hay fever. Those pills are known to cause sleepiness, so I look forward to seeing what happens when the season's over and I can stop using them. I am hopeful the effects of NoFap will be even more apparent by then. Okay guys, time to wrap it up. A little summary of some of the things I have done or gained during this streak: - I have made some great new friends, both male and female - I met a wonderful girl I instantly hit it off with and I look forward to seeing how it develops between her and I. - I am way more confident - I give way less of a fuck about shit I shouldn't care about - I take a cold shower every day - I have made a habit of going to the gym - I make and keep eye contact more easily than before - Better sleeping pattern, except for nights out of course - More energy and willpower Words cannot describe how amazing it is to not have porn as a part of my life anymore. I know 80 days may not seem very much in relation to the achievements of some other users, but it has made a hell of a difference for me, and it will for you too if you make it to this number and beyond. I would like to thank you for all your posts and comments on r/NoFap, I have learned a lot about NoFap and life and you help keep me going when I'm down. I hope this post has motivated some of you to start a new streak or perhaps continue their current one with extra motivation. It's a wonderful life without PMO lads, don't you dare miss out on it. Edit: haven't reset my badge when I started this streak"

The last three years of my life have been spent studying, mostly by myself. I haven't had much time or courage to date, but the desire is strong. So often I take the easy way out, escaping down the fast road to fantasy where I will never lose, rather than walking the unknowns of day to day life where the rewards are much riskier, but can be so much better. Staying rooted in reality is my biggest challenge. I am my own worst enemy. I say nobody will like me or that I'm not good enough. So I turn to PMO which will always accept me, but always leave me lonely and no farther toward my goals than when I started. When you've hurt before on the part of another's actions (like being dumped), sometimes it's easiest to control the pain yourself with PMO rather than letting your heart out and exposed. We know that real people are better, but we'd rather face the devil we know than learn what might be beyond.

Its been a strange journey. Ive had streaks of 90 and 60 days porn free in the past two years, but this is the longest Ive gone without MO and P. Over the past 90 days, Ive had ups and downs, faced past issues, created new ones and most of all, learnt more about myself. The Past: I knew I needed to seek help when I was using PMO to escape my life. I hadnt had sex in four years (and still havent). Id even started trying out my porn induced fantasies on myself, including anal play and cross-dressing and was convinced I wanted them (both of which, when I tried, just felt silly and didnt really do anything for me). I had issues with HOCD (homosexuality obsessive compulsive disorder), which was made worse by people calling me gay for years because I like musicals, opera and am more of the quiet type. The main thing I realised was that my life was full of disparities and contradictions. I wanted to connect with people, be noticed, share feelings and experiences, actually participate in human interaction and most of all, be able to feel love. However, the things I wanted so desperately were also the things I was most afraid of. How could I connect, be noticed, share feelings, and be capable to feel love and to love others, when I had so much shame? Shame is such a powerful emotion. I can recall the exact moment when I first realised that shame was the prominent driving force in my life. I watched Bren Browns TED talk on The Power of Vulnerability, and I never looked back. Still it didnt come easy, vulnerability is not something you can purchase or philosophise about. It is a skill, and skills need to be practiced. It was also about this time that I first read Models by Mark Manson. Bren and Mark spurred me on to change my life. Id been self medicating for years my using porn and masturbation whenever I felt lonely, frustrated, bored, or anything at all really. Looking back, I can see that I wasted my most formative years in front of a screen masturbating.

I realised that my thoughts and my actions can influence each other, and that I had the power to change. With a newfound optimism, I started NoFap again. The Present: I had ups and downs during the 90 days. I had times where I felt great, and others awful. I had, and am possibly still in a flatline period. With the encouragement of my therapist, and as the result of NoFap, I started trying to connect with people in real life, and push myself in other areas of my life. I went of a few dates with a girl, we kissed on our second date. It didnt go anywhere as she didnt know what she wanted. But I actually met someone new, and let them in!

Ive started being happy for no reason, which believe me, is really, really strange. I know its clich, but even things like nice weather (which is rare in the UK), or a particularly good day in the office, or a pint down the pub with friends feel so much better than before. Ive gained more self assurance and self-worth. I now know that I am worthy of love, and with time, will be capable of loving someone. I feel far less socially awkward and my speech has improved. Im comfortable with talking to and meeting new people. Im not afraid of who I am. Ive started setting boundaries. That being said, I am still unsure as to what to do next. Part of me wishes to carry on until I meet someone, which doesnt seem likely anytime soon, as I still havent met anyone. Another option is to start MOing again, but focusing on my physical experience, being present in the moment and not fantasizing, and try to re-connect to myself physically and sexually.

Its been a strange journey. Ive had streaks of 90 and 60 days porn free in the past two years, but this is the longest Ive gone without MO and P. Over the past 90 days, Ive had ups and downs, faced past issues, created new ones and most of all, learnt more about myself. The Past: I knew I needed to seek help when I was using PMO to escape my life. I hadnt had sex in four years (and still havent). Id even started trying out my porn induced fantasies on myself. I had issues with HOCD (homosexuality obsessive compulsive disorder), which was made worse by people calling me gay for years because I like musicals, opera and am more of the quiet type than one of the lads. The main thing I realised was that my life was full of disparities and contradictions. I wanted to connect with people, be noticed, share feelings and experiences, actually participate in human interaction and most of all, be able to feel love. However, the things I wanted so desperately were also the things I was most afraid of. How could I connect, be noticed, share feelings, and be capable to feel love and to love others, when I had so much shame? Shame is such a powerful emotion. I can recall the exact moment when I first realised that shame was the prominent driving force in my life. I watched Bren Browns TED talk on The Power of Vulnerability, and I never looked back. Still it didnt come easy, vulnerability is not something you can purchase or philosophise about. It is a skill, and skills need to be practiced. It was also about this time that I first read Models by Mark Manson. Bren and Mark spurred me on to change my life. Id been self medicating for years my using porn and masturbation whenever I felt lonely, frustrated, bored, or anything at all really. Looking back, I can see that I wasted my most formative years in front of a screen masturbating. I had all the classic issues like trouble relating to others, lack of empathy, a sense of being an outsider, social anxiety and numb emotions. I reached out for therapy. I had six counselling sessions at my University. As we explored, more and more issues started coming out of the woodwork, and I felt even worse. Sometimes, things get worse before they get better.

Involved a lot of deep breathing, relaxation, and resignation. Somewhat calmer but still playing boatloads of computer games which is keeping my brain foggy. One thing at a time. Met a girl who was visiting town last week. Really hit it off and spent a couple of days together. Slept together the night before she left. I felt much more present during the deed than in the past. Didn't last too long but didn't explode immediately either as I expected. Been focusing on a lot of emotional work lately so I felt pretty connected to her before and after. The feeling of true vulnerability while intimate. I almost wept. I still have a lot of sexual baggage to unload and stress/trauma to resolve. Wondering if I'll continue to make progress rebooting even while having sex on the rare occasion. This is one of the longest periods I've gone without M and it's been surprisingly not difficult. I wonder if stress is keeping the drive low."

I've lurked from time to time, even regularly for a few months last year, but never really interacted with anyone here. also, throwaway because shame. I'm 2 days in. it's pathetic. what a worthless accomplishment to take pride in. I feel good about it, but fucking 2 days? I just can't stand myself right now. I've been addicted to porn since I was 12, and am turning 23 in a couple months. over a decade of worthlessness. this isn't even the longest I've gone without indulging. I've gone months at a time, especially when I was in a wonderful relationship last year that ended on July 4th. But now I've just been in a vicious cycle of idiotic self-indulgence, and I hate everything about it. I've only just now started unsubscribing and filtering out all the nsfw subs I relied on. It hurts, I feel worthless, and the only thing keeping me going is the slightly better nights I've been having due to not spending multiple hours every night in front of my computer. I need accountability, but I'm terrible at reaching out to people. I even live with wonderful guys who are close friends. I just don't want them to have the burden of having to listen to their dumb friend who can't stop jerking off. What a stupid thing to ask a friend for. so I don't. So I guess accountability is why I'm posting here. I doubt anyone will see this. It just feels good to tell someone, even if it's strangers. I don't know. I just want it all to be over. I want to do productive things with my time. Imagine all the time I'd get back if I hadn't spent hours and hours watching someone's daughter get plowed for my pleasure. I could have fucking learned 12 languages by now with that time. sorry for the dumb post. if anyone does see this, and wants to talk about anything, please pm me. I love talking to people, I just need to get better at it. and these sorts of problems don't solve themselves. bring your struggles into the open, into the honest, real, humble open of vulnerability between you and another human. as long as you hold them within you, they will never be solved, they will only grow more and more complex and dangerous as they intertwine with themselves and fester. ok i'm done. maybe i'll check back in when a week has passed, and maybe i'll relapse again. probably the second one, but i'm really hoping i don't. **TL;DR - haven't indulged for 2 days, isn't even close to my best record, just need to tell someone about it. baby steps i guess.**"

203,vulnerability,NoFap,Learning how to walk all over again,5,4cfst1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4cfst1/learning_how_to_walk_all_over_again/,2016-03-30 02:01:48,"Hey guys, This would be my third post here. I restarted my counter a few days ago, looks like I'm on day 2. Obviously there are no drastic changes in my 48 hours of rebooting but I will certainly describe what I've been forcing myself to do in order to start stepping out of my comfort zone to become the person I know that I truly am on the inside. This weekend, for the first time in 6 months, I actually went to the bar and got sloshed with my girlfriend and her friends and got to be in the company of beautiful women who were very comfortable around me and seemed to enjoy talking to me. This only happened because I said ""yes"" to going out instead of being at home feeling sorry for myself. Also got a few new numbers in my phone and have been getting text messages since the outing. My girlfriend is a pretty confident as well as attractive woman and doesn't get jealous over things like this. We are extremely close and have a very intimate relationship filled with honesty and complete vulnerability over things that bother or concern us. Fortunately because of the kind of relationship we have, we don't tend to argue or fight a lot. I'm lucky to have her support in this sense. Yesterday, upon grabbing food with her for dinner at some BBQ place, the cashier's accent and green eyes caught my attention. I impulsively asked her where she was from as she had a rather foreign accent, she responded with a smile and lingered eye contact then my lady friend and I proceeded to wait for my order. When the cashier called me up to grab my order, I asked her what her name was, she says ""Melissa"" and I follow up with a ""Thank you, Melissa. Have a great day"" as she smiled back. A few months ago, I would've been too timid to do this because I never felt the incentive to go up to people as my social anxiety would cringe at the idea of being rejected or ignored. Now, my biggest motivation is to go out there and speak to as many people as I can. I love connecting with people. I spent such a long time under a faade of confidence and now I want my confidence to be real and authentic so I'm doing everything in my power to work on my social skills (I'm not even remotely close to a socially awkward person but internally, I can be really anxious about meeting people sometimes though I hide it incredibly well). I have to. I need to. And it's only going to happen if I make it happen. I hope to keep you all updated over time but just thought I'd share the past 48 hours of my life, I must say this has been the most confident I have felt in a very, very long time. Wouldn't exactly attribute it to not fapping but I'm feeling way more energized from living life than not. I'm starting to realize all the life and vibrancy I've missed out on from living by shutting myself away from people from my low self-esteem issues and internalized self-hatred. Learn how to walk guys, no, force yourself how to walk! One step at a time."
204,vulnerability,NoFap,The power of who you truly are...,1,4cnfv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4cnfv7/the_power_of_who_you_truly_are/,2016-03-31 10:35:30,"As I sit here typing up this post about how I feel and getting things ready for the gym. I feel vulnerable, unsure, and naked. I have had long streaks and I've also had short ones. Currently, I just had to start one again and Im not to far in, a little less than a week to be exact. But in all honesty, when you mess up you shouldn't tell yourself ""Never again"" and then next thing you know you do it again and you beat yourself up because you realize how infallible your words are and you begin to lack faith in your character. What you should say is, ""I dont care how long this is going to take to drop this habit, and I dont care how many times I mess up, Im going to do whatever it takes to keep going and free myself from this addiction!"" And the emotion that ensues is a lot more invigorating and the difficulty of challenges that lie ahead become a lot more realistic. So be yourself. be vulnerable. Because in your vulnerability you'll realize who you truly are and what you can be capable of. Don't give up. Its a journey. Love yourself for even wanting to walk down it :)"
205,vulnerability,NoFap,Maintaining a strong sexual habit signals to the brain that social order is broken,1,4dww9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4dww9w/maintaining_a_strong_sexual_habit_signals_to_the/,2016-04-09 01:29:06,"Think about it. When social order is broken, that means that the survival of the human race is in jeapordy. If social order is broken, then there's no point in maintaining social sensitivity and receptiveness, for it is assumed that no one is going to approach you with bonding in mind. Without a powerful social order, the only thing that will keep the species alive is sheer numbers. Meaning, every viable female needs to be impregnated. Meaning, sex needs to dominate the minds of every man. Sex cannot be disregarded, it has to happen often, as often as possible really. In this mindset, society is not going to keep humans alive, so sex has to step in to fill the void. If society is broken, then humans are going to die constantly, and they will need constant replacing lest the species go extinct. Normally this would mean men going around raping every woman they could and trying to have sex slaves. Think Vikings going around raping and pillaging. The pillaging represents the disrespect the mind develops for social order whenever it perceives it. It is in a different state of mind where it hates social order, since the compulsion for sex had convinced it not to expect social order. In the age of porn, raping and pillaging has been replaced by fapping to porn as much as possible. It's possible that porn was created to try to shift would-be rapists away from rape. Porn definitely has a rapey-vibe, unless it's soft-core. When guys perceive that the social order is broken, they gravitate towards porn. Their thinking shifts away from forming relationships with both men and women, to thinking just about fucking, and chaos. They try to maintain their relationships but can't, and feel ashamed, angry, and horny because of it. I therefore think that sex and social skills are mutually exclusive. The existence of a strong sexual impulse in a man signals the brain to turn off its relationship-programming. Contrarily, a strong social impulse in a man signals the brain to turn down its sexual-programming, since it's not needed. It's in our human programming to do this. In times of famine, war, social breakdown, humans shift towards making sure that every female is pregnant at all times, and this means that every male has to be a sex demon. That's the survival strategy for the species when society barely exists. When society and social bonds are strong, on the other hand, humans shift towards strengthening those bonds. Sex is understood to be a lot less necessary in those times, because the survival of the species is not in question, and can be enhanced by strengthening what already exists. In this mindset humans take an interest in natural laws. They develop mathematics, architecture, science, and above all else social bonds. They become interested in what is, because they can sense it. Sexual compulsion demolishes that sense and makes the world, and the self, seem meaningless. So it's a simple relationship. When humans perceive a lack of social relations, they start fucking/raping obsessively since only numbers will keep humans alive, since without a functional society, it is presumed that humans will be dying by the truckload. In modern times, that raping impulse has been rechanneled into obsessive PMO. As long as a man is in that mindset, he's gonna assume that the world is in chaos, that he is vulnerable, that relationships cannot be made. He won't be able to ""date"", because his natural impulses will be telling him to rape, not date. To just take what you want from women, without a relationship. That's basically what porn is, it's ""sex"" without a relationship. In olden times, this could only mean rape. When humans perceive an abundance of human relations, the opposite happens. The mind shifts towards immersing itself in those relations, and it turns its sex impulse way down because it's understood that human survival is no longer just a numbers game. In this mindset, the mind perceives social order, stability, love, self-esteem, human connection, with ease. It's radar is up for that stuff. It doesn't see vulnerability anymore. And it doesn't have perverted thoughts either, it is actually disturbed by overt sexuality and doesn't understand masturbation. Nofap reduces our brain""s sexual impulse, and repurposes it towards social skills, bonding, and happiness. TL;DR: the mind will only put you in a ""social"" and ""open"" mindset if it thinks that social relationships are possible and stable and that society is strong. Frequent ejaculations signal to the mind that society is weak and that an antisocial, ""closed"", ""rape and pillage"" mindset is required to maintain human numbers. In this situation a man is only useful to the species by spreading his seed, not his self. Abstaining from frequent ejaculations tells the mind that society is real, that a man is more than a sexual unit, and that a personality is required.It therefore ups it's social sensitivity and ability to bond with others, be intelligent, affectionate, and learn new things. In this situation a man will feel mighty impressed by his social interactions, and will form relationships quickly and easily with others. He will have a much more selfless attitude and will only want to see others happy. It's the complete opposite of what a man is like in ""rape and pillage"" mode, where he wants to see others suffer, he wants to cum obsessively, and he basically just wants to fuck and fight until he inevitably dies young. Normally such ""dead"" men never lasted long but in today's age such ""dead"" men exist for ages as PMO addicts, who can't behave like the lunatics that frequent ejaculations have made them simply because society is good at keeping such impulses repressed. But they live with the same psychosis as the maniacs of history, because PMO has tricked the mind into abandoning its social graces and receptivity just like barbarians."

But that sense of power and control turns into helplessness and chaos when it's over. You want to make a deal with the Devil again by masturbating, only this time he offers you a little less power and control than last time. You accept it anyway because you're desperate to be rid of the vulnerability you've got now. And then when you finish, that vulnerability is even worse. You keep making deals with the Devil and getting less and less out of it each time, to the point where your life is hell all the time even when you're masturbating. Moral of the story is to tell the Devil to go fuck himself. You don't need his charms, all his charms are temporary and they come at the cost of your soul. I'm not religious by the way, but the metaphor is good. A lot of the stuff written in the Bible was probably inspired by ancient masturbation and nofap practices "

I am edging so hard right now, and I know it will destroy ime in the long run. I've just torn myself away from the porn and from orgasming. i was touching, barely little touching but it was still arousing. I'm lucky enough not to be still touching right now. It's all a matter of building habit. I relapsed yesterday once and it led to a worse day today. I can't do it. No, I CAN do it. To hell if I can. I won't. Because I know through repeated progress that I am now just in an emotional slump and another relapse will just restart the emotional slump from day one again. It's been two years And I've realized that the biggest reason that I relapse is my perceived lack of meaningful connection. I feel like I'm in this fight alone. Sure there are tons of others on here who are experiencing the same pain I'm feeling, but I have never shared. I have never connected with others. WELL NO FUCKING MORE. I can start this fight alone, and have gotten far. But I know I can't last long in this fight by going it alone. I'm tired of journaling and not sharing myself for these past two years. The only way I can keep up and stay up is by sharing myself with others, and letting them help me with my weaknesses. In vulnerability, there is strength. This is just the beginning. This may not make sense to many of you right now, but that's okay. I'm getting the word out there in my own way. I got to practice communicating. And i can share my struggle, for the first time, in a supportive community. Never give up boys. And when you fall flat on your face, feel it, then get back up again. But fight it off with all your will to not do it again. One day, all my work on social skills, workouts, abstinence will pay off. I hang onto that hope And when that day comes, I won't regret a single day I fought the urge to quit. "

What a journey. Its been a journey to say the least. I know the tendency here might be to read the word journey and be dimissive, but I think that it is that and anything else other than that, even you taking injury to that is on you. No masturbating, no porn for a year. I started off 366 days ago, and what I quickly realised is that I was using PMO as a way of hiding from the real world. That is where I was letting myself most down. In the last year Ive worked through a bunch of stuff with my psychologist, gotten engaged to a real life girl (getting married mid 2016) and I think Ive grown significantly in my Christian faith too. I dont want to play the God card to bash you over the head or bend your arm or insult you by ignoring you or downplaying you, who you are, the journey that youre on. I dont believe in doing that. I believe that God is Christ and his word, desire, etc actually fits in with life, so theres parts where Ill weave that in, only for possible encouragement, because its not my story, but Im not trying to put anything on you, I just want to, thought it might be encouraging to you to share in my story. In the last few years this has really been the only serious attempt I made at no porno, no masturbating and here I am 366 days later (leap year). Im not going to jump out and claim superiority or anything here, but Im glad I got 366 days on attempt 1. The desire for connection, for female, for nakedness, the enticement, the horniness, these things are all way present when you kick it all off. Your brain is used to the endorphins, the dopamine the wiring in a way where pmo is normal, acceptable, meeting desires for adventure etc. and helping kick those things that you might not want to feel / cant deal with / dont want to dream of. The problem with all of this is that you create your own fantasy land and, I think if youre pretty normal, its pretty easy to fear leaving this fantasy land. The big bad world, hurt, pain, depression, openness, actual vulnerability, the part where you, very real you might actually get hurt, these things are all at stake when you leave the fantasy land. Your brain also leaves that cloudy state too. My advice is that you need a network of safe people here. The opposite of your anxiety is going to be to trust. I think one idea that has helped me in recent years, background to this journey but certainly a part and a helper throughout is the idea that you (me) are loved. You are loved, you are loved, you are loved. You are something, you are something and you are something of significance and you are beautiful, and fearful and good and you are loved - this is also what I believe the basic message you are supposed to pick up on in life and is central to Christianity - Christ died for you, you are something, you are fearfully and wonderfully made (and yeah youre a mess, and yeah theres a whole bunch of other people out there etc, I think Id rather PM chat this too if youre sceptical). My girlfriend / fiance (theyre the same woman, dont worry) actually went to Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA) because she had sex addiction (to masturbating) for years and years and this place helped her kick it. I actually think they gave her a bunch of negative messages too though, stuff that kind of missed the previous paragraph. They were effective in stopping behaviours, some messages, and I think the process used in some ways actually is pretty biblical, but without that explicitly missed what I would say are a few core messages. (Id be happy to PM chat you about this if you wanted too, if you are struggling with the whole thing). She was and has been encouraging in ways, and the accountability has been nice. I didnt discover some of this until a bit further in the relationship - I liked her because she was (and still is!!) someone who speaks the same language and can go places emotionally, get under and around things. I think one place I really started to work through the issues was the one of assertiveness. Put them on a continuum: passive, assertive, aggressive (and yes you can be passive aggressive but thats basically aggressive etc). Where assertive is good, passive or aggressive bad. I think that that was a helpful thing to come to grips with. Appropriate assertiveness. I think it comes back to the idea of you are valuable so in a way you sell yourself short, but also you sell everyone else short in not acknowledging this too and saying your bit, because you are important and something. And really, masturbating land is easier and exposes you less. I mean Im a school teacher so I can talk down to people all day and not need to be evens with them if I dont want to be, but theres a necessary element in all of it. The idea of authority is particularly helpful too. You are under authority, youve been assigned a place etc thats your and it is good. You are under people, people are under you and theres roles to be played out, things that need to get done in honesty, in contriteness, in your best efforts and this is necessary and unavoidable, not something to work around and the authority is not something to usurp, but being you in your space and place is good too. Stepping out of the fantasy land is GOOD. Whilst your in it, whilst pain keeps being hurled on top, when something real enters your mind as you PMO and you need to go deeper and deeper until youre looking at something wtf, like a horse or something, then youre really in a bad place. The opposite of the anxiety, the opposite of the weight is to trust, to have faith. Faith that you are okay, someone out there gives a shit about you (this is network stuff, maybe real girl stuff if you find someone who wants to do the journey with you), and that there is some goodness. Christianly too, I might add, and I know that most people here have probably had bad church experiences etc, if you run the idea of justice, it makes sense that if you establish yourself to be the law and all you do is feel sorry for yourself etc, then of course it makes sense that you get wrecked. The idea of justice might be to live life how God intended, which means to live life. It might mean to not wallow in dick in your hand land. There are bigger and better things out there for you. Trust in something good, be a man and stick your head out. As a young man I get the desire to be nothing. I get the idea to not be offensive or to be nothing. I get that youve created the land where youve fought for yourself. I get the idea of avoiding someone elses anxiety or irrationality or moving goalposts. I get the desire to be black and white and I get that in your head people see you as pretty black (not a racial thing, black and white is a thinking style - Im going off the idea that dark is bad maybe in a biblical sense, maybe in a common the evil guy is always in a dark suit in the shadows, its also where the undesirable creepy crawlies hide sense). In a sense all this is not trusting the original you are loved. As a young man Ive found a lot of Soren Kierkegaard helpful too, Id recommend reading there too. I might also recommend listening to a guy named Dan Allender, who is very Christian, but did a great sermon series in Orlando a few years ago. Otherwise, Id say it does get easier but is not always easy. Society is very sexualised and its actually astoundingly easy to play into it or indulge it, in a sense everything is tainted, but as you learn routines and about pmo, masturbating etc it does get easier. Id say that, if you can, get support, not necessarily really for accountabilitys sake (because that will just make you feel guilt, then anxiety which very well may push you back to dick in hand land - I mean for some it could be helpful, but I dont think I either felt these things from people or that in this case feeling these things was helpful), but for the trusting their word, faith in humanity, faith that someone gives a shit sense, and these things will take fighting to get, and also fighting to maintain and not just transfer all your problems and anxieties onto them (for remember, the cure is to trust!!). I think I should be around if you want to chat further, cant guarantee that it will be timely (working a busy job and trying to plan a wedding). Anyway, at this point its just words on a page etc. Its up to you to feel it, to live it, to work it, to trust it. This is a wheel youre got to re-invent. In some ways there are not a tonne of shortcuts but, as Ive said, its GOOD. On you brother, and I have faith that you can do it. Otherwise good luck to you fair stranger, its a delight and a pleasure trying to and fighting to maintain and keep healthy and proper sexuality (as an institution) in societies and in our own individual lives with you!! Dont miss out on the delicacy, sensitivity, fearsomeness, creativeness, vulnerability, honesty, care, warmth, wisdom, honour, sacrifice, grace, justice, nobility, emotion etc that is life. This is where its at. Your brother, yaypeteryay"

I wont say that my life improved a lot but in a month I have experienced high level of happiness and also sever sadness. I got closer to one of my girl friend, Im working on my self-confidence and my negative thoughts. I decided I must gain weight. I also started to journal every day. The main difference with fapping is that when on nofap, you embrace your sadness, your vulnerability. It hurts, its so painful (for the first time in years, I cried 3 times this month) but then you stand up again and you fight. Slowly, step by step you build your new self instead of wandering on the simple but bad path. Im not cured, Im still on a long journey but Im more confident overall. Good luck "

I imagined climbing that tree often, I admired its prowess. When I moved from that house, I bid that tree farewell, the shining pillar of strength I had grown up respecting. Now as I think back to it though, perhaps I had misunderstood the strength of that tree. An orange tree lives to serve others, whether it be providing shelter, or firewood, or fruit. While those who benefit from it hardly break a sweat, the tree works tirelessly to provide its subjects with riches. While it devotes energy to producing fruit, those who seek to eat it lazily meander under the excuse of being too inept to find their own food. While it endures the hot summer sun to blanket the radius with shade, those who seek to relax under its foliage complain endlessly about the heat they are shielded from. While it sacrifices its body to give the flame of life, those who seek to utilize the firewood only bring death in their wake. Trees give without reservation, enabling those they attempt in aiding to take advantage of their generosity. An orange tree can not adapt, it is stuck as it is. As time progresses, and its trunk becomes more thick, the thought of change becomes bleaker. The occasional branch will bend, but it only does so to the point of breaking. Minor shifts mean nothing to the overall entity, there is no hope for amelioration. If a fire is swallowing up the earth, the tree is powerless to save itself. If termites are rapidly approaching, it has no choice to accept its end. The inevitable finish to its impressive legacy will come about because it has no control over its own fate. An orange tree allows its entire worth to be decided by others. It is not by the esteem to which it holds itself, success is measured through the perception of others. It does not matter how many seasons the tree gives beautiful fruit, one bad yield has the potential for it to meet its end at the hands of an axe. Regardless of the oxygen it endlessly produces for the ecosystem, the tree's life will never be seen as a necessity. It is up to the greedy and ungrateful to determine the tree's value. So I respect the orange tree for everything it had given me, but I will never for a moment be envious of it. While looking like a vision of strength and vigor, the tree is actually riddled by vulnerability. So, my fellow sufferers, remember you are not a tree, for if you don't like where you are, you can move. "

Vulnerability is the opposite of what we do when we watch porn. Porn creates a cheap and temporary pleasure that numbs us emotionally. It numbs all the bad (and the good) and leaves us feeling empty. Then when we come down from the high and feel things that we dont like, we turn back to our addiction to escape and around and around it goes. If we are open and honest with ourselves and others about our situation we will discover a way to live where we can handle the bad and enjoy the good."

Shame, Denial and Social Anxiety !",2,4bcbbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4bcbbe/nopmo_why_do_you_care_what_other_people_think/,2016-03-22 00:47:44,"**Introduction** * For some people, for some reason, emotional pain carries a deep personal meaning. It is felt as a sign of their unworthiness and inadequacy. Then it cristallzes into shame. They try to hide it, and repress it, or staying in denial for every sign of discomfortor and pain or trying to normalize their shameful behaviour thinking it is socially acceptable and done my many people and therefore not a problem. * Then, addictive behaviours are discovered as an attractive escape strategy to deal with pain, but the suffering in truth doesnt resolve or dissipate, it only becomes a little more numbed for a little while, as long as our attention is so narrowly focused upon hyperstimulation, instant gratification and multitasking. PMO serves also the additional dysfunctional role of us trying to normalize a behaviour and mindset that, in our gut and heart and mind, we know is only harming our views on sexuality, people and ultimately ourselves **Main Part** * Because of shame and a sense of unworthiness (which PMO didnt solve but helped to grow) we are convinced that other people are also judgins us as unworthy and stupid and therefore every social encounter can become threatful and, expecting the worse, our physiology starts to prepare for fight/flight/freeze or die even before communication begins. This becomes a self fullfilling and generating prophecy. A self sustaining loop. In our minds, we have lost our self-respect and now, we think, no one respect us. * By the sheer force of habit, we have forgotten what our deep values and inspirations are, and we have become obsessed with the importance of validation from others ( things like looks from other people, specially women, likes on social media, others behavious toward us..). We have become addicted to others, and while we may put some smile facade, we are in fact being extremely manipulative, trying to get their head nod, their hum-hum, their smile, their validation, their attention. * The feeling of fake-ness, the deep gap (between our values and deep wishes and the way our behaviour is showing up) is huge. We experience something called cognitive dissonance, which is very umcomfortable and feels like fake, so we experience a disconnection with our true selves - but we dont know why and that's also very frightnening. Being fake we can be sad and depressed and try our best to hide it with a smile or changing the topic of converstion or making something fun or different to distract people from focusing on our pain (why am i thinking of Robbin Williams ?). Also,we can try to say something important and serious but our face portraits a sense of irony and even disgust with ourselves. **The path to emotional healing (my suggestion)** * Make a list of your priorities and values, and i will answer for you - you will put happiness and peace and freedom on the top. You will of course want to put other's thoughts about you and your life much more towards the bottom. * Practice remembering and trying to connect with your deep heart felt wish to be happy. Dont force or fake it ! Just try to connect with it, and eventually it will be more and more easy and spontaneous * Whenever you feel fake, and caring too much about what other people think, remeber your wish to be happy and that you dont need to care so much about others validation and approval. Think that it is really a matter of personal choice: to value more your own happiness or, on the opposite, what others think. You have just forgotten to live your life according to you ! It's your life, not theirs ! * Listen to self compassion and minfulness guided meditations and strenghten your self love, and learn to recognize automatic reactions of aversion and attachment (which will give you a sense of more freedom) URL URL URL URL * Self compassion and mindfulness will teach you to feel everything fully without superimposing the feeling of  i am a bad person for feeling or thinking this, this is horrible and so on. Basically this is a radical acceptance, which will make you free and able to effect real changes and achieve inner stable happiness and contentment * This is also the principle of vulnerability as power - because it takes courage to feel these emotions fully without wanting to change them or numb them.

Because when we are afraid to feel and show a short lived emotion or feeling or mood, then it stays blocked in our system and the fear itself is enough to keep the emotion stored in the memory, even without any external reason to feel the emotion. As longs as one is afraid of feeling and showing discomfort, one will feel uncomfortable - reflect on this The only way is to be willing to feel and show the pain. Vulnerability, they say."

YOU ARE NOT INHERENTLY AWKWARD OR ANXIOUS! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW! Your brain is like a computer, and like a computer, your brain has programs which have been installed from birth, through infancy, right the way up through puberty into your adulthood. Before birth, your brain was virtually empty, like a blank sheet of paper waiting to be wrote on. All of your programming has come from your environment. This is very important. None of it has come from inside you. Also, like a computer, your brain is susceptible to hardware faults. Are you your software, or hardware, or both? Do you think that the world you see is the world as it is? If so, then think again. The world that you see is merely your model of the world. This is why some people see a beautiful, divine, elegant, happy world, and others see a shit hole. The fact of the matter is, your brain has been programmed, by its environment. Each set of programs consists of four basic parts: Genetic Imperatives. Totally hard-wired programs or ""instincts."" Imprints. These are more-or-less hard wired programs which the brain is genetically designed to accept only at certain points in its development. These points are known, in ethology, as times of imprint vulnerability. Conditioning. These are programs built onto the imprints. They are looser and fairly easy to change with counter-conditioning. Learning. This is even looser and ""softer"" than conditioning. The point here is that relearning and counter-conditioning is entirely possible. Don't just think that you were born this way. The causes of social anxiety Software faults Negative self image (Or low self esteem), caused by: Negative belief systems, caused by: People telling you that you're not good enough People telling you that you're stupid People telling you that you're ugly People telling you that you're a little shit Basically people shitting on you and spitting on you your entire life. Remember that children believe fucking anything, ANYTHING! It's a genetic imperative for a child to believe anything their parents say. When I was a kid, my parents told me that a fat man with a white beard and red suit flew reindeer around every home on the planet in one night delivering presents to all the good kids, and guess what? I believed it. Probably you did too. All the negative things you were told as a kid, you believed. Your subconscious took that on board and formed a belief system around it, hence, you believe that you're not good enough. Hardware faults Low levels of dopamine being received (dopamine motivates us to do things which ensure our survival, and makes us feel good when we do) caused by: Dopamine D2 receptor deficiency (Desensitization), caused by: Constant bombardment of dopamine D2 receptors by dopamine, caused by: Overuse of porn (probably the most stimulating), drugs, alcohol, video games, and junk food. I bet you weren't as anxious/awkward until you started over indulging in your dopamine addictions were you, unless you already had a negative self image, which wasn't even yours to begin with until someone perhaps unwittingly put that in your brain. You know all the people that say ""Nofap is making girls notice me more""... they are fucking spot on. I've noticed it myself. Only 7% of Human communication is done verbally (not including phones, texting, emails, smoke signals, etc). 38% is tone of voice, and 55% is BODY LANGUAGE. Nofap teaches you self control, which is a confidence boost in itself. It also allows time for your dopamine receptors to replenish. If nofap inspires you to better yourself in every way possible, like it has inspired me to stay off the drugs and booze and video games and junk food, then that's even more dopamine receptors that are gonna heal. Confidence really does show in your body language. It's in your posture, your walk, your facial expressions. Tell me people don't notice that. Women are much better at communicating than men, get them in a group and they won't shut up! If women are much better at communicating than men, then its obvious that they can also read body language better too. By the way it's important to note that body language is normally read subconsciously SO... to cut a long post short, YOU ARE NOT INHERENTLY AWKWARD OR ANXIOUS! Fix your software! Find your negative core beliefs and change them. This is the difficult part. Fix your hardware! Restore your dopamine receptors. This is the easier part. You can and will live a life free from social anxiety, mark my words. As a long time sufferer of social anxiety myself, I can say that one of the best cures I have found for it is nofap. Peace and love."

The stars above are shining and oddly enough I notice the lack of city ambience and instead the chant of many crickets. I walk to towards a Street and exit the alley and can hear laughing in the distance it's coming from the right I take it. it's almost as if the sky is darkening the street lights are dimming and the laughing is growing. I continue pacing towards the laughter. it's a deep perverted laugh and gives me chills to the bones but I must get to the bottom of it. suddenly it stops and right in front of me a match is lit and the strong aroma of a peter jackson smooth begins to creep into my nose. instantly some street lights to the west all click on the laughing returns and in front of me its Samuel jackson sitting in a tub full of water and bubbles. his Afro is large, his grin even larger and the smoke from his dart is moving towards me instead of upwards surely to assault my pink and wholesome smoke free lungs. I turned to run but just as i began a giant hand grabbed me by the throat. I turned in fear only to see it was John cena and his terrible acting and all. Unable to escape his silver back grip I stared in complete shock and vulnerability as he nodded to the tub and what I saw still makes me sick to this very moment. willem dafoe took off his bathrobe handed Samuel a glass of wine to hold while he proceeded to enter the tub with him. and all the while that black bastard just kept laughing. it was at this exact moment I woke up and Puked all over my dog that was sleeping next to me. what do you guys make of all this? should I go back to porn I feel the images pertaining to the adult industry are much less scarring then the picture I endured in that nightmare "

Wow ! When you stop distracting yourself with porn, and other uncountable activities (anything you can imagine) you put yourself in a place to receive messages from a deeper place of yourself. Porn is just the coping mechanism to avoid (bury) our shame. Shame of what? Shame of whatever you are ashamed of ! Our culture is completely biased towards the culture of fake smiles and fake positivism. We can not help but to get the message that only positive, high, pleasant states are ok. Porn and masturbation, some say, is then an healthy way to get your positive mood back. It is healthy they say. But you see how ineffective it is, how much worse shame can get. That's what NoFap uncovers so ruthlessly. Unless you give up distraction and avoidance strategies to look at your shame, and hopefully, bring it out of the shell in which it perpeatutes itself and grows, it will keep growing steadily. It is important to recognize shame (otherwise it stays forever unconscious and buried), then accept it and then share it wih a wise and safe person ( you can try with a non human being). This is true courage. Women are educated to have this courage, now called vulnerability. Men have to learn it For me, this addiction can be thought of an escapism from shame, at least for me. Anyway, i am sure everyone of who keeps giving up distractions and PMO will receive many insights. In short time i hope to celebraring my day 90 and reporting it. Stay tuned :) "

Hoping to really make some changes this year. I'm tired of feeling like I have something to hide, especially looking at porn. I feel like PMO prevents me from showing my true self to the rest of the world, and I spend WAY too much time and energy trying to hide it. As a result, I don't feel like I'm to make any real connections or relationships with others. Porn gets in the way of me living to my fullest potential.

First off, I want to say thank you to this community. If I never found this subreddit, watched the TED talk, and read other people's posts, I wouldn't be living my life full of passionate purpose right now. I won't get into the nitty gritty, but basically--because of this disciplined practice, i have been able to turn my life around to live a life of purpose in a career that I am passionate about. Now to get what you are all for... ------------- ***Background*** This journey has taken me 3 years. My biggest streak was my first: 33 days. Then I varied from 1-15 days for 3 years. I broke up with my girlfriend this last summer and was able to screw everything and suddenly found myself at 90 days. I can't believe it. But it is true, if you stick with it, sooner or later you will strike gold. I am a case study for perseverance. **Takeaway #1: Pick yourself up after every failure and make a devoted mental choice that this next streak could be your 90 day streak** ________________ ***How I have changed:*** * Confidence * Increased initiative to get involved with life * Slef-esteem * Confident in speaking my mind to people and especially girls * EYE CONTACT, EYE CONTACT, EYE CONTACT * Deeper voice * louder laughter * Increased focus * Increased creativity Sure a lot of this could be seen as bullshit, but I experienced a lot of these due to many variables. Not fapping anymore? More time devoted to gym and reading--&gt;greater physical shape and wider scope of brain functioning--&gt;increased confidence and creativity. So there are tons of variables. **Takeaway #2: Nofap helped spark my initiative get involved with life which resulted in some incredible changes to how I look, behave, and feel.** ---------------- ***What helped me get there:*** * iPhone Streak counter * Journaling every day on my own (I use evernote app) * Accountability partner: a friend I could message every day * Reminding myself why this is important * ***#3 Going to be bed early, waking up early*: this is huge! If I felt somewhat drained of energy, or felt like procrastinating homework, i closed my computer and went to bed. I sacrificed good grades in order to make progress on my streak. The benefits were enormous though. Sometimes i went to bed at 9am** ------------------------------- ***What I learned in order to make the next 90 even better:***: One of the most powerful mental techniques is reminding myself how important this is. I have a few huge motivational factors that I mentally reminded myself. I will be writing them down, and having an alarm on my phone to look at them 3 times a day at my highest points of urges. Additionally, I will not spend as much time on my computer at home. I will make an effort to go to cafes more often. This is also key to just engaging life and interacting with people. I will also attempt to minimize my time on other time wasting activities. I realized that I substituted PMO with mindless reddit, facebook, instagram, or snapchat. I need to replace these mindless activities with purposeful thriving activities. #**4 They key to change is adding something, not subtracting something.** I will make sure i have one go-to safety behavior that is a thriving activity that I can force myself to do whenever i have an urge to do a mindless activity like PMO, facebook, or etc. I will continue going to bed super early and waking up early. ----------- Lastly: the most important thing I realized: **#5 When it comes down to it, all that really matter is connection.** We all just want to have high connective relationships. Vulnerability is super powerful. Let yourself be open to those who you trust and are friends with. If they don't reciprocate a warming feeling to compliment your vulnerability, then either a) they don't know how and they are trying their best, b) they have trouble being vulnerable themselves and aren't ready to be a compassionate person yet, c.) you two don't have a good connection. **But nothing should change who you are as a person.** Let compassion for others run deep in your veins. Strive to find good connection and sit with it. I know I went off topic, but I hope this helps someone. --------------- List of powerful books that helped me: * Brene Brown Vulnerability * Seneca on the shortness of life * Flow by Cziksentmihalyi * Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts * The Slight Edge * Power of Now TL;DR: 1. Pick yourself up after every failure and make a devoted mental choice that this next streak could be your 90 day streak. After 3 years of struggling, I finally hit 90 days. 1. Nofap helped spark my initiative get involved with life which resulted in some incredible changes to how I look, behave, and feel. 1. Going to be bed early, waking up early 1. They key to change is adding something, not subtracting something. 1. When it comes down to it, all that really matter is connection with others. "

I have been fapping compulsively to porn (average 1x per day) since I was 17. I was abused by my parents as a child and fapping has been my way of numbing my emotions for a long time. With limited financial resources and no older adults to provide an emotional role model, it was easier for me to fap and numb than to address my emotional issues. I am not trying to justify my behaviour or saying that I am proud of what I did; I am saying that I have empathy for my younger abused self and can see why I found refuge in porn. I was very anxious around women for a long time - as you'd expect from someone who was abused by their mum. Rather than being vulnerable and connecting to women emotionally, my approach when I was younger was to get into pick-up artistry and emotional manipulation. I was seriously involved in the scene for about 18 months and did a number of messed up things that I regret. According to my most recent therapist, I was living out the manipulative relational template that I had acquired from my parents. Around 3 years ago, I started to get seriously depressed for the first time. Simultaneously, I started to question my approach to dating and women. I discovered that I had been repressing my emotions because I was terrified of connecting to other people, especially women. I actually went out of my way to avoid vulnerability. Around this time, I also came across the ""Your brain on porn"" material and began to notice that fapping was having an effect on my romantic relationship (notably ED). I didn't take this very seriously at the time. I installed a pornblocker on my computer for 2 months and then deleted it again. My self-therapy was painful, but it was also successful in many ways. I figured out that my issues stemmed from my childhood and took steps to limit contact with all the abusers in my life. The last time I spoke to my parents was just under a year ago. The distance from my abusive family has been hard and lonely, but it has enabled me to grow immensely as a person. I have set up multiple businesses from scratch and spent hours working on my relationship and communication skills. Despite this hard work, I still have depression. I have low energy, low motivation, fatigue, ED and low self-worth. These issues came up this morning while in bed with my current girlfriend. I had ED and was frustrated and angry with myself. We were talking about what the reasons for my ED could be, when I remembered this subreddit and the ""Your brain on porn"" material I had found a few years ago. I had been thinking generally lately that my porn consumption was a problem, and I finally put the pieces of the puzzle together. I have been very emotional all of today and just had a long conversation about PMO with a close friend, who was supportive. I don't claim to know all the answers, but I am convinced that my porn habit has fried my dopamine receptors. I am sure that this is one of the main reasons why I feel so numb so much of the time. I understand why I felt the need to numb my emotions in my childhood, but in the absence of abusers and with financial security, I feel the time is right to come out of my shell. I want to feel. I want to be alive. I never want to look at porn or masturbate to it again. I want to thank all the members of this community for sharing your stories and taking part in this struggle together. PMO is a topic which is very taboo and shameful. Overcoming the silence is empowering. Here's to a future without porn. "

The same reason i dont like women with fake breasts, or GMO products. The same reason I dont like scripted reality TV shows. They are UNNATURAL. A big pattern I am noticing lately in society today is the pattern of PERFECTION. No more imperfections. No more stuttering during VLOGS, JUMP CUT. No more small breasts, IMPLANTS. No more human element in songs, AUTO TUNE and ELECTRONIC QUANTIZED PERFECTION! It is the fear of vulnerability. Louis CK talked about this video where he was driving in his car and he felt this urge of sadness coming up, and instead of hiding in his phone or ignoring it, he pulled over his car and FELT the SADNESS. HE cried like a BABY. But, afterwards he felt amazing because he let himself go. This generation is all about instant gratification and vulnerability is something that is UNCOMFORTABLE. We have become to comfortable that we can no longer tolerate sadness. There is an APP for EVERYTHING. This is all escapism behavior. It is not being present and identifying that we feel SHITTY, that we feel HAPPY, that feel NERVOUS. WE have become too comfortable because we no longer allow ourselves to be vulnerable. When you allow yourself to become vulnerable, you can give more to the world. You can contribute more, you can say and do MORE. People are scared to be vulnerable nowadays because everything we see is constantly edited to near perfection and anything less than that would show too much vulnerability. Vulnerability is allowing yourself to be hurt, rejected, disappointed, uneasy, uncomfortable. Vulnerability is also allowing yourself to be loved, admired, adored, looked up to, inspired. BUT THAT IS HOW WE GROW. Become vulnerable and life will change. Make eye contact with that cute girl in the store, cry during a movie, ask out a girl with no definite chance of success. JUST DO IT. - Anthony URL"

It's getting easier to shrug off urges, too. Aside from long days at work, lazy Saturdays in bed were my second biggest vulnerability. The urge was there today and it lasted a long time, but it was more like a mild headache that I was able to ignore until it passed. Hopefully things will continue to get easier as I progress. Keeping my fingers crossed, hoping this isn't the calm before the storm."

Rejection, breakups, disapproval, trust, etc. are really hard for me to stomach. I feel them on a gut level and they have been gigantic sticking points for me. I had a 4-hour porn binge last night that culminated in orgasm. I relapsed again to one of the videos this morning. I've been watching facial videos where the woman asks for the guy to you know what on her face. I'm not ashamed of that, and I know that some couples do it, but for me the context is that I have a really fragile sense of self and I feel extremely insecure. The allure of those types of videos is that they help me escape vulnerability, something that I really have a difficult time tolerating. The thing is, I saw my ex yesterday. We had coffee and chatted. She looked cute and the vulnerability started to spread through my stomach. ""Does she still want us to be together?"" ""Does she still have feelings for me?"" ""Can I trust her?"" And not just with my ex, but with women in general. I often get anxious and with some I get suspicious and not sure if I can trust their intentions. By the time I got home I snapped. I can go for long periods without PMO as long as I'm not experiencing abnormally high levels of vulnerability. But it fucking sucks because life IMPLIES vulnerability. I really wish I had thicker skin or something. My skin feels paper thin. The irony is that when I'm away from porn for long enough I feel way for confident and secure. When I relapse I feel numb and I escape from the vulnerability for the short-term. But ultimately it comes back ten times stronger, of course. There seems to be some kind of threshold. When enough vulnerability adds up I snap. I really am struggling with this sticking point. I know meditation is said to help. But I'm looking for some fundamental shift, I really want to get this at the root. I'm suspecting that perception plays a big role. But how exactly I'm not sure. Maybe somehow recognizing my power or acknowledging ways that I can actually create safety for myself. I'm really at a loss here. Has anyone else struggled with low vulnerability tolerance? It felt really good getting that off my chest."

I find it very informative. Hopefully it will help someone just like it helped me. --------- For years I never understood why I lacked the motivation and self discipline of others. Was something wrong with my moral fiber? Recently after doing some reading its starting to make more sense... Ive been a compulsive masturbator...and had severe anxiety, since the onset of puberty. Sometimes I would masturbate 20 times a day. All day at school, all day at work, even on dates with girls Id just look forward to getting home as soon as possible so that I could masturbate. I didn't even bother pursuing girls anymore because they couldn't get me off as well as I could and I didn't have to have a personality of any sort to score with myself. In addition to being a compulsive masturbator I've also been a compulsive drug user since about puberty. Between the two I think I pretty much killed my drive in life, and did so by my own doing only seeking immediate gratification. --- Quote: *The problem with too much* If you begin looking forward to getting home only to play with yourself all night long, then maybe masturbating is not so good for you. After all, the fact that you're looking forward to basically sleeping with yourself is stopping you from meeting other people, namely women. That's right; and even if you do go out with the boys on Friday night (I'm referring to your friends, not your testicles), you won't feel inclined to approach all the beautiful women. Why? Well 1) your testosterone levels are lower so you're more serene and not very inclined to approach women and 2) you know that you'll be home alone in about three hours so you can stroke and choke your penis at will. Why are you doing it? Even if you are in a relationship, you might masturbate -- and that too is absolutely normal, although your woman might think and feel otherwise. But do you even know why you masturbate if you have a woman who's ready, willing and able in your bed? Believe it or not, sometimes masturbating is less about sexual thoughts and feelings and more about anxiety. Many men, when they're feeling stressed about work or home life, tend to masturbate as a way to relieve the tension and anxiety. Now don't get me wrong; of course masturbation is also about sexual frustration. If your woman is not giving it to you enough or not the way you like it, then masturbation is one way to relieve the pent-up sexual aggression trapped inside of you. Read more: [URL --- This article below discusses more on the science of it: Quote: Has anyone reading this noticed a correlation between giving up porn and reduced social anxiety? Due to a search engine coincidence, I have been listening to the agonies and ecstasies of recovering porn addicts for several years. Over and over, a common pattern appears: As users manage to abstain from porn and cut way back on masturbation, their desire to connect with others surges. So does their confidence, their ability to look others in the eye, their sense of humor, their perception of their ""manliness,"" their concentration, their optimism, their judgment, their attractiveness to potential mates, and so forth. Even those formerly suffering from social anxiety are more often than not emboldened to explore new avenues for social contact: smiling and joking with work colleagues, online dating, meditation groups, nightspots, and so forth. In some cases it takes months, but often the shift is so rapid that it catches them by surprise. (I'm not implying that social anxiety is solely due to porn use, or that extroversion is a sign of its absence. I'm merely wondering whether, for some, more careful management of sexual desire might be surprisingly beneficial.) In Addiction as an Attachment Disorder, Philip J. Flores makes the point that one can't attach in a normal, or even therapeutic, relationship while one is attached to an addiction. By the same token, the best support for avoiding relapse is solid relationships with othersand the ability to form them at will. Why might a porn addict be obliged to address his compulsion in order to form, or restore, real relationships? Psychiatrist Norman Doidge suggests that the intense stimuli (high dopamine) of today's porn hijacks and rewires ""brain real estate"" that would otherwise be devoted to making social ties rewarding. (The Brain That Changes Itself, p. 109) Actual people become less rewarding; fake people become far more enticing. In this case, size does matter, namely, the amount of brain that lights up. Ceasing the compulsive behavior frees the brain to restore its normal priorities. Interestingly, people whose habits cause continuous over-stimulation of their reward circuitry with high dopaminedrug users, for exampleoften feel anxious or depressed the rest of the time. This is largely due to abnormally low dopamine (or low sensitivity to dopamine due to a decline in D2 receptors) between the highs. Rats that have been bingeing on sugar show signs of anxiety and brain changes (decreased dopamine). And mice exposed to protracted elevated dopamine later behaved like they were depressed in response to stress. When one is anxious or depressed, socializing can feel like too much of an effort. Several studies show that social anxiety is associated with low dopamine or decreased sensitivity. Also see this study about the link between dopamine instability and social anxiety. All addictions cause a decline in dopamine (D2) receptors, which is a major aspect of desensitization.  First question: What's one primary biological difference between dominant and submissive primates? Dominant primates have higher levels of dopamine D2 receptors. They were not born with higher levels of D2 receptors, rather ""becoming"" a dominant male caused the increase.  Inducing addiction in these same primates resulted in the same low levels of D2 receptors in all the males  Second question: During rebooting, are reported increases in confidence, sociability, and motivation related to regaining dopamine D2 receptor levels? Is excessive masturbation to Internet porn leading to social anxiety in some individuals? Dopamine surges during sexual arousal and drops after climax. Do some people masturbate so frequently that their reward circuitry is unable to return to homeostasis between orgasms? Are they suffering from chronically low dopamine (or low response to dopamine)making social anxiety more likely? It's important to realize that masturbation frequencies in modern Western society may have little resemblance to our hunter-gatherer ancestors (see WEIRD Masturbation Habits). If not masturbation, then heavy porn use can certainly lead to a decline in dopamine and dopamine receptors in some brains. All addictions, including behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and Internet gaming, cause a measurable decline in dopamine signaling. If you have a porn addiction, you have what we call a numbed pleasure response or desensitization, which means low dopamine signalling. (See: Porn Then and Now: Welcome to Brain Training and Intoxicating Behaviors: 300 Vaginas = A Lot of Dopamine to understand the mechanisms.) Once the brain becomes less sensitive to dopamine, it ""becomes less sensitive to natural reinforcers"" such as the ""pleasure of seeing a friend, watching a movie, or the curiosity that drives exploration."" Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Hardcore, ever-novel Internet porn is mightily compellingfor the same reason as crack and Krispy Kreme donuts. These stimuli are like nothing our ancestors' brains had to cope with as humans evolved. Yet the primitive limbic system mistakes them for things so ""valuable"" that it urges us to seek more and more of themeven when they cause hangovers and withdrawal symptoms. As with drugs and alcohol, ""too much"" is different for everyone. However, for some, the vulnerability of the brain's reward circuitry in combination with Internet porn means that pursuit of sexual stimulation has become compulsive pursuit of sexual stimulation. That is a problem because compulsions, remember, get in the way of forming rewarding relationships. In short, it may be that balanced masturbation habits are more important for our psychological health than generally recognized. ------------ Source: URL "

Each post from a different person, dedicating their status to a guy in my community who died in a car crash. Now I did not know this young man (we'll call him Dean). I did not have dean on facebook. But i found out we had so many mutual friends because of the endless love and online support he was being praised with. Now i know when someone dies most people arent going to talk negatively about the deceased, but man o man, the praise this lad was recieving (like huuge paragraphs from people talking about the intimate times they spent with dean and meaningful conversations they had- and tbh, many status' from attractive girls) was phenomenal. Now your asking, ok so what?? This made me realize something.. as i sat here alone in my room, behind a computer, with no immediate plans or friends urgently waiting for a text back from me.. The path i am on now.. the path of fapping away my emotions, connections with others, empathy, love, personality.. no one will ever get to experience ME.. not even myself... My funeral might be just a few friends. maybe a few cousins. the point is NOT a popularity contest, the point is that this lad that passed had touched the hearts of SO many. Now I dont know if he was a Nofapper but i can tell you this. Me as a fapper would not get the amount of praise he did. I stress however that I did not start no fap to get praise, no. I started nofap so that i dont do a diservice to others. YOU are literally doing a diservice to the people around you by NOT talking to that girl, by NOT raising your hand in class, by NOT voicing your honest opinion. Every time you resist an urge, every time you reject procreating with your right hand, you free up time and energy to expand yourself into the world. To create WITH the world. To reach out and touch people and let them touch you! You experience true vulnerability and in that, strength. You form connections and experience LIFE. You are experiencing life! Listen, you are what you repeatedly do. so do excellence in your work, in your relations and in your life. Dont ever settle for less and dont ever doubt that you can overcome an urge. Dont ever consider failure as an option. This last point has been a key for me. 2 years i have struggled and now i sit on a 45 day streak without even remotely doubting my ability to overcome any obstacle thrown my way. RIP to dean. but to dean i say thank you. for inspiring me to shape a life worth living and to write this post to inspire all. HappyHolidays gang *drops mic"
225,vulnerability,NoFap,"NoFap (day 65) + ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" = Profound social and personal growth (benefits included)",276,3x0q54,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3x0q54/nofap_day_65_no_more_mr_nice_guy_profound_social/,2015-12-16 12:25:07,"**I. No Fap Benefits:** - **Increased energy**: I would say that this is the **pivotal** benefit out of all the benefits of NoFap that will help your growth the most, simply because it will give you the energy to try *more*. To read that extra self-help book, to go outside for that jog, to push yourself to cook that meal at home instead of ordering out. And what's great about this is that it's like weight-lifting. Your stamina will only increase as you use more of your energy and push your limits. NoFap will give you that extra energy boost you need or rather, conserve your energy by avoiding that terrible deflated feeling you get after you masturbate. - More comfortable in my own body: I can spend time alone now and feel just fine with myself. I can look at myself directly in the mirror, which feels great. I've never been self-conscious about my own looks, but I was never really able to look at myself in the mirror until now. I suspect this has something to do with feeling subconsciously shameful about how I spent my time (smoking weed, watching porn, being lazy). - More in control of my emotions: instead of resorting to weed, porn, alcohol, or even friends, I can sit with myself and analyze how I'm feeling. Feeling bad doesn't feel that bad anymore, simply because I know that it won't last. I've learned that emotions are fleeting and that a large part of being human is learning to embrace them, whether good or bad. Each emotion is unique and consummates our experience as a human on this planet. It's how we relate to others. It's not just our joys that connect us, but also our shared sorrows. (See 'The Guest House' by Rumi) - More confident around others: I look people in the eye when I speak. My voice seems to have gotten deeper. I feel still and calm during silences. I feel respected by others. - More humble: This journey has taught me so much about myself and my own flaws. Somewhere along the way I realized that I'm not the only one that has flaws. Everyone else does too. This was a profound realization for me. Ever since, I've felt more humble around others, less judgmental, and more appreciative of the bravery that it takes to be yourself amidst our conformist culture - Better conversations with girls: I was at a party last week and for the first time in my entire college career I held a conversation with a really attractive girl where I had no sexual intentions. I asked her about what she liked to do in her free time, what projects she was working on in school as an aerospace engineer, and we made comments about others at the party as we just sat next to each other and people-watched. I could tell she felt really comfortable in my presence and she was enjoying our conversation. On top of all that, I didn't drink a drop of alcohol. I had water. The host offered me a drink and I graciously declined. She told me she really liked me for that, and that's how we started talking to each other. Unfortunately I didn't get her number because she left while I was in the restroom, but I didn't trip about it. I appreciated our conversation and time together for what it was and didn't feel needy whatsoever about it. Who knows, maybe I'll see around again. But for now, I feel great about meeting someone as interesting and attractive as her and holding a great conversation without any alcohol. - **New take on women (and people in general):** Before this journey, I never realized how sexualized women were in my mind. It wasn't until I began to meditate that I observed my anxious thoughts and feelings around women and where they originated from. I realized that I sought validation from women in my social interactions with them (even more so the more attractive they were) and I didn't really treat them as regular people. An emotionally healthy individual doesn't need validation from anyone, not men or women. A confident individual reinforces and sustains his own emotional well-being. He doesn't view his interactions with women as a telling point of his self-worth or capabilities. This realization has helped me to interact with women eye-to-eye (literally and figuratively). At the end of the day, women are human (just like men) that desire connection with other humans. Nobody wants to be objectified and degraded to a single line of thought, whether sexual or not. We are all multi-faceted, regardless of gender, and have value in various aspects of our lives that we want to be appreciated for. This outlook really helped me to connect on a deeper level with that girl from the party (see above). And I suspect that this outlook will continue to provide richer and deeper relationships with other women (and men) in the future. - More studious - Almost no brain fog - Anxiety went from 8.5 to about a 2-3 (still improving everyday): In tandem with NoFap, I've also started to meditate pretty consistently (about 20 minutes a day). I highly recommend meditating for anyone that would like to improve their anxiety. It helps to slow down your thoughts so that you can sort through them and be more certain of how you feel about things. Huge aid before social situations if you're feeling a little nervous or unsure of yourself. - Better relationships with guy friends: I feel more confident in my own masculinity and myself as.. a guy. I believe this improvement stems from the improvement in my social anxiety, but I just feel more confident around other men. I stand tall with my shoulders relaxed if we're standing around in a circle. My body language feels more masculine and confident. I'm not afraid to share my opinions. I'm not afraid to approach another guy. But on top of all this, I think the most pronounced benefit in this category is that I no longer feel like it's necessary to ""assert my dominance."" I don't need to prove to other guys that I'm more masculine than them or I'm more disciplined than them or whatever it is that sets me apart from them. I accept myself for who I am and I bring myself, the whole asianamericanpsycho package, wherever I go and contribute when I need to. I don't need other men to validate me or compliment me. I'm fine just being myself and exuding a natural confidence that doesn't feel like I'm trying to put the other guys around me down. In fact, I want other guys around me to speak up and join in on the fun because that makes the time that I'm having better too. - More pronounced jawline (result of diet + calisthenics) - Strong sexual tension around girls but feeling perfectly comfortable and in control - More patient And much more (will continue to update this post) &amp;nbsp; **II. Synopsis of ""No More Mr. Nice Guy""** ***(a must-read!)*** Over the past two weeks or so, I feel like I've grown a lot. I read this book called No More Mr. Nice Guy, which is about how the current generation of men in society are basing their identities on what women expect from them. Men are unhealthily seeking women's validation but aren't harnessing their masculinity by living lives that satisfy themselves. The book continues to say that men aren't giving voice to their own desires and are becoming more submissive and timid in situations. &amp;nbsp; Other parts of the book referenced how this attitude towards life translates to relationships, both romantic and platonic. In **romantic** relationships, ""*nice guys*"" place their woman on a pedestal, serving her every need and doing everything possible for her in hopes of receiving something from her in return, whether it be sex, validation, etc. These nice guys minimize their own needs in fear of creating conflict if they were to voice them and focus all their attention on fulfilling the needs of their woman. Eventually, these unhealthy habits lead to sexually repressed and frustrated men that aren't so 'nice' anymore as they are more prone to anger outbursts and manipulative behavior to get what they want. Instead of practicing masculine traits such as assertiveness and confidence, these nice guys will conceal their manipulative behavior by presenting themselves as selfless partners that are willing to travel to the deepest ends to meet their partner's needs. This act is draped in a false sense of nobility which disguises the manipulative intent of the man, which is the fact that he is acting to get something in return. He is not acting out of love or abundance, but rather from a place of desperate neediness in which he validates his behavior by shrouding it as good-mannered conduct. &amp;nbsp; These men are *weak*. They don't have the confidence to withstand rejection. The idea is that it takes strength to act beneficially towards your significant other without the expectation of a reciprocal action from your partner. Now, this is not to say that relationships shouldn't have this reciprocal exchange of kind acts toward one another. It's to say that *they shouldn't be reciprocal*. These acts shouldn't be related to the last deed your partner did for you. You're not buying her flowers because she gave you great head last night. She's not giving you great head because you bought her flowers the other day. You're buying her flowers because you love her and you want to see her happy. You're giving him great head because you genuinely want to make him feel good. These actions are coming from a genuine place of wholeness. These actions are *independent* from one another. These actions require you to be **vulnerable**. &amp;nbsp; These insights also translate to **platonic** relationships. It's possible to have unhealthy platonic relationships with others because of the desire for validation from others. People like to be given things, not have things being taken away from them. The nice guy wants to hang out with his friends because he wants to feel validated by them. He doesn't hang out with them because he genuinely appreciates their uniqueness and the creative, light-hearted banter that ensues when he hangs out with them. No, he just wants to be in their presence and feel appreciated, even if he isn't contributing anything to the group's chemistry. These attitudes often go unnoticed to the individual himself, but they will eventually permeate through his thoughts and into his outward demeanor in these social settings. He will be less talkative, more concerned about others' opinions about him as he keeps his engagement with the group entirely internal. He thinks he's an active listener, which isn't a bad thing, but his desire for validation and fear of unacceptance from his friends will keep him silent. He has no output, no social personality, nothing for the people around him to embrace and appreciate. ***He can't be vulnerable***. He can't stand the fact that the next thing he says might go completely unnoticed and ignored. He can't stand the fact that the majority of the group might not share the same opinion as his, and this tears away at his confidence as he's internally contemplating whether or not he should speak up to share his own personal opinion. Most of the time, he'll choose to stay quiet and although he feels like this is the safer option, it rots his social confidence and self-esteem. Interactions such as these will reinforce this mindset and he only digs himself into a deeper hole. &amp;nbsp; **III. Personal Insights from Personal Failures and Book** These are the things I've noticed the past three months, through my own personal experiences. However, ever since reading this book about two weeks, I feel as though I've grown immensely. When I first read the book, I felt like it described my life to the T. I've always been described by others as a nice guy. I was a pretty popular and well-known guy in my first year of college and people knew me for being the really nice guy. And I liked it. I reveled in the fact that I was 'different' from other guys. I entered a relationship with one of the most attractive girls in my class for about a year until it ended horribly. After I read this book, I felt like it described my platonic and romantic relationships perfectly. &amp;nbsp; I wasn't the good-looking, popular, masculine guy I believed myself to be. I was a narcissistic, approval-seeking, unassertive guy that lived for others. I wasn't the dream of a boyfriend I thought I was. I was the 'good-natured' manipulative asshole that treated his girlfriend as an object and validation-provider more than a person. I was in a relationship with my ex for almost one and a half years. Yet, I wasn't able to connect with her emotionally. To this day, I can't say I know her that well. There was and is a large part of her that I feel like is missing in my experiences, which I never sought to address or figure out during the relationship. The best way I could put it was that my relationship with her was a Beautiful Mess (Jason Mraz). There was no vulnerability in our interactions. I didn't know it at the time, but I had built walls between us so high due to my insecurities and unwillingness to be vulnerable that at the end of our relationship, I felt entirely disconnected from her. I took the breakup really hard, but not because I felt like I lost someone that was special to me, someone that I shared deep intimate bonds with. The breakup destroyed me because I had nobody left to validate me, nobody to make me feel that I was valuable. I felt worthless, useless, and unwanted not only by her and my peers, but worst of all myself. I didn't want to be me. That's how shitty my life felt like at the time. &amp;nbsp; Fast forward two years of frat partying and several meaningless drunken sexual encounters, I discovered NoFap. I was skeptical at first, but I was depressed, unmotivated, and desperate for a way out of my slump of a life. So I tried it. I quit my fraternity the summer before my fourth year, found a beautiful home that I luckily found with several other friends, and decided that I would turn my life around. Over the next quarter, I would start NoFap and invest entirely in myself. I quit partying. I quit smoking weed. I quit hitting up friends to hang out because I felt lonely and had nothing to do. I took up calisthenics. I took up a healthier diet. I began playing more basketball (huge hobby of mine, played since the third grade). I bought an academic planner and began to plan out my weeks. I studied harder. I found studious friends. I spent my time more productively. I deleted Snapchat and Instagram. I only use Facebook to keep in touch with a few friends, but I don't actively post nor do I scour the newsfeed anymore to see what everyone else is up to. My life became my top priority and I got rid of anything that took away from that focus. Today, I'm on day *65* of Nofap. &amp;nbsp; If you've read this far, thank you for taking time to look through this post. This is the first time I'm sharing my journey with anyone and I've gotta say it feels tremendously liberating and empowering to share my successes with you guys. If you guys are currently struggling with NoFap, I wrote another post the other day about how there are some days where you feel like you're back to square 1. Don't be disappointed in yourself, *it's not your fault that you feel shitty*. It's all a part of the rebooting process. I'll be continuing this for as long as I can and I plan on submitting another post around 100 days. Good luck my fellow Fapstronauts and thank you for all the insightful and funny posts in this sub that kept me going even when I didn't think I could make it another day. You guys are the real MVPs. &amp;nbsp; **Don't let the title fool you.** I don't think that men should no longer be nice. That's not what the book talks about. The book is about how men in this generation have lost their masculinity, are no longer assertive, have become dependent on the validation of women, and are no longer the attractive and confident men that they were truly meant to be. It focuses on changing men's flawed perceptions of themselves and others (both women and men) to stimulate personal growth and help them to reclaim their self-confidence and self-esteem. "

227,vulnerability,NoFap,60 Days Report,1,3r4t9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3r4t9s/60_days_report/,2015-11-02 09:13:11,"This is my first post on Nofap, or indeed Reddit. I first became aware of nofap and my obsessive porn habit about 18 months ago. I went cold turkey right away, but eventually succumbed to temptation and relapsed. For about a year I cycled between abstaining and binging. I got involved with the fetish community at my University, and things just got worse from there. At this point, I haven't had sex for almost four years, and I accept the reason is my own responsibility. It was the classic story, I had become hardwired to respond to screens. I didn't care about the feelings of others, I barely experienced any feelings myself. I used porn and masturbation to fill a huge hole in my life, one that only got deeper the more I tried to fill it. I started therapy and realised the disparity between who I was and who I wanted to be. My therapist encouraged me to consciously reach out and connect with others. She even encouraged me to develop a dormant friendship and see whether it could lead to a possible relationship. I had visited my friend to go on a date on a couple of occasions during my fapping period, and we had a fantastic time, but I was unable to show any kind of overt sexual or romantic interest. I believe this was because I had developed an association between sexual activity (in my case obsessive fapping) and shame. Shame is such a powerful part of our lives, it can control us. For more info look at Bren Brown's Ted Talk on The Power of Vulnerability - it was exactly what I needed to hear exactly when I needed to hear it. 60 days ago I decided enough was enough and I wanted to change my life. I had to spend the summer at home with my parents, as I was finishing my Masters thesis. Days at home, the arguments that ensued lead to binging for several weeks out of frustration and procrastination. I knew that nofap was going to be a difficult journey, but anything that is worth doing is going to be difficult. After 60 days I do feel like a different person. I haven't experienced 'super powers', and am nowhere near where I want to be in my personal development, but nofap has given me a drive to carry on working and improving myself. I also feel able to take responsibility for my own imperfections and claim that they are as much a part of me as my best traits. I believe this is the most important aspect of nofap. Being honest with yourself and not using porn or masturbation to numb your feelings opens up a whole new world. Yes, there will be dark days where you want to give up, where the temptation of a few minutes of pleasure seem irresistible. There will be times where you are in a flatline, or maybe feel depressed, or feel nothing at all. Without the emotional numbing caused by fapping, you'll have to deal with these destructive thoughts and bad moods. However if you don't give up, you'll also be able to feel things you haven't felt in years. Happiness and pleasure can be found in the smallest things, like the crunch of an autumnal leaf underfoot, or the patter of rain on the window. It's these small things that draw me back to the present and make me feel alive. You'll be able to be yourself with others. You'll be able to be vulnerable. You'll be able to connect with other people in a way which you may have never experienced before. And perhaps most importantly, you'll be able to look in the metaphorical mirror and be at peace with your reflection."

A quest the wise and honest have taken, one that will shape my future, hopes and dreams. It is this quest that many have called ""narrow"", ""hard"" or even ""impossible"" but this community knows that to be false, they strive to reach others and inform them on truth regarding porn/fapping and the negative effects it has on an individual. My porn addiction voyage began when I was 10 years of age and of vulnerability. It lead me to depression and exile. No friends, no one to talk to just a pure 'loner' in every sense of the word. In a dark isolated room is where it commenced, where is where it will END. "
229,vulnerability,NoFap,"Bye Felicia! I love you guys, and thanks for everything (a little advice, too)",2,3pxya1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3pxya1/bye_felicia_i_love_you_guys_and_thanks_for/,2015-10-24 06:18:18,"LOL I will miss a lot of you guys. I'm movin on and leaving a lot of internet behind as a next phase in my upward journey, thanks to Jesus Christ and his power that makes me free. I sound like a televangelist to a lot of you, but it's true. The words are true when there is a reality behind them. And that reality I have not known until recently. But there is a meaning behind them, even if a lot of people (me included) have not or do not know that meaning (and those people are in a scary situation). You guys are awesome for doing this. Regardless if you're Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, atheist, or agnostic or whatever. You're taking a very important part of your life back from Satan, the evil one. Even in Christianity, we know that all who work righteousness please God. All. I know that Jesus has a special message and power to those who believe, and I invite you to look into it. I haven't myself found anything healing or worth my attention (exercise, career, women, etc.) than Jesus. I've climbed a lot of ladders andthey all ended up going further downward. Keep doing what you are doing. Go for your heart. Ask questions, look for answers and dont' be lazy about it. You all are human beings, and you all matter deeply. You will all, if you make it out of this hell, learn to be human beings again and not withered corpses and sex zombies. A couple words of advice: 1. No edging. if you stop edging, the rest will follow. For instance, if you don't edge, you won't M. Duh. But there's a deeper one. if you don't edge, you won't P either. Why? Because why would you go to P and put yourself through the misery of watchin all that smut if you aren't gonna touch yourself? Hmmm, not so dumb, right? 2. Higher power. I said enough on that. but it's real. It gets us out of ourselves, and addiction is really a form of negative selfishness. So is despair, loneliness, etc. Some hurts go deep, but asking questions and seeking answers will get you many places. And for those who are Christian: go to Jesus. He is a healer, really, THE healer. Shrinks and self-help lit don't cure. THey help to manageand to cope, but Jesus *cures*, to them who have faith. 3. Go back to the past. We all got hooked for a reason, and for reasons behind the reasons. Addiction isn't just a bad habit. It's a personality, a way of being in the world, running instead of facing danger with courage. 4. 90 days isn't a milestone. It's what you do during those days that counts. The guy who watches movies allday and orders pizza out for 90days instead of PMO isn't going anywhere, and it's just a matter of time before he finds another black hole. But the guy who cries his guts out, who exercises, who gets God, who does what he's afraid to do whatever that is ... he's theguy who will find that after 90 days have passed, his life isn' the kind of life where he's got no options anymore. 5. Connect. I suck at this, but it's something I have to work on. Connecting requires vulnerability, letting my defenses (lies) down, and loving other people and not being so selfish. Ever heard of ""Rat Park"" experiment? Check that out sometime. 6. Admit your evils. You won't get anywhere if you don't look hard at yourself and take responsibility for your life, for your bad habits, and for your mistakes and errors and sins. I use the word sins because mistakes and errors are kind of responsibility-avoidant terms, and a lot of people live a lifestyle of mistakes and just call them 'personality' or 'lifestyle' or whatever. Look hard at your actions in the past and now, and use prudence, justice, fortitude, and etc. to figure out if it's a viceor a virtue. 7. Find something to believe in. Youc an't nofap your way through life without a yes____ to something else. Addicts live sad lives, and remember those shitty feelings you get when you're done relapsing. They'rethere for a reason. Be grateful for them. They help you avoid doing the badthings the next time around when the urges and temptations wave in. Thanks, guys, and God bless. Some don't believe, but it's the best I can say based on reality, and I mean that with all love and no highfalutin hypocritical retrouss attitude! Love ya"
230,vulnerability,NoFap,Quit porn for 7 years and recently relapsed... Grateful to know this place exists :),29,3q9np4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3q9np4/quit_porn_for_7_years_and_recently_relapsed/,2015-10-26 22:31:28,"I was heavily addicted to porn from ages 14-17, to the point where I was watching porn and masturbating in copious amounts every day. Even if I was with friends at my home I would leave to privately watch and masturbate. After realizing how watching porn and lying (to myself and others) was effectively blocking/numbing me to accessing and embodying my creative potential, passion, purpose, and authentic expression with life and meaningful relationships, I began the journey of recovery and healing. I didn't masturbate for around 5 years and began to explore it again (w/out ejaculation + practicing energy cultivation techniques) on a rare/occasional basis around age 22. January of this year (2015) I relapsed with pornography. I rose from a half asleep/awake state late in the night with the urge first to self-pleasure and then remembered the name of a porn star I used to view. Somehow I convinced myself it would be harmless to not 'look her up' (photos, videos etc.) but to attempt to find out 'more personal information' like her birthday (I geek-out on astrology - another addiction I have been learning to bring into balance), if she was still in the business, etc. That went from youtube videos of kind-of teasing imagery to eventually being sucked into the black hole of page after page of images as well as a video. This experience created so much overstimulation that I barley even had to touch myself to experience strong sensation in my genitals. After my energy started to rebalance, the massive weight of shame and guilt overpowered me. I prayed, sang, and did my best to love myself through a moment of loss, disappointment, fear and self-resentment. I processed and integrated the experience deeper over the next days and ultimately saw the value in my relapse as an opportunity to humble myself to the fact that even though I went 7 years w/out porn, I had not yet fully healed through my addiction. I realized that I wasn't immune to succumbing unto these kinds of urges again. I also began finding a huge presence of porn-reovery-support articles and info (which was almost nowhere to be found in my teen years) which helped me feel more supported and understanding of my own process. Around 3 or 4 months passed and I again late at night found myself pursuing my cell phone, this time trying to mask my urge to myself by searching for artwork or animation. This happened another time where in both instances I was able to pull myself out before going too deep i.e. masturbating or watching any full-on porn. Then I began to do a similar thing with pop-culture music videos (which I am these days generally unfamiliar with) and are basically like a form of porn to me. Then masturbation coincided with this. And now, here I am in bed, its just about 4 am, and at around 2:30 I awoke an decided to do a porn search with this kind of 'nostalgic' urge for something once experienced and also new. Kind of a 'why not' or 'I'll just peak' enabling/self-convincing thought form. I didn't masturbate but I definitely let my wandering-clicking-urge take over, going from video to video seeing only a few seconds of each creating a feeling of dissatisfaction and craving for more (note: I have been resisting the urge over the past few nights and this time caved... It even entered my dream last night where I was watching a screen but was being physically pleasured by an actual woman...). After the relapse tonight I immediately went to youtube for recovery support and found mark with the 'sacred sexuality project', a message, practices, and info I deeply resonate with... (also how I found this site!) . I have been wanting to connect to a support group around porn addiction and recovery and didn't know that a site like this even existed until now. Thanks Mark! Basically this is my background info for joining this forum and I am grateful and honored to be here in humility, vulnerability, service, and support to all of my brothers' and sisters on the path of personal liberation and self-empowerment. I am really ready to evolve and transmute these pornographic/masturbatory urges and habits into thoughts and actions of self-love, deepened awareness, and expanded consciousness. Hope this post brought benefit to you. Just writing it definitely has helped me feel lighter and more supported. Thank you for reading and feel free to share your personal journey with me as well, I am hear to listen... In love and gratitude."

234,vulnerability,NoFap,Fapping is fine in moderation,0,3jmiur,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3jmiur/fapping_is_fine_in_moderation/,2015-09-05 00:54:12,"I've experimented with various cycles of fapping and come to the conclusion that a weekly or fortnightly wank is perfectly fine and somewhat alleviates the following: moodiness and irritablity, lack of mental focus, emotional absence, complete lack of productivity, lack of enthusiasm, inability to compromise, anger all the time. What I have learned from runs of 2+ months of PMO at a time is that the all or nothing approach does not work with things such as hormones which are continually fluctuating within us. I don't think it's a compatible lifestyle choice given how much temptation and filth there is around is, i.e. overt sexualisation in the media and on internet. Unless we choose to live in a forest somewhere I just don't think no PMO can work long term due to the exposure that is forced on us. The best possible compromise is a moderate approach, where you are getting some release but at the same time you are not robbing yourself of vital nutrients and vitamins which are lost in semen. Giving yourself ample time (1 week miniumum) between PMO has helped me tremendously. I am finding myself maintaining the perks that come with long stints of abstinance, such as a more engaging attitude and friendliness towards people, but without the depression that hangs over me when I don't PMO. I would agree that PMO should not be a reward system, because we can quickly fall foul of abusing it in times of vulnerability to the point where it's 2-3times a day occurence, but it is nice to remind the brain that in 14 days or so ''I've got a wank planned'', and as yet I've not seen any reason from anyone on here that this is not a workable solution. We seem to get far too caught up on how many days have gone past without a wank, meanwhile life is passing by, and I think there is evidence on the contrary (from testimonies on here) from people with over 1000 days no PMO, whose lives have not significantly improved, and whom haven't suddenly become masters of the universe, which is the mantra I see peddled from those obsessed with the number of days no fap.

I've grown attracted to him as our friendship has deepened. It's more of an emotional/romantic attraction. When he shares personal things with me, I sometimes get aroused.

Thoughts of him having sex with someone else will sometimes sneak into my fantasies or when I'm having sex with my wife (I don't want that to happen).

It's ridiculous that I'm feeling tempted because I have a beautiful wife that I'm going to be having great sex with in a couple of hours, in all likelihood. So why am I tempted to look at porn right now? I think a couple of reasons: 1. I'm tired/lazy. I can't have sex right now, and I don't feel like making dinner, and I've had a long day at work. 2. It's been two weeks since I last looked at porn, so I think my id is craving a fresh supply of filth to wallow in. 3. The last time my wife and I had sex, it was great, but during the sex we had to stop and talk through some serious stuff that we'd desperately needed to work through. (As a side note, it's unlikely we would have had that conversation if I'd looked at porn recently--I would've been too self-loathing and evasive for it--so quitting pornography has already reaped that benefit in my life.) I think I'm a little afraid to have sex because I'm afraid of having another conversation like the one I recently had. Even though the conversation would be a good one, I hate feeling vulnerable, and a sex fantasy made of pixels doesn't make one feel vulnerable. Real women, real men, and real relationships are complicated. That's what makes them difficult, but also what makes them worthwhile. Being naked with my wife is fun and loving, but scary. Being naked with my laptop is, on some ultimate level, repulsive, but there's no vulnerability there. It's a cheap, cowardly way of avoiding my feelings."

STUDY 1 - Participants (median age 20) who initially reported viewing more pornography demonstrated higher discounting of future rewards. STUDY 2 - Participants (median age 19) were randomly asked to give up (for 3 weeks) either their favorite food or porn. &gt;""Results: participants who exerted self-control over their desire to consume pornography chose a higher percentage of larger, later rewards compared to participants who exerted self-control over their food consumption."" &gt;""Our study is the rst we know of to show alterations in decision-making processes from use that is not compulsive or addictive."" The researchers don't deny that porn can be addictive, however: &gt;""Pornography use in itself may be a harmless activity ... but, given what we know about the reward system and the primacy of sex as a natural reward and visceral stimulus, it also has the potential to become compulsive or addictive."" The researchers believe porn consumption increases impulsivity for 3 reasons: - Sexual urges can be extremely powerful, and have been related to impulsivity in past research, - Pornography consumption is a simple replacement for real encounters, can become habitual, and can the condition user to instant gratification, and - Constant novelty of the internet can lead to repeated stimulation and habituation (decreased responsiveness) EXCERPT: &gt;""This research makes an important contribution, demonstrating that the effect goes beyond temporary arousal. [Consumption] can have implications that transcend and affect other domains of a persons life, especially relationships. It is therefore important to treat pornography as a unique stimulus in reward, impulsivity, and addiction studies and to apply this accordingly in individual as well as relational treatment."" In short, - internet porn consumption has an impact on impulsiveness with or without pre-existing vulnerability, and - even non-addicts can be adversely affected by porn consumption."

However it had an extremely deep meaning that took me about all of today to fully realize. If you can handle the description of what went on, you will see the power behind its meaning. I'll try to keep it as clinical and non-arousing as possible while still communicating my point. First, however, some background on my life. I am young, in my early 20s. I've dated three girls and had two girlfriends, only one of which (my first) was truly serious. I actually wound up proposing to the serious one and we stayed engaged for about 6 months before I broke it off. My whole life, I've been raised in a Christian home, where pornography was labeled a sin and masturbation a taboo. However, at a young age, (like 8 or younger) I discovered masturbation and, not knowing what it was, went wild with it. Before I knew it, I was doing it multiple times a day. By 13, I couldn't fall asleep at night without touching myself. I was 12 when I first looked at porn. Ever since then, I have been indulging in porn just about as often as possible. Even now, I pull up something to watch at least once a day. Now, I am a firm Christian, so I feel that what I'm doing is wrong, but I am not convicted about it enough to really put a stop to it. I tell (lie to) myself that it's a rather victim less crime whose problems can be dealt with as they arise. Whatever your personal or religious views are, I think that most of us can agree that I have at least an unhealthy fixation on porn and masturbation, mixed with a dose of denial. That's about all you need to know about me. The next key factor in this story is my first relationship with this girl, let's call her ""Jenny"". Jenny was my high school sweetheart. I met her in class when I was 17. I knew from the get-go that she was from a bad family. Her mother was manipulative and her father was an explosive and unfaithful man. However, she was beautiful and struggling to do her best with her life. At least that's what I thought. She later turned out to be incredibly manipulative and selfish and she had the young, naive me wrapped around her finger. However, the most important factor here was that I saw that she needed help. She needed to get away from her family, she needed someone to be genuinely good to her, and she needed a hero, because she had never had one in her life before. I was all too willing to be all of those things to her. We dated for 3 years before I proposed, with her drawing me deeper and deeper into her manipulations. She nearly drove me away from my family, who I love dearly. She nearly took my ambitious future in order to make me focus on her alone. She nearly took my strength. I was weak before her, as she pouted, screamed, and lied her way to control over me. Through the grace of God and the perseverance of my family, I finally broke it off with her. To get a good idea of what kind of person she was, she got married a year after our proposed wedding date. In the space 14 months, she had ""gotten over"" me (If she indeed had any attachment at all), found a new love interest, made him her boyfriend, had him propose to her, and then marry her. I guess she gets points for ambition. She was conniving and twisted. Now for the dream. Like I said, its sexually explicit, but that is because it relates directly to how men view sex, vulnerability, and the plight of a woman. I'll try to keep it as un-arousing as possible. In my dream, I saw Jenny having intercourse. I could see that it was her father that taking her from behind. She was clearly not enjoying it, only taking it without resistance. I was nearby, naked. My sympathies went out to her as I saw her. Then she saw me and her countenance changed. While still being taken, she batted her eyes at me. This excited me and in my dream, I reached to touch myself, but hesitated because I did not want her to see me doing that. She recognized what I was doing and batted her eyes again, encouraging me to pleasure myself. I did and the dream ended. It's rare that I dream. It is even more uncommon that I remember so vividly. As you can imagine, this dream haunted and disturbed me. It put me in a funk until I had time to sit down alone and think it out. I've studied the natures of men and women, reading books on their psyches and defining qualities. As a Christian, I believe there is a deeply spiritual element in masculinity, femininity, and sex. If you are not a Christian, consider the social implications of masculinity, femininity, and sex. They kind of line up. Every person has a wound; a question. ""Am I enough?"" is what a man asks. ""Am I desirable?"" is the question of a woman. We crave the answers to these questions, and we usually get our answers from our parents, parental figures, or whoever else is of significant influence during our developmental years. That means that the parents make or break our image our selves. If my father had told me that I wasn't enough, then I would be a very different man today. However, it was clear that Jenny's father had a very different answer for her question. He had told her that she was undesirable. She often told me stories of how he was so appearance-based in his approval, sometimes mandating that she could only wear specific things, even if she was just around the house. His answer to her was that she was beautiful so long as she did as he said. This was her wound. And she used it to manipulate me. In my pursuit of may answer to the question of ""Am I enough?"" I was looking for a wound to heal. I wanted to be enough for someone. She saw that and flaunted her wound (batted her eyes) to draw me in. Just like in the dream. I saw how she had been broken and it drew me to her. However, the plot thickens. Notice how I responded. I became sexually excited. Both in the dream and in real life, I didn't do anything to stop her from being wounded, rather I took advantage of her vulnerability for my pleasure. And she used that to manipulate me. She saw my weakness and drew me into it, knowing that I would be ""hooked"" on her brokenness and that I would gravitate towards her because she excited me. That is how she saw herself as desirable. I desired to be near to her because of her brokenness and weakness that I could exploit. She used that to attract me. However, I ignored my want to be enough for her in order to pleasure myself. I cannot help but wonder if I would have reacted the same way if pornography had not been a significant factor in my life. Pornography features vulnerable women for men's excitement. I had been diving into this realm of broken women, screaming for attention by putting themselves in a state of vulnerability. Would I have been so attracted to this girl when I met her if I had not been taken in by this idea of broken women being sexualized? Pornography does not show strong women. It shows women who are willing to expose themselves for profit. Say what you will about women's rights and their ability to be strong and independent no matter what they do, but porn is porn. Sex implies vulnerability. Think about it. A women literally opens herself to a man, exposing all her flaws and imperfections. What is one of a woman's main concerns? Body image; whether or not she is desirable (her question). However, when she is opening herself to sexual intercourse, she bares all for the man. This excites a man, allowing his ""manhood"" to grow. This is metaphorically significant. A man becomes more of a man when a woman is vulnerable. He ""rises"" to the challenge, showing that he is enough for her. He exerts his strength for her, eventually *spilling himself* for her. This is how life is made. A woman is vulnerable, a man becomes excited, he emphatically answers her question of whether or not she is desirable by being a man for her, and she states that he is enough for her by opening herself to him. This is the deception of pornography: we as men take a shortcut, thinking ""this woman is vulnerable, so I must be enough for her, since she is vulnerable enough to accept me."" I now realize that this has definetly warped my thinking. Now, instead of vulnerability being a call to be a man, especially in a non-sexual way, any vulnerability is a call for exploitation. I saw Jenny's wound, her vulnerability, brought on by her father, and I was attracted to that. I had something to exploit for my pleasure. Now, I want to be clear, the farthest we ever went sexually in real life was making out. That was as close as we got. I never even saw her in a bikini. We were saving our sexuality for marriage. However, even with that being the case, I sexualized her and her brokenness, simply because that is what I had been doing for years by watching pornography. I saw a woman's vulnerability, sexualized it, and sought to exploit it. Every time a man looks at porn, that is what happens. He sees a woman in a state of vulnerability and instead of rising to defend her, he lowers himself to exploit her vulnerability. Even if these porn stars don't think of it that way, that is how we men think of it. ""Look at this woman spread out for me! I can feel like a man simply because she is vulnerable! I can feel the sexual feelings of a true man because of this!"" Only today did I realize the effect that this was having in my daily life. Think of this: A naked woman is exposed and vulnerable. There is no difference. A vulnerable woman is a call to action, just as a naked woman is a call to excitement. Even action and excitement are kind of synonymous. It's a very distinct response that a man has to a vulnerable (naked, exposed) woman. He is called to action (Excitement) to do something for her: 1.) defend her or 2.) take advantage of her, just as those that he is supposed to defend her from. Within a trusting, loving relationship, the woman's vulnerability is answered by the strength of the man she deeply trusts, defending her from the statement that she is undesirable. Outside of a trusting, loving relationship, the man's strength is twisted with desires of exploitation, stating that she is desirable if she is cheap and vulnerable to whoever's attention she catches. My dream showed one simple truth: Because of pornography, I sexualize broken women. If there is a woman who is hurt or in need, I exploit her without even knowing it. I can fool myself by thinking that I am helping her, but the truth is that I am open to manipulation by a woman who is aware of what I'm doing and that I am not acting as a true man should when encountering a woman with hurt. If you look at the archetype of a true man, he always fights for his true love. We should do the same, even if we have not met our true love yet. A true man should say ""I will not exploit vulnerable women. I will stand up for them by not exciting myself on their vulnerability. Rather, I will save my manly desires for the woman who is true to me. I will be true to her now so that I will not have cheapened my sexuality and manhood before we even meet."" I have not been living up to this. I have been cheapening my sexuality by taking advantage of exposed women about every chance I get. I see that now. How will I be a true man for my future wife if every vulnerable woman I see is sexually arousing? A vulnerable woman should be a call to action, not an inspiration for masturbation. If I watch porn, I only reinforce the idea that women in need are sexual objects. I realized that I should not have watched on and pleasured myself while Jenny was taken in my dream. I should have stood up for her and said that she was not an object to be used or commanded. I should have used my strength to defend her, not exploit her. However, porn and my constant masturbation had conditioned me to the latter response. I am used to vulnerable women being very accessible. I am used to using my strength in my own self-interests. How can a be a man for my future wife when I act like a foolish boy today? TL? DR? Here you go: I now understand the consequences of pornography and masturbation. It takes a man and makes him act like a child, selfish and without understanding. It corrupts a man's idea of a woman in a state of distress (vulnerability), making her an object for exploitation, rather than something to be defended. I cannot be a true man if I exploit; I will be a man if I stand up and defend vulnerable women. And the first step is to defend them from myself. To use porn to stimulate myself is to debase myself as a man because I do not protect women from exploitation by exploiting them myself. I look forward to any comments or feedback you may have. I know this was a wall of text, but it feels good to get this off of my chest and into the air, where it can be a discussion. Thanks for letting me vent and figure out my thoughts and feelings here. Fight the good fight, men!"

All I felt in the dream was being intimately entangled with a woman...just a blur of arms and legs and hair and kissing and grabbing. No sex, no sexual contact, no emission. It was this amazing feeling of oneness, togetherness, and vulnerability that I'd never felt before. I woke up completely emotionally drained, even empty. Kinda like how you feel after an orgasm. I'm trying now to analyze why I feel that way, but I've not had any luck so far. I'm just preoccupied....a friend asked me if anything was wrong today, it was that noticeable. If anything good came out of it is that I don't even want to contemplate fapping. I want to understand that feeling. Has anyone had a similar experience?"

I am still negatively affected by ejaculation even after 1 year + of recovery from porn and masturbation. This problem with ejaculation does not seem to be going away, so the question is, how much of this is normal? How much should I accept will be a part of me for the rest of my life? Do others experience these unwanted side effects? (I will explain the effects in detail momentarily) 2. I have struggled a lot with relationship or ""love"" addiction and codependency. I've done therapy, and I've done a lot of soul searching and self-care. It seems that adding the element of sex to the relationship I am currently in would increase the risk of it becoming addictive and unhealthy like all my former relationships. Now to explain my current developmental stage and the details of these two concerns of mine. I am 21 years old. I started masturbating to porn right when puberty began. It instantly became my number one response to stress and all other unwanted emotional states. I spent years and years masturbating compulsively to porn multiple times a day, every day. Probably from 10 or 11 up until age 19. As my addiction intensified over that period of almost a decade, the effects of continuously wasting my semen became more pronounced. I started to develop really bad social anxiety. It became so debilitating that my first year in college I never left my apartment. It brought me to such dark places...some of you may know those places too. At the worst of it, I was utterly unable to interact with people, I was obsessively looking for girls to take advantage of on dating websites, drooling over women in public, drinking and smoking myself to sleep every night, etc etc. That was about a year and a half to two years ago. Where am I now? I've finally started to REALLY recover from my addiction. I first completed 90 days PMO free last November, and made this post on Youtube: URL That ""streak"" continued until around 165 days, almost 6 months. I was studying abroad in India and I relapsed hard, and found myself stuck in a cycle of slips and relapses every couple of weeks for the next few months. Near the end of my stay in India I began to regain the stability I'd had prior to leaving the US. I returned home to my friends and my daily routine, and my addiction again receded into the rearview and became less of an issue. I'm a few days from reaching 90 days for the second time. So in the past year, I've done a lot of healing. From years of PMO all day every day, incredible social isolation, no motivation in life, etc. And then this past year I've gone months and months without looking at porn or masturbating. I've grown wings and become a social butterfly. I am motivated to better myself, my life is a thousand times more meaningful now, and I've met a beautiful girl who I am currently romantically involved with. Things are GOOD. My addiction sometimes comes back into my rearview in times of weakness, but it is nowhere near as difficult to manage as it was in the first part of my recovery, where every day I was a mess of anxiety, worrying either about relapsing with the porn or about being abandoned by whatever girl I had most recently sold my soul to. Although things are good, I still have problems with ejaculation. Whenever I ejaculate now, my social anxiety comes back. It's not as severe as it was when I was looking at porn everyday, but it's substantial enough to really affect my social life. If I have sex or masturbate, (neither of which I feel comfortable doing right now, hence this post) I will have a mess of symptoms: **More pronounced social anxiety/less confidence in my interactions with people, as if the energy and charisma that I've slowly cultivated over the past year has just been sucked right out of me. **No motivation to continue my day, pursue my goals, etc. It's as though my life is put on pause and I find myself stuck in this limbo of laziness, profound insecurity and lack of direction as to how to move forward, and just a general sense of helplessness and stagnancy **Urges for porn, more lustful thinking, staring at women in public, just generally feeling less ""in control"" of my mental state So what the fuck? Where is this coming from? Is this because I wasted my fluids every day for years? How long do I have to remain abstinent in order to be able to have sex without losing my mind? I've already been abstinent for most of this year, with a handful of slips here and there. How much longer?!?!? Or am I doomed to be stuck with this shit for the rest of my life? The last point I will make on this point of ejaculation: It seems that when I have a wet dream, I am not affected nearly as much. This raises a number of questions: Are the negative symptoms coming from ejaculation generated by my sub-conscious mind? If so, would changing my perspective somehow change the effects and make them less debilitating? Or is the constitution of what is released in the wet dream somehow different from when I ejaculate in my waking state? Or do I release less? Now on to the codependency problem. Thank you to all of you who have read this far. I imagine I won't get much feedback on such a long post, and that's ok. All relationships in the past have been addictive. They would be based on intense sexual connection with little to no intimacy, no emotional connection or vulnerability, poor communication, etc. I found myself extremely needy, insecure, and deeply afraid of being abandoned. (I believe some of these problems are a result of a dysfunctional family growing up) This current relationship I am in is very different. I have a good emotional connection with the girl I am seeing. We share everything with each other. We allow each other to be vulnerable. We fool around sexually, but have not yet had sex. I am worried that if we were to start having sex, not only would I deal with the issues I just mentioned with ejaculation, but I worry I would become too attached to her. It seems that for people who have struggled with sexual/relationship addictions, adding sex to the equation too early can mess things up. So, am I gonna get any feedback on this? Thanks for listening. I haven't been on this subreddit in a while. If any of you newer members want any advice on rebooting or whatever, I'd be happy to talk about my own experiences.

Being in my late forties now, it's what you call a pretty well-established habit. Nofap has helped me cut it down a lot, but I haven't been able to get past a few weeks. I admire the folks who are more successful. While I agree with the prevailing sentiment that it does not represent proper care of oneself in the sense of not tending properly to health, dignity, psychic architecture, relationships, etc, for me there is another aspect at least as powerful, which I know is controversial, in that I believe that using pornography doesn't represent proper care of the the world, in the sense that using pornography takes advantage of the brokenness of the world, fostering an economy that harms the dignity and potential of the people that participate. My basic idea is that people are beautiful in general. I don't like contributing to an economic process that creates a dynamic for the people involved where whore-shaming and marginalization must make it hard for them to realize that they themselves are beautiful. Something like that. For me, maybe I am a basket-case of empathic projection, but the experience of pornography creates a spiritual division where in order to enjoy sexual release I have to choose not to feel identification and love but substitute a shallow carnality that pretends she is enjoying what she is doing. The link tells a bit of the life story of a prominent performer. If you have been a consumer of hetero porn over the last decade I'm sure you have seen her perform. There is a certain vulnerability about her, a girl-next-door quality, that heightened my pleasure. How different attitudes and behaviors can be. What feeds my pleasure is from the same place as what feeds my self-disgust. I am grateful for this community because it helps a person look beyond themselves and find a better way. I think it is good to try to see people as they are and to see yourself as you are. Non-judgmental compassion towards myself and others. I am absolutely sure that a loving approach to the world does not include PMO. "

(is that the right word?) As I promised myself one year ago, I am going to share with you the resources I believe helped me get to 365 days PMO free. **A quick backgroung** &amp;nbsp; I have had a problem with excessive porn viewing probably since I was thirteen/fourteen, pretty much ever since I had a computer in my room. I had multiple attempts to stop or ""cut back"" throughout all my teenage years. When I was a senior in high school I had so much anxiety I ended up not being able to study at all, PMOing all day and really failing academically even though I had been a pretty good student the previous years. When I was 22/23 I discovered this community. I was able to do 90 days - which I was so happy about - but after I got to 150 I had a relapse. Tried again a few more times but was never able to get to three months after that. After a while I joined SLAA online (Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous) - my issue has always been just porn (some people categorize porn addiction as sex addiction and others link it more to an addiction to the internet - both ways describe behavioral addictions). I was sober for more than three months but I eventually had one relapse and decided to explore other options (ps: I think SLAA is a really good program and it helped me a great deal but it just wasnt the right fit for me to continue at the time). After that I briefly joined Candeo Program - which I found interesting - and then I decided to give Fortify Program a try. One year later here I am. As promised, here are the steps that I took to be PMO free: &amp;nbsp; **1 - The BIG 4.** This is based on Kelly McGonigals research on willpower (She published a book  The Willpower instinct  which is great). She explores many things you can do to improve your willpower  and she mentions 4 of them that will improve the physiology of Willpower: * 1 - Sleep. * 2 - Meditate. * 3 - Eat a low glycemic diet - (Cut out sugar!) * 4 - Exercise. I created an excel spreadsheet and tracked my progress  of course I missed a couple days here and there, but I have been pretty consistent this whole year. &amp;nbsp; **2 - I established a Web Routine** It just means that I know what I am going to do when I get online. Here is an example of a web routine: 1) Email + 2) Facebook + 3) Feedly (I RSS all the content I want to read)  And I save the articles I want to read on Pocket(URL Then I am done. For the times you decide to just browse  Knowing that is a risk factor!  I recommend Timely (URL Time yourself and write down what you are doing online.  Example: Watching cats on youtube + Learning how to make Italian pasta on pinterest. That way you are aware of what you are doing and less likely to follow a link hole that is going to lead to relapses. I would recommend creating a web routine and trying not to browse aimlessly at least for a while. &amp;nbsp; **3 - I have a filter.** Pretty self explanatory. I use K9. I do have to mention innocent sites though. I cut off some news sites that would always lead me to relapses and also a lot of social media. As a heads up  FB and Instagram have a no porn policy. Twitter and Tumblr do not. Research the porn policy of sites and social media you use. But even the sites that are porn free can be a risk. Know your habits and what is a vulnerability to you. &amp;nbsp; **4 - I follow a program.** As great as /nofap is, it isnt a clear program you can follow. There are a lot of programs now that can help with porn addiction. I would recommend researching them at: * URL * URL * As I mentioned, I am on the Fortify Program: URL They are a part of a great organization called URL &amp;nbsp; **5 - I have an accountability partner.** I have never met my buddy in person but I got to know him through SLAA online and we send each other weekly emails, talking about our struggles, victories, and overall state of mind. Remember: Isolation = Relapse. &amp;nbsp; **6 - My bedroom is a lit screen free zone.** I dont allow cell phone, computer or TV in my room. The only electronic device that is allowed is my kindle (it doesnt have a lit screen). It just creates a safe space in your house and whenever you are anxious, stressed, tired you can just retreat to your bedroom and not worry about relapsing there. It was a game changer for me  also, it makes you sleep better. &amp;nbsp; **7 - I researched my addiction.** I tried to learn as much as I could on porn addiction. I would recommend subscribing URL run by the amazing Gary Wilson and also reading books and seeing lectures on the topic. A few I would recommend: * 1 - Slight Edge  Jeff Olson. Not specifically on porn addiction  but shows you how to improve your life. * 2 - The practicing mind  Thomas M. Sterner. Also not on porn addiction, but on how to lead a more meaningful life. * 3 - The Willpower Instinct  Kelly McGonigal. Lecture + Book. URL * 4 - Your brain on Porn  Gary Wilson. * 5 - The Brain that changes itself  Norman Doidge. &amp;nbsp; **A final word:** &amp;nbsp; This is just the beginning of your new lives Start creating the future you want for yourselves one day at a time See you on the other side.

250,vulnerability,NoFap,I wrote something on my blog and thought I would share it here. It may be fitting for some of you.,3,3dta3n,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3dta3n/i_wrote_something_on_my_blog_and_thought_i_would/,2015-07-19 16:16:53,"I am new to writing and am enjoying it so much. It is a wonderful release. I encourage you all to keep a journal just for the sake of processing and what not. Here is the blog entry : I am writing right now because I made a promise with a wonderful woman named Mary Jean that I would write for fifteen minutes every day. She claims I have a gift for articulation. Something I would have never seen in myself being that I often find myself stuttering over words while trying to portray my feelings. I bow out of most arguments because I find myself lacking the wit or tact it takes to lay out my wisdom in such a way that may impress someone. Before this turns into a pity party let me carry on. I love writing. I love imagery and how it grabs the soul. I love staggering vulnerability. I love those few fearless people that bare their hearts because for their livelihood it comes out of a necessity; emptying themselves infront of everyone to be judged yet their need to be undone somehow trumps their fear of man. They live for the whisper from a stranger in a crowded room that gently spits out hey, me too. I love those spoken word nights held at hip little tea shops. These are the brave and the revolutionaries; reenacting age hold traditions that mimic the aroma of a lost garden when a man could stand in front of another being naked and unafraid. The topic of vulnerability has come up in many conversations I have had over the past few weeks. Never before have a seen a single element hold such power when it comes to healthy community. Over the past year I have seen families nearly fall apart, close friends battle with suicidal thoughts and marriages crippled. Vulnerability has been the foundation and the catalyst at seeing these situations coming to redemption. It can be the tipping point of a situation teetering on the edge of ruin. It is the soft spoken words in the darkness that pokes pinholes into the dam which will eventually burst as healing is brought forth. I am starting this blog because I want to be that for some people. I want to help you find hope. I am starting this blog because I need to write and I am hoping that it impacts your soul in a beneficial way. Yours, Cody"
251,vulnerability,NoFap,what it says makes men desirable???,4,3e7miu,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3e7miu/what_it_says_makes_men_desirable/,2015-07-23 02:04:31,"TL;DR The role models of men today are pathetic, passive, submissive, and bending over backwards to make women happy. I don't know about everyone else, but it seems that men care more about sex these days than about much else, and they become these little lapdogs or just another female accessory in order to get that sex. ""Gotta make the woman happy, or I'm not happy"" so the saying goes. Whatever happened to men being men? Whatever happened to men not caring what women think about them? Whatever happened to the tough, resilient, vulnerable, and male-to-male relationships that have been completely eclipsed by these marital frauds and dating relationships based on lust and Disney fairytales? Why do we men give away so much of our courage, fierceness, and adventurousness in order to either have sex or to 'make a woman happy'? Is it cultural conditioning? Sex addiction? Men never growing out from under their mother's shoe? You tell me. ------------------- Disclaimer: not all women are like the women portrayed in this post. I know some good women and some bad men. But this is my perspective on what is happening to men in general, and I believe it is right regardless of feedback. Sometimes because of feedback. Thank you. --------------- From what i've read about the 1920's, it used to be that a man had to be a provider, somewhat cocky and aggressive, a real go-getter. Gangsters as urban cowboys, the mafia, racketeers, slick salesmen, and a tough police were the role models of the day. The economy was booming, and a lot was going on that required industrial spirit and a dedication to work. As time moved on in the 1950s, the role of men turned toward something more sociable and tolerant. Atticus Finch of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", or James McKay of ""The Big Country"" were the kind of role models here. Sensitivities were building about race and gender, and the aggressiveness and confidence that was lionized in older days was now seen as reckless, ignorant, socially backward, and primitive. the nation had gone through two world wars and a great depression, as well, which complicated the role of men. Women and even other races played a huge part in keeping this country going, and proved not just their own hidden abilities, but also a sense of equality. Nowadays, when I watch the media, I get sickened by the kind of role men are supposed to play. It seems like every commercial has a woman in charge of the man, toting him around, nitpicking commentaries on this or that about him, the man carrying everything, the woman leading the man walking around ... it used to be that a man would let a woman walk in front of him as a gesture of knighthood or courtesy in a world where men went ahead and did things on their own. It's a quixotic absurdity. But nowadays things are very bad for men. It seems like so many men I know are nervous about making their woman happy, because if she's not happy, he's not happy so the saying goes. They spend a tonne of money to make her happy, they give up their own male friends to make her happy and spend time with her, they give up their hobbies for 'together time' or dates, and their lives shrink more and more and they lose more and more independence as time goes on in their relationship. I don't like that. Love is, as Eric Fromm put it, standing in union with someone while having our individuality respected. As M Scott Peck said, love is about expanding ourselves, not diminishing it. Whatever happened to letting the woman be responsible for her own feelings, and stop being her dad and having sex with our 'child'? When a man goes out to buy ice cream or a meal, or a gift or something, the kinds of specifications and the necessity of exactitude really seems to be a stressful experience. whatever happened to a woman appreciating the gesture? Bitchhood and narcissism in females these days (and I don't care about the flak i'll get for this) is at an all-time high. The roles have really reversed and things are gone way overboard. There are still male action heroes, but they're a dying breed. It seems like for men in this culture, that the summum bonum or ultimate purpose of a man is to find a woman and to make her happy. That this is his calling. A man who enjoys being single, or who keeps his semen for himself and doesn't cum into the woman, or one who holds women accountable for their selfishness and obsession with looks, gets no respect in society. Rather, it's the man who has the hottest girl on his arm who is seen as 'successful'. But i know that hot women have some really freaking screwed up heads sometimes, and are not faithful at all, so keeping that hot woman around requires either a bag of tricks, repeating the abuse she suffered in childhood by being a bad guy, or kowtowing to everything she wants. I mean, seriously, how many of us have heard the expression that a woman is looking for a project in a man? someone she can domesticate or whip into shape, or someone she can make into whatever she wants? Whatever happened to love? To that kind of thing where the woman makes an effort toward union, while respecting the man's individuality? And then there is the issue of respect. I am happy to admit that there are a lot of men out there who by appearance don't deserve it. They don't ask for it. They don't feel entitled to it. They believe they're just supposed to be just another accessory of their woman, and they'll become lapdogs just to have sex with her. But women these days do not respect men. How can I say that? Does a woman treat her man like she treats her boss at work? No. No way. Some women don't even respect their bosses, which is just a tell on how disrespectful and unfit for the workplace they are. But respect is completely different than love. Respect requires compliance, flexibility, seeing a bigger picture at work, trust, and sometimes vulnerability. Love is just a feeling to so many women, and it's been that way for me, too. The answer is not complicated. We men can start respecting ourselves. We can stop caring what women think, and care more about what we think about ourselves, and certainly more about what God thinks of us. NOFAP is also a first line of defense against the sexual obsession that feminizes us and makes us into groveling insects and lapdogs for female projects. And the biggest thing of all is to care about forming healthy male-to-male relationships, and not to let our women either attenuate or destroy them - at whatever cost to our relationship with her. If she doesn't want us to have friends anymore, she can get out and stay out."

A little background - I met her through Tinder, and I've met up with about 10 other girls through that service and each one was a total waste of time, but there is something about this particular girl that really fucks me up. Most girls I can approach objectively and weigh out whether or not I should invest more time into the ""relationship"" or not, but this one just has my head in tangles. She is a profound fit to the ""perfect girl"" I never thought I'd meet, and although she's not a bikini model or anything, I can't stop thinking about her. Anyways, my question for you guys is this - from the nofappers here who have built successful relationships with the girls you've always dreamt of, but might have run into the emotional baggage of what comes with nofap, how have you dealt with the awkwardness of everything? I feel like I have moments where I'm blushing, I don't know what to say, I feel awkward, and I feel like what I see as a manifest destiny-needs to be a relationship type deal could slip through my fingers because all of this is happening so suddenly. Not sure if this makes any sense to you guys, but goddamn...I don't want to fuck this up but I feel like the emotional vulnerability of nofap is making me seem more awkward, and have less false confidence than I normally would have as a calloused porn addict. Just don't know how to deal. Any advice would be appreciated."

I used fapping as a substitute to help ""overcome"" all of the other emotional problems I've been trying to fix lately. I've been reading a lot of self help books. Namely ""The Gifts of Imperfection"" and ""Daring Greatly"" by Brne Brown. I highly recommend both of these books for people facing other emotional issues in their life such as lack of trust, vulnerability, low self confidence, and depression. While reading these I realized I was only replacing these problems I was trying to fix with another problem (fapping). Now I'm 4 days clean and trying to become a better person in every part of my life. It's a difficult journey but this post goes out to all of you who are conquering more than just NoFap!

255,vulnerability,NoFap,Don't masturbate inside a woman,6,39lreo,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/39lreo/dont_masturbate_inside_a_woman/,2015-06-13 02:58:41,"&gt; In our culture today, so many men are using womens bodies as receptacles for their pleasure, dismissing and discarding the heart and soul of women. And many believe that women are okay with it. Many women falsely believe they have to comply with mens needs in order to have a man, so they make themselves okay with it. Im offering a different perspective. Men reading this, I ask you to dig deep within you and try to imagine the vulnerabilty of penetration for a woman, and the pain and hurt you can cause by just not giving a damn about her, using her only to get off on. Even if you think shes okay with it, even if she says she is, many women are so wounded and blocked here, from so much pain, that they are numb. The harm you do by using a woman at any time is beyond my ability to convey to you with words. I am not asking you to read a womans mind. I am simply asking you to examine your motives. If you know youre only using her for sex, perhaps you could make a different choice. You know what your intention is. Be mindful of that. Find a place inside you that honors women, our bodies, our hearts, and that vulnerable portable you are all so fond of inhabiting. Its not yours to take ownership of or to use as you wish. Women, you MUST stop allowing this to happen. We have the power through honoring ourselves to put an end to this. We have the power to educate men with love and grace by simply standing in our own self-love and self-respect. We dont have to make men wrong in order to change this. I also believe that when women honor men and stop vilifying them, men in turn will honor women. When we understand this simple truth, our relationship to each other will be transformed, and we will learn to truly serve each other. Source: URL"
256,vulnerability,NoFap,Struggling with romantic relationships while recovering from porn addiction.,1,3bbyzs,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3bbyzs/struggling_with_romantic_relationships_while/,2015-06-28 05:37:31,"Could I get some feedback on this? I'm already a year into my recovery from porn addiction and these are the things coming up for me right now. TLDR: I have a history of falling into addictive relationships and becoming way too attached. What is the cause of this? What is the solution? And why am I so deeply affected by ejaculation? What is the solution to that? Yeah, I am in a relationship of sorts. It's probably the closest to an actual relationship that I've ever experienced. I think I could very easily characterize all past relationships I've had as extremely unhealthy. Fears of abandonment, lack of trust, jealousy, excessive self-doubt and anxiety, compulsive sex, lack of openness and emotional intimacy/vulnerability, etc. I have for a long time wondered why I've had such problems with what some people would call ""love addiction"" or ""relationship addiction"", why I become so consumed by my romantic relationships, to the point where I obsess over little things, like not receiving a text message when we are spending time away from each other, or not greeting me with enough enthusiasm when I come home from work, etc etc etc. In these relationships I often slip into a state of being that is very one dimensional. My creativity is stifled, I feel very ""dependent"" on the other person, like I constantly want to be around them, but then when I am around them I feel insecure, I need continuous reassurance that the person is still interested in me, etc etc. Basically things that interfere with my day to day life considerably. And I've been dealing with that shit for a while. Perhaps the problem originated with my father being emotionally absent from my life for most of my adolescence. In my reading of codependency and addiction, a common cause of unhealthy attachment to romantic partners is a history of neglect from parents, physically or emotionally. So I have certain ideas about why these things have come up in my life. And I've worked to deal with them. The past year or two for me have been spent recovering from a nasty addiction to pornography and masturbation. Removing all addiction from my life has left me fairly vulnerable and uncertain about myself..a state which I have probably always been in deep down, but never fully acknowledged in my earlier years because I covered everything up with lots of drugs and sex and other risky behaviors. Anyway, to give you a better idea of where I am at present, I was in two pretty unhealthy relationships in 2014, the last of which ended very abruptly in November, two months before I went to India to study abroad. At that point I had to make a critical decision as to whether I would slide back into a life of addiction with pornography and masturbation, which would have completely consumed me and left me extremely depressed and socially isolated, or to decide to face my emotional immaturity and build a better life, and spend some time on my own. I chose the latter, and so for the next six months or so (most of which was spent in India) I really got to know myself better. I learned more about what I need to feel happy, how to care for myself, I took more initiative in making more connections with people and facing my social anxiety, had a great time in India, etc etc, finally got an idea of what it's like to live life independently, had occasional problems with my lingering porn addiction but for the most part did ok, and I learned to trust myself more. Six months later, I return from India, ready to go back to my life in Minneapolis and finish my last year of college, and continue to develop myself and face my anxiety and all of my inner emotional problems, and I then become involved with one of the girls I am living with. For the sake of time and making this easier for you to read and respond to, I will say briefly that I have a connection to this person that I have never known I could have with a woman. I used to be embarrassed to introduce my girlfriends to my friends or family, because we had no true connection, or compatibility of personalities, so our relationships were based on sex, and the girls were generally pretty unintelligent people. The girl who I am involved with now I admire a great deal. She is gifted artistically, she's very creative, she challenges me intellectually, she's very skilled socially, she's drop dead gorgeous, etc etc etc. And she truly cares about me on a deep level. We can be silly and creative together in a way that feels very natural and very enriching. We also happen to be natural partners according to the Myers Briggs profiles, which for me is a very accurate source of information about my personality and my relationships. Anyway, my point in describing how awesome she is is that she isn't just some new girl I want to have sex with. She's someone I see myself having a future with, someone who I like being around regardless of sexual/physical involvement. She has also struggled with addictive patterns in relationships in the past, and was also a victim of sexual abuse, and so we are treading very carefully. We are trying to keep some boundaries for ourselves sexually, so we don't jump into something too soon. One thing I wonder about is when to introduce sex into the relationship. There are those who argue that if you wait to have sex, the critical time in the beginning of the relationship where trust and emotional connection are established is not interfered with. If sex is introduced too soon, according to some, the opportunity to deepen the trust and emotional connection is to some degree lost, which may contribute to (if not cause by itself) the kind of problems which I have suffered from in the past, i.e., attachment/abandonment issues, insecurity, etc etc. So we are trying to figure out how to navigate this new territory in a way that will not compromise our health. For me, when I become ""too"" interested in someone, it becomes a kind of mental block that weighs me down. I am less motivated to be productive with my dayI am less interested in doing things, meeting new people, going to the gym, volunteering, whatever. Because instead, I'm thinking about/worrying about my relationship with this person. It's a feeling of powerlessness, where your life becomes harder to live, and each moment harder to fully be present in, because of this cycle of anxiety and preoccupation surrounding the romantic relationship. Anyway, my current relationship with Hannah is far healthier than everything I've ever had, and I want to nurture that relationship. But I am concerned about becoming too consumed. I don't have a very reliable friend group in Minneapolis. The times when i feel the most confident in my independence and my abilities to keep myself from becoming overwhelmed are when one of my good childhood friends comes to visit me, and I'm reminded that I have friends, and I have a life outside of this person which is actually pretty stimulating. What does it mean to be ""ready"" or ""not ready"" for a romantic relationship, in this context? Some have told me that for those who struggle with attachment and addictive patterns in relationships it's important to spend an extended period (six months, a year, or more) single and strictly focused on oneself, keeping oneself away from all romantic involvements. I did do that for six months, and I'm not quite sure what that did for me. To avoid becoming involved with someone for fear of becoming too attached would not give me the opportunity to learn HOW to deal with those feelings when they arise. I would just avoid the feelings. I don't know if that's actually a solution, or just a way of taking a break from, or delaying the inevitable return of the problem. How do i learn how to deal with that shit in a healthy way if I don't let myself experience it? That was part of the rationalization for becoming involved with Hannah recently. I think about that a lot. Does sexual activity play a role at all in this? If we were not physical at all, would that help? If so, what would need to happen before sex could be a part of our relationship? Is it simply a matter of the passing of more time? Or is there something specific to be learned during that period of no sex? Is it that I don't have enough of a social life outside of the relationship? That could certainly be part of it. But there are plenty of people who are in romantic relationships and they don't spend much time with other people. Do they all struggle with obsessive, intrusive thoughts and worries about the relationship and where it is headed? Do they feel too attached and fear being alone? If it is more a result of my childhood and the lack of acceptance from my alcoholic father, what do I do with that insight? Do i attend Alanon meetings and hope to better understand how to deal with this through that lens? I've never been practicularly fond of 12 step groups. Do I just need to make more friends? Do I need to take a break from this relationship altogether? Or would that be running away form the issue and prolonging the problem? Is the fact that we live together contributing to this problem? Do I need to impose more distance? How do I know if she has become too important to me? When we spend a night sleeping together and the next day comes, and she has to go to work and I have nothing to do, and I feel this intense sadness like my life is pretty meaningless without this relationship, what the fuck do i do with those feelings? Is there some way to overcome that? Am I too young to understand why this is happening or what the solution is? And to address the effects of ejaculation, for me, whenever I ejaculate, not only am I exhausted afterwards, with zero motivation to go do the things with my day that I had planned to do prior to the act of sex, (which sounds relatively normal) I also have an intense spike in social anxiety. It's like I become extremely insecure and nervous around people after I ejaculate. Like all of my charisma and magnetism and energy and social skills and all that just gets thrown away after I ""spill my seed."" And then I become very attached to my partner. Is that shit normal? Is that a result of the fact that for years and years I masturbated excessively, throwing away my seed faster than my body could produce it? If that's the case, what's the remedy? Am I destined to always be so negatively affected by ejaculation? I feel as though I am not able to really enjoy my sexuality because of unhealthy attachment/abandonment issues when I become romantically involved, and also because my confidence erodes every time I blow a load. Thanks for reading all of this. I feel I'm in a very confused place. Confused places bring more triggers for PMO. But I am remaining strong, I am committed to becoming an emotionally mature and healthy individual, and figuring out how to integrate healthy relationships into my life during my recovery. All advice would be greatly appreciated."

Anyway, my point in describing how awesome she is is that she isn't just some new girl I want to have sex with. She's someone I see myself having a future with, someone who I like being around regardless of sexual/physical involvement. She has also struggled with addictive patterns in relationships in the past, and was also a victim of sexual abuse, and so we are treading very carefully. We are trying to keep some boundaries for ourselves sexually, so we don't jump into something too soon. One thing I wonder about is when to introduce sex into the relationship. There are those who argue that if you wait to have sex, the critical time in the beginning of the relationship where trust and emotional connection are established is not interfered with. If sex is introduced too soon, according to some, the opportunity to deepen the trust and emotional connection is to some degree lost, which may contribute to (if not cause by itself) the kind of problems which I have suffered from in the past, i.e., attachment/abandonment issues, insecurity, etc etc. So we are trying to figure out how to navigate this new territory in a way that will not compromise our health. For me, when I become ""too"" interested in someone, it becomes a kind of mental block that weighs me down. I am less motivated to be productive with my dayI am less interested in doing things, meeting new people, going to the gym, volunteering, whatever. Because instead, I'm thinking about/worrying about my relationship with this person. It's a feeling of powerlessness, where your life becomes harder to live, and each moment harder to fully be present in, because of this cycle of anxiety and preoccupation surrounding the romantic relationship. Anyway, my current relationship with Hannah is far healthier than everything I've ever had, and I want to nurture that relationship. But I am concerned about becoming too consumed. I don't have a very reliable friend group in Minneapolis. The times when i feel the most confident in my independence and my abilities to keep myself from becoming overwhelmed are when one of my good childhood friends comes to visit me, and I'm reminded that I have friends, and I have a life outside of this person which is actually pretty stimulating. What does it mean to be ""ready"" or ""not ready"" for a romantic relationship, in this context? Some have told me that for those who struggle with attachment and addictive patterns in relationships it's important to spend an extended period (six months, a year, or more) single and strictly focused on oneself, keeping oneself away from all romantic involvements. I did do that for six months, and I'm not quite sure what that did for me. To avoid becoming involved with someone for fear of becoming too attached would not give me the opportunity to learn HOW to deal with those feelings when they arise. I would just avoid the feelings. I don't know if that's actually a solution, or just a way of taking a break from, or delaying the inevitable return of the problem. How do i learn how to deal with that shit in a healthy way if I don't let myself experience it? That was part of the rationalization for becoming involved with Hannah recently. I think about that a lot. Does sexual activity play a role at all in this? If we were not physical at all, would that help? If so, what would need to happen before sex could be a part of our relationship? Is it simply a matter of the passing of more time? Or is there something specific to be learned during that period of no sex? Is it that I don't have enough of a social life outside of the relationship? That could certainly be part of it. But there are plenty of people who are in romantic relationships and they don't spend much time with other people. Do they all struggle with obsessive, intrusive thoughts and worries about the relationship and where it is headed? Do they feel too attached and fear being alone? If it is more a result of my childhood and the lack of acceptance from my alcoholic father, what do I do with that insight? Do i attend Alanon meetings and hope to better understand how to deal with this through that lens? I've never been practicularly fond of 12 step groups. Do I just need to make more friends? Do I need to take a break from this relationship altogether? Or would that be running away form the issue and prolonging the problem? Is the fact that we live together contributing to this problem? Do I need to impose more distance? How do I know if she has become too important to me? When we spend a night sleeping together and the next day comes, and she has to go to work and I have nothing to do, and I feel this intense sadness like my life is pretty meaningless without this relationship, what the fuck do i do with those feelings? Is there some way to overcome that? Am I too young to understand why this is happening or what the solution is? And to address the effects of ejaculation, for me, whenever I ejaculate, not only am I exhausted afterwards, with zero motivation to go do the things with my day that I had planned to do prior to the act of sex, (which sounds relatively normal) I also have an intense spike in social anxiety. It's like I become extremely insecure and nervous around people after I ejaculate. Like all of my charisma and magnetism and energy and social skills and all that just gets thrown away after I ""spill my seed."" And then I become very attached to my partner. Is that shit normal? Is that a result of the fact that for years and years I masturbated excessively, throwing away my seed faster than my body could produce it? If that's the case, what's the remedy? Am I destined to always be so negatively affected by ejaculation? I feel as though I am not able to really enjoy my sexuality because of unhealthy attachment/abandonment issues when I become romantically involved, and also because my confidence erodes every time I blow a load. Thanks for reading all of this. I feel I'm in a very confused place. Confused places bring more triggers for PMO. But I am remaining strong, I am committed to becoming an emotionally mature and healthy individual, and figuring out how to integrate healthy relationships into my life during my recovery. All advice would be greatly appreciated."

Despite what I'd like to think, I'm aware of my vulnerability. I'm determined and committed to not relapsing, but history has demonstrated that I'm not infallible. 2. Flatlining sucks. This is the hardest and most confusing part. Not feeling the burning desire to ""get laid."" Seeing a gorgeous girl and feeling nothing. In a way, this is a gift as it takes the pressure off of pursuing women. With that said, when women want sex more than I do, things become a little difficult... I'm doing my best to ride out this flatlining period, despite it feeling like forever and despite it wearing on my esteem to some extent. I suppose this part requires faith in the prescribed treatment of p/m induced problems. Anyone wanna share their flatlining experience? "

Because we keep each other motivated and support each other (also abit of friendly competition!) I thought I would look into it. I had been struggling with porn addiction for years, but had absolutely no idea how to go about stopping (I didn't know about the behavioural link between P-M-O, I thought I just had to address the P and everything would be fine, except it was impossible). THEN...at the start of the new year I came accross the [Gary Wilson TED talk](URL which changed everything for me. I was going to sign up for a month challenge, then at the last second, I opted for 90day hard-monk mode (it seemd crazy and scary to give myself that much of a challenge, but I thought, what the hell, lets do it properly!) 90 days later, I have learned so much about myself that I can say for a certainty that I am not the same person as I was at the start of the new year: I now know quite intimatley about the feelings of fear and vulnerability that crackly gently around my heart, the feelings of anxiety that seem to numb and quietly choke at the throat, and the sadness that rises and falls like waves in the chest. This is what I have gained from NoFap (sounds like a shitty deal right?) actually, no, its quite wonderful not to be running from my life and to be able to feel everything authentically. The PMO was just the easiest way to push down the feelings and to not to feel. Of course, all the good stuff also comes with all the uncomfortable feelings too (but you already knew that). Its a bundle package. Yes, all the classic benefits of fully embracing NoFap have come about: I have authentic and confident communication with women (so many women are now electrifyingly fascinating to me because of this discipline) to the extent that I have asked my friends advice about how to let girls know kindly that they weren't my type (its a new weird and funny problem to have in my life!) The most difficult part of the 90day challenge? It was when I went on retreat to the mountains for 2 weeks where there was no electricity/internet/tv. It was a massive struggle emotionally (I felt kinda angry for no apparent reason) because my brain started screaming out for stimulation of somekind (it felt like there were a hundred baby chicks in my head wanting to be fed with the click click click click of a laptop). Being deprived of all technology (which I discovered for me is a watered-down-methadone version of PMO) revealed the level of general visual stimulation I was used to in my life. It was very instructional. I hadn't really thought about what I would do once I had reached my goal. I know in my bones that Porn is right off the cards for me, and I now find the thought of it distateful (this genuinely feels like re-aligning my ethics with my tastes as described in the reboot accounts). What is also weird, is the idea of Fapping feels like a big deal now that I have invested all this time to this personal challenge, so I am letting the 90 days slide into the unknown... Thank you for all the support that you have and are giving, its a genuine privilige to have found such brave warriors and to be counted as one of them! My question is, what next? (please, your advice is most welcome)"

It numbed me and my vulnerability. Now that I dont have it, I feel more exposed, vulnerable, and I feel things much deeper. But this has also brought up a lot of anxiety that Ive been suppressing for awhile. I used PMO to escape from all those feelings because they were uncomfortable. Now Im facing them, and it takes courage because it can be overwhelming. Doing NoFap has shown me the original things I wanted to escape from by using PMO, but now Im dealing with them. The cravings are back because of all this, but no way am I giving up now. Has anyone had an experience like this? "

Some thoughts,1,327drg,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/327drg/slipped_yesterday_some_thoughts/,2015-04-11 15:36:23,"I've been slipping the last few weeks, but yesterday was the worst and just wanted to share a few thoughts. 1) It looks like I didn't exactly understand what ""porn"" was. For different people with different desires it may mean different things. I'm a crossdresser and therefore the Amazon ""women's clothing"" page should be considered porn by me as it arouses me. I browsed through /r/nofap and I found a good, simple definition - in the early stages of doing nofap anything that arouses you could be considered porn. 2) I'm much weaker when in an emotionally vulnerable spot. Two days ago my girlfriend hurt me emotionally (nothing bad actually, but hurt me a bit) and yesterday I was hurt by two colleagues at work, whom I now consider colleagues and not friends. I was also quite annoyed / angry at work for various reasons and I think that state contributed significantly to me slipping. 3) Boredom is one of the biggest enemies. I was just lying in bed yesterday thinking about what happened at work and the thoughts started crawling in. I used the usual defences but when you're lying in bed doing nothing, just out there with your thoughts, those defences aren't enough. What can I do about this? Well with (1) it's simple, it's a bit of an ""eureka"", you realize that ""porn"" means much more and you need to abstain from much more than just what regular people describe as ""porn"". With (2) I guess it's good to realize that when I'm in a vulnerable state the thoughts might start crawling in more and this way I can prepare myself better - schedule drinks / dinners / outings with friends for an evening that I know might be tough. Or get myself excited with a good movie, video game, side project that might get me occupied in a time of vulnerability. Plan ahead basically. And with (3), that one's tougher, I need to work on my defences better, but I think for now something as simple as taking a walk might actually do it. I'm thinking of doing meditation as well, or making myself work out if the thoughts start crawling in. Alright. Today's a new day one. Hoping for the best, but won't be disappointed if I slip again. Every slip makes me stronger. Good luck to all other nofappers out there!"

I deleted my porn collection. It was tremendously difficult. My finger hovered over the delete button nervously. After I pressed it and emptied my recycle bin, I strangely felt a sense of grieving for all of my beloved videos and all of the pictures I had spent hours finding and saving. It felt like my safety net that I could come back to whenever I needed it. But I don't want to live like that. I don't want to live in fear. I want to have the courage to engage with my vulnerability. I want to have the courage to be authentic. And even though I grieved for the loss of my collection, it also felt like somewhat of a relief. Because now that temptation isn't there. I don't have to worry about turning back to open the same old file. It's gone. Today, I'm turning over a new leaf. I can't do this anymore. I need to be free from my bondage to this. And this is my present to myself. I can do this. We all can. We're in this together, brothers. Your fellowship in our bold undertaking of the ultimate challenge is a great birthday gift to me.

263,vulnerability,NoFap,What Women Really Want,5,339b1x,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/339b1x/what_women_really_want/,2015-04-21 03:58:21,"Like many of you I have experienced the oft-discussed superpowers of nofap, but specifically increased attractiveness to women. And again like many of you I have questioned the actual validity of this superpower. Is it the placebo effect, male pheromones, increased confidence, or just increased awareness? These explanations could be partly the cause, but I believe it is something else. I have been reading the book ""Models: Attract Women Through Honesty"" by Mark Manson that I believe when paired with knowledge gained from nofap explains this superpower. Manson explains that women primarily want a man who is comfortable with himself and expresses himself honestly; in other words, becomes vulnerable. We shrink back from being vulnerable, because it has been ingrained in us that vulnerability equals weakness and neediness, but its not. The kind of vulnerability I am referring to, is often called confidence, but the word confidence carries a lot of douchey alpha male baggage. Being vulnerable doesnt mean you should open up to a girl and beg her to go on a date with you because you havent been on a date in three years. I mean be honest with her, and yourself, about who you are, your intentions, and what you really believe. There is nothing less needy than honestly approaching a girl you like, telling her you like her, and asking her to go on a date with you. How is this? You have made yourself vulnerable. By doing this you show her that you are OK with being rejected, and you have the balls to come out and say what you mean. Using pickup lines, scripts, techniques, or simply trying to be her friend is disingenuous, and shell see through it. You may be asking what does this have to do with nofap? Everything! When we are hooked on porn, we are dulled and numbed emotionally and we become needy and pathetic. We put up fronts and have to fake our way through social interactions because of our shame, lack of social skills, and mental fog. PMO robs us of our natural instincts and feelings that help us when interacting with women. Women can tell we are not being honest about who we truly are, or have something to hide. They may not be able to put there finger on it, but something about us turns them off when we are living the PMO lifestyle. Quitting PMO allows us to be honest, vulnerable, and confident around women both in verbal and nonverbal communication. We start to like who we are as a person and the women around us, like us in return. I hope I was able to articulate my thoughts in an intelligible way, but regardless I recommend you read ""Models: Attract Women Through Honesty."" tl;dr PMO inhibits honest interactions with women, which in turn, turns them off.

I used porn to self medicate, to mask the negative emotions I was experiencing and to gain a temporary relief from unhappiness, boredom etc. The problem with this is it is very temporary, like any addiction you need more and more to get the same effect, the more you get the more you beat yourself up and the worse you feel and round and around you go. I repeated this same cycle for over 20 years, slowly but surely loathing myself more and more. Eventually a couple of months ago I just reached a point it didn't matter how often or how much porn I looked at there was no relief any more. I couldn't suppress the negative emotions or continue with the self denial about how out of control I was or unsatisfied I was with my life. I stopped looking at porn, started NoFap, started meditating and exercising, started socialising with friends and I've felt stronger emotionally than I have in years. I've since been arrested in relation to my internet activity and this has been a huge blow, I'm now more depressed, anxious and stressed than I've ever been. Suicidal thoughts even enter my mind when I contemplate the consequences but you know what I still feel stronger and more free than I ever have. These thoughts and emotions I now experience are so painful I feel myself welling up with tears at random times of the day, just now sat at my desk at work as I type this, but you know what now I embrace it all, at last I know that I'm alive and I don't want to hide from my emotions any more. My mind is no longer numbed either by using porn or pre-occupied with when I can next look at it. Porn used to be my life, if I was at work, out with friends or family half the time I'd be counting down till I could go home and watch porn instead of living for the moment. Porn still pops in to my mind and I would be lying to say all temptation has gone. I have images in my mind I wish I had never seen and that I could erase but my thoughts no longer linger on porn I've seen or that I want to see, when a thought or image pops in to my mind of porn I think of all the negatives consequences no matter how painful and dismiss the urge, for the temporary relief it would bring I would not exchange one minute more of my life, I realise now it is too precious. Life can be full of happiness, joy, love but also pain, sadness and heartache, embrace it, embrace your vulnerability, survive and grow stronger, then you can truly come to appreciate the life that you have and savour the happy moments when they come."

It does **not** say that any masturbation at all is necessarily bad or wrong. This is a sensible view, and one I believe is reflected in the WebMD pages below. Please note these links give reasons why for most people masturbation is fine. **If you are struggling at the moment, don't go to these links.** [URL [URL I recognize that many people in this community have religious reasons for abstaining, and I certainly don't want to belittle or undermine those.

I think that recognizing and having an informed understanding of why we are doing this (for religious reasons, or because of vulnerability to compulsive masturbation or other problems) is an important foundation for our efforts.

Perhaps this is a violation of my March agreement, but I turned by head away several times because I wanted to watch the shows themselves, not their respective nudity. I confess that I have been isolating myself for several months and now am beginning to understand why; I feel ashamed of myself and have believed that I'm supposed to do everything alone and that I should be strong enough on my own to conquer any addiction or habit. But the reality is that I can't do anything alone. The idea that we're supposed to live these isolated lives is a lie, a scam, a con to try to get us back into our addictions. But really, what are addictions except trying to meet healthy needs in unhealthy ways? I need intimacy, love and acceptance and all of these are positive, healthy things except when I try to get those needs met in unhealthy ways like through pornography. And why do I keep running back to it? Because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of genuine intimacy, love and acceptance because I don't want to get hurt and I want to be in control and I'm insecure and weak. There, I said it. I am weak. But I think that the reason I've arrived at this place is because I have refused to admit the truth that I need acceptance and love and intimacy and help. But I do want and need these things. I need to feel understood by others, I need hugs, and need regular, quality contact with other people, and I need friends who see who I am not who I want them to see. I need people to see that I'm not doing well, that I don't have my shit together, and that I am flawed. This is where I'm at, and I'm admitting it because I need to. I think perhaps many other people feel the same way, because something tells me that I'm not alone.

268,vulnerability,NoFap,Dissociative Nature of Sexual Addiction and Role of Traumatic Emotions,2,2y3e0s,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2y3e0s/dissociative_nature_of_sexual_addiction_and_role/,2015-03-06 13:16:53,"I'll try to summarize/transcribe a very powerful journal article by Craparo Giuseppe from Social and Behavioral Sciences 114 2014. Abstract: The term addiction applies to a morbid form characterized by substance abuse, an object or a behaviour; it defines a dysfunctional mental state characterized by a feeling of irrepressible desire and uncontrollable need to be repeated in a compulsive manner; it is an invasive condition marked by the phenomena of craving in a frame of uncontrollable habit that causes clinically significant distress. The authors propose a new interpretation of sexual addiction as a dissociative mechanism to regulate not-modulated emotions that were not mentalized (traumatic emotions) in early relationships with primary caregivers. To start from this theoretical model, this article suggests a treatment of sex addiction focused on the identifying and regulation of traumatic emotions implicated in sexual compulsion. IMO, my parents neglected me, they were not emotionally in tune with me, and they were not emotionally available. they did not mirror my emotional state, and help me mentalize my emotions into units of value ""feelings,"" so that I could express them in interpersonal relationships. A primary care giver's role should include fostering the emotional growth and maturation of their dependents. That includes helping them identify their basic emotions, helping them find symbolic meaning for their emotions, so they can remain in the emotional state and mentally identify the way they feel with accepted language. Traumatic emotions are non-symbolic, because they were never identified in the relationship with the primary care-giver. Pornography and masturbation are used to annihilate the painful emotions. Pornography consumption leads to a distinct cycle of behavior: 1. obsessiveness a) recursive thoughts and images concerning the experiences of addiction or the ideas related to the addiction (e.g. excessive absorption in reliving past addiction experiences or in day-dreaming or in planning future experiences of addiction); b) the thoughts and the images related to the behaviour of addiction are egosyntonic and cause, at the same time, a generalized tension; 2. impulsiveness a) restlessness, anxiety, irritability or nervousness when it is not possible to put the addictive behaviour into effect; b) recurrent failure to withstand and to regulate the desires of addiction and the impulses to put the addictive behaviour into effect; 3. compulsiveness a) repetitive behaviour of addiction that the person feels forced to put into effect, also against his own will, despite the possible negative consequences, as a result of the recurrent fantasies regarding addictive behaviour and the deficit of impulse control; b) the compulsory behaviour or actions of addiction are directed to avoid or to prevent states of uneasiness or to relieve a dysphoric mood (e.g. feelings of impotence, irritability, inadequacy). ""Down this evolutionary line, traumatic emotions are the result of a lacking mentalization of specific, basic or aporetic emotion, which remain inside somatic memory due to repeated experiences of emotional neglect."" What we observe in a sexually addicted individual is his/her inability to recognize emotions as signals. In these individuals, what is affected is the capacity to tolerate the physiological arousal which follows the emergence of traumatic emotions. The narrowing of the tolerance window and the recursive oscillation between the states of hyper arousal and hypo arousal, may eventually hamper more complex cortical functions which foster metacognitive processes of self-reflection and impulse control, as well as causing a progressive fragmentation of the sense of Self that generates disorientation, fragmentation, an increase of difficult when modulating sensorimotor activation, and in important vulnerability to pain. Clinical case: When he comes for our session, Roberto, an eighteen year old teenager, reports his own inclination to regularly engage in (hetero-) sexual promiscuous experiences with girls he has never met before and often with prostitutes. Such an urge, which has the features of impulsive-compulsive behaviour, is caused by a state of tension that suddenly overcomes him without an external cause. When invited to describe the psycho-physical state accompanying this tension, the patient claims to always feel an increase of heart rate, excitement (with erection), sweating and severe pain in the stomach (thus, it is a hyper arousal). His psychological state associated with such physiological arousal is characterized by initial confusion that is soon followed by the emergence of a dissociated Self state. As affirmed by the patient: During those moments, I feel like a different Roberto. I am grabbed by sexual fantasies that come with such strength that I cant get rid of them. I get the urge to stop the pain by going with prostitutes. I dont care about what will happen to me, or if Im seen or about the embarrassment if my family found out. Its like I am someone else. I don't care a damn about anything or anyone. But, after having had sex with a prostitute, I feel bad. I come home and shut myself up in my room feeling sick and ashamed. You know, I can't even stand looking at myself in the mirror. I keep saying to myself that this is the last time, but it's just a lie Therapy of this patient shows that his compulsive need to have sex does not represent the expression of an unconscious conflict; it is a deficit of mentalization of traumatic emotions. His state of hyper arousal (which can be considered the basis of his craving) is thus the expression of emotions that he does not reflectively link to prior life experience. It is for this reason that they he is lead (the individual) to use an external object drug (sex) which according to the patients experience, is able to reduce psychophysical tension state (a state of hypo arousal) producing temporary pleasure. Abnormal emotional experience processing is related to the history of his relationship with non-responsive caregivers. Family anamnesis shows that Roberto lives in a neglecting family context where he was taken care of more from a material point of view than from an emotional one. An example of this emotional neglect can be considered the fact that he has always experienced a role reversal condition in his relationship with his parents. Since I was a little child says Roberto I've always found myself in the situation of comforting my mother, I've always had to reassure her because my father was often away from home. Ive always tried to hide my pain because I knew there would be no one to comfort me Treatment of sexual addiction According to what we stated so far, the treatment of a patient affected by sexual addiction requires specific clinic work aimed at the mentalization and the integration of the patient's own traumatic emotions. Affect mentalization (Jurist, 2008) represents the basic condition for the patient to be able to understand and regulate emotional contents (traumatic emotions) which lie beneath his sexual compulsion. In sexual addiction psychopathology, sexual behaviour is but a dissociative measure which aims to avoid feeling psycho-physical pain provoked by the activation of emotions which are known (pre-reflectively) to the individual but not mentalized (Bollas, 1987) and that lead him\her to experience states of sensorimotor hyperactivity. The goals of mentalization-based treatment of sexual addiction are: a) increasing mentalization, which entails to b) developing capacities for the identification and exploration of traumatic emotions; c) working on current painful mental states; d) developing the ability to inhabit one's own body. As we mentioned in the previous section, an aspect we consider essential, when it comes to handling sex drives, concerns the acquisition of a new relationship with pain: notably, it refers to helping the patient to mentalize his/her own pain. Mentalization of pain goes through a new relationship with both ones own emotions and body. Thus, the therapist would be expected to encourage the patient to gain a new self-awareness so as to make him/her capable of linking an idea of body to (painful) sensations he/she is experiencing in the present or has already experienced in the past and that are the core of his/her pathological relationship with sexuality. Conclusions Our reflections on sexual addiction lead us not to consider compulsive sexual behaviour as a symptom, a metaphor of an unconscious conflict, but to think of it as a deficit of both: integration skills of mental and corporeal experiences and mentalization of the emotions. As Allen, Fonagy and Bateman (2008) remind us, mentalized affectivity does not mean taking a detached intellectual stance on one's emotion but rather entails achieving clarity about emotional experience [...] not just thinking clearly but also feeling clearly. Feeling clearly indeed is a necessary condition in order to live sexuality not as a mental refuge where to sedate one's pain, but as a spur capable of driving the individual towards an intimate relationship where to discover ones subjectivity as well as that of the others. Footnote: I recommend reading Otto RANK's psychological theory about primal separation anxiety, stored as somatic memory form our birth experience, and our symbolic yearning for reentry into the vagina (womb), a place of unity, wholeness, and security. Rank says an anxious man clumsily grasps in social situations to achieve wholeness (meaningful relationships). The average man follows society's prescribed methods of living, and the ""artist"" finds ways to integrate the polarity of separation and union with creative methods, acting out his feelings symbolically. I hope this post helps people struggling with traumatic (unidentified, painful) emotions."

If we never allowed ourselves to be vulnerable, we would never be able to create (what if our project doesn't work?). We would never be able to achieve (what if they laugh at me?).

270,vulnerability,NoFap,40 DAY REPORT - The greatest rewards in life are those that require discipline.,29,308v7h,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/308v7h/40_day_report_the_greatest_rewards_in_life_are/,2015-03-25 23:39:03,"edit* URL (someone reposted my ""5 addiction lies"" last week and added a background track to listen to while reading... it seemed like a cool idea so I'm stealing it) There has always been a part of my brain that never thinks it will get enough. Enough to drink, enough to eat, enough sex, enough love, enough money... the list goes on and on. I have always thought this way about most things in my life. And I think this is the root cause for many of my addictions and compulsions. I have been addicted to many things in my life. Alcohol, cigarettes, porn and masturbation, sex, adderall, oxycontin, over-working(70+hours/week), obsessively picking my face and arms, chewing the inside of my cheeks, overeating (eating an entire pizza in one sitting)... those are my main compulsive behaviors/addictions. I have come to believe that this way of thinking stems from early abandonment issues in my childhood. My parents were good to me. They loved me the best they could, but they made quite a few mistakes in raising me (like all parents do). I was *always* a needy child, even from infancy. I suffered from colic when I was a baby, which I think some of my problems can be traced back to. I would cry for hours and nothing could comfort me. Even as a small baby I was in this mode of thinking that I would never get enough... enough attention, enough comfort, enough love. I am *NOT* trying to say... 'oh I cried as a baby, my parents sucked, and now I have a justification for my addiction.' In fact, quite the opposite. In exploring my past I am experiencing emotions that I have repressed for years. I am realizing that everyone makes mistakes and it is okay to forgive others and myself. I can take responsibility for my addiction and start to change my outdated and destructive mode of thinking. My addict-self tells me I will never get enough. That I need to drink more, eat as much as I can, masturbate for hours. I have to enjoy it while it lasts because it will soon be gone. Even from my first drink of alcohol, this was the case. I didn't just have a couple of beers. I chugged 8 cans of warm pbr as fast as I could and then puked all night next to the campfire. I didn't just masturbate once a week... I watched porn for hours and hours and would orgasm sometimes more than 4 times in one day. I have similar problems with compulsive eating, exercising, working, etc... My brain encourages me to get as much as I possibly can at all times. I am finally realizing that if I don't engage in these activities. Drinking, smoking, porn, and masturbation... greater rewards will enter my life over time. This is something that I thought I knew... but I really never comprehended. My inner-addict was so convinced that orgasm was the best reward I could get in life. I thought sex was love. When I had sex with someone, I started to fall in love with them because they gave me my drug... my orgasm. I stayed in destructive relationships far too long. I had no idea what life could be. What happiness really is. What love is. I had forgotten how to truly love. The greatest reward that recovery has brought me so far is not the ""superpowers"" that I hear about so often in this sub. Sure... I am more confident, charismatic, brave, and daring. This all stems from the fact that I believe I deserve these things. I am starting to love myself unconditionally and to me, that should be the goal of recovery. Unconditional love for yourself is the absolute greatest reward you can ever attain in life. It is far more important to love yourself, than to get the attention from a hot girl at work or in the gym. But if you start to love yourself, you may find that people respect you more. This cannot be the only motivation, though. It has to come from a desire within yourself to change. True Intimacy. I had always heard that relationships will only work with honestly and vulnerability. I thought I knew what that meant. My last relationship ended after four years.. we lived together for two of those years. We owned a dog together. We were practically married. And yet, I had *never* experienced true intimacy even once during those four miserable years. I was never capable of experiencing intimacy and vulnerability because both of these things require rigorous honesty.. which starts with loving yourself. How could I be honest with my partner when I couldn't even be honest with myself. How could I love someone else when I didn't even love myself? This past month has been a whirlwind of emotion. I have cried hysterically, I have screamed, I have begging, I have fought to be where I am today. I have seen tears in the eyes of those that I love the most in this world. I have started to face the shadow of my past and forgive this flawed part of me. I have started to love myself unconditional. I'm starting to believe I deserve to be happy. I am seeing my girlfriend of two years in an entirely different way. I am falling in love with her all over again. I am learning to feel EVERYTHING. I am learning to be human again."

I was feeling positive, getting along with people, feeling optimistic about springtime and the future. I'm sure I could've kept going... but I didn't. I was just sitting there. I didn't do anything after my stupid job. I had the site typed in, I sat there for a long time, and then I did it. There were a million things I could've been doing. I could've fought harder. I could've cleaned, worked out, talked to someone, make some art... whatever but I CHOSE to just do nothing and then relapse. I'm bummed, I'm not devastated. My streak has been positive. I can build on it. I'll survive. l'll have an okay day tomorrow and try again. I'm sick of people acting like relapsing destroys everything. Dudes will make it like 90 plus days on hard mode (which is insane!) relapse and declare EVERYTHING IS RUINED! It's fine. Nofap shouldn't be the point of life. Other things are more important, nofap can definitely become an unhealthy obsession. Jerkin it every once in a while should not destroy you. On the other hand (to go in the complete opposite direction) I totally get it. I know what it's like to be living for porn. It's given me the most depressive, empty periods of my life. I fucking love it though. I'm super addicted. I like porn better than sex. I can't handle relationships. I can't handle vulnerability or awkwardness at all. I can't commit to a person. I can't handle getting my feelings hurt or hurting someones feelings. I'm getting older now and this relapse reinforces the idea that I might just never truly fall in love with anybody. And that's all I really want. Like I want to start a family with someone. But it feels like I'll always end up loving porn too much and never make the effort that I need to. This is crushing. If porn is your favorite thing, that isn't a good way to be. I spent a while writing this and I'd be down for advice/encouragement/conversation. just saying..."

I was proud of it, and I still am, but someone said ""Mailanka, just do hard mode. It's worth it."" ...And so, I discovered that it is. This star was earned on hard mode. I have a hard time explaining how I achieved it. I know I should, because that will help others who are struggling. I went for years on the NoFap challenge without getting more than 2 weeks, and now I'm at a month and going strong. 1. Even failure can lead to success, if you fail forward. Each time I faltered, I learned something. I learned that fapping didn't really make me happy, it just made me miserable afterwords. I learned what my triggers were, and what I had to avoid. I learned that easy mode was good, but not enough. It's a process, and I'm reaping the benefits of that process. 2. You have to accept that you'll never fap again. Every time I face a trigger, a part of me wants to, and there's a voice that pops up in the back of my head with a smirky ""And then what?"" Fap just leads me to a dead end, and so I recognize triggers as empty things and I can walk away from them. I have accepted that I won't be that person anymore, that I've left him behind. I know, I know, we all hear that, we all say things like that, but you really, in your heart, have to make that conversion. Until you do, you can't get very far. You must fundamentally change, but that comes from the process, above. 3. I'm not afraid to starve. I think we tend to see sexual energy as like hunger, a need to be filled. If we cannot find a woman to sate that hunger, we accept the thinner gruel of fapping. But that's not actually what's going on here. Sexual energy is a driving force. It can push men to greatness. It makes us drop our guard and risk rejection and vulnerability to chase. Now that I have accepted, really accepted, that I will never fap again, that sexual energy has only one outlet, and that is feminine sexual energy. The results are magnetic. People talk about how women seem drawn towards men on NoFap, the so-called magic powers, but I wonder if it's just that we become so drawn to them that they can't help but notice and blossom under that attention. To be wanted is a pretty heady thing. Scientists talk about the marriage curse, this idea that many of the greatest scientists did their best work before they married. I speculate that men are driven by desire, by their energy, to greatness. To attract a mate, we would climb mountains and slay dragons. But if you've emptied that energy and discarded it with fapping, you have less drive to achieve. Sexual energy, then, is not a danger to be discarded, but a potent strength to be exploited. 4. Have a reason. It's not enough, I think, to just say ""I'm going to do this thing."" At some point, your inner self will ask ""Why am I doing this again?"" A girlfriend will help. ""I'm doing this for her,"" you'll say. I don't have that. For me, it's more spiritual, more about the eyes I have on me, the example I need to be, and the progress I want to make. But I have it, a reason, a why. Will it last? Will I make it to two months? And then three? I won't lie, it hasn't been easy. It never is. It never gets any lighter. But you do get better at bearing the weight, especially as you come to understand it better. It'll last. Anyway, I don't talk much on these boards, but I hope this helps someone."

I am actually in a relationship with the greatest girl of my life. She was my crush in high school but she moved before any fires could kindle. We reconnected about four months ago and every single day has been an incredible blessing since then. Not only do we have a perfect sex life but our communication is on point. I know things I don't wanna know about her and vice versa, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The trust we have is amazing and I've never had it with any other single person in the world. I am sorry if I seem braggadocios I just want to give a small background. The ONLY bad part is that she just recently went in to serve time for a DUI she received about a year before we met. As time passed my loneliness grew and my thoughts lingered to pornography. (Terrible, I know.) When I was eleven I was addicted to amphetamines and sometimes the right poison will throw me in a loop. I have to live very cautiously because of my past. My woman nurtured my soul, reassured me of my insecurities and talked me through my negative thoughts. Now that she is gone and I have been doing this my insecurities have amplified. She gets to leave the jail every couple days to walk a couple miles to this community center to find a job. The jail is on the bad side of town and since I have started watching these porno's I just can't stop imagining her being gang-banged or finding some hot guy at the community center and discreetly giving him a blowjob. (Sorry if I am triggering anyone else's behaviors, it is just what is killing me on the inside.) She is so loyal and trustworthy but then that content just piles up. The words ""watch as cute teen girl sucks and fucks boyfriends best friend"" or ""hot girl deep throats stranger in bathroom"" rattle around in my clogged up brain and I get nervous and scared. I saw her for the first time in five days (That is the longest time we have been apart) and I was very loving but also just constantly spilling the beans about how I was worried she would be committing sex acts out of desperation or vulnerability. Again, she reassured me with the smile of an angel that she is in love with me and that my demons were just playing tricks on me. She told me she would do her best to constantly remind me how much I mean to her; which is so cool because no one should have to do that in a relationship! I am just damaged. (My last girlfriend cheated on me with a few different men.) As I sit here alone though the aftermath of what I have done still taunts me and it doesn't help she tells me she is getting cat calls from homeless guys and strangers honking their horn as she walks (but I love that she tells me EVERYTHING. Even stuff I don't want to hear, that is a great sign imo! Like, if she had something to hide she wouldn't have said anything of that nature.) I decided today, recognizing a pattern, that I would stop looking at pornography. I have decided to read books if I start getting to bold on the internet or go for a run if I feel an insatiable urge. The problem is in the moment, when I get horny, I get REALLY horny. My mind tricks me into thinking if I don't get off I will die or something crazy lol! I want to nourish the love I have for my woman and right now I have done a terrible job. As much as I have learned to trust her it is still difficult. The country we live in treats women terribly. I am guilty of contributing to this. She is my redemption. My ticket out. What I need is some support because without her I feel really alone and it tempts me to withdraw into this blue-light seclusion. Help me stick to my word for the next 26 days. To keep my thoughts positive. Give me advice. Tips. Tricks. Anything that will get me back on a positive track, not just for her, but for myself and my health and my well being. If anything, thank you for taking time out of your day to read this. I am gonna go for a jog and hopefully will have some cool messages to read when I get back. "

I know that person who this happened with uses this forum and since it happened I have been lurking learning more about why what happened to me did. I have read several concerns from your members struggling with sensations that meet the gray area of what happened. Thank you to anyone for your time, patience, and understanding. I had a friend who struggled with many sexual issues: they had ED, Masturbated too frequently (which didn't help the ED), etc. Well I would witness my friend go from girl to girl ""fall in love"" in these toxic scenarios. We would have long conversations about his toxic choices in chasing unobtainable women beyond a fling/hook up status. I watched as he poured his heart out to woman after woman and they might entertain him for a moment and then wouldn't want a thing to do with him. Which would always be when he would get super clingy to them making things only worse. Well he would every so often blame he failed romantic relationships on his performance uncertainties and do ""reset"" challenges for himself. I would always notice when he was doing challenges he would change and I heard of more strippers, risky sex flings that left me feeling concerned, and in general a significant increase in sexual partners during the times he was choosing to not satisfy himself. He would complain EVERYDAY about how he needed an orgasm though he couldn't do it on his own yet he could if with someone else. We would talk about how I enjoyed our openness though I felt he might be hinting or trying to pressure me into being with him. We had a yo-yo of he would be super affectionate combined with his complaints and I would have to ask him to back down and respect my vulnerability and he would for a few minutes and be right back pawing at me. That combined with his vocalizing he didn't want a relationship with me and how every new broad in his life was the next possible the one and more important than me were what killed me after what happened. ""IT"" basically from his advances and the yo-yo going on I started backing away from him hoping at least until the challenge was done and he maybe chilled out. So I was limiting opportunities for him to try and make advances or pawing at me. Well He picked up on it and created an opportunity I should never of trusted knowing where he was mentally. He created a situation where I was vulnerable to him, climbed on top of me and had sex with me. I was so in shock over what was happening, the betrayal of my trust, and my stupidity for putting myself there I couldn't move or say a word to stop him. He took me no protection, no consent, finished, got off me and told me not to tell anyone. I ended up physically ill from the stress of the encounter and afraid of him. In the days followed he tried to manipulate me into thinking what had happened was consensual even though I knew it wasn't. I was still ill and made him confess how many partners he had had that month. It was multiple not including myself all unprotected and he confessed some were heavily under the influence while he had not been. Finally I broke down mentally I couldn't handle how damaged and used I felt by a dear friend I had been there for on so many things. I ended up in counseling where it took over a month for me to come to terms with what happened was rape. I was unable to press charges for several reasons though it was put on his record for questionable cause. I could not make it emotionally if I had to go through the process the rape kit during my std testing and my 2 rounds of std level treatments were hard enough on me because I did contract from him. Since I have had the unfortunate pleasure of stumbling upon some of his other victims many of which he manipulated identical to myself with the exception many of them he expressed feeling and caring for where with me he had not. It has been therapeutic us all talking together to cope with the way he not only had his way with us how he had convinced each of us in a way to get away with the lack of consent. So on top of feeling shitty enough after what I have been through I am still hurt that at the end of the day I meant less to him than any of the others, I meant and will mean nothing to him. He has likely moved on and continuing life this way. My question is I have read where some of you during challenges increase your flings and sexual partners and that you feel guilty for using them as ""toys"". If they knew they had been a toy what would you say to them to help them understand, if anything? I want to try and understand. why I was made a toy, why he changed (had always been), how he could just use me to get his and be done then try to claim it was consent. How do I pick up the pieces now because I am scared of any guy just using me for their own pleasure or that being their only interest in me. How do I move forward to feel like I matter and can be cared for? There is one I trust and all I need. Though I went from not being afraid of anything to I wont look people in the face, afraid to even attempt to open up or talk to anyone. TL:DR: male friend who stressed they didn't care for me of have any feelings used me as their own personal toy to get off during a challenge, and now I would like help understanding why that happened. Edit: I would like to say thank you to all the amazing people who did comment and helped me further understand it is from his issues himself and not me. I'm sorry to those who are upset I posted here. During therapy I remembered he would speak of coming to this site specifically for support. I wanted to know more about it so I became a lurker and saw the great support you all have for each other for your own self goals. I read a few post where people had expressed woes over feeling things similar to what I would see him do. Unfortunately he used things like this as an excuse for what he did to possibly try to justify it to himself. I hope you know I didn't come here accusing. I was hoping to find more understanding that therapy and the rape support group I partake in don't have any knowledge about my questions."

Funnily enough I don't feel too physically or emotionally hindered by it and it's likely I'll feel similar to how I felt while on the (albeit short) streak, yet there's something demeaning about it controlling you rather than controlling it. I always reminded myself I could stop whenever I wanted but ironically it appears that I can't. I guess here's to another attempt at something longer than a working week but ultimately I'm the only one who can decide that and if up unto this point I've been unable to achieve higher, that's fine and in truth: once every 5 days is still better than my old three-four times a day average.

282,cybersecurity,NoFap,"90 DAYS | Experiences, Advice, Lessons learned | Long Post",1,aaf0tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aaf0tb/90_days_experiences_advice_lessons_learned_long/,2018-12-29 09:20:10,"Hey all! Hope you all are having a wonderful holidays. Today is my 90th day, and I am extremely excited to share this day and my past three months experiences with you all. I hope that the experiences and advice I have helps you achieve your goal as well. Keep in mind, however, this is purely anecdotal and things I say may not be exactly the same for you. Also, to be honest, I never had a true problem with pornography (for example, going to Pornhub to watch porn as I never understood the enticement to watch random people have sex). I would instead use Instagram and or past experiences while fapping, which honestly in hindsight is just as destructive if not *more*. However, my goal was to stop fapping. I fapped daily. I was constantly drained of energy, could not think clearly, and just overall felt useless. I also did not quite fit in even though I knew I did, if that makes sense? Anyways, now that I have prefaced where I started, hopefully this will give you a picture of where I started. I have tried my best to keep note of how I feel as well. This will be broken up into three sections: experiences -&gt; lessons -&gt; advice. So lets start! **Experiences** I will just jump into my current streak, and go over how I got to my current streak in the lessons section. A short preface, I had been trying to do NoFap for almost two years. In late September, I made a deep, conscious decision to stop. It was not a grand event. I did not make a post on NoFap saying ""I'm gonna do it/I'm done fapping"" type of post. It came from within and was actually sort of quiet. Something changed in me. When I first started, I took each day one step at a time. Around day 10 is where it got interesting. I knew this girl from home, but we had never met before. It was one of those ""I know of you but I've never met you"" sort of relationships. I had noticed that she had liked a good amount of my tweets on Twitter. However, I felt she was *way* out of my league. Like, there was absolutely no shot she would be in my league (later did I figure out, I was just selling myself short. I had no self confidence!). Eventually, I slid in her DM's, and long story short, we hit it off *fast*. I got her snap, and it went from there. We talked every single day, whether it was snap, texting, FaceTime, sharing tweets, etc. The attraction was building, and I believe we were both feeling it. I want to digress here for a bit, however. During these times, it would've been very easy to fall into constantly texting her and giving her all of my attention. During NoFap, I focused on myself. I was in the midst of an 18 credit semester; sometimes I would not respond to her for a few hours. My bed time was 9:30PM and getting up at 6AM, where her going to sleep was around 2AM and I would sometimes fall asleep on her. What I'm trying to say here is: yes, I was excited to be talking to this girl. There were times where I would wake up and think ""todays the day she loses interest and we stop talking"". However, I focused on myself and my surroundings. I talked to her when I could. This helped me balance my emotions, which I think is what NoFap is really good at. Before, I know that I would've been so caught up on the possibility of sex that the relationship would have faltered eventually. I was keeping my emotions in line -- not letting them get unbalanced and getting caught up with her. The biggest thing here was keeping my emotions in check and focusing on bettering myself in all aspects of life. Continue. There were times during this, however, that I SO badly wanted to relapse. I mean, think about it, she's unbelievably attractive, giving me attention as well, sending less-than-modest snapchats -- the temptation to relapse was insanely bad. However, every time I would want to fap or even edge, I would tell myself, ""No. You know this is bad for you, first off. You are genuinely enjoying this girl and building a relationship. Why in hell would you risk changing anything? 5 seconds of fapping pales in comparison to how much joy and happiness this has brought you so far"". So I didn't. From days 10-35, it was one of the most exhilarating times I've had in my life in a while. My self confidence was off the charts. Here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen: when I talk to a girl over text for a while, I get bored. I have to do something eventually or I will get bored. One night, she told me that I could trust her and that I could tell her anything. Well, I told her yes, I believe that the way the relationship is going, that that would eventually happen, but we NEEDED to hangout. Anyways, she did. She invited me to her apartment the following weekend (Veterans day weekend. Here's that post -&gt; URL ). We got that scheduled, however keep in mind we never met. We had only facetimed/snapchat/texted. Around Day 35, I hit a flatline. I flatlined, and I would not say that I lost the ""superpowers"", but I just felt calm -- almost hollow. I didn't feel drained; I was just scaled back. I didn't have nearly the same amount of erections that I had before that. Instead of feeling super depressed, I took this time to relax and get in touch with my softer side. There are ebbs and flows to life -- this was the ebb and I addressed the quieter side of my soul that had been sort of neglected for the first month. However, the Monday before I was supposed to go to her apartment, she asked me if I wanted to get dinner in her hometown (my flatline broke literally the day before. I had energy and everything came flowing back. It was amazing!). I agreed, and we had a great night. It was purely emotional. We hugged and held hands, but there was nothing sexual and I was completely okay with that. It was perfect to break the ice, and I really need that emotional connection before being sexual. After that date, everything seemed perfect. However, when I went over that weekend, it was absolutely terrible. For sake of me not having to re-type it, I posted this comment on u/whitetrihard 's post on self worth: &gt; Self appreciation and self worth become very strong and deep. For example -- I went over to a female's apartment for a weekend (she was two hours away at a university that was completely foreign to me -- she was also the most attractive girl I've ever been emotionally invested in). We went clubbing both nights, and the second night we went to her teammate's 21st birthday party and then to the club. That night, she left me to fend for myself. She basically left me by myself and did not introduce me to anyone or check up on me. Of course, I was able to have conversations with random ass people. But you know what I did? After feeling so worthless (because to me it felt like she did not give a fuck what happened to me that night), I left early the following morning without saying a word. She apologized insanely once she realized I was gone and called me 7x, but I just kept going. I'm worth more than that, and I won't suck up to a woman no matter how attractive she is. Value yourself first and foremost. I was actually really upset after that. I had no closure from the situation, and when you go from talking to someone everyday to not speaking to them, that takes a toll on your emotions (even if it is was only for a month). This was a trying time. I had rooted my streak in this relationship. Now that it was over, the future was unknown (ended around day 47). I no longer had the weight of the relationship to give me purpose to my streak. I had a choice here -- would I allow this situation to bring me down and relapse, or take it for what it was worth, appreciate it, and continue to better myself? My logic was this -- if I can attract one of the most beautiful girls that I've ever spoken to, then the who knows what the future holds. I continued the streak, working every single damn day on myself. I have an unbelievable amount of self-worth and confidence (another post on that here -&gt; URL ) To get away from the relationship, since I am coming near the end of my college education, moving into industry is coming up. I am a Computer Science major and have an area of concentration in Cybersecurity Engineering. I'll be honest, I never understood in the past how my friends got internships and I never did. Not to sound condescending, but I had friends who I felt that I had more knowledge than getting internships and I wasn't -- why? I believe it was because without NoFap, I wasn't sure of my skill set. I was not confident when I spoke. Brain fog affected my ability to think clearly; when an interviewer would ask me to explain an algorithm or create one, I would just stammer and could not get through it which would bomb the interview. In the past fifteen days, I put out my first round of job applications in the field for the first time in a year and revamped my resume. I got one interview (I cannot disclose what company or where). Before I had that interview, I got two more e-mails from hiring managers, they were also impressed with my resume, and also wanted interviews. I had one interview last week, and the conversation was free-flowing. I got grilled on algorithms/networking/software design -- yet I believe my anxiety was so low due to NoFap that I was able to effectively not only answer, but be a *normal person*. Subsequently, I got a job offer from them the following day doing exactly what I want in my field. They will also be flying me up at the end of January. I put this completely on NoFap and the ability to be rooted in my own self-confidence and worth. I will admit this though: Throughout the streak, I still have yet for anyone to say that they've noticed a change (albeit, some might be nervous to say something or just dont care to). But the thing is, it does not matter in the slightest. If I know there's changes and I see them before my eyes, that's the proof I need. **Learning Experiences** I just want to take time to express how *hard* it was. Ladies and gentlemen, it took me almost two years to finally reach 90 days. You can see here: URL that that was the first post I ever made in the NoFap community. It has been a very long and hard road. There were highs -- and of course lows. One of the biggest struggles I had when I first started was that I could never make it past 14 days. For some reason, any time 14 days would roll around, I would relapse. It could have been mental, I'm not sure. However, that was the first roadblock. I must've failed at 14 days probably at least five times. I would relapse, and then binge. There were times where I'd get a 14 day streak, relapse, and then relapse again, and then not try again for a few weeks. Eventually, the way I got over this, was on that fourteenth day, I would keep myself out of my apartment. The first time I broke through 14 days, I made it to 18 days. Although I relapsed, I did not discourage. I had proven to myself I was capable of this. After getting over that obstacle, I could only get to about 20 day streaks, and then relapse for a week, then try again. I was still on Tinder, Instagram etc. which I knew I should delete, but I just could not bring myself to it. I also suffered from edging really bad. This was something that I had convinced myself that was *not that bad* since I was not ejaculating. However, it was just as bad and had me feeling just as terrible as a full blown relapse the following day. However, I am not sure what changed, but after a few months of that cycle, I busted out a 45 day streak. During this streak I edged and did not build many new habits. I did experience the typical pluses, like less brain fog, increased awareness/wit, less social anxiety etc. but they were still inhibited by edging and just a lack of new habits. Once I relapsed after the 45 day streak, I binged for a few more weeks and barely could get passed a few days. It just seemed hopeless and the pluses just did not seem that great. I was trying to stick to NoFap, but only half-heartedly. After this past summer, I decided to try it again. I am going into my fourth and final year of college, and I was really quite ashamed that I had not rid myself of this. I had seen posts on r/NoFap about people who would give anything to have their youth back, and this really helped put it in perspective. I learned to stay out of my room. I learned to push myself out of my comfort zone. I worked out in the gym long before NoFap. I also learned that the days where I would have urges or I felt a surge in energy were the days where I would go the hardest, knowing that if I exhausted myself that I would have less of a chance to fap later. The biggest thing I learned was to take each day one step at a time and to never get complacent. I learned throughout the 90 days that NoFap is simply not about the superpowers or impressing other people -- it is about improving yourself and realizing your own self-worth. **Advice** First off, temptations do not have one specific attack vector; there are many many ways they can creep in and you must be on guard at all time. Every single day, you must wake up and realize that it is a new battle. I deleted Tinder, as I realized that it was a trigger and that I can meet females in person. You must figure out your big triggers and work your way down to specific triggers. Another thing I would say is to go to sleep early. I am going to sleep at 9:30PM and waking up at 6AM. The first three weeks sucked, I'm not going to sugarcoat. I would wake up and try so hard to convince myself to get back in bed. Instead, I got up and *meditated* for 45 minutes everyday. I am Catholic, and I would go in before the Blessed Sacrament and simply just find myself and speak with Christ. If you are not religious, then I would simply say to meditate, but simply find peace and quiet. To me, this is where I made leaps and bounds of progress in self-worth. Becoming in tune with myself and starting the day early doing this allowed me to set the tone for the rest of the day. I believe meditation in general is the most important part of NoFap. I never did cold showers, sorry I just enjoy warm showers too much. Another big thing is keeping your emotions in check. There were a few times where I had mood swings and would have to apologize to people. Chalk this up to personal development -- you learned how to be humble. Humility was something I would also express to you all to have at the forefront of your development. As you become less socially anxious and have more self-confidence, you must balance that with being humble. You're excited about your new found self; and thats great! But you must balance it with humility. **Conclusion** All in all, it's been a hell of a ride so far and I absolutely will continue living this lifestyle. This is a way of life, not just reaching 90 days and being done with it. Throughout life, we must always continue working on ourselves and learning. TL;DR: Read the post. If you're serious about NoFap, stop taking shortcuts and take time to learn from those who have found the key to success."
283,cybersecurity,NoFap,It's time to get motivated.,1,9lifl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9lifl6/its_time_to_get_motivated/,2018-10-05 12:35:27,"Recently, I broke a 20 day streak. Why? Because I thought, I wonder what's the top thing on my favorite site right now? Big mistake. Ever since then, I feel more tired, less motivated to finish my schoolwork than ever. My mom has been noticing too, telling me I've been less motivated lately. I believe it's becausw of PMO. I would like to finish high school, graduate college with a associates in Cybersecurity and a masters in Computer Engineering, but I believe that I'm being held back by PMO. I'm too overweight for what a person my age should be, so I think I will be taking up exercise as a way to get rid of my temptations. It's time to get motivated, finish school, lose weight, and quit PMO!"

Even last month if felt like I could crank out a 15 day streak no problem but now I'm struggling to make it past a day or two. I have a great internship in cybersecurity with a final deliverable due in less than a month so I can't waste any time but before I know it I'm PMO'ing and I feel like I have no self control. I kept waking up and PMO'd probably about 4 times last night despite having been to the gym and gone to bed completely exhausted. "

I got a decent grade which was awesome, but that was all that really went well during that time. I'm on 12 days now, and I've started a new job in cybersecurity, hit the gym more, played more ice hockey and began to start conversations with people more. I made a post the day before yesterday about how I started a conversation on the bus with a girl and we got lunch together and she invited me to the carnival with her friends. I had an HR briefing today (2 weeks after my internship start date lol) before which I met a cute girl waiting for the same briefing so I struck up a conversation with her, and turns out she was on the same internship program but in a different department so I got her Facebook after the meeting and we had our coffee break together in the afternoon (she asked me!). I've experienced so much more in these past 12 days than the whole of my previoud 56 day streak. Guys (and girls), don't stay inside all day and count away the days. The world is yours for the taking, so get out there and seize every opportunity!"

I had 2 and a half years of MGTOW/NOFAP beauty. Everything was amazing. I was seriously on top of my game. No Drugs or Alcohol. Hitting the gym 3-5x a week and working a substitute teaching job just really having amazing students and really working on my interpersonal skills with co-employees and just really ingrained into a nice life. I went on a nice 6 months raw vegan streak of no-meat or dairy just raw fruits,veggies, nuts and seeds. Then I started hitting age 30 and kinda got depressed. I was having to go through a lot of the process of not having a wife or kids now and I had to move into the back of my parents backyard in a converted shed. Over the past 4 months I've been on a real low. I gave into eating meat again, my detox is over, the muscle mass I created over the past 2 years went away because I was getting sick from the food I was eating when I was working out thats why I went on the detox. I also went back to the porn frequency in the mind, closed myself up, depressed about a shitty job still substitute teaching like a babysitter, having to borrow my moms car now because my other car got ruined. I have little money now only like 2k dollars and I feel like fucking shit. Goal for the next 2 months: Get a fucking job overseas with my own apartment. Start my masters in cybersecurity. Slowly start to feel myself again. Get this shitty ass energy out of me. Start feeling again. It was a good ride over the past 2 and a half years but I really need help rebooting. This shit is getting to me. I feel low."
287,cybersecurity,NoFap,(Trigger warning) well i have decided...,1,6ihe4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6ihe4x/trigger_warning_well_i_have_decided/,2017-06-21 08:03:42,"Im just going to be completely honest, and this comes from me doing nofap for about 2 months, I would like to make a few point on it, and for a better picture, this post is **why you shouldnt nofap**, of course you will not agree, and say a bunch of things like ""oh he hasnt seen the benefits yet, what a non-believer"", Im sure the mods are going to take this down, but I will post it until it gets noticed and people open their eyes, so a brief story for all you guys out there: Hallow fellow reditors, my name is Core (on reddit of course), I started nofap about 2 months ago, and as everyone knows, the first few days are the most painful, its not enjoyable and can bring all the things you been hiding to surface out like an avalanche of emotions, but as I went on I eventually reached 2 weeks, thats when it started all those super-powers, lots of energy, happiness, annnnd then, the dreaded *flatline*, like the beginning , all that depression and your mind yelling ""I really need this"" comes out full blast, so eventually I relapsed, saying to myself I was going to control my masturbation, with no porn, but then I started watching a little bit and another relapse on full, but then I thought to myself... wow, why am I really doing nofap, and here comes my conclusion to why nofap is just stupid: *in the past, a lot of girls approached me, and I was just not into it (mainly high school, Im currently in college taking cybersecurity) *I noticed one thing that was insane, of course I like girls, of course I wanted a girlfriend, but fuck, when people here in nofap keep saying ""you have to push yourself and shit"" whats the ***** point? I like my computer, I like sitting all day doing nothing, I occasionally meditate and go out to water my huge garden (about 10m^squared) *this is a little different but level with me, people! girls in this country are so stupid! some getting pregnant at 16, some that just choose to smoke weed and live with some high school dropout that sells dope, telling people here to ""go out there and chase after them"" is the same thing as saying, stop doing something that brings you pleasure in the comfort of your home, buuuut ***read this***, i in fact believe porn is bad, but wise man once said ""you cant just quit something you enjoy, cause your midn will still want it no matter how far away you try to keep yourself from it"", taking that into consideration read this: people ho smoke weed at a young age NEVER WILL BE ABLE TO STOP, wantme to proove to you? you go to rehab yada yada, you stop doing weed for 10 years, buuuuut, one thing as i mentioned a few lines ago is ***you might be ablke to make your brain stop doing it, but it STILL WANTS IT***, its just human nature, nothing you can do about it, when people say reqiring your brain, you know what that means? changfing whats makes you!, porn is bad as mentioned above, but everything in moderation, and controlled with external forces can help, why suffer doing something as stupid as ***hard mode***, people have jobs, not everyone has the time to cry and go on reddit to keep reading shitty stories about ""superpowers"" , do you think a grown ass man ho was divorced, has a dead end 9 hour shift job has time to NOFAP? this is exactly what im trying to say, we by nature are addicits, to somethings, there by studying,drugs,exercise, what makes us diffrent, that we can ***moderate***, and control *Conclusion(TL:DR to all the lazy ones): we all struggle, I myself struggle, so dont come at me like Im typing as if I were some up with a grandiose complex, think of me as someone who doesnt have TIME, someone who cant just spend 2 years our more detoxing from porn while life goes around, let that sink in for a sec, really, please let all this sink in before you comment something like ""youre wrong and neap can make you feel better"" well now i really notice how much of a dick i sound, but still, i wish life could had punched me in a healthier way.
