I mainly see application security internships. Also I can't get certifications since college is demanding. I am majoring in computer science and the college I go to has no cybersecurity courses and a lot of common core classes. Any advice on getting a summer internship in this area?

2,vulnerability,cscareerquestions,"By pure luck, I managed to land a cloud engineer/devops role without much prior relevant experience. Almost 2 years in and looking for a new job.",1,iiag85,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iiag85/by_pure_luck_i_managed_to_land_a_cloud/,2020-08-29 02:37:43,"I'm 30 years old. For the first 8 years of my professional career I was a structural architectural engineer/construction project manager. I taught myself some MEAN, Linux, Bash, and AWS/Cloud Engineering and somehow managed to land a job at a smaller company to help build out their projects/products. I'll be honest, I think I only got this job because I showed drive and I was a previous project manager, I took a salary below what I was currently making to get this job. I've been at this job for almost 2 years now and I have no idea if I'm doing well, there is only like 2 people here I can compare myself to. I got hired along side 2 senior network (subcontractor) guys that were hired to manage the office IT and responsible to set up cloud environments for our contracts. Less then a year in, they decide to move on and I had to pick up the slack. My responsibilities throughout my time were basically set up app environments, maintain windows and linux servers, script installations, build ci/cd pipelines, automate configuration management via puppet/ansible, Securing AWS Infrastructure, implement/configure firewalls and WAFs, conduct and remediate vulnerability/compliance scans, setup/install splunk, setup dashboards and reports and review logs for security, conduct basic pen testing, api load balancing efforts, some code testing/sast, dockerize applications, manage container registeries, etc. I could rattle off a long list. I know I'm in a 'devops' role, but I haven't actually done real IaaC. I've done some basic cloud formation templates but and looked into terraform but the company quite at a state to do IaaC due to ever changing environment requirements and resources. My concern is that all I've done is seemingly basic and I'm not really specialized in one thing. I've had little to no senior advice when setting everything up. The CEO basically just tells me he wants X and I google until I can figure out the best way to integrate or create it. Since its a smaller company, I haven't experienced anything in real production yet, only UAT in large groups. So I feel like I've learned a lot in the past year but to be honest, the pace of structure of this company is kind of hectic and I have no idea how to judge my progress cause I lack people to compare to and sometimes I feel like I haven't done much at all. So with that being said, I thought looking for a devops/site reliability engineer/systems engineer sort of role at a larger more established company would be better for my growth. The question I keep wondering is, is my experience enough? It seems like several positions want production environment experience. I'm worried they'll ask a production design question and I'll have no idea how to answer it. Additionally, I wanted to ask about Resumes. As a recruiter, what would you want to see on my resume for someone like me who went through a career change? Should I try to narrow my experience description at my current company or is it better to include all responsibilities? Is it worth it use photoshop/illustrator to create a nice looking resume or should I just do plain black and white text?"

I really do. However, it really burns you out. I constantly feel like im on a goose chase, trying to learn another repo/framework/language every other sprint where I feel like Im not able to specialize in anything. I understand the surface of what I need to know to get something done (mediocrely and with trouble) and then move on to the next things. Im never able to dig deep into anything I learn Or do. I feel like Ill constantly be in this state where I just wont know deeper elements of the tools I use since it feels like every team I go to will have a separate way of doing things, different language choices, different frameworks. I feel like overall, im getting slightly better at being able to manage the transitions and context switches as I progress, but I feel stuck. Like Im not getting any deeper. What do I do? Here is an example situation: Sprint 1: Implement x in Go Sprint 2: Fix a vulnerability issue on a package inside a pom.xml file in a java repo by upgrading a package or framework Now, I may know java, but since I dont have a deep knowledge of build management, I struggle pretty hard with the story, almost going nowhere, since sometimes things like a spring boot/framework upgrade has so many trickling dependency conflicts, and it feels like Im always constantly running out of time, and somehow have to save face. I either do the very minimum or have to shamefully say I wasnt able to get this done I need help. I never get to the point where I feel comfortable ever solving a similar issue in the future since I never dig deeper into fully understanding many aspects of maven and etc. &lt;- that is the issue I fear. Anyone been through this? Am I alone?"
5,vulnerability,cscareerquestions,Security research: what's between finding website bugs and doing vulnerability research on kernels and system libraries?,1,gkh4dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gkh4dv/security_research_whats_between_finding_website/,2020-05-16 06:43:36,"I want to get into a career in information security. I've done some bug hunting on web apps (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection, etc.), but I don't think that I want to do that for work. Most bug bounty sites (HackerOne, Bugcrowd) emphasize finding these kinds of bugs since that's what their customers usually need. I'd like to start learning and doing more serious vulnerability research, like what I sometimes see on r/netsec. Fuzzing, reading source code, writing exploits, all that fun stuff. Putting CVEs on my resume seems to be the most effective way of getting a job in this particular subset of the industry. So my question is: what can I do to get my feet wet in ""serious"" vulnerability research? Every time that I've done it on my own, I've run into some kind of roadblock before long. This whole concept is somewhat strange for me because I don't get put into situations where there isn't necessarily an answer at all too often. In school, if I'm having trouble figuring something out, I still work on it, because I know that it's not unsolvable. Any thoughts?"

I currently work as an Information Security Engineer in a small team in a mid-sized cloud software company (\~1'000-1'500 heads) . I work on a lot of broad topics such as AD security, compliance, third-party security assessment, vulnerability management, logs management, endpoint security, etc. The job is fine overall although I wouldn't say I'm *passionate* about it. About me - I'm in my early thirties, passionate about a lot of topics including infosec but also devops and cloud (Kubernetes, Infrastructure-as-code, delivering software efficiently, microservices, AWS/Azure, service meshes...). It's always been hard for me to ""stick to a job"" where I can only work on a subset of these topics, and I've only done security professionally up to now, but I do spend a lot of my free time practicing and writing about ""devops and cloud"" topics. My company has several ""cloud devops engineers"" and is hiring one more - I want to get your feedback on whether I should apply internally. My idea would be to suggest a DevOps position *also* acting as a single point of contact for ""devops/product deployment"" security and bridging the gap between security and product (say, 70%-30%). My main fear is to close doors and to have a harder time applying to security-related positions in the future because it says ""DevOps"" and not ""security"" on my resume. On another side, companies in my country (Germany) are slowly starting to adopt public clouds, so it could be a plus in the 10 next years to have both infosec and cloud/devops professional experience. Some examples of topics/positions I would be extremely interested in (but that are not applicable to my company for now): Endpoint Security Research, Cloud Security Engineer, Threat Hunting, Incident Response... Thank you for your input!"

Due to corona virus I can't really just quit and find a new job (although I'm in the process of doing that). The past week however it as come to my attention of major security issues at my company. Mostly on the web services we offer but also our infrastructure and computer security. I did just 2 harmless tests. One being able to join a open guest wifi and send emails on behalf of anyone in the company with out any credentials (scan for mail server and send email via port 25). The guest wifi has a login system but it only blocks you from accessing the internet and not from seeing all other devices and servers in that network. The second vulnerability was sticking USBs into company laptops. I was able to run an attack from my phone to reboot company laptops. The rest of the vulnerabilities I did not execute for fear I might actually lose company data or damage our systems. Due to all this I have decided to take action. I sent an email to my boss (as well as the fake email I'm able to send) and demonstrated the two attacks I mentioned before. It seems my boss does not take any of this seriously. I then sent an email to the VP of the company explaining the issues we have and setting it up as ""I just thought you should know"". It seems no one in the IT department cares or that they just don't know how to fix it so they ignore it. What steps can I take to make clear the importance of these vulnerabilities?"

9,vulnerability,cscareerquestions,PhD student looking to go into malware analysis/threat research,1,fwvxuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fwvxuo/phd_student_looking_to_go_into_malware/,2020-04-08 10:12:56,"I'm a first year PhD student in the UK, doing research into vulnerabilities in Internet infrastructure (can't say anything more specific for anonymity reasons, sorry). I started learning how to do reverse engineering to study malware samples as a side project and I'm finding that really interesting. It's early days, but I'm enjoying the challenge and would love to do this as a full time job. I would also like to spend a lot more time reading up on and working with current/active threats than my PhD allows. The program is more focused on getting academic publications, which can take months to get reviewed and presented etc, so working with new threats isn't feasible - anything I find will be outdated by the time I can release it to a public audience, and academic venues don't usually take much interest in threat writeups. I have a few interviews lined up with companies in mainland Europe for entry-level security research roles (application vulnerability testing, pentesting, OS hardening, etc), so I could switch into industry at this point. I could also stay in the PhD and try to steer it towards working with (somewhat outdated) malware and threat intel. The people I work with in my research section are great and my advisor is an excellent mentor, but nobody has any experience in reverse engineering or cyber security so I'm learning from online guides and textbooks when it comes to tools like IDA Pro, WinDbg, etc. They're shit-hot at systems and networks though, so I get a lot of good info about those which might help in the long run. I guess I'm wondering if taking a gamble on dropping out of a PhD for a security role of unknown quality is worth it - I would potentially burn bridges with a lot of talented people who have helped me with a lot of opportunities and knowledge which might help with securing a malware/threat analyst role later on, but I might just be wasting 3 more years if I stay. I could also start earning actual money instead of scraping by on a PhD stipend and finally move to a new city. That said, if an offer for an entry-level malware or threat analyst role appeared for a location I'd like to move to/remote work, I'd grab it with both hands. But from what I understand most adverts require a fair bit of experience and/or self-study first, which I'm fine with doing - I'm wondering whether staying in the PhD or gambling on taking an industry job would be better to increase my chances of getting one of these roles in the future. tl;dr: is it better to drop out and move into industry or to continue the PhD if I want to become a malware analyst or threat researcher? Would staying in a PhD actively harm my job prospects for these roles later on? How much have I screwed up if I've burnt the bridges I have in systems research and the industry job I choose doesn't give me relevant experience?"

I have an opportunity to go back to school part-time with tuition assistance through my employer. I graduated a few years ago with my BS in CIS. Unfortunately my degree program was mostly business with a few programming and development cycle classes mixed in. I'd like to use this opportunity to pursue something in STEM to help me move more into an engineering role once I get into development. Something to help me get the math and algorithm background that most engineers and Computer Science graduates have. So, the question is should I pursue.. BS in Computer Science - this is the faster option, would probably take a year to complete. MS in Computer Science - this would take two years. Programs seem heavy on theory. MS in Data Analytics/Science - this would take two years. Programs seem heavy on math and programming. Or should i ignore this opportunity altogether and continue spending the time studying programming and computer science on my own.

I know that a lot penetration testing has to do with running numerous scripts to breach a network, and thats more in the realm of MIS, and I dont want to major in MIS; I want to write software. Im wanting to know if theres even a career for someone whos training to become a developer and still wants to test networks, or hosts, for vulnerabilities. In these days, is hacking just running scripts written by other people in the past to exploit a network? Will security companies even hire someone to write scripts (or programs) to exploit a vulnerability? Or, should I just look for a job developing normal software and box hacking as just a hobby. I appreciate any advice or suggestions!"

There are also updates and patches to the Android operating system. You cant count on Android to update itself in a timely manner, because wireless carries control update schedules on all but Googles Pixel devices. Expert testing of Android mobile applications shows that in most cases, insecure data storage is the most common security flaw in android apps. According to a report, Vulnerabilities and Threats are slightly more common in Android applications, compared to iOS counterparts(43% vs 38%). But the experts categorize this difference as minimal: the security level of apps is roughly equivalent between the two platforms. Comprehensive security checks of a mobile application include a search for vulnerabilities in the client and server, as well as data transmission between them. **There Are Two Aspects:-** ### Client-Side vulnerabilities &gt;***60%*** *of vulnerabilities are on the client side* ***89%*** *of vulnerabilities can be exploited without physical access* ***56%*** *of vulnerabilities can be exploited without administrator rights* Insecure interprocess communication(IPC) is a common critical vulnerability allowing an attacker to remotely access data processed in a vulnerable mobile application. Android provides Intent message objects as a way for application components to communicate with each other. If these messages are broadcasted, any sensitive data in them can be compromised by malware that has registered a BroadcastReceiver instance. For more details, you can use this Ref. link:- [URL"

She announced my pending resignation (2 weeks notice) to the company, and I could feel every set of eyes on me judgmentally. Not a single person clapped, congratulated me, or wished me good luck. Most people will not speak to me now, or they do so with a harsh tone. I had a SVP immediately question my loyalty, apparently he feels like I should be indebted to the company because they let me take FMLA leave. Not gonna lie, money was a factor, and they purposely have my job description written so that the ""above-market compensation"" for my role is undervalued -- I am considered a web administrator and not a software developer. HR tried to deny me several hundred dollars in benefits because she forgot to reactive some of my benefits after I came back from FMLA leave. I was told all of the benefits would be managed for me and she sure didn't need a reminder to turn them off the second I went on leave. Here's what is expected of me before I leave: homepage completely redesigned, while documenting everything the company doesn't know about the website (everything), leading content editor training sessions with multiple departments, redeploying all of our server environments, documenting the setup of a new server environment for an outsourcing firm, handling all tech support questions that come in from staff, conducting a usability study, helping the outsourcing vendor review all their requirements, fixing a difficult bug in our newsletter subscription management application, figuring out why our site search is broken, fixing a remote code execution vulnerability in our CMS because I caught our previous vendor lying about their billing and discovered that they were literally charging us thousands of dollars a month to do nothing.

Now that I am in my final 2 weeks, I am not allowed to take PTO and I believe that I will not be compensated for any of my extra hours because it was off the books. I am also not allowed to work from home anymore, even though I have a far better setup at home and am able to better focus at home. TL;DR: Employer is setting me up to fail in my final 2 weeks and trying to guilt-trip me into overworking myself for no compensation. Do I have any legal protection? I really want to try to explain my situation to my new employer and see if it's cool if I go to work tomorrow, drop off my laptop, and basically ragequit. I almost cried at work today, which is something I have never done before. I've worked my ass off for this company, put an end to a ton of vendor fraud and shady billing, and saved them stupid amounts of money on software they would typically outsource and none of that seems to matter.

I got my first job right out of college because I was referred to by my chair. Basically the company wanted someone graduate with experience in Info sec as they had a position open for someone at a entry level salary. I did alot of security stuff in college from research to competing I CTFs and had a good relationship with our chair that I was the first person he asked about this position. Well now I work in Vulnerability management and all the penetration testers are on my team so I work with them and learn more everyday. The problem is my coworkers are very..... aggressive. I don't hate them at all. In fact they are really cool people. But being in Info sec right out of college has made me kind of the baby of the department. I'm 25 and the next closest age on my team is my manager who is 40 and in the department is 33. So I kinda get picked on by my hacker coworkers. I usually fire back with something like ""don't make me go to HR"" And they'll usually pull out a golf club and say ""you got to make it to the car first"". They also call me a millennial, young and dumb (which I am young and don't know near as much as they do). They basically make me the bitch of the team and they even say it.

I'm just curious if anyone else has had this experience before? TLDR: Coworkers pick on me all the time but at the same time are great at teaching me things and actually care.

In addition, I have QoS software development experience with broad understanding of many security related concepts related to authentication, encrytion(IPsec/IKE/PKI) etc. In a nutshell, I understand the theoretical aspects of security with very small amount of experience in security software. I am now looking to make a switch to cybersecurity and need your advise on where to start. I tried to read up, but cybersecurity is such a broad field that I am still not clear. Why switch - I have always been interested in networking and security but did like writing systems software and didn't want to give it up early in my career. Now I strongly believe security is becoming more and more of an interdisciplinary area, very soon security engineers will also have to learn DevOps skills(and vice versa), so I will not have to give up software(I can pursue it on the side as well.) Switch to what - I am looking for a security solution architect role and advise on how to get there and in how many years. I do not want to be on the incident response team(while I am keen on identifying and fixing a breach, but on-call 24/7 is not for me. Neither is more than 20% travel.) My interests are more towards designing a security solution and integrating it with SDN/network management software to automate when possible after due analysis of data. I am interested in vulnerability and penetration testing of network and software, but not an IT operations role where I would just need to run pre-existing tools and report results. Is such a role possible or am I just cherry picking job functions? Is moving to writing security software my best bet? "

I'm 23 years old living in Germany and I am currently enrolled in two Master's degree programs, one is about IT Security, the other about IT Management. I am going to finish my first Master in a couple of months and the second one next year early June. Furthermore, I am employed part-time since 2015 as a researcher at my university and my research interest mainly centers around InfoSec. However, most of the time I am working at a major company in the high security area as a contractor (as part of my commitment with the university). In my job I am currently doing Java development. Now my contract with the university expires in a few months and I am trying to find a job, but I am not sure which area to pick. My strategy has always been (and will always be) decide + refine but I still want input from you guys. My primary goal is to get into a PhD program in Europe. I started my search for an academic advisor just recently so I am fairly new to the game. However, since I am coming from a no-name university, my experience is that this might be quite a challenge. Consequently, I am expecting to be without a job before I will get into a PhD program. Even if I will get into a PhD program in time, theres absolutely no guarantee that I will find employment at that university. It is also worth mentioning that becoming a teacher is not my ultimate goal, maybe sometime in the future part-time, but instead I love to research, write papers and I am aiming to get specialized knowledge in my field. Therefore, I think in my situation a PhD would still make sense (and I am willing to make this investment), but is not essential to my future career. Unfortunately, I currently do not have neither a research concept nor a topic, but I want to go into the direction of software engineering, if possible with a security focus. Okay, enough background story. I am now actively looking for a job in either the InfoSec area or as a software developer. The good thing is that I do have some job experience with Java. However, if I decide to go into the direction of software development, I want to apply for a junior Scala position. I have worked with Scala (on private projects) only for almost a year and my transition from Java to Scala is still in progress. Furthermore, I would probably have to move to another city to get a Scala job, meaning that I have to stop (temporarily) my study for my second Master. If I would instead go into the direction of InfoSec, I would miss software development, even though I really enjoy doing penetration testing, vulnerability research etc. Now to my questions: * Would I be considered a good candidate for an InfoSec position, if I spent X years in a software development job with Scala? * What are my chances of getting a Scala job if I spent the next X years in an InfoSec position maybe even without writing a single line of production code? * Should I be worried about the fact that I have apparently no idea which direction to go at my age? Thank you for taking the time to read my story."

I took courses in Software engineering but... all I did was write documentation and producing code on that (is that what it is?). I also hope this post can last less than a day for... *reasons*. So let's get to the main topic. My courses this semester are: * Distributed Systems * Penetration Testing &amp; Vulnerability Analysis * Network Security * Data Science * Software Engineering II These are all **grad level** courses (except S.E. II) with grad students but I am still an undergrad. I think it is a very broad collection. There's also one more but that's pretty much a given (DB). My specialty is on Distributed Systems and the rest are 'add-ons' to help solidify Distributed Systems somehow (in fault model or performance evaluation). There is the Performance Evaluation course but that is... *untouchable* (alternating+Grad Only). ASAIK for Data Science, the math is intense and there is basically a whole degree in that (Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Big Data). As such a master's is required to delve deeper and to actually land a job in the field but I'd rather not touch Masters. Not that math-savvy. Embedded requires circuit II and I don't have that. Sounds software-engineery though. P.S. I didn't list A.I. because I heard it is too broad and basically an intro to the real A.I.'s like ML. I think Information Visualization is part of the branch but that's like... making graphs. I know Performance Evaluation uses stats but at a lesser level than Data Science and more geared towards systems. Should I just snipe Performance Evaluation and let go Data Science?

Little on the back ground Location is Canada, I work in a small company, mostly creating website using CMS. I am the only developer, who creates codes or creates architecture, and modify plugins or core of CMS to get everything working. The company has few other developers, but most of what they do utilizing plugins or modules and adding client side code mostly JS to adjust the design. The boss is not a developer, and she claims she understands developer world, but in my humble opinion... no... not even remotely close. Let's say, I am the only one who understands pointers or primary key in database in entire company, other employees may have heard it, but they have no clue to how to use it or what it really is. The Problem: In summary, I feel like if this company is factory, we have majority of the employees on sales and marketing, and some on decoration of the product, and only I seem to be building the actual product and I have to guarantee the product. It is a lot of responsibility and burden and they are asking me to guarantee it more and give more accurate timeline that is in their budget. The previous developer who left, and I have replaced, did not code properly, his relational data base did not even have any keys, his codes had no documentation and no OOP, security was vulnerable. I have joined this company and started to fix everything, but they are demanding me to do proper coding, and documentation, but they are not giving me more time. They say they will, but then they come back and say that I need to work faster, and currently I am juggling about 4 projects at once and one of them is a really big project, I would need to use node js, python for server end and C++ for threading, it is a really big project, I think you would need whole team to build this. However, the company is looking into hiring a sophomore intern to help me at best, and I think i'll spend most of time teaching him, and he seems to be connection to the boss, like family friend's son. Process : I am usually not in any of the meetings in early stage of project, the company says that I have a say on decisions and project, but not a single thing have gone to the direction that I wanted. they'd hear what i say and sort of dismiss it saying it's not how the process work or developers don't have same understanding when creating the design of the project. I see too many flaws in our current process and system. The company creates UI without diving into technology that we can use to fulfill the required features, then we look into technology and revise the UI. I dont think its efficient usage of clients budget and time. There is no internal meetings on how project should be executed, UI was created on the spot during the meeting with client on boss lone decision which everyone seems to just agree with it. If I address any of the issue company has whether it be process or system structure, they call me negative. Cultural: I am not an optimist, but I believe that I am realist. I seem to have this label of negative person, since I am the ONLY one who speaks against a lot of the direction, because at the end of day, I am the one who pays highest price for it, because I have to guarantee the product, in their given budget. I am the only developer and no one speaks for me, I see a lot of inefficiency, and system vulnerability. I have addressed it before, and manager just told me, If you dont present a solution with a problem, you are just being negative. However, I do not see an easy solution to this, but if I dont tell anyone of it it will grow to be a bigger problem and I have to guarantee the product, at the end of day. The company strongly emphasize on staying positive, so much that it feels like north korea, where everyone smiles in front of the glorious leader. I do not see much to be positive about work environment. We do not have flexible hours. If I work on weekend for 20 hours, and missed a 7 to 4 weekday hours, I do not get paid for that day, regardless of the extra hours I put into. There is a lot of overtime, and my boss indirectly pressure me to go on overtime by asking for exact deadline, without knowing all the variables and if I give a large number, then the boss asks for reasons for long timeline and I do not even know the variables that plays into the project. We sign contract where ALL of our intellectual property becomes companys. This has discouraged me to do any side projects. I even had to ask if the novel I am writing can remain as my property. I feel like there is too much burden on my shoulder, but the company is telling me that I need to be more effective and less negative. I think they just want me to work like a slave and smile about it, because they want to be morally correct and abuse developer as well. How bad is this working environment? Is there any solution, other than getting a new job? Is my complain reasonable or are they correct with me being ineffective and negative? I get paid around 50k CAD for my job, is this right payment for my job? If not what should it be at? (I maintain the server, use mostly PHP based CMS for most projects, and some node js and python based projects) Is this common in the Canadian work space for developers? (I doubt it, but just in case) Are there any rights that could help me? What do you think will happen to this company, with current kind of structure, and developers almost dont have any representation and developers quitting regularly and the website core is a complete mess, mostly appending poor coding created by previous developers, because of his lack of time. (for instance 80% of data was stored on a single table for a website, it needs to be built again ground up, which isnt a solution but negative attitude). Thank you for your patience. "

I'm leaning towards the first mainly because it seems ""good enough"" and is the most convenient for me but I want to know if I might be shooting myself in the foot.

I'm not sure what to search for though and even at that I can't find any jobs related to what I want to accomplish in the future. I have a few questions: * What job or internship should I look for that sets me in this path for the future? * Above, where can I find these specific jobs if I'm qualified to get them? * Is this a hard field to get into in general or am I way too underqualified to consider it? Do I need a Masters before thinking of going into it? If I'm being confusing or if you want more info don't hesitate to ask."

I also like circuitry and hands-on engineering. I have experience in all these things and biomedical robotics also interests me a LOT (I would need ECE or CE program probably for this since I don't want to apply to a major like BME or EE because they have very limited career opportunities) however that's the only thing I don't have experience in. In CS I'm not really interested in how programming languages work and the computational math behind it but in CE I'm not interested in building computers either. I'm scared that if I do CS I'll just be stuck coding which I can do but I don't think I would enjoy only that. In CE I'm scared I will get stuck in too much of the building hardware side and not get to explore my Machine Learning and AI interests. I have some schools I want to apply to rn like UMD, Georgia Tech, Cornell, some other ivies but I'm still looking for schools which is hard because I'm not fully sure about the major.

But some areas are clearly more meritocratic than others. For example, Machine Learning Research usually requires a Phd, but I would imagine Fortune 500 companies and the NSA would be fine hiring the best cybersecurity experts independent of their educational background and almost entirely on their skills and experience outside of university. Similarly, I think web development could be much more project-based, whereas Fintech would be nearly impossible without a degree. My question is, if you did not want to go the traditional route of university, could you get into any area in software development simply by your skills and merit - or is this a fallacy.

I work contract to contract and had had some trouble finding work with the downsizes due to the pandemic. I talked to my boss about expanding my skillset to help me get back to work and we came up with some possibilities, but I had a hard time finding what the day to day work in these fields was like from my brief googling. I'm not worried about making the most money in the field, just trying to find something engaging enough to not want to die on the day to day. Automated testing (Largely with something like Selenium) was one option, and probably the one that would get me back to work the most quickly. It's closest to my current skillset and definitely the path of least resistance, but I was worried that I wouldn't really be challenging myself and might get bored with the day to day. The idea of a career as a data analyst or other fields related to data management came up, and this is what I'd hoped to glean the most information from here because I don't really know what the day to day of this job involves at all. I assume there's a lot of review and trend identification, but I definitely know very little about the tools of the field and the goals involved with specific positions. Cybersecurity came up and I know it's a sought after position that tends to receive good compensations, but it also seems to have very little overlap with my current skillsets and just seems, well, daunting. Daunting and stressful and involving a great deal of trying to convince people of what they ought to be doing for their own good. I'd love to hear that I'm wrong about this, but I'll admit to leaning against it for the time being. Apologies if this doesn't fit it's own thread or belongs in a daily post, I read through the rules and related subreddits and thought that this would be the place to ask.

But now that I am little bit older I see that perhaps I was the true fool. When I have a job I can't control my workoholism and feel like I am wasting my life away for nothing, working long hours and weekends. Seeing my parents and myself grow older while the time is flying by and all I do is work and have no time for them. I realized I don't desire a management position or money.

Now I work 40 hours minimum and it occupies my mind for the rest of the day. * No deadlines * Working on cybersecurity, cryptography, programming or whatever I want and they need I am considering accepting the offer, but I feel like I am taking the easy, lazy way. I feel that I am supposed to help society by working hard and dilligently and instead I am choosing my own comfort. I wouldn't normally disclose this, but recently I went to get tested by mensa and scored 100% (the test measures only IQ up to 150). Isn't it moral imperative for people like me, who were given a gift, to sacrifice themselves and their needs for others, for the betterment of mankind?

Unfortunately I didn't manage to get an internship while at school, so I had a lot of trouble finding a job, and currently work in a glorified customer service position in a call center. I don't know whether or not I enjoy cybersecurity or even IT as I have no experience in it. I do know that I enjoy programming. Before going with a cybersecurity major, I was a computer science major, and switched because the math requirement was getting too much for me. Since graduating, I've tried self-teaching myself coding, which hasn't worked out for me, as without the structured direction of the classroom setting I feel lost with coding. To my understanding, I do have the option of getting certs (CCNA is the one I was looking at) and hopefully get into an IT position that will put me through programming training. My other option is to go back to school, and hopefully get an internship this go-around. The problem I'm facing with that option is that since this would be a second bachelor's, I will not have access to any grants, and my only option is to get more student loans. My work does provide tuition reimbursement, but I still haven't fully figured out how that works or whether it would work for a second bachelor's. I don't know if I want to lean on that option too much though, as my current job has landed me with some heavy anxiety and has fired back up my depression, likely due to it not being what I went to school for and is not giving me good IT experience for the future. Due to this I've been trying hard to find a different job, which means I wouldn't benefit from that tuition reimbursement. Overall, I'm not sure if I'd even enjoy IT or cybersecurity because my education didn't really prepare me for any real world application. Ultimately I'd like to be a coder, working for either federal where I can work on video game projects on the side, or working for a game company."

Whether it is getting my hands dirty and code, or just general IT. The job description seems pretty dense, consisting of that I will be developing and supporting DoD systems like linux, windows etc. Configure networks and servers, design and maintain application/machine virtualization and of course, general IT matters as well. This internship isn't a summer internship but rather a job, and that if I do well, they can extend a full time job after I graduate. This is a win win situation! For me, this is my first tech internship. I am pretty excited even if it may be surface level IT work. But I being a MIS major, and minoring in CS. Eventually, I would like to land a job that is a CS traditional job. Such as like CyberSecurity and or a programmer. I want to break the barrier for MIS grad of staying IT level and be so much more. To get to the point, I am seeking advice from people who may work in IT or have started in IT then landed something greater. Since this will be my first internship, will it hold me strictly to IT work? Can I still land a job in a different tech sector like mentioned before with just this on my resume? Should I still work on side projects? Is networking the most important here? Should I pursue a 2nd internship in the future? Is my CS minor going to assist me greatly for jobs? I know this is a lot of questions, I don't have much guidance with school or career paths, it would be great if you can tell me whatever you like! Thanks in advance!! &amp;#x200B; Side note, I know you may be thinking ""Why didn't you major in CS then"", and to counter that, during my first two years of college, I was switching majors quite often. I was inspired by my professor who was successful as a MIS grad. His stories of working in the tech field helped me find what I wanted to do. So I decided to major in MIS. Never got a chance to take a CS class :/ and also, It was too late to really switch to CS for which I would be in school for a really long time lol. But the minor isn't requiring too many classes so I decided to add it and finish school on time."

Lastly, for clarification, I understand that cybersecurity is a huge umbrella. I've considered specializing in threat intel, like network traffic analysis, malware analysis, or a different branch like auditing/compliance, but now I feel entirely disillusioned with this whole industry. &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR**: I recently got Security+ but have long been wondering whether going into the infosec industry is a good fit for me for two main reasons: (1) I suck at technology and am partly disinterested in learning new technology; and (2) concern about the constant learning/self-study in this industry.

I know the field heavily relies on certifications however I thought having academic knowledge could be beneficial and help me stand out when combined with certifications initially. Then I learned my school has a data science masters degree in which there is a data security concentration. The computer science program at my school is very flexible so now I am thinking about adapting that general structure to my CS degree such that I would have knowledge in both fields to do work that combines data science and ML with security. Essentially it would be a ""MS in Computer Science with a focus in Cybersecurity Data Science"" or a ""MS in Computer Science with a focus in Data Science/ML for Cybersecurity"". &amp;#x200B; Would doing this be too narrow of a scope for a CS masters degree?

I've been giving much thought as to what I want to pursue in college and what career path I want to go down upon. I've thought that IT would be the sector for me these last few years as I've been involved in it for a very long time and I am in a specialized cybersecurity program at my school. However when I look at the people on my team, I am the least qualified by far. Though I am better off that most others in my pathway at my school, I don't see myself creating side projects, working on coding away from school, etc etc. To start such things seems like such a chore. I have learned coding and done my own stuff outside of school, but I haven't done anything too major and I don't find myself waking up in the morning and saying ""Let's code today"". I simply don't see myself coding the rest of my life. I do enjoy it and computers, and cybersecurity and such but I want my work to be play. Since March I decided to take up the stock market and see if I can make any money there (I've made money in various entrepreneurial efforts and wanted to try something new). I've found the markets fascinating and economics just APPEAL to me. I've literally binged economics videos and am engrossed in the markets and business on a daily basis. Business has always been my thing since the beginning, and I guess that is why finance, markets, economics appeals to me so much. I began to delve into career paths in Finance and what a Finance degree can land you. I was disheartened to see many people actually say it's very very hard to get a nice high paying financial job, and some people with financial degrees end up car salesmen, or grocery store managers. My goal is to land a pretty good entry job and end up making six figures easily several years after college. The good jobs like Investment Banking required 60-90 hours a week all throughout your 20s, for the same salary a software engineer could get for half the hours. I want to get married in my 20s and live life to the fullest with financial freedom instead of slaving long hours. Investment Banking is also very very hard to get into, most people get in because they go to an Ivy or they have a good network. It's a pretty replaceable job as long as you put in hours. I'm sure with my entrepreneurial spirit I will start a business somewhere down the line, but obviously that easily could fail and I need a job in the first place for some sort of capital or experience. I began to wonder if I should go into software engineering/cybersecurity and start trading on the markets on the side, and maybe somewhere down the line I could start a financial consulting company or something of the likes. What are your guy's opinions, and could anyone with a finance degree let me know how the sector is like? (Good high paying jobs with good work/life, etc etc). TLDR: I need ideas as to whether to pursue a career in finance/business or IT, and what careers I could potentially look at. Very interested in finance, but jobs aren't looking as promising due to competition, short hours, and lower pay as what the future of IT offers."

I've done a lot of research on both fields and I'm still not sure which is right for me. I understand both fields are very large and diverse but I was hoping to get some advice on choosing between the two. &amp;#x200B; The reasons cybersecurity is interesting to me is because it seems like a very practical, hands on and exciting field. Every day seems to be something new and there's a progression in the cat-and-mouse kind of game between the attackers and defenders. It seems like a very fast paced industry which is something I love as well as the flexibility to change roles and try things out while staying within the security domain. Additionally, I like the idea of essentially being able to have a direct impact on users on a nearly daily basis. The reasons data science is interesting to me is because I like to work with data and make it work for me and whom ever needs it. The flexibility of data science and machine learning is also very appealing, the fact that these concepts and practices can be used in so many different fields, like security. Additionally, I want to make sure I'm not just riding the hype but rather actually suited and will enjoy the field. From my undergrad I believe I have the base math chops required to start and do enjoy stats and the insights it can bring. I think MLE roles sounds interesting to me since it is developer-like but pure data science/analysis positions sound interesting too. All in all, I think I have a little more passion for cybersecurity than data science but they're pretty close for me. However, I have considered the fact that data science and machine learning seem to be seeping into cybersecurity (as well as pretty much everything else) and that it may be beneficial to me to study data science academically while learning cybersecurity through certifications even if I am going into a cybersecurity-related role, is this something I should consider?. Irrationally (I think/hope), part of me worries that if I don't include some type of machine learning into my studies that I will lag behind the security industry or even the software development industry as well. Additionally, I would like to have a path to more senior/managerial roles as well, I'm not sure if that would impact anything either.

My dilemma is which route I should take to enter into this field. AppSec Eng is probably the field I find most interesting in the realm of security, mostly because it encompasses a development aspect to it. That being said, I would also consider a development position with a focus in security. However, as I look for internships, it seems that the popular title for most cs students is SWE. It is also possible to take up an internship in Cybersecurity but those seem to focus more on SOC/Help Desk/Networking related stuff without touching much on development. I can't seem to find which side I should initially prioritize, development or security? En route to becoming an AppSec engineer, would it be better to start off in a software engineering position then transition into AppSec OR start off in cybersecurity then Appsec? Lastly, how would one differentiate an application security engineer vs. a software security engineer? Are they the same thing? I've seen job listings use the terms interchangeably."

What I HAVE always had a passion for is computer forensics, cybersecurity/crime, anything along those lines, especially with the dream of working for a government agency. My school doesn't offer a degree in computer security, forensics, etc. and I cannot minor in IT with my CS major. However, I am enrolled in ""Certification in Computer Security"" but that doesn't really include any classes that'll help in terms of education in that department. Additionally, I went to tech school prior to college for computer networking, security, and repair. &amp;#x200B; So my question is, did I mess up by pursuing CS? I'm already past the point of a major change, but I'm still considering adding on a criminal justice minor, mainly because I believe I'd enjoy those classes but also because I think it'd help towards my future goals. Should I look into one of those ""Cyber Security Certification"" programs after I graduate, or is my CS degree helpful enough to get my foot in the door, at the very least?

I've most recently assumed cybersecurity responsibilities (I work for a small company). My two options that I have narrowed it down to are as follows: 1.) UPenn's MCIT, to seek formal CS education on topics that I have read about and not dug too deeply into to, can lead to an executive software engineering masters if my career progresses that direction. Like others have mentioned, MCIT is like a CS associates + with some masters courses. 2.) UT Dallas's Executive Masters in Systems Engineering/Management, where I can concentrate on Database systems and information assurance. More quantitatively focused than the MCIT, and can add more cybersecurity courses too. My outcome would be to become a VP of analytics, VP of data engineering, VP of research... or if I decide to quit the management path, I could become a cybersecurity or data engineer (those are the two avenues I currently live in most of the time).

Ive been at my company for 2+ years, I feel like now is a good time to start learning new skills and make a goal of another career path. Im unsure if I want to get into front or back-end development, majority of my programming work in school was C++ and I didnt really care for it. Really the only classes that I really liked was my SQL / database design classes and cybersecurity. A dev position seems more accessible, less cert requirements and more profile building which I like. Im pretty lost on where to look. Sorry for the rant, Im just overwhelmed."

I'm doing things at home like learning pentesting, Python, AWS, DevOps, CI/CD, Github and anything else I can, but that still isn't professional experience.

I know this question has been asked many times, and I did my research, but I would love to get some advice and opinions from you guys on different cs path that I could follow, bonus points if it's your personal experience with them :) Right now I am a placement student (I will finish my cs degree next year), working at a Top 5 cybersecurity company in the UK (my placement contract would end this summer). I am doing enterprise network security, mostly maintaining the existing products and implementing some new small features here and there. (something that I would not want to continue with in the future..). I have experience with multiple programming languages, operating systems, software development methodologies (basically can pick up anything, this is something I learned at this job). I have some experience with Android development (I want to launch 2 apps as side projects), and now I am working on doing my final year project in machine learning. I am really unsure what I want to do in the future, I enjoy this field of cs, but not really loving something over other stuff, working with new technologies is when I am motivated the most to learn, and after some times the ""hype"" falls off. I would really love to get some insights of how the work is in the different fields that I would mention underneath, and what does it take to be successful in those specific branches of cs, a pros/cons list would be exceptional. **Career path options here:** 1. **Android Developer.** (I have experience with Java/Kotlin, and have developed small android apps). 2. **Machine Learning**. (I started to learn python, ML models, and I am working on doing my final year project in machine learning). I also should state that I have a week maths background. Any advice on that? 3. **Cyber-security.** (Something different that my actual work right now, I would like to go into pentesting just because it looks interesting, have no prior knowledge on this) 4. **Software engineer.** (This is basically my title right now, but I hate it has I was expecting more development to be done, I basically wrote 1000 lines of code in almost 1 year). These are the paths I have considered. Please let me know your thoughts and experiences :)."

This made me study CS in uni. I didn't code much in uni as it was general CS. But now that I'm done, I want to fully dive into programming, but I feel discouraged. I don't have that flare anymore. Maybe because it's been years since I last assembled something with scripts, and I'm more recently focused on building from scratch, and it takes longer. When young, it was this new, rare thing, but now it seems like everyone is learning to code, and it feels less special. Everything just feels saturated. I've manage to pick the language I want from all the saturated languages and frameworks, but still. The entire field of web and app development seems like I'll be a droplet in an ocean. Cybersecurity and data science don't really call out to me like development. I'd only be interested in making my apps secure, and maybe developing security apps. It's pure development I'm interested in. I don't know maybe it's all in my head. Anyone else ever feel like the development field is too saturated?"

For instance, I switched out of Biology because I originally wanted to be a PA(Physician's Assistant), but I did poorly in Precalc so I realized I knocked myself out of getting into any PA program. I switched out of Psychology because the ROI is horrible with the only way for me to even find a decent job is to get a master's degree. And now I'm starting to have second thoughts with Computer Science because I don't have a foundation in the subject. Most people I know who are studying this have taken Comp Sci courses back in high school and have done hackathons and have a bunch of experience working in the field.

Some IT certs, A+ and Network+, but mostly got where I am today through knowing the right people, being in the right place at the right time, and working my butt off. Current situation: Mid 30s, work as what I guess you would call an application support engineer (Atlassian stack mainly), along with some cloud and infrastructure stuff. In other words, I admin a Jira instance as well as the AWS stuff that it lives on. I make just over $150k. Where I want to go: I'd like to continue to grow my career. The Atlassian stuff is currently my specialty, and I am working on the best way to leverage that without pigeonholing my career. Right now I report to the 'Directory of Cloud and IT'. That's the kind of position I would like to have in the next 5 years or so, not still just a really overpaid Jira admin. At my current company we are growing and should be hiring some other application support engineers onto a team that I would theoretically lead, so that will help. My main concern is that B.A. in Video Game Design is going to hold me back eventually. Before I kind of landed in/settled on this Atlassian stuff I was, like many tech-minded people who need a job, trying to do the self-taught developer thing. I audited some classes from my Alma Mater combined with some stuff on Coursera, etc. I think for the trajectory I want my career to go to will benefit from having a postgraduate degree, especially now that I make enough that I can pay for it out of pocket. So I have two kind of rough plans I am considering: 1 - Get a B.S. in Computer Science (online) from WGU. For those of you that are unfamiliar, they have a kind of competency-based program. Talking to the enrollment advisor there it seems reasonable that with my transfer credits and pre-existing knowledge I could complete the program in a year. This would be entirely as a stepping stone to then go get my M.S.. in Comp Sci from somewhere since pretty much all of those programs require a B.S. in Comp Sci, or closely related degree. After that I might then also go get an MBA at some point, possibly also from WGU (they have an IT Management focused MBA program). 2 - Skip the B.S. altogether and go into one of WGU's IT Masters programs. Their M.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance sounds very interesting. Then again followed by an MBA somewhere. Option 1 seems like the safer path, as developers always have pretty solid job security, especially with a Masters, so I could always have that to fall back on. Option 2 is quicker and cheaper and might make more sense given that, while I do do some scripting and some light-ish Java development around Jira Add-Ons and things, my planned career trajectory probably doesn't include me ever working as a dedicated software engineer. One the DevOps scale, I am definitely more on the Ops end of things. Either way I plan to continue to do hobbyist development stuff to keep my GitHub relatively interesting, and looking into going down the AWS certification route next. Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated."

I worked in 3 Fortune 500 Companies, In each company I did a fair amount of Interviewing candidates for Jr and Associate roles due to my background in Sales and Teaching and HR liked to get my feedback before hiring. I'd like to give some advice and guidance on some of the recently graduated and recently certified, or recently laid off and are looking for a new direction/career. **IMO :** You should always decide on a career only if you have the motivation to do it day in and day out. Have a genuine **Interest in Computers, Be Curious how Technology Works, Desire to learn New Technology (like Cloud/AI), Know Data/Storage, Understand Digital Communication.** All of these qualities gives meaning and a purpose for you to work and study, and it will make all of the difference in your overall happiness and well being on the job as you work in Tech. That being said, here is my recommendation on getting the job and skills tech folk look for in hiring you : *-You must possess Knowledge of* ***How Computers work and How to fix Basic Problems***\*, Knowledge of\* ***How a Business Works (High Level)****, and* ***Why IT is needed to support a Business***\*.\* *-A good candidate should be Skilled in* ***Troubleshooting, Deductive and Investigating Thinking, Typing/Navigating an OS, Writing and Presenting Information, Programming (nice to have), Imagination (often times you cannot see abstract technology), and Physical Handling of Equipment and Tools***\*.\* *-Finally, and* *most importantly,* *the ability to* ***communicate, gather information from ambiguity, stay calm in stress, and find creative effective solutions to technical problems.*** *Emphasis on this because these skills will be invaluable both in presenting yourself on an interview and in day-to-day work.* This communication includes your Resume, remember to read the role, format your resume to highly the preferred qualities as succinctly as possible. If you are at a Networking Event or meetup, this can also translate to how you present yourself to a headhunter or a professional. To interview with us (the tech folk) you will unfortunately need to make it past HR and the software they use to rank resumes. Once you do that, if you can highlight the characteristics mentioned above, you should easily get the job! Let me know if you have any Questions, Happy to answer!"

I'm a computer science student in India in my second year. I still have 2 more years of college left. I'm well aware of the worth of this kind of time, where I get to experiment with what I like and don't like and learn languages and frameworks that add value to my resume before I leave college. So, naturally, I'm constantly ping ponging here and there trying to see what interesting things the degree has to offer and so far, I've found a lot of fun stuff to do. Here are the ones I found most intriguing. 1. **CyberSec:** I thoroughly enjoy learning about Cybersecurity, and solving HackTheBox challenges and whatnot. It's still an incredibly difficult and time consuming process, but I am very much willing to work on it. I am however, well aware of it's lackluster career options. 2. **Software Engineering:** This is what I primarily am expected to choose as my career option by my college, and it is much more easier than CyberSec for me to learn, but it gets quite tedious since I am really bad at my problem solving skills. I can't code for very long since I get very burnt out, even if the problem I'm solving is interesting. 3. **Android Programming:** Like everyone else, I would also like to make apps. This is also very interesting for me and I love tinkering around in Android Studio trying to figure out Fragments, Buttons, Activities and all that. While I do want to make apps, I often don't learn much because I get burnt out trying to understand it. I'm still at the base beginner stage here. 4. **Web Design:** This one is interesting to me because I know a bit of designing and have worked in Photoshop and Illustrator a lot. However, I have basically ZERO idea currently of how to develop a website from scratch with CSS or whatever. This is probably the thing I'm least interested in because I haven't had the chance to explore it yet. To sum it all up, I have these 4 domains that all interest me, and that I want to explore, but I'm not able to narrow down enough any further. I don't have any real projects I worked on, so I need to start working on projects and stuff too, which further leads into the confusion. So, I need help figuring out which of the options make the most sense to just stick to and become really good at, rather than try and jump between everything and ultimately learn nothing. Am I even approaching this the right way? What should I do? Cheers!"

My goal is to get a masters in the end, and in both schools, I would be able to do the 4 + 1 masters program. The thing with sbu is that they only offer a masters in cs and I have been reading through many posts/articles, including advice from my parents, that a masters in cs would be really redundant unless I do it in data science, machine learning, or cybersecurity (whichever I am interested). Stony brook does not offer a masters in these topics (just in CS) nor provides a specialization, while in UMD, there are those options and plenty of opportunities to specialize in my undergrad years so I can really find what I am interested in. As a result, with SBU, I would have to apply for masters elsewhere and I could potentially do it at a top-level university for CS. The negative with this is that I would have to do two years for masters instead of one. My guess would be around 60-70K total for the two years, while UMD would be 30K for one year.

What are the pros/cons of being a math major? I'm current a CC student setting up my application for transfer to my local state university. I'm choosing between Computer Science and Mathematics. The former because it's what I've always been interested in (and job prospects ofc) and the latter to gain a deeper/raw knowledge of the mathematics that I might be working with in the future as a computer scientist. I want to work within the field of computer science and have been eyeing cybersecurity (reverse engineering, exploit dev). I'm not sure if I have the ability to go to graduate school (work ethic issues) but the path I've been eyeing is *heavily involved* in research so I might as well try. I don't intend to work as a web/app developer or data scientist. A friend told me math majors tend to do a bit better in academia/research settings (given that they have basic programming knowledge) because of their maturity with mathematics as opposed to CS undergrads. As I've been looking more into CS research (and especially RE research), there is a huge emphasis on mathematics and it got me pretty spooked as a lot of the maths are not covered in a CS undergrad curriculum. Even though I've thoroughly enjoyed my math courses at CC, I'm not too sure if that will transfer over to the rigor of a 4 year university. My ego might be inflated from the easier math classes i've taken at CC but it's something I'm currently interested in. I'm considering if prioritizing mathematics would be more beneficial to me with the programming background I currently have. I have an alright resume built from HS till now that got me some webdev internships interviews this year, but it isn't what I want in the long run."

I am a Computer Engineering student in an Italian bachelor, I am in my second year, which means that by July/September 2021 I should get my degree. In order to get it, I need to do an internship during my third year and I was recently offered one. I already took part in two interviews and in the next weeks, I must decide which kind of project to take part in. The three areas I was offered are Mobile Development (iOS/Android, which I have already rejected), backend (Java) and frontend (Angular). Currently, in my studies, I already learned C, MatLab, and Python and I am learning MIPS, SQL, HTML, CSS, and PHP; I will tackle Java next year. I am not sure which field I should choose, here are my considerations: \- I would like to learn about a field that I am not familiar with (for my Master's I am considering either Data Science or Cybersecurity, but I am still not sure) and to learn skills that could be useful in my career. \- I am not considering an internship in Data Science or cybersecurity because I do not have the skills necessary for those fields since I will do that only during my Master's, whereas I have already developed some skills that could be useful for the internship I was offered. Besides, my internships must be about something that I already cover in some form in my university. \- My main doubt is that I am not sure what would be more convenient: \- either do a backend with java while I am learning that language at college (maybe if I manage, I could even try and learn some java during summer) and directly apply what I learn in class; \- or frontend with Angular, which would mean that I learn a skill that I normally wouldn't during my studies. I would like to hear your recommendation and what you would do if you were in my shoes. Thank you in advance!"

Ive also received an offer to be a cybersecurity consulting intern for next summer at one of the Big 4 in consulting, and I need to give them a response back by early September. Ive never had any experience in consulting and Im open to this internship, but at the same time, Ive never interviewed for FAANG for a SWE/security role and accepting this offer would mean that Id be unable to interview at other companies. I was worried that if I take the cybersecurity consulting role for next summer (my junior yr) that it would be harder for me to get a SWE role at a big company my senior yr. Also, if I decline this offer would it be hard for me to apply for the same role at this company in the future? What do you guys suggest?"

Before that, I was a software engineer for 2 as well as a software eng intern, all at the same company. Just about to turn 25. I'm thinking of quitting my current role in order to earn my OSCP and perhaps start looking into a master's in cybersecurity at GA Tech. I'd like some extra dedicated time to better understanding this industry and pursuing the technical topics I most enjoy (reverse engineering, Linux security). While I do enjoy this field, I haven't been given as much opportunity to learn on the job as I'd hoped (many days are really just writing up policy documents, responding to Slack queries, or doing on-call work- only the occasional pentest or code/design review, and it's mostly web apps at that), management is becoming more and more disorganized after several high-profile departures, coworkers are becoming complacent and knowledge siloed, the old company culture is eroding away, and I just feel completely lost. This experience really wasn't what I was hoping for when I transitioned to this team, and I feel like I'm just missing way too many fundamentals to be as effective as I could be to be able to thrive elsewhere. I've been turned down for other training opportunities that would've otherwise been on the company dime; my manager thinks they're either not relevant or that I should be doing these things completely on my own time. I've done plenty of the latter, but with chronic pain and mental issues as of late, it's become more and more difficult to do so on a regular basis. I am extremely lucky in that I have enough money saved up to pay for essentials like rent for at least 2 years (I live in the Midwest, so COL isn't so bad), and I do live with my S/O who is a software engineer. GA Tech's master's program is also on the much cheaper end than most places. I also feel however that this isn't exactly the best time to be considering a break that'd last for at least a few months. My alternative was to apply to some other roles, possibly software engineering for other security-facing products, instead of taking a career break. Am I incredibly stupid for even entertaining this?"

I have gotten around 10 legitimate interviews out of hundreds of applications (Fortune 500/startups) but only ever made it on-site twice to Big N, where I always bomb it near the end. The most frustrating part is that I started recruiting last August, and I had a job offer fall through because of COVID, and some other chances but it never came into fruition because of some unknown generic phone interview failure.

I have been looking at engineering in trading firms/quant roles, cybersecurity, or ML, where I am genuinely a lot more interested in the material and applications, but I am no where near qualified for any roles for it.

Thanks, TAA. I don't know how to decide which path is best for me. I understand this is a difficult thing for other people to give advice on but here I am anyway. I will outline the major choices I am facing with hopes that you wonderful, experienced people can offer any advice on how to make this choice. &amp;#x200B; The Backstory! &amp;#x200B; I originally wanted to career change into programming from being a manufacturing technician (not the well paying kind). I spent a few years at community in a part-time program that went from 'never touched a computer' to 'basic procedural programming in C++ and Java (yes, I know. Procedural programming in an OOP language.) I have an AAS which I earned specifically to transfer to a 4-year institute, which I choose to do when I was almost finished my above degree. So, technically I have two associates degrees. Go Me, hah! All that was within the last 7 years. I graduated from a community college in 2016. I had one semester in a CompSci program during the spring of 2018, but I ran out of money and I refuse to borrow anymore. I also tried to do that while working 12 hr overnights (work 12 hours, sleep on a bus for 40 minutes, sit through almost 6 hours of lectures 2 days a week. Not my smartest choice) and bombed the difficult, for me, classes. Basically, I need to do that semester again! No shame, I just did not have the time to dedicate to it. I have no industry experience in IT or Development. I have not been 'pounding the pavement' with my associate's. I've only really applied to a few businesses since 2016. I am still learning programming slowly, in my own time and I do not plan on stopping. Eventually, I will feel confident enough to freelance. &amp;#x200B; I just don't think it will be easy for me to find a job with my programming skills; at 44 years of age, in my economic area (coastal North Carolina) and within my self-imposed physical restriction of staying within an hour and a half of my co-parent. That means no moving towards Raleigh, back to Greensboro, or to Charlotte, btw which are where many more programming/development jobs exist. There is a higher chance of me finding open IT positions which is why I have decided to pursue IT in any manner. More opportunities in nearby areas. &amp;#x200B; Some Choices! First: I can aim for a BSIT at ECU. This requires one class (net 126) at the nearby community college and a CompTIA NET+ or a CCNA cert then 2 more years at ECU through online courses. I would start at Community in the fall then transfer in spring and hopefully, classes will line up to get me out of ECU in 4 semesters. I would graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology and end up in IT. Ideally. Second: UNCC Bootcamp such as their CyberSecurity Bootcamp and some certifications. Pro: only half a year! The advertisement says 24 weeks. That is a huge deal compared to almost 3 years. Cons: Are Bootcamps even worth anything? I have no idea how to judge that. It has been hinted to me, by the TAA caseworkers, that the government is more likely to pay for something that correlates directly to a job. A Bootcamp might fit that? I don't know. I really need outside experiences to value judge this. &amp;#x200B; These are the two choices I am considering. IF YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER PLEASE SAY SO! Of course, all this depends on the TAA program paying for it. I have to put the proposals together first; the what, where, how long, and how much. Then the caseworker can put forward her own proposal to the state department. It is quite a process, but an opportunity I definitely need to take advantage of. Worse comes to worst. . . I can earn something more pertinent to the local economy (welding, a higher paying manufacturing skill) or something I don't really want to do and work on earning a bachelor's on my own time. I hate that idea, to be honest, but I hate continued poverty and the economic disadvantages my wonderful 7-year old will face because of my thoughtless choices made earlier in life. Anyway, any advice and help are appreciated."

226,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,27 yr old - spent 3 years as full-stack developer for a Cyber security company. I was asked to switch to frontend development only. What should I do?,2,gcb2vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gcb2vf/27_yr_old_spent_3_years_as_fullstack_developer/,2020-05-03 04:16:21,"Hi, **TL;DR**: spent almost 3 years as full stack developer; was recently asked to switch to frontend development only. Should I do it? (note: I think context is important here so If you decide to read all my post, well thank you!) I'm a 27 years old software engineer (CS bachelor degree + close to get my CS master degree too) and I live in south Europe. I work for a cyber security company that provides a SOC service (major service) and several others, like penetration tests, all related to the cyber security field. When I started as a developer 3 years ago the developers team was composed just by my supervisor and I. One important note is that the SOC service we provide is all throw internal software (network sonde, PC clients, cloud, and web application) developed by us, mainly by my supervisor (dev team leader), and yes it is a really skilled software engineer. Later another person joined our team and he works mostly on our sandbox (hes kinda responsible for it). So we are in 3, my supervisor and I who work mainly on everything except the sandbox and the sandbox guy who works on the sandbox and recently started doing some little work on the network sonde and he cloud app too. One important note before I go ahead with my story: our work is NOT organized as micro tasks we are not given classes or functions to implement, we are given a problem and we have to come up with a solution for that problem. So we start with problem analyses and all kind of stuff software engineers do. Anyway, I started the first 7-8 months by developing the frontend (angular + redux), it can be considered as a complex web application and pretty data intensive, then I started working on the backend parts too, the cloud and our network sonde, after this period. Tasks on the backend vary a lot, it can be implement some new API to serve some data, implement new feature on the cloud, write some integration for some 3party security appliance (our sonde collected data by analysing traffic and collecting events/logs from many other 3p sources or work on new born project like a windows client endpoints (installed directly into PCs). On the other hand, working on the frontend is, let's say, more basic (at least by now). Often new features mean new api that needs to be supported by the frontend, find a fancy and usable way to serve the data, build new forms etc. I have to say that the frontend is always seen as the last part/less important to be implemented, something like: you implemented this then the frontend must support this. But I also think that in terms of web development there is a lot that can be done especially in terms of user experience and performance, and here comes my question. I have been offered to switch from full-stack developer to frontend development only. I will be the person responsible for it and I was also offered a structured UX/UI course to fulfill that part that was always missing in our team, a person dedicated to that with an eye for cybersecurity and that know how cybersecurity analyst interact with the web app (they use the UI differently, i mean from normal users). The options are: If I decide to stay Ill start to work more frequently on the backend and they will find someone else later to be dedicated to the frontend only. Here is my question, **Is it a good idea to switch from full-stack to frontend development?** Note, once I decide what career path to follow that will be definitive it will be irreversible. I see some pro, cons and some fears I have about these two options: * **Pros** * I can specialize in this field, at least more than if I stay full-stack * I can learn UI and UX skills that very few people in this field have * I will be (in a near feature, I hope) my project, I will be responsible for the frontend and every aspect related to it. * If I choose to stay backend I fear I'll never have a project I'll be responsible for and I'll bounce around doing some tasks (backend only) where needed. * I can spend the learned (more likely than backend ones) skills elsewhere even outside the cybersecurity field * **Cons** * By looking at the [Stackoverflow 2019 survey](URL frontend developers are paid significantly LESS than their counterparts fullstack and backend developers. * I will work gradually less often on (backend) security related stuff (what i like, or at least i think it's more valuable) like the one described above. * What if the value brought in by UI/UX enhancements will NOT be considered/perceived as much valuable in this field. What I mean that in this field users are mainly technicians who care less (at least I think they do) about UI and UX. My fear here is that I'll end up doing the frontend as we did before with a few enhancements plus doing some boring backend stuff like implementing API routes. * I fear to learn less, especially in security related stuff and backend / devops ones. By looking at other frontends of other competitors like Googles [Backstory](URL or [Reaqta](URL it looks like they care about UI/UX but I know basically nothing about this field, I need advice here, is it an essential thing in every field or is frontend/web development + UX generally considered less valuable then backend one? &amp;#x200B; Thank you so much if you read it all :)"

They don't have any requirements as to what CS subfield I have to choose to specialize in. I can choose to specialize in any of Theory, Systems, AI/ML, PL, etc. or I could choose not to specialize at all and take courses from a wide array of different subfields for breadth. Given that, I'm wondering which area of CS might be the best to go for. I'm interested in really most areas of CS, and am especially leaning towards Systems Programming (and theoretical CS a bit too). But I am open to most subareas, including AI/ML. However, from a job market perspective, I'm wondering which subarea might make the most sense. For example, I've heard that you need at least a Master's in ML to do interesting work in ML / Data Science, whereas I haven't really heard that a Master's in Computer Systems would lead to more interesting jobs. So maybe that means that getting a MS specialized in Systems would be ""useless"" since most jobs that require such systems backgrounds can be done with just a BS? Would a MS in CS with a concentration in Systems or Theory be ""wasting my ticket"" so to speak, and should I try to specialize in AI/ML as that would open more doors up in the future? Or are there any other specializations to look for that would be beneficial to enter the workforce? For context, I'm mostly open to most areas in tech related to software, whether that be SWE, AI/ML researcher, cybersecurity researcher, etc. I'm still trying to figure out which path is the best for me, and deciding my MS specialization is part of that.

The degree is not as useless as it may sound (curriculum is very practical and some major employers like Apple/Amazon/various record labels are actually asking for Music Business degrees), but I have done no internships during college and havent made any meaningful relationships with any of my peers. Connections/experience are vital, and I have little to none of either. I would love to work in the Music Industry, but I dont know if I would be very successful at it without good social skills and connections. I also would be confined to either LA or NY, both of which are incredibly expensive and would be fairly difficult to pay for with a Music Industry starting job.

However, I just dont think my Web Dev minor would even get me a job doing Web Development. Even with a decent project portfolio, I feel like priority would almost always be given to CS majors (rightfully), which is why I want to switch.

Since Im going to be a Senior, I only have about 1.5-2 more years of federal/state grants, as well as my universitys financial aid. I think going to a CA State Uni would be much cheaper.

Also, is it possible for me to still get web dev/programming jobs with my Music Industry degree if I can demonstrate competence through an extensive portfolio?

232,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,News Flash: You Do NOT Need A CS Degree,1,fg62kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fg62kg/news_flash_you_do_not_need_a_cs_degree/,2020-03-10 12:41:49,"*So this whole rant is triggered by a guy I saw asking why all the good cybersecurity technicians that the government wants are junkies, and I needed somewhere to post this. This is not to say all the people who do CS as a pastime are junkies (obviously), but it's just what triggered this particular post. I really want to educate younger folks who may be considering the field and want to know their options:* With my experience in Comp Sci, I've realized the reason that the bureau can't find people with decent cybersecurity skills is that all the straitlaced ones who go the degree route are in general not as good. Most of my friends smoke weed, I'm not gonna lie. I've never touched it myself since addiction runs in my family and I don't wanna risk putting my family through what I've gone through. But at the end of the day, these people who I know are also the most skilled people I know. This is most likely because Comp Sci degrees are advertised as teaching you all you need to know about the field, which is sooo wrong. Most comp sci majors graduate knowing like 2 languages, maybe a bit more if they're lucky and get in a tech college like MIT, with zero experience in the practical use of them. They may learn more than just Java and a C, but from what I've heard just the basics of them. Even if you argue that you can transfer skills from one language to another (which I agree with), someone with heavy practical use in a few languages/areas as a long-term hobby is more likely to beat out someone with a basic CS degree, in my opinion. The one thing that a degree is good for is connections, which honestly won't get you far for very long in the tech field if there are many people who can outperform you. At the end of the day, people who start young and devote time to coding, CTFs, ARGs, and such as a pastime are going to be much more skilled to practically defend/attack technology. Unfortunately, in my experience with people that start cybersecurity in their free time, these tend to be people with authority issues. They also have a tendency to question almost everything, which is a common trait with these, and so some of the good ones end up turning to drugs. Much more likely for the lack of good hackers in government, however, is that the amount that government agencies pay their technicians is absolutely appalling. I know a lot of people are hypnotized by the ""secret agent"" glamor or whatever, but I could never imagine working for an agency paying that low rather than a private company for significantly more + travel. Don't get me wrong, a comp sci degree can help someone out. If you, for example, start out as a hobby and then continue that education in college, you will be an actual *god*. Still though, out of my friend group and myself, I've never gotten a degree in Comp Sci. But all of my jobs have been programming/tech-related. When I was very young I got my start from making video games (cliche I know), moved onto cybersecurity and got very familiar with Linux, then got a job at a small startup in my hometown, and I have remained in the field since graduating hs. A friend of mine actually got employed as an *officer in the army* without a degree cause he solved some sort of cybersecurity puzzle (I'm sure you can read up on it somewhere, look up Army Cyber Command Puzzle or something of the like, there were a few different ones, most commercial). Another dude I knew ended up getting a software engineer job at E-Bay with a Political Science degree. My brother (who introduced me to the tech field) and other friends all managed to do pretty decently in the tech community as well without any degrees just freelancing and finding other jobs. Anyways, sorry for this long-ass rant, had to get it off my chest since I think it's incredibly fucked that college advertises to highschool students as if they need to spend thousands of dollars to get a programming job when that couldn't be farther from the truth. Don't get me wrong, if you can afford it and it won't put you into 10+ years of debt, go for the degree. I'm not saying it'll hurt you. As I said, those who are already skilled programmers and advance their education with a degree are practically unstoppable in my experiences. But if you can't afford it, or if you feel college isn't right for you. Don't sweat it. Just bust your ass, find a passion for something in the tech field, and keep working on it and looking for jobs. Quick tip: You can still try applying for jobs even if they have a degree requirement in their application post! This means get working on your portfolio since if you don't have a degree this and the weight of your name/previous workplaces are the only things that an employer can use to validate you. The worst thing they can do is turn you down, but if they see your portfolio is very impressive, you may have a decent shot even at these workplaces."

Both are in the Bay Area, close to my hometown. The offer that I originally got was from vArmour, a startup/small company for cybersecurity. I'm not entirely sure what exactly I would be working on (other than being software engineering), and not sure about the benefits either. The pay is $35/hr and I would be working full-time for about 13 weeks. The offer I just got is from VMware, which is a larger, more well-known company. I would be on a EUC team, and though I am not sure about the benefits either, there is more information about the company/benefits online. The pay is $32.75/hr and I would be working full-time for 12 weeks. I mostly care about what I would do/learn on the job, benefits, and how the internship will help me find future internships/jobs. Since I want to concentrate in artificial intelligence, both are not very related. Both also seem to make return offers (which might not be relevant since I may stay in my college city next summer). Since VMware is a larger company, I thought that they might have more non-monetary benefits, as well as look better on my resume.

My first onsite interview (after 100 applications thrown away) was delayed due to the outbreak but I'm not here to complain but to get some advice on which technologies I should start learning or improving to be able to find a job in the near future. To introduce my background a bit, I have strong knowledge in databases, solid background in cybersecurity (penetration testing) and some basic knowledge of ML algorithms. No internship experience but multiple nontrivial projects. Skill summary: Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS EC2/S3, Django, Node.js/Express, Bootstrap4, Linux With that, I concluded I should focus on either 1) refreshing/improving on my existing skills: \- improve web development skills with Django (most recent project so shortest time expected) \- work on a new project to refresh NoSQL as I haven't worked on NoSQL databases for a year \- brush up network/cybersecurity knowledge (need some time as the cybersecurity training was more than 5 years ago so I'm not sure if it's worth spending time on this unless I want to be a network developer or security engineer) 2) learning new skills to broaden job searching: \- learn React for full-stack (I'm not into front end but seems really hot) \- learn TensorFlow for ML \- learn Spring for Java backend (Should I keep working on Django/Node.js to save learning time?) \- learn GCP for clouding (Should I focus on AWS?) \- learn Hadoop/MapReduce for Big data (I'm into interacting with data but will it take a long time?) My goal is to get a job as fast as possible and to use my time wisely knowing what to focus. I'm not sure if I should be familiar with all the hot technologies or should be an expert in a few.

I've been pretty involved with music since and will continue to do so - writing, performing, playing multiple instruments, giving lessons etc. I love it and it's provided me with supplemental income, but never near enough to live off of. I've also worked as a part time professional tutor, mainly helping students with math, writing, and basic computer skills. Recently I was hired in a full time position (my first ever full time job actually) at one of the colleges I worked at part time, and honestly I hate it, lol. I enjoyed tutoring, but all the minute administrative tasks, education budget politics, and the mis-management at this particular college is enough to make me realize I simply don't want a career in higher ed administration. My salary is 40k a year, which for me was a big jump, but in the grand scheme of things, probably not that great? Plus, it's grant funded, meaning my job will likely end when the grant is up in 3 years. So, I figure if I'm gonna be working full time somewhere in an area outside of music, it may as well be in a field where I can challenge myself and have potential to earn a really good living. I'm completely new to IT, and honestly probably less tech savvy than the average person my age, but I'm always stimulated by learning new things. I like to solve problems and work independently, while still communicating with others effectively to reach the same goal. I figure something in IT would fit this well. Even from a musical standpoint, I do some very amateur producing, and as I'm messing around with software I'm curious as to how the sound of a guitar effect is coded, or how that technology is built. That very thing or something similar is something I'd wanna do. So, my tentative plan is this - come August, I intend to step down from my full time job and enrolling in the other community college I worked at to take their associate's in computer science program. They are a great school and I can easily pick up hours tutoring part time again. Their program has 3 tracks - Mobile applications development, business support, and cybersecurity. There's also a programming certificate I can earn. I'm probably leaning towards mobile development, but can anyone help me out on the real differences between these pathways and how much they matter when applying for jobs? Since I already have a Bachelor's, I expect to finish the program in a year, maybe 3 semesters tops. Finally, a few questions. I have no interest in getting a second bachelor's. I got free of student debt a couple years ago and never want to go back. Can an associate's degree at least open the door for me? I'm not opposed to picking up other certifications, just not doing another 4 year school. Also, what can I expect to earn initially and how much can that grow over time? Like, I'm at 40k salary right now, so I'd hope to at least match that or surpass it quickly after a period of time. I don't aim to be rich, but one of the main reasons for me looking into computer science is because there is potential for a high income, and if I manage money okay, I aim to retire early and/or be more flexible with work as I age. Let me know if you think this is a good idea for me, or have any other advice!"

263,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Cybersecurity vs programming,1,f9wjwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9wjwl/cybersecurity_vs_programming/,2020-02-27 04:16:21,"Hello guys, I am new to cybersecurity and I am looking for advice regarding what should I choose. I know cybersecurity is hot right now and more and more jobs will come up in the future as the need for it increases. That's one of the reasons why I joined this field. I wanted to get to know what it's all about, but I started to feel that it might not be for me. I am currently working as a security analyst and I feel that I am usually limited in what I can do. For example, someone is trying to exploit an internet facing application. Depending on the information the client provides you via tools, you can often find yourself in a position where you know what steps to take(check the source/destination of the traffic, what's the impact, what happened to the traffic instance:blocked or not?, is the application even vulnerable to that exploit?), but can't find answers to most of these questions. Like it's frustrating as hell to know what you have to do in order to properly assess what happened, but not having the means to do it. I feel cuffed. Is it usually like that in this field? Now lets look on the other side of the fence. In programming, from what I know it's more about what projects you have going on at the time rather than what security incidents occur. With the information you learn at the workplace, you can actually go home and create from scratch your own applications which is pretty nice. In cybersec you don't have that going for you. You can do some hack the box, forensics on infected machines, but it feels that is way harder to get into it as a beginner without properly reading some books before. Programming is just straight up. You learn something and you can immediately apply that information and see how it works. It feels more convenient to learn and do in your free time than cybersec. The criteria on which I will make up my mind are: 1) pay I've seen that both fields are pretty close regarding money. It seems that programming offers slightly higher salaries. 2)number of jobs Even though there are more and more jobs in cybersec, there are definitely a lot more jobs in the programming field. 3)flexibility Learning a programming language well, helps you learn faster other programming languages as a lot of concepts remain the same. It depends on what kind of programming you do(web, embedded, games, pc applications, android), but I have the impression that switching from one type of programming to another is done with a good transfer of usable knowledge. In comparison, transitioning from security analyst to a pentesting role seems to be way harder as you need to know a lot more. 4)work time The thing that scares me about security is that you might sometimes be required to do long hours and sometimes at unusual hours. Programming seems to be more business hours oriented. Since I touched this point, how is the workload usually like for each of these? I really need some advice regarding what would be a good choice for me. Context: I have close to 1 year experience as a sec analyst which is not much. I know networking, have comptia sec+, decent programming skills. Right now, I feel that the work resembles more a help desk job than a technical oriented one which annoys me a lot, since I have an engineering degree. I need to know if it's worth to continue in this role as a sec analyst and then switch to pentest, sec engineer or maybe programming will be better well paid, less stressful, more rewarding overall? I am willing to put in good work even outside the job, but I need some sort of assurance that I chose the right track or if I need to do the switch now while I am still new. It kind of bother me that in cybersec you need clearences, you work strange hours and sometimes the stress level hits the roof. Please share with me some of your insight. Thank you in advance!"

I graduated high school back in 2018. In high school I participated in speech and debate, an activity that I enjoyed. I liked researching current events, accumulating evidence, and generating arguments. After hearing an alumni talk about his experience in the Intelligence Studies program at Mercyhurst, I thought that was what I wanted to do; intelligence gathering and counterterrorism. For a number of reasons, not the least of which were financial, I enrolled at the local community college. Full ride, everything paid for. I haven't spend a dime out of my own pocket for school these last two years which is pretty great. I will graduate in May, and I should end with an overall GPA of 3.9 and a major GPA of 4.0. I'm majoring in cybersecurity, as it was a brand new program for the school at the time and was the closest thing to what I wanted to do; credits would transfer and some of the skills and information I was learning would translate. I had just built my own computer and had a blast doing it. I love to repair electronics. I had no issue going into IT to start. As long as I wasn't stuck doing help desk and basic tech support in 10 years. The problem is I don't want to do IS anymore. I don't want to work in government. I don't want that kind of responsibility, and although it may be an irrational fear, I don't want to endanger my future family in any way and I feel like working in that area could place a target on my back. Whatever the case, IS no longer interests me. But it's not like I'm in love with cyber either. I'm not too great a programmer and I don't like doing it. I can tolerate it but I do not want to sit in a cubicle all day typing away at a keyboard. I gravitate more toward the physical side of the field; social engineering, hardware, policy, that kind of stuff. I've befriended a few professors and people working in the field. They're more on the business side of things, and one runs his own consulting firm (not a consistent enough position for my liking). He got his Master's degree from Western Governor's and gave it a good recommendation so that definitely put WGU on my radar. I'm working on lining up an internship this summer which will finally give me some field experience. I don't have any certs but I plan on starting some relatively soon; the entry-level ones shouldn't be too difficult to knock out. I still don't know exactly what I want to do in cyber. But that's the path I'm on and I don't see any other options for me. The only thing I've ever been passionate about is football and my dream job is to work in an NFL front office, but I obviously can't really go to school for that. I've been a sports writer for 4+ years now and worked for Pro Football Focus, an analytics firm, this past season so I am chasing my dream on the side. WGU was my plan heading into my last semester; it's online (I place very little value on the whole ""campus experience"" - the degree is what matters to me), very affordable, and has the potential to be extremely quick. It would allow me to earn a bachelor's - the degree is Cybersecurity and Information Assurance - while interning and gaining experience, earning certs, and continuing my football stuff on the side. But my parents don't love the idea. They seem to want me to to go to a university. They think I should be ""setting my sights higher"" than WGU. I don't necessarily disagree, but I also feel like WGU is the most efficient option for me. Not to mention it's actually affordable. I had a 33 ACT in high school along with a 3.92 GPA but that's pretty much worthless now, and as far as I'm aware scholarships for transfer students are basically nonexistent. So basically I don't really know what to do right now. You might say it's my life and I shouldn't let my parents make this choice for me, which is true, but I value their opinion highly and I would like this to be a collaborative decisions, especially since they're the ones that will be footing most of the bill. I'm also interesting in getting a bachelor's in data analytics - I don't like math but I know how useful that degree could potentially be, in many different fields including sports. I don't enjoy school at all, whether it's in person or online, but I do anticipate eventually getting my master's degree. I know I'm smart enough and I can handle the workload. I'm just in a tough spot right now and honestly I'm feeling pretty discouraged. I would really appreciate some guidance and I will do my best to answer any questions. Any university and/or program suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."

I'm currently in recruiting as a professional, and my soft-skills are solid although I am hesitant to rely on them solely for the rest of my career. Reasoning for cybersecurity: I've got soft-skills and the people-skills that I want to apply to a technical field. Being as cybersecurity is so vast, I feel like if I get some certs under my belt then I can move around easily. Also, I love learning new things, and this field is always changing. Question: I have my bachelor's in humanities, my master's in a social science, and I am considering getting an associate's in cybersecurity for time/cost effectiveness since I wouldn't need to take gen-eds. During my time during the AAS, I'm supposed to pass at least 2 certs out of the following: CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Administrator), CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, and/or ISC2 Professional Security certification(s).

I'm in my early 30s and I've worked for several multinational companies and I currently run a small team running AdWords, Bing Ads, FB campaigns, etc. I guess what I mean is that I'm not completely unfamiliar with coding as I work closely with developers, data scientists, PMs, etc. I was diagnosed with cancer a few months ago. Fortunately, I'm much better now and I've decided not do delay any longer what's been always one of my dreams: working remotely and perhaps while travelling. Finding a remote online marketing job would be the straight option but, looking tino remote work websites, I found only a few marketing posts. Freelancing is an option but I feel only small business would take a single individual to run their campaigns. Not sure how reliable that option would be. I taught myself enough R to create simple scripts to analyze large datasets, segment customers or do basic web scraping. I also did some Udacity HTML/CSS/JS courses on my spare time and build two embarrassing websites with Bootstrap. Enough to know that I enjoy problem solving and that the unforgiving logic of programing turns me on. I still need to be home for a while to regularly check myself so it is the perfect time to learn a coding language and spend more hours on Stack Overflow. Software engineering or Data Science (especially the last one I believe) could complement very well my current skill set and boost my career to the next level. I can see how statistics and machine learning could help me but also developing with javascript an app that connects to an API. Nevertheless, it seems 95% of remote work is software engineering, neither data science or marketing. I would appreciate any advice you could give me on the path you think I should follow. I can only speculate and search job posts to get an idea about my options but you really know your stuff and know the job market from the inside. In case that matters, I'm from the EU. Hoping this post gets noticed by somebody.. PS: I have also fantasized about a career in CyberSecurity (love NITE Team 4) but that's probably unrealistic, especially for remote work.

Is there anyone here that was in a similar situation that made it work? What should my focus be? Potential solutions in my mind are: 1. Grad school (Masters in CS or something more specialized like CyberSecurity) 1. Could I take undergrad CS courses to get some XP to put on a Grad resume? 2. Bootcamp. Not my ideal solution, but my understanding is people do learn from them 3. Self-teach myself to code?

I found that I can still change it to Cybersecurity without damage. I've learned in my first Computer Science class that I don't like Java. No more. So I don't want to write code in Java anymore. In fact, I don't want *java* to be the main responsibility of my future job - If I can avoid it, of course. I must make it clear that *can* code in Java all up until interfaces, something extends something else, private classes, abstract classes, polymorphism, support classes, events and listeners, all of that. This is probably the reason I don't like code. So what are my options if I don't want that to be the primary focus of my job? What about internships? What do cybersecurity people do? Thank you!"

I am in a technical field that is fast becoming obsolete and/or getting off shored. Think of me as a Windows 95 admin but now everyone is using windows 10 which is very tightly connected to the cloud while Win95 has limited internet technology. So I know the basics of windows, but I don't know the new stuff which is what everyone is looking for (the cloud integration). And the new stuff is completely foreign (win95 barely had dial up let alone gigabyte upload speeds that we do now). I'm in my mid 40s and I just realized (10 years too late) that I cannot continue here due to bad #4, bad #3 is tolerable. BUT I feel I cannot get a new job because of bad #4, I don't have the latest skills that is being sought in my field and because of bad #1 and #2, I don't have the management skills, ability to lead meetings, workshops, design things, etc because I've never been involved with that and was always just given tasks to do. (and never sought out more which was totally my fault) Think of my job as an off shore guy - just given tasks to do, not part of the design or analysis, just a DOer rather than a planner/innovator. It is true that industry related skills might not transfer over but it doesn't matter as much if you have the management/lead/planning skills, those are generic and can carry over. (and I don't have it) But I feel that I have to move ASAP because as I get even older it will just be harder and harder to get a new job because expectations of my skills will just get higher. (WTF! how did you work 25 years and not gain the ability to lead meetings or manage a timeline?) Due to bad #3 I don't mind going in as a experienced entry level (the next level above recent grads) since I feel the salary might be comparable but due to my age I think companies will think it is very strange that someone with 25 years experience will apply for a job that requires 6 years experience and will hold that against me. I am not quitting my job (I need the salary) but staying here will just dig me deeper in the hole as I am just getting older and falling behind more due to bad #4. What to do? What industry can I try to get into? (try to BS into at least) Project Management? I can say that due to my many years experience, I've led teams and been part of many projects so I know the process, I know how to plan timelines and budget (but I don't) Audit? anyone who has been in technology has been part of an audit, maybe I can say that due to being through many audits over 25 years I have picked up the basics and can learn more? Can't think of another field/industry - most other positions, even analyst requires a couple of years experience in the specific technology of that field. (and analyst is newbie entry level). For example I looked at some cybersecurity analyst postings and they all require 2-3 years of work with XYZ tools and ABC programs which are native to that industry. (although that is a hot field to get into) Thank you for reading through this wall of text and for any advice"

I am currently a masters comp sci student from a UK university. Recently I received an exploding offer from a FAANG company for graduate SWE role and was told to have to respond by the end of December (they are not willing to give me more time). However, I am also waiting for other offers and final interviews for other companies, including a quant fund and a big finance company which might have better offers, none of which are able to move things quicker due to the holidays. I have also interviewed for a cybersecurity associate programme and am waiting for an offer but was told they can't make a decision until January. The thing is, while the FAANG offer is great, I am quite interested in cybersecurity (having done basically none of it at uni since my uni doesn't offer a course in cybersecurity). I feel that it would be a great step to having a cybersecurity career, but at the same time I don't want to reject a good offer with a very good company reputation and the cybersecurity programme probably has far less benefits. The other SWE roles are also in London which is where my family lives. I feel that it would be immoral to accept an offer and renege later, and I wouldn't want to burn any bridges at the start of my career, but I'm also worried I would be rejected for the other roles. Any advice on what I should do?"

It really stands out on my resume, and I am almost always asked about it in interviews. However, the project to which I was assigned quickly proved to be more technical and ambiguous than our supervisor let on during the application and interview process, and my team members and I were tasked with developing the desired solution on our own. This was much to my surprise, as I assumed the internship would be more structured and more tailored to a programming novice. I had only taken one coding class at the time I applied, and I made this very clear during my interview. By the end of the semester, a couple of my team members with a stronger technical acumen were able to provide the deliverable our supervisor wanted, and he was pleased with our ""team's"" work. The issue is, I spent most of the time looking over their shoulders trying to make sense of what was going on and asking questions rather than actually contributing to the solution, as I felt trying to tamper with their code and algorithms would only make things worse. My team members understood where I was coming from and were happy to help teach me, but in other interviews after the fact, I have been hard-pressed to discuss my ""individual contributions."" I usually outline what our team's goal was and how we effectively met our supervisor's expectations (what I currently have outlined on my resume), but I have been met with something along the lines of ""that's great...now tell me what YOU PERSONALLY contributed,"" to which I have no real response. I really don't want to come off as like I was just being lazy or like I am falsifying an entire internship experience.

It's hard to focus all my energy into one aspect of CS when I inevitably deviate and catch my self exploring yet a new niche - I am starting to become a jack of all trades, master of none. To sum it up, I'm afraid of pouring myself in X path, only to find that I should have followed Y path later down the road. &amp;#x200B; Secondly, the CS job market moves so fast that it's hard to predict where it's heading; A few years ago searching for ""ML tutorial"" would return only PhD thesis and scientific papers. Nowdays everyone is heading torwards an ML career and there are many content creators exploding everywhere with courses and whatnot. My point being that every year there's a new catch phrase, whether that is ReactJS in 2017, Blockchain in 2018, ML and data science in 2019 and so on, which feels like an eternal race to learn more about these catchphrases and ""improve"" my LinkedIn/CV, while the previous jobs slowly fade away. &amp;#x200B; Lastly, poking around with these fields is fun as a hobby, but browsing this sub has made me question the corporate world.

I've done a little bit of research on them, and I'd consider myself a little bit desperate. In May 2019, I graduated with a B.S in Computer Science from a rather prestigious university, 3.29 GPA. I didn't, and still don't do well with interview questions, and didn't land a job right away. I enjoyed programming, and had side projects, won several app competitions, had worked as a TA, had a Big 4 Accounting Firm Cybersecurity internship in a European country, had a Capstone project, and did clubs. I got scared when I was getting ghosted while seemingly less qualified peers landed jobs (unhealthy comparison, I know). I panicked and enrolled in a Master's degree at the same school. I began doing research on the first project I could find, and did an REU program that summer. I became depressed and didn't perform any miracles during my research over the summer, and my project hasn't got very far. I currently am not enjoying my first semester of the Master's, and feel burnt out from my 3 classes, TA'ing and research gets whatever time is left. At the same time, I'm not awfully excited to enter the working world, and am very conflicted. I've been applying to both internships and full time jobs, with little luck, mainly getting ghosted, without even the chance to perform poorly on the coding challenges. If I were to have an offer of any kind I'd probably be a lot less anxious. Revature emailed me today, wanting to talk. I feel like they know I'm desperate, because they never scouted me during senior year. I believe I'm worth more than that because the people who came to me for help with CS throughout college landed jobs with 2-3X the salary, prestige, and the freedom of not being bound by the 2 year contract. I don't believe I'm god's gift and know there is more to learn, but I'm still disappointed with myself for this situation.

I have a degree in Computer Science. Although I am not academically strong, I do think that I can make it in this industry. I started my career as a QA resource in a startup testing for mobile(Android and iOS) and did it for about 2 years, one year in automation using python. I learnt a little bit of SQL as well. I got a job in a new startup where I got the role of SDE-I working on a project with backend in python. My problem is that I was not really a good programmer to begin with. Although I had the passion to learn and create new things through code, it pretty much got sucked out of me in college. I was also not strong with Algorithms although I tried a lot to fix it by going through some books. It was at this point I realised that being a full fledged programmer may not be something I could do. I was moved back into QA as my programming structure and methodology is bad. Feedback given by my manager is that it is worse than a fresher. I have also had the problem where freshers in my team have ridiculed my code. I recently developed an interest in cybersecurity and wanted to pursue a career in that direction but my manager who has been helpful so far is telling me to stick to QA as I would have a great career in it if I were to apply my skills. So far many of my colleagues have also said that I am doing well as a QA. My manager suggests that If I were to leverage my skills and improve in automation I could get to be an SDET and eventually a Manager. My problem here is that I know I don't want to do QA anymore but I don't have a solid reason. Since the job market here is also not that great, and my skills for a candidate of 3 years experience is pretty bad as an SDE I am afraid that If I don't continue my career in QA, I might become unemployable. The people that have been helping me so far have made it clear that I have not capitalised on the chances being given to me. They also don't want me to throw what I already have away. I have set my goal to break out of QA and pursue a career in cyber security. My only thought process to back this is that if I had the skill to find bugs in an app, why can't I use the same skill to find vulnerabilities? If at all it is possible for me to turn my life around please let me know what I can do. I am going to turn 25 and I am not sure if what I am doing is career suicide."

First, some notes: * I have a BSc in Computing Science from the University of Alberta from 2014, which afaik is a decent school. * I've since done a bunch of random jobs, and am now doing a very qualitative, interview-based MA in an unrelated field. * I did get about 2 years experience as a programmer for a research group during my degree, and 8 months at a software company post-graduation. This was almost all Java, including application development, web development, and some Android dev. I do have some Python experience from random research assistant gigs. * However, I won't have any CS experience in the last 4 years when I graduate the MA. I do have recent work experience in communications, teaching, qualitative research, and administrative roles. I'm ready to move back into the tech world, and also planning to move to Vancouver (yes, I know, CoL sucks but I'll take that and the rain over icy cold winters). I'm planning on going into Software Development since that's what I seemingly know best, but I'd love to move into some sort of cybersecurity role eventually. I don't have too much time with work, TAing, and thesis work, but I definitely feel like I need to do some sort of project to get back into the industry and show I can still do things. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has suggestions on what would look ok for someone who hasn't been in the field for ~4-5 years? And any language recommendations? I'm still quite bored of Java, and I enjoy Python but am not sure how useful that is on an industry level. Thanks a lot for any suggestions here."

Second I haven't started researching/applying to companies at all. Some explanation: My program only has 2-month summer so it wasn't easy to find an internship in the 1st and 2nd years. Instead I just spent some time self-studying. Also I haven't applied to companies because I wanted to focus on the exam. My questions: Is it too late now to start looking for a job/sponsorship something in cybersecurity for after graduation ? How important is the internship section on the CV ? What are the good resources to learn about tech companies, especially for cybersecurity, not general software engineer ? Thank you for reading."

I sometimes wish I'd taken more advanced CS classes to figure out what I might want to specialize in or even do research in, as opposed to staying a code monkey (I'm already taking 3 graduate level classes my senior year, but that's about all I can squeeze in before graduation on top of general graduation requirements). I'm also worried that my second major might make me seem less technical to employers and less competitive in the market in the long run. Because of these factors, I've been debating getting a MS in CS to gain more exposure to CS subfields like advanced operating system design, program analysis, computer graphics and cybersecurity, some of which weren't available at my undergrad college. Is a master's in CS worthwhile professionally? Should I enroll in a part-time master's program, or take time off work to fully reap the benefits of a master's program (especially if I'm considering trying out research)? Is there a point (in terms of # years of industry experience) beyond which getting a MS will have a negligible effect on my job prospects? Also, does anyone have experience with leveraging non-technical experience to one's advantage in a software engineering career?

I'm considering the AF Reserves as a means to enter cybersecurity for a few reasons: 1. The AF can guarantee you your job (as long as you qualify for it) meaning that if I chose a cybersecurity-related job, it could at least somewhat count as job experience to start my career. 2. After graduating from tech school (where you learn your job), you earn your sec+ certification and a Top Secret Clearance which I heard from this community is worth gold in the field. 3. The reserves can also help pay for college with Tuition Assistance so I plan on getting a computer science degree online. Additionally, the AF also pays up to 4500 per year for certifications related to my job ( CISSP, CEH, Etc.) 4. Finally, the AF reserves would also provide a good source of connections. So if I do go through this route, my main focus would be to first gain a plethora of exp and certifications. Exp meaning internships, jobs, and etc. The reason why I would do college online is bc of the flexibility for more hours. I would probably, however, have to start out with IT while teaching myself cybersecurity on the side. I also have some connections who could possibly hook me up with these jobs as well. Once I gain enough exp in probably 4 or 5 yrs after college, I want to get a full-fledged job in the field (my main interests are pen testing and cloud/security engineering). Now there is one thing that I'm afraid of which are deployments. Ofc as an airman I would be fine deploying but I'm more concerned about what employers would think when hiring me. Ik it's illegal to even ask about your reservist status/military exp since it has the potential to be discriminatory but I also heard that employers could just find another reason not to hire you. But all in all, does this sound like a feasible/good plan to enter cybersecurity? I did hear of others who did this but ofc I don't know where they are now. People say that I should at least be able to get an entry-level IT job after tech school since the field is growing fast and bc I'll have a TS clearance (which will help me a long way, especially with government jobs) and a sec+ cert to start out. If anyone could give insight on whether or not my expectations are realistic, that would be awesome. Thanks y'all."

Do I have to go for a master's or Ph.D. if I want to work in AI or Cyber Security? thank you, everyone, this is a hard question for me and I am not sure where to go from here, I'm hoping to see you guys advice to see what are some great career prospects in cybersecurity or AI. looking forward to hearing from you guys soon."

After completing the two semester course you get an online badge, which basically says 'Advanced Certificate' on the course took (blockchain, AI/ML, IoT, business analytics, or cybersecurity). I'm from a college at southern India, which this part has a pretty good reputation of baking out enginner students without any practical knowledge. What they say is that with their top notch curriculum and iCAT program, it'll do the magic. So I was wondering, does anyone have any experience with this kind of IBM training? If so, how is the curriculum? What can I expect? Did the course help you in your career? Is the course any effective? And it costs about 49K in INR (rupees, not the zelda one, the Indian one). I really do hope for your honest opinions on this!"
383,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,"Recently started as Business Consultant Security, but expectations are not meeting reality by a mile. Nearing the end of my probation. What do I do?",1,dl3ptu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dl3ptu/recently_started_as_business_consultant_security/,2019-10-22 04:18:10,"I recently graduated with a Master Degree in Computer Science (specialization Cybersecurity) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I went looking for a job, and was offered a position of Business Consultant Security at a company that mainly focuses on testing. I looked elsewhere and had 3 or 4 other offers, but decided to take this one because I believe it allowed me to grow in the direction that I wanted, which is security testing, the fastest. To make it clear: They did mention that I might not immediately be assigned to a security testing job, and that the security testing within the company was not that mature yet, but said that I would be able to help to grow it. I was okay with this, since I really liked the place and the people, and wouldn't mind doing some other types of testing for a short while. In the first week, I was told that I could help with a security test, together with a couple of other colleagues, and so I did. I created a template for the report that would be sent to the customer, I found some vulnerabilities in the system and everything was awesome. Now I'm 1,5 months into the job, and I was told that I would be introduced to a company for an assignment. They told me I would do a combination of functional and technical testing, and that there might be some security involved. With this in mind, I had an intake meeting with a couple of people of this company. Long story short, the meeting went well, I was looking forward to have an assignment and was able to start the next working day. The first two days were mainly introduction, but on the third day, I was introduced to the actual job I would be doing: purely functional testing. The job would include copying and pasting descriptions of features, editing a couple of words to make them test cases, and then clicking through the application, taking screenshots and putting them in Excel. If any problems arise, I'd have to report it. With all respect to the people who do this for a living, I find it boring. The assignment completely mismatched my expectations, does not align with my ambitions and is taking a toll on me. If it was a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10, sure, I would have done it as an assignment, but this feels more like a -3. I called my supervisor from the consulting company, and he understood and said that it would be discussed internally, and that they would get back to me in two days. I think I slept for around 2 hours the night after. I just couldn't wrap my head around how I got there and what I was doing with my life. I dreaded getting out of bed that morning, something which I haven't done in years. I made my 8 hours that day, I delivered my work, but dreaded doing it. The next night I barely slept too. It was a little bit better, but I think 4 hours or something. I skipped my morning run as well, which I hadn't done in 6 weeks. I got the promised phone call. My supervisor from the consulting company said that I should confirm that the job would stay this way and to discuss the problems with the external company's supervisor. I did, and that supervisor confirmed there would be no change in what I would do for the duration of the assignment. I relayed this info back to my consulting company supervisor and they would come to the external company's office the next business day. This happened, and we discussed everything that was said previously. The consulting company's supervisor talked to the external company's supervisor and said that he would discuss it further with other people from the consulting company. That brings us to about an hour in the past. I got a phone call that the deal they are proposing me is to do the assignment for 32 hours instead of 40 and to spend 8 hours on my OSCP (security testing certificate) training. I have 10 days left in my probation and I'm considering all the options that I have. I'm at a point at which I'm not sure what to do. If I take this deal, I will dread going into work for 4 days a week, but I will make it through my probation and I will maybe get a better assignment in the future, with no guarantee. If I don't take the deal, I will most likely be fired. If I resign, I have to pay $800 back for the OSCP training and find another job. Could you please give me some advice on what to do here, Reddit?"

I have a couple research projects in cybersecurity and have built some applications in django/react.

I plan to work through their interview questions easy-hard. Once I am about midway through the medium questions I am going to start applying to software engineering jobs. I do not know how to prepare for any cybersecurity interviews but I have taken a networking class and am currently taking a introduction to cybersecurity principles along with cyberdefense training class. I plan on creating two resumes and cover letter templates for the two jobs.

Along with my current gpa being so low it makes me want to push applying for jobs until spring semester.

Hello all, I'm a 3rd year CS student who just transferred from my community college to a pretty good 4 year university. Last week we had 3 career fairs, in which I was able to talk to about 15+ employers (it would have been more but we had limits on time and the lines were really long). That being said. It's been about a week and I haven't heard anything back. I also applied to a bunch of jobs (about 20+) through Handshake. Again, nothing. My worry is that since I'm from a community college, I'm at a disadvantage compared to the students who have attended the 4 year university from the beginning. Where as I have only one internship and project under my belt, my peers seem to have several, either through clubs that were available to them but not to me or internships from the aforementioned career fairs that they've been attending since the beginning of their academic career (my cc didn't have any career fairs). I also talked to a lot of other students while waiting in lines at the career fair, and a lot of them are even grad students working on their master's or PhD's, so I dont know how I can compete. Getting to the point, the career fairs are done for the quarter, and since I didn't get any responses for internships I was hoping to spend this quarter bolstering my resume and preparing to apply for internships next quarter. I've already joined some clubs to learn about AI, web development, and cybersecurity. I'm most interested in internships regarding cybersecurity and software engineering, but honestly I'll take anything at this point. Are there any recommendations you guys have? Either for projects or ways to boost my resume without having an internship? I'd also like to work on my elevator pitch so that way I can be more confident when talking about myself to employers.

I'm currently making $40k and located in Phoenix. I have a few worries as far as my future goes: - I feel out of place. Before getting hired I never had any plans for cybersecuity so this job isn't something I'm exactly passionate about. Even after almost a year in I'm kind of just okay. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing half the time and I feel vastly inferior to those who are really into it and have attended hackathons, gotten multiple certs, etc. Imposter Syndrome is strong on this one. - My pay is only 40k. I know I'm right out of college but from what I've read, most SOCs pay like 60k or more. One my classmates found a developer job for 75k right after graduation. Some older graduates have told me they've doubled their salary within the past few years. And my old professor told me graduating students have a lot more potential than working here. Stuff like that is eating me alive since I'm surviving in a 1 bedroom apartment and struggling to pay my student loans back. My girlfriend is working an advising job at the university for 45k (although she has a master's in higher education). I feel like I undercut myself. But what's sort of keeping me here is that I keep hearing cybersecurity is a good field to be in and its grossly understaffed, and being here kind of puts my foot in the door. My manager wants me to study for certs like Sec+ and all, and it might be easier to just move up in this field than change my career entirety, if you can even call this a career at 10 months in. I dunno man I just want a better paying and more fulfilling job."

I will do anything to work in tech again, but cant convince a company to give me a chance! Ive had great experiences and continued to educate myself. Friends in tech dont understand why Im not landing a job. Peers just think Im not trying. Everyone says to network. Networking, I manage to find no one who can influence hiring and an unbelievable amount of people looking for work. Im a gay male, with zero family obligations, so I am able to relocate within a couple days. I apply for appropriate positions and hear nothing. I have a great interview; nothing. I have a bunch of recruiters contact me; they ghost me. I've spent years being persistent at continuing to learn and landing a job, but now the time gap in my resume is huge. In 2004 I finished a Bachelors in CIS. I spent 2004-13 at a Fortune 50 company, in mainframe app dev and support, PMO and solutions. I completed a bunch of projects building APIs on mainframe apps for web app consumption, so I didnt think the mainframe experience was totally worthless. After a few years, I was leading an entire team of analysts. In 2011 was encouraged by leadership to experience different positions in PM and worked in a client solutions role, to better prepare myself for supervision. In 2013 my position was eliminated after a legal entity sale. I never wanted to leave this company. In hindsight, in 2011, I should have moved to another dev team learning and coding Java. In 2013 I landed a technical process consultant role - pretty much overhead, because projects were failing and they needed help. I had responsibility with zero authority. I was used as a scapegoat by all the long term employees and lasted 2 years before resigning in 2015. I was barred from moving roles. In hindsight, I would have been better off taking advantage of some pretty inappropriate anti-gay remarks made, to get into one of the open tech roles. So, mid 2015, unemployed, I kept applying, learning Python, played with Swift for iOS dev a lot, learned some AWS, more Linux (Ive used Linux since 1998), did odd jobs and drove rideshare. Two years later, I still hadnt landed a tech job. Summer 2017, I decided to attend an in-person CyberSecurity bootcamp. I learned a ton and was extremely motivated after finishing in Feb 2018. I moved to Denver to look for more opportunities. I studied for and passed the AWS Solutions Architect Assoc certification. Ive been applying for positions and networking since. Spring 2019 I spent 10 weeks, 6 days/week learning JavaScript and playing with NodeJS. I did a lot of C++ in college, so JS came to me fast. I enjoy JS, but after 10 weeks I noticed some major hurdles to becoming a dev again. 1) I am not artistically creative, so struggle with cool front-end design to build a great portfolio. 2) At meetups and through networking, I consistently ran into devs who cant find work, so trying to land an entry-level position, seemed futile. 3) I practically begged others to work on projects together, but they had endless excuses why they cant. 4) The \~$14k so for a proper coding bootcamp had a lost of risk! I was accepted into one of the better ones, but was scared away for many reasons. For about the last 5 months, I keep studying for the AWS Security Speciality cert, playing with terraform and learning devops tools. Every job posting wants prior full-time experience in these. What do I do? How do I get just 6 months support or production experience in AWS and sysops or devops? I would absolutely love any cloud engineer, security or sysops type position. Im totally humble and will take any pay offered. I have no problems working 50+ hour weeks or being on call 24x7. A few example positions Id like: [URL The Cloud Technical Account Manager with Amazon would be a dream. (Amazon Job ID 929419) Location wise, I'm floating around now.

Below is my work experiences and hopefully someone can suggest what I should do next? Thanks # Summary of myself and my work experiences : \-Graduated over a decade ago with a computer science degree \-I'm in my late 3x already \-I'm a bit slower than normal people. But once I learned a subject well, I can perform well, as fast or even better than most people. \-Another weakness of me is I can hardly multi-tasks. **A very short IT support experince:** \-First job out of university = An IT Support job(3 months duration). At that time, i was naive, I didn't like the job and quit because I don't like to crawl under desks to fix PCs and making my clothes dirty. I asked myself, why don't I try programming instead where I don't need to do crawl under the desks? **First programming job:** First programming job (4 months) - It was a indie game company using C++. Quit after 4 months cuz my senior told my manager that *""I was learning slower than expected"".* \-Then I change career to a totally different field...years later, I return to IT. This time doing QA **QA - Performance Testing (4 years)** \-Got a QA performance testing job, didn't really like it, but the colleagues were good and stay at this compoany for 4 years...everything seems stable until structural change and whole team got laid off. **Back to programming again:** \-Thinking about programming again, wasted my money on useless bootcamp and end up with a small company doing some programming (SQL stored procedures mainly ). Initially, my senior told me that *""I'm progressing well as expected""*. This is a big confidence boost between this comment and the one i had years ago in that game company. A confidence boost indeed. However, things go bad when my senior left and we start a new project using Javascript to build Android/iOS apps (Not react native, but an older tool) only me as a sole developer and ended up unable to deliver works. So yeah, I left that job after 4 months due to unable to deliver works. **Manual QA** \-Got a QA Manual testing job doing it for couple of years now and hate it to the core. Realize that I seems to hate dealing with business requirements(especially the process of translating it to test cases). I do have opportunities to look at some automation projects including performance testing in this new company. I was shocked to see the complexity of it. It seems what I learned before was just scratching the surface. I feel like all my experiences so far are just scratching the surface, and feel like I'm not qualified to do anything..... \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks for taking your time to read until this. Now below are the next steps/career move that I could think of: # My Next steps/career move: As of today, I will become unemployed soon. (Maybe only few more weeks left for my current manual QA job). And i wonder what I should do next. ***Programming?*** I'm afraid it would end up like before. Getting stuck and unable to deliver on time. I previously asked in this subreddit that if I want to go for programming, then Java or C# Enterprise stack would be more suitable for me due to my age + unable to focus on many things/multi task effectively. ***Freelance Programming:*** This is something I was always envy people. I think bringing your laptop to a coffee shop and work on programming seems like a dream environment compare to working inside an office. Freelancing seems like I'm my own boss and i can use the technology that I want etc...but then I understand that to be a successful in freelancing, it require lots of years of prior experiences and luck. Also maybe I'm just looking at the good side of it and didn't see the bad side of it? For sure, it is not something a beginner programmer like me to be able to do immediately. ***Manual QA/Automation?*** As of this moment, I'm convinced that I'm tired of manual QA, translating requirement to test cases, execution are so tedious and it feels like killing me from the inside out. For Automation? There are rarely any full automation job, usually it is a hybrid of manual/automation. Oh and for my latest two QA jobs, they always told me (You have to do the manual QA first before you do the automation). So screw that! ***Networking/System admin:*** I was immature back then to think that being system admin/it support I have to crawl under desks...I think i wouldn't mind too much about that now if the $$$ is not too bad. It seems it is the only position that I don't really have to deal (or very little) about those nasty business requirements! And with time, I may be able to move up to Cybersecurity roles which is what i think i would interest (I don't know until i really try). ***IT security/Cybersecurity:*** Ultimately, I may want to do something related to the security field. But may not be easy to land a job in IT security without prior experience in networking/system admin first? &amp;#x200B; It was a bumpy ride for my career for my last decade mainly due to I don't have clear goal. I hope this time I can find a clear goal and then working toward it without looking back Please advise as to what career should I choose next? Thanks"

Setting up networks for the control systems, WiFi for clients, troubleshooting network and hardware issues for clients, and remote monitoring using domotz. It doesnt feel like much but I know its at least something to put on my resume. My goal with my career is to work for some organization (A21, Operation Underground Railroad, US government agency, etc.) as cybersecurity or something similar to help take down human trafficking groups and rescue victims. I only recently started getting into computer science and IT so Im still learning quite a lot. No degree yet and getting my first cert next month. Started learning python as well since that seemed most recommended for cybersecurity / pentesting. My basic plan so far is - 1. Get N+ cert and apply to Western Governors University for Cybersecurity(cheap and gets me a ton of certs) 2. Get into entry level pen testing / Cybersecurity job to get experience 3. Apply to anti-human trafficking organization. 4. ??? Not sure since I dont care to move up much as long as it pays enough and I am truly seeing my actions help the people trafficked and bring criminals to justice. Of course Ill be learning as much as I can on my own since I know WGU isnt the most comprehensive course to put it lightly. Planning on adding the Linux+ to the ones I would get from WGU, learn c++, participate in hackathons / practice rounds, teach myself new cyber concepts and tools, learn and practice social engineering, and teach myself more languages concepts. Im just not sure what the best route to go is, wether this will work or if I need to change something / add something. Or if its just a pipe dream. Any help and criticism would be greatly appreciated."

A little background on each: Charles Schwab: Cybersecurity specific position in Austin (IAM ARC team), pay is $26/hr, no relocation assistance which is fine since Im native to Austin, very quick interview process, managers seem nice Fannie Mae: General Software engineering intern program, Plano Office, pay is $30/hr + 1500 signing bonus - loved the recruiter and my interviewer, office looks great Thomson Reuters: General SE and cloud based apps, Carrollton Office, pay is $30/hr + $3500 stipend, company seems good but nothing really clicked regarding the people/work Pay is much less of a factor to me than doing work that I can talk about in future job apps. I am really interested in cybersecurity, but Im not sure if its better to get a General SE development position as an intern so I can go through a structured program Another factor to consider is what the company is like in general, their return offer value, what looks better on a resume, etc. Im leaning towards either Fannie Mae or Charles Schwab but Im really stuck on what to take into account and which company might be a safer option/more value able experience TLDR; General software engineering intern position at Fannie Mae or Thomson Reuters, or cybersecurity internship at Charles Schwab?"

404,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Graduating with a CS degree (concentration in Cybersecurity) in two years and have no idea what I'm supposed to do,0,dr4da5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dr4da5/graduating_with_a_cs_degree_concentration_in/,2019-11-04 05:22:14,"Before I start, I apologize if this post seems rambly. It is the culmination of like a year's worth of questions/concerns that have been floating around in my head. I will try my best to divide the post into sections. **Financial goals** Honestly if it weren't for this section, I probably wouldn't make this post at all. With salaries in CS being pretty high, I understand its hard to go financially wrong. However, in my case, after four years of thinking about this, I still have yet to find a CS career that really excites me. In other words, since I can't really think of a ""dream job"", the thought of working until age 65, even if the pay/work-life balance/culture is good, is not attractive to me at the moment. For that reason, I'm setting a personal goal of retiring early at 45-ish (40 if I can help it). It is possible, that after 5-10 years of working I find something I really like. In that case, no problem, I just cut back on investing a little bit, and enjoy a nice job and good quality of life until age 65. In the worst case scenario, I find nothing I really like. In that case, I have the option to leave the rat race early. Obviously this does create a self-imposed financial restriction that I need to be aware of, and think about when it comes to considering compensation. I calculated that I will need to set aside a bare minimum of $40k a year (with $50k being preferred) in investing to achieve my goals. Before I think about that though, I do need to consider my student loans. Because I have transferred universities (thus having to take extra bullshit gen-ed stuff, and having stuff not transfer because reasons), due to family relocation, by the time I graduate in two years (will be 24 yo then), I will have been at school for six years instead of four. That, and unwise decisions early in my schooling, leaves me a debt that I would wager is above average for CS students. Fortunately my parents are understanding of this and have offered me a sweet deal. Until my debt is paid off, I stay with them for like $400 - $500 a month. Utilities and groceries included. Besides paying off my debt, the only things I would have to worry about are taxes, rent, gas, and personal expenses. That last paragraph was probably unnecessary, but essentially what it means is for the first three years or so after graduation, I'm restricted to the Franklin-Nashville area where my family lives. **My experience as of now** Don't know how important it is to this post, but I'll list what I know anyway. About me: 22 year old junior going for BS in CSC at relatively unknown public university. Overall GPA is about 3.1 at the moment. Languages: Comfortable in C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby. Exposed a little bit to SQL. OS's: Comfortable with Linux (Ubuntu, Mint, Manjaro) as that is my personal OS. Extra-curriculars: I'm active in my school's cybersecurity group. We spend most of our time in extra education, competitions, and some outreach. Competitions: Three years of Cyberpatriot in highschool. Currently in Cyberforce now. Will most likely be doing CCDC next year. Work: One summer as QA intern (wrote and ran tests in C#). Two summers, one December as IT intern at a company's headquarters in Nashville (did support calls for PCs and phones, handled PC and mobile orders, worked on building an asset database, played a major role in O365 migrations) **What should I be doing with internships in the short term?** As I mentioned above, I have interned at a company's HQ in Nashville doing generic IT and support stuff. If nothing else changes, that is likely what I'll be doing again this December and next summer. Work is easy, company culture is decent, and my co-workers and managers are great people. There are, however, a few reasons why I would consider changing next year. \- I get no experience outside of IT \- Pay is not the best at $11/h \- There is little to no opportunity for career/salary growth (lots of things are outsourced). So for next year, I feel like I have three options. \- Keep my internship as-is \- Keep the internship but see about getting higher pay (and accept more responsibilities) \- Look for new internship What would you do in my shoes? **What should I do right after graduation? (until debt gets payed off, roughly three years of time)** The good news about the situation with my parents, is that I can reasonably pay off my debt in three years, and still have excellent quality of life on a $50k - $60k salary. Honestly, this part of my career worries me the least, but I still want to know what would be the wisest thing to do. I see two main options. \- Avoid the stress of entry-level job hunting, and see if the company I intern at now will take me as an IT tech full time. The problem here is I seriously doubt I'd even make $40k, much less $50k - $60k. \- Find an entry level cybersecurity job. This option scares me, as I know jumping into a career field with next to no experience is a pain. **What should I do after my debt gets payed off?** Going off the assumption that my parents will want me out after my debt is payed, combined with the fact that I still want to dedicate a large chunk of my income to investment, I realistically need to be making $70k - $90k at this point. My expectation is that this may not be possible with just three years of work experience. But if it is, what do I need to be doing to work towards this goal. **What should I be doing outside of classes?** So right now I spend a lot of my time with the cybersecurity club I was talking about, and doing competitions as well. The problem is this leaves me with no time for other things (like certifications). Is this a good way to spend my extra time while in school, or do I need to switch things up to be a little more ""career-ready"". **What should I be doing with regards to resumes, networking, career fairs, etc?** As my internships so far have mostly been acquired through familial connections, I have an embarrassingly small about of experience in this area. I have no real idea what I should be doing. The first and only career fair I went to a couple of years ago was an unpleasant experience. I hated being there the moment I stepped in. I hated the atmosphere of dressing over-the-top and waiting in lines just to put on fake smiles while begging for internships at companies. After effort I put in, I got a phone interview with a company who didn't even bother keeping in touch after it was over. Not even a ""sorry we found someone else"". If career fairs really are required these days, I'm happy to suck it up and do it. But I would rather my job hunting be much more efficient than that. The problem is I know nothing about job hunting (including online) outside of career fairs. I also don't have a LinkedIn or anything like that. I'm not much of a social media guy. Is this really needed? Also, what about portfolios? I was recently told I should have one (no one in the four years I've been at college bothered to tell me this). If I'm not going into software development, do I still need one? If so, what on earth do I put in it? **For those that are working in what you would call your dream job, how did you discover that it was your dream job?** I've literally been thinking about this since highschool, and like I said earlier, if I'm being honest with myself, nothing in CSC (or any career for that matter) looks worth spending half my waking life for until age 65. That said, I still want to find that dream job if it exists for me. **How do I make sure I'm ready for interviews?** Because the two companies I've worked for really needed extra hands, interviews for me have literally been just 20 mins of asking some generic personal questions, followed by ""Awesome, you start next Monday"". As such, I have no experience in ""proper"" CS interviews. **Any solid resume templates/tips/tutorials that worked for you?** **While working full time, how much time per week should I aim to spend working on certs? Also, besides the basic CompTIA stuff, what are good certs to get?** **What are some career things you wish you knew, or wish you did, while in college?** **Thanks for reading!**"
405,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Internship advice,0,dr8pw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dr8pw8/internship_advice/,2019-11-04 10:30:26,"I was hoping to get some advice on a few different offers for an internship next summer. I realize that these all are great opportunities and I would be happy with any of them, I just am not sure what is best for me. A little about me, I am a Junior at a really good small engineering school that is only well known within the engineering industry. In high school, I got in with Northrop Grumman's high school internship program and ever since I have been interning with them each summer. I love cybersecurity (particularly the pointy end) and that is the domain I have been working in with Northrop. Because of that, I haven't gotten a lot of your typical software engineering industry experience and was hoping to diversify and get some this summer, but I am worried I may not enjoy it as much or may end up missing the pointy end aspect of what I have done historically. Here are my current offers. **Northrop Grumman** Role: Cyber Software Engineer Intern Pay: $24/hr + $3500 living stipend for the summer Location: Cincinnati, Ohio Description: This is what I know and love but I think I have kind of ruled it out due to my wanting to experience a different workplace before I graduate. **Ceaser Creek Software** Role: Cyber Software Engineer Intern Pay: $30/hr + unspecified living stipend Location: Dayton, Ohio Description: I had a 6-hour interview here and loved everything about it. The work and the people was amazing. It is very similar to the defense contraction I have done at Northrop, it is just a smaller company with more of a family atmosphere. I almost made my mind up after visiting until I received other offers. **MIT Lincoln Labs** Role: Cyber Systems Assesment Group Intern Pay: $24/hr + subsidized housing Location: Lexington, Massachusetts Description: This is really interesting to me because it is what I love (similar to Northrop but more researchy) and it comes with the name MIT Lincoln Labs attached. I have been told that only really matters if I plan to do research or go into academia (which I don't think I do). Also not sure if I would like the more formal work atmosphere (I am used to casual attire and not strict hours). I feel like I would be crazy to pass up the name MIT Lincoln Labs but maybe I put too much weight on it. **Amazon** Role: SDE Pay: $8k/month + $2500/month living stipend Location: Seattle, Washington Description: Opportunities like this are ones CS students dream about. Being an independent self-supporting student money is also a big factor even for internships, and this offer has no lack of it. Also, I feel like having a Big-N on your resume is the type of thing to let you work almost anywhere but I am not sure how true that actually is. Part of the reason I have started looking at other places than just accepting my return offer from Northrop was for the chance to experience something different and this would be that. On the other hand, I have been told the wlb is awfull and while that may not be as true for interns, I am not sure this is a place I would like a ft offer from but I'm guessing that opinion may change if I had one in my hand. I also would not get to pick my team wich kinda sucks because I would still like to do something related to security. On the other hand, **AMAZON!!!** **Microsoft** Role: SWE Pay: \~7.5k/month + $2500/month living stipend Location: Seattle, Washington Description: I haven't actually received an offer yet but I have my onsite soon so I include it just in case. This would probably be about the same as Amazon with a few exceptions. For some reason, I feel like Amazon looks better on a resume because people will know they worked you hard. Also, the pay from Amazon is slightly better and I feel like I would learn a lot more at Amazon, someone tell me I am wrong. The pros are that it seems like Microsoft has a better internship experience and a lot of people get ft offers, which is something I would be more inclined to accept. It's gotten to the point where I have withdrawn my applications from other amazing places because I don't want to make my decision harder. I have also expressed interest in interning in the fall of 2020 as well. Ceaser Creek Software has told me if I join them I can work summer and fall, and I am sure that If I took A different offer for the summer they would let me join them in the fall still. I am kind of curious to explore this option with a number of different internship combos for the summer and fall, just not sure which ones would let me do what. A pro of doing that would be that I would have an extra summer to do another internship in 2021 with the added con of not graduating until fall 2021 instead of spring 2021. I'm sorry for my word vomit, I just was hoping for some other perspectives. Thanks everyone!"

Before getting hired I never had any plans for cybersecuity so this job isn't something I'm exactly passionate about. Even after almost a year in I'm kind of just *okay*. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing half the time and I feel vastly inferior to those who are really into it and have attended hackathons, gotten multiple certs, etc. Imposter Syndrome is strong on this one. - My pay is only 40k.

Some older graduates have told me they've doubled their salary within the past few years. And my old professor told me graduating students have a lot more potential than working here. Stuff like that is eating me alive since I'm surviving in a 1 bedroom apartment and struggling to pay my student loans back. My girlfriend is working an advising job at the university for 45k (although she has a master's in higher education). I feel like I undercut myself. But what's sort of keeping me here is that I keep hearing cybersecurity is a good field to be in and its grossly understaffed, and being here kind of puts my foot in the door. My manager wants me to study for certs like Sec+ and all, and it might be easier to just move up in this field than change my career entirety, if you can even call this a career at 10 months in.

I go to a technical college and lots of people I know make over 30$/hr at their CS related internships but I didnt know how to put a value on myself for the position. I interviewed (phone call) with a company yesterday for a cybersecurity internship. They made it clear that they are looking for someone that knows the basics but is willing to learn more (me), and that they were super excited to talk to me because I was a perfect fit. Then they asked what i was looking for in terms of compensation. Being completely honest I said I wasnt sure (oof). They said if I were to be hired Id make 21$/hr and asked if that was OK, I said yes. I felt like this was a LOT of money considering I make only 11$ /hr at my job at school, but looking back I feel like I shouldve asked for more. Im moving on in the interview process and the next step is a video interview with no technical questions. If I should negotiate, should it be before I receive an offer (if I do) or should I wait to see what the official offer is?"

I hope yall having a great day. So Im a high school senior and my story started when i first take my coding classes in high school and then i loved it. This year Im taking a cyber security class and im enjoying it. I definitely wanna go for cyber security but im kinda undecided about what to do for next year/college. I was surfing on web and i saw that University of Texas is offering coding and cyber security boot camps. I was thinking about not going to college next year instead taking a gap year and going to bootcamps try to get some certificates so i can get a part time job while im going to start college next year. So my question is if i take a gap year and go to bootcamps can i get a part time or full time job on cyber security? Or should i just start college without dealing with all that stuff? Im also thinking financially too if i can get a entry-level cybersecurity job i can pay for my college and my rent all that stuff. Thank you!

I'll try to keep this short. I'm also not sure if this is more suited to /r/findapath, but I do think I want to come back to CS. I graduated with a CS degree in 2014 with about 1.5 years of CS internship experience. After, I spent two years working at the student newspaper as the tech/digital communications person because it was fun and paid enough. In 2016, I got a job as a junior software dev (Java (spring), Android Apps, etc.). I burnt out hard when they made me sole developer on a Visual Basic spaghetti-code nightmare, and ended up quitting after 8 months with hardcore depression and an anxiety attack that landed me in the hospital on morphine (the only anxiety attack I've had in my life). I spent about 8 more months unemployed before going back to school for an MA. I transitioned to a woman sometime around here, which has honestly put everything back on track mentally; just mentioning this since that might affect the job hunt, although hopefully not too much? I'm currently finishing a Master of Arts unrelated to CS and will be done in just under a year. It's a very qualitative MA on travel, photography, etc. that uses Foucauldian theories of surveillance. I find it interesting and am personally glad I did it, but I don't know how this will look to hiring committees. When I'm done, it will be ~3.5 years since I worked in CS. My previous employer was understandably not happy when I quit, so I have no CS references. I'm currently working part-time customer service in the digital service centre of a library, but that's not exactly CS. What I'm now wondering (and starting to worry about) is how to get back into the workforce. I've acquired a ton of soft skills, writing experience, and have a bunch of multimedia experience; basically, I could probably find a job in communications and would find it fulfilling. But I also really enjoy working with computers, technology, etc. I really miss it. I'm considering trying to leverage all this into the cybersecurity field. My rough plan is to do a bunch of certifications (Security+? CISSP? whatever companies in my area are seeking?), some Capture the Flags, learning, and then trying to get a job in that field when I graduate. Does that seem at all realistic? Or does it seem a bit hopeless? Does anyone have better advice? Thank you so much."

All of the local Masters in Cyber\*\*\* degrees seem to be not particularly helpful. They seem to be really designed to give cyber level knowledge to IT or non-cyber bachelors holders. Getting that kind of degree seems to be largely a waste. What are other ""non"" cyber paths in the graduate realm that would be helpful Mid/Late career?

441,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Does cybersecurity engineers really earn more than software developers on avarange?,0,crqopj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/crqopj/does_cybersecurity_engineers_really_earn_more/,2019-08-18 05:25:44,"Hey All This question is bugging my head. For me, logicaly software developers should earn more. Cybersecurity is something that ""protects"" software, thus cybersecurity engineers will be always ""behind"" someone who create software. If you think about it, if there would be no software, there would be no cybersecurity. Also cybersecurity is only needed, becasue of human destructive behavior. As Lem once said, if human can break something, they will do it. It dosn't evolve us, it dosn't help human race to become better or more advanced like programming can, its just ""required"" because of our nature. This also brings me to conlusion companies threat cybersecurity as ""unwelcome expences"", they dont have a choice. Secuirty engineers wont bring them money, they will help them not loose it. Software engineering on other hand can create a resolution, that will start flowing money into company pocket. So lets talk about skills required. And please be aware im not talking about hi-end 10% here. Im not talking about security engineers that have hardcore skills in field like reverse engineering, programming(any flavor but especcialy low level, C, assembly ), cryptography, and advanced forensics. These are 10% out there that really deserve tons of money, because their skills are very hard to learn, and require time and dedication. To compare with software engineering world this would be software developers that know multiple languages and technologies, but also is great in mathematics and can create solution based on his vast knowledge. We are talking avarange here, and believe me i know how it looks in corporation because i work in one. Big corps this days have those large Cybersecurity teams, and because of demand they employ almost anyone. Cybersecurity use to be field where you needed a lot of experience in administration, networking and programming to even get into. But this days they employ people right after collegue, without any previous IT experience, they teach them how to install kali linux and use metasploit. You can take someone from street and teach him how to run exploit or break WPA2 in one week. Also this fields seems ""fun"" and exciting, because what's bad it is cool. Lots of kids dream to become hacker. But not so many dream about becoming programmer, which can be daunting and less exciting in many areas. So naturally there will be more people taking ""easy and exciting"" road. On other hand if we talk about programming, this skill requires some decent time just to learn one language. And having this knowledge dosn't even make you a software developer, you need to learn frameworks, software design, patterns and algorithms. Takes time and good dedication. &amp;#x200B; So to finish this lenghty post, i think cybersecurity is overhyped by media, and i don't believe avarange security enginners earn as much as developers. And you probably think im some programmer wanna be that hates on cybersec. But truth is the exact opposite. I would love to get into cybersecurity becasue its something that always interested me as many of us. But i dont want to invest time and money into something that will bring me less money, than something that interest me adequatly and can bring me good income. &amp;#x200B; Sorry for bad english, i tried my best."

While we were originally hired to work as a team, I was asked to take over an entry-level cyber analyst who was about to leave, since apparently I was the only person with some exposure to cybersecurity. The 5 of them were immediately placed on a software project while I was asked to shadow the cyber analyst. I quickly learned that the cyber analyst was only with the company for 3 months, so he was able to provide an overview of his entire accomplishments within a single afternoon. Considering he only provided penetration testing the entire time that he was there, he was also unable to disclose much of his results, since the information is sensitive to the vulnerabilities that the company has. With no experience within this task, I was asked to continue penetration testing where the previous cyber analyst left off. The issue is, given that I have never performed penetration testing before, I have no idea what to do. Since my boss is not comfortable with sharing me the documented work that the cyber analyst has performed, I have no idea what I should or should not be tackling. Lastly, given that the company has no security procedure put in place, I feel like there are bigger issues that I should be addressing first. To top it off, I was just asked to take charge of insuring that our company meets the NIST 800-171 requirements and that the company wants those standards to be put up in 2 weeks. I never heard of these requirements until the end of last week, however given everything that needs to be tackled, I do not think that I have the experience or capabilities to make such changes within the company. I was hired as an entry-level software engineer, but my role was changed to a cyber analyst role that I have no experience in and I am not sure how to make the most of it."

To give a bit of context about my situation: I'm a recent gratuate in their mid-late 20s and I have nearly one year of experience in RPA (robotic process automation). I finished a Masters degree last year from one of the top 10 Unis in the UK with a Merit doing Computer Science. It was a conversion which basically taught me some pretty fundamental things about programming, networks, OS, cybersecurity etc. Since finishing I've been hired at a good company (a consultancy) at a fairly decent wage for the midlands. I have now had a few projects in my unit and I am considered one of the best developers on the team because of all the work and effort I put into my role (#humblebrag, but has relevance). I have recently completed a very exhausting project and came back to my home base and I honestly feel like I've had enough of RPA and I need a change. I was taught in Java during my studies and created a complex program on Windows which makes use of concurrency, multi threading, databases and socket programming... and I really miss that! As a result, I have taken up learning Python at work when I'm free/in my spare time and I am thus far ...LOVING IT! In RPA you use programs like UIPath, Blueprism that basically do everything for you and you can honestly do them for a couple of weeks before fully mastering them.. needless to say the challenge is not as grand as you would expect in CS. I've had a bit of a dilemma on whether to spread my wings and look at opportunities in London/somewhere else in the midlands that involves a lot more free coding. As a plan in my head I wanted to: 1. Learn Python to a degree where I can use it professionally. 2. Apply to a developer role which has a direct exposure to it (I have a good knowledge base of git, JIRA, AWS, azure, terraform, docker, regex, SQL and Java). 3. Eventually look at going for the golden opportunities in the fintechs in London. But, I had a conversation with the lead architect in my unit who apparently has a very high opinion of me due to above reasons and suggested that I may be fast tracked towards our company architects programme within 1.5 - 2 years. Most of the top tier senior management in my company stem from architect roles and as far as I can see, experience as an architect can lead to some pretty high yielding jobs (VPs, CTOs etc.). I am completely lost on what to do with myself. I need some perspective/guidance on how to look at this situation, as I feel like I'm at an impasse. Does anyone have any advice at all on this/gone/going through something similar? I have very ambitious career aspirations and money is obviously a good motivator, but I am more so happy taking on the big challenges and problem solving to my heart's delight. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time reading this."

Im sure pretty much everyone here would rather scroll on to another more interesting post since guessing from the title, its another sob story about how I dont feel good enough and youre right, I suppose. I wanted to seek advice and feedback on a couple issues so Ill try and keep this post as concise as possible so youre not clawing out your eyes by the end of it. When I was about eight or nine years old, Ive gained a consistent interest in computers. I was never the sporty type, and even now you wont catch me running a marathon, but I always felt comfortable with technology. This developed during my school years where I took up a programming club and home hobby developing websites. I even wrote a CV at twelve. My younger self was aspirational and ahead of the game. I was eager to learn about HTML, CSS and Javascript. (I was a bit of a show-off too at the time, I was called to the front of the class multiple times because I was the star student, but thats beside my point) It felt great and since then I basically tunnel visioned this career path. This is what I thought programming was all about, creating and structuring designs and concepts; after all, my only experience with programming was web development. Fast forward to college (UK, age 16) where I moved onto a Computer Science course. This is where I was theoretically hit with a ton of bricks. It was september two years ago in a class where I knew nobody and whats this? Variables? Stored values? Arithmetic? Nested if loops? For loops? Binary calculations and database manipulation? SQL? All of this information was dumped on my head and when we were given our first task in C#, to create a cash register system, I lost all confidence in myself to the point where I cried myself to sleep practically every night because everyone around me picked up the task so easily. It felt like I had been wrapped in a blanket of false security then boom, Im exposed to the true nature of computing. Turns out everyone in that class had done Computer Science at school, and my private education sheltered arse didnt. It was just IT, and featured excel spreadsheets, macros and web design at most. It was so bad that my teacher even took pseudocode for granted, and I went about two months until I finally figured out what it meant. The first few months of college were some of the most pressuring, difficult months Id ever experienced. I was filled with regret and uncertainty, weighing my options thinking computing is not for me. I even considered picking up English Literature instead because I had a decent amount of creative writing talent. Im sure you dont want to hear anymore about that tragedy. Long story short I received my A-Level results a few days ago and I got a D. Alongside Computer Science, I also took IT Programming, which I received a Distinction\*, and Maths to which I received a B. Astonishingly, I received my University Computing course offer which required ABD\*. Im overjoyed that I get to start the next step in my life in twenty nine days except now Im doubting my ability to start a four year computing course at university. I enjoy programming a lot. It was my hobby for practically a decade of my life. The only problem is Ive never touched a raspberry pi like my friends have and Ive never rebooted a different OS like my friends have and Ive never built my own PC like my friends have. You get the point. Some of the things talked about on this sub is like another language, and the whole field of technology suddenly seems so overwhelming that, despite it being a huge aspiration to be working a back-end programming job where I can work a development project with a group of people, now I feel Id be the most useless in that group of people. I dont know what to do. I havent done any programming all summer because I dont know where to start. Ive tried multiple websites in the past, such as CodeCademy, except now most of it is locked behind a paywall. Ive bought books such as a raspberry pi tutorial, but I havent bought one yet because its quite an investment for something I might not be able to figure out. I havent booted Ubuntu in fear I might wreck my laptop in the BIOS somehow. Im too afraid to build a PC in fear something will go wrong or I break a component with static or something. Im so nervous about starting a project in Python and coming across a bug I dont know how to fix, and ultimately giving up. Im unsure where to find potential resources to improve my programming, and just to top the icing on the cake, now Im anxious the last nine years of my life have all been for nothing. I wish I could be like some of my friends and be a tech wizard; I just heard he bought all components to build a new rig, and that he passed his exams with flying colours to go on to do cybersecurity. The other day, he was talking about how he couldnt get hid DDOS or MRAM or AKBFL23564FDSLK to work and its all gibberish. I feel so inferior. Im sorry this was so lengthy. Its 2am here and Im rambling. Im not even sure if anyone here can help or even if theyd want to give advice, but consulting reddit was the best idea I had come up with. Thanks for reading."

Is it easy to transition from a programming job into another similar job(system administration, cybersecurity) or will you have to specialize in a field? 3. The admission averages for some nearby universities are kinda daunting.

I'm going to be a HS Senior applying to several top CS programs. I've been heavily involved in programming and cybersecurity competitions throughout high school and have also done research for a few computer science professors. I'm dead set on doing CS and have 100% enjoyed every class and activity I've done related to it. My college application list (in roughly ascending order of prestige/difficulty) includes Northeastern, UMD, UMichigan, Georgia Tech, Cornell, UIUC, Harvey Mudd, Carnegie Mellon, and MIT. **My main questions are** **1. How much of an advantage do the very top schools (MIT, Carnegie, Mudd) offer over other top choices (and also, what are those advantages)?** **2. Would these advantages outweigh the disadvantage of the amount of student debt incurred?** As of now, I'm considering sending an Early Decision application to Harvey Mudd (a school I'm interested in based on its extensive humanities curriculum, research opportunity, social culture, and quality of education), meaning that I would have a significantly higher chance of getting in but would have to attend Mudd if I got in. The cost of Mudd per year for me (according to their net price calculator) would be 20K/year + flights to and from CA. My counselor though believes that I could get scholarships (possibly even full rides if I'm lucky) to Northeastern and UMD. I'm wondering if it would be a bad idea to throw away the chance of being debt free for a better chance at a top school. I heard that many CS internships pay well (up to 10K a month), and could possibly help me minimize my student debt if I were to go to Mudd or another school. But also, I question the advantages that the very elite schools offer over other great schools. I know amazing students that went to both UMD and Northeastern, and heard that many top tech companies recruit out of both schools. Additionally, if I were to pursue a master's degree (which is likely given how much I like CS), I heard the name of the undergraduate school becomes a lot more useless and any graduate acceptances I receive will reflect my success at the schools rather than the schools themselves. Basically, Is a full ride scholarship at a T20 school any better worse than incurring debt for a T5 school?"

I also have a tutoring job lined up next semester tutoring a Python software class.

So now I have the option of going to the legendary ""UTCS."" However, their GPA system works differently therefore I most likely will not be maintaining my 4.0. I could get another tutoring job for a software class but it would have to wait until my sophomore spring semester. So stay at A&amp;M or go to UT Austin? I talk about GPA and the other things because I really would like an internship for my sophomore summer. I'm afraid if I transfer to UT Austin I won't be able to get one as I won't really have anything under my belt. Regardless of which decision I choose, I should have 1-3 programs finished on GitHub before I even start applying to those internships, so those should help as well. Also, I want to go to UT, but it's not like i hate A&amp;M. They're both great, obviously UT is more established and recognized in the CS world, however I always hear it doesn't even matter. If I could see into the future, and see which option would better help me get internship I would obviously choose that option. I know they're both really great, but which seems... better? I guess?

Not looking for a conventional engineer career.,0,c0nupx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c0nupx/what_can_i_do_with_my_skillset_not_looking_for_a/,2019-06-15 04:57:24,"Hi r/cscareerquestions, *What I have:* I am a 4th year going into 5th year in a mediocre university in California. My GPA is steadily floating around (read: below) 2.5, which I don't really care about, however most of my CS classes seem to show A's and B's on the transcript. Before, I have dreamt about being a Rails engineer. I took up online courses, made a few tiny websites (one of them is still afloat) that get 2-3 visitors a month. In 2017 I even completed 2 internships, both of which were at startups, and I have letters of recommendation from there. After that, I have received a multitude of ""we have decided to move forward with another candidate"" emails, which has kinda depressed me. Then, I suddenly realized that I don't want to be a software engineer anymore. It's tedious work, and despite the fact that I am not that bad at it, I just don't want to do it. I just don't want to sit in front of a computer all day, it's depressing. I took an IoT class last semester that has really inspired me to build little arduino mechanisms that make my daily life easier. On top of that, I figured that working with my hands is quite fun. I also started digging into fungal biology, which is just an interest that can be developed into something. In addition, I authored a paper in cybersecurity which has been accepted for publishing. *What I am looking for:* I like to build things physically, and coding something up for them is never a problem. I am interested in setting up and performing experiments, collecting data and analyzing it. I like working closely with other people, not by myself. I like stuff that is built to help humanity/socioeconomics. I need mentorship, someone to follow. Ideally I see myself as a #2 person in a company that does stuff like **Google Project Loon** or so. I can do both/either tech and/or *visionary* &gt;!what a terrible word!&lt; work and/or managing. I'm more interested in the final product that I/We deliver, rather than details of implementation (but these are important, too). I also like making the v0.1 of the product. Such as an MVP for a web service, prototypes of different kinds, proof of concept things, etc. *What's wrong with me:* Sometimes, I'm not the nicest person: I can forget to follow up with your email, say thank you, wish you a happy birthday, or ask how your day went. If left alone, I can easily steer away from work I'm doing to something more interesting at the moment or social. I am generally reserved, but if I let myself loose, I talk quite a lot, and sometimes might subconsciously troll, which isn't really nice. This can impact my career growth ambitions. I can't work a 9-5, having a flexible schedule is a necessity. Despite that, I am easily available for meetings/doing stuff with other people between 12 and 6. In 21st century, I'm an analog person. I like writing with a pen on a piece of paper, printed photos, etc. Facetiming feels like torture, online meetings (through hangouts, skype, etc) are ultimately boring and seem unproductive to me. I lack skills in sales, negotiations (both of which is something I'm passively trying to fix &gt;!meaning I consciously understand the problem!&lt;) and understanding certain business ethics. *Notes:* I am an international student on a visa. I don't have a problem with looking for a job anywhere in the world, but I am familiar with California culture and am comfortable with English, so I'd ideally look for something in San Francisco. The issue with that is that getting an H1B isn't the easiest as of right now, and I am not fully ready for an O-1. I can't say I got in with the wrong crowd completely, but *most* of my school friends are meatheads, and size of my network is close to 0. &amp;#x200B; ***My Questions to you:*** *What career path can I pursue with that?* *What could be my entry-level job?* Please name a position. *How do I find mentorship?* I need someone to look up to. *How fast can I grow?* Money is an issue, as I'd like to repay my debt as soon as possible, and start investing into stuff. I also want to get to the #2 position as fast as possible, as it's the most comfortable place for me. *What are the companies that do things that I'd seem to like?* Based on what I've mentioned above. *When should I start applying for jobs to start in June 2020?* I don't want to apply right now, and then tell prospective employers I'm not going to start until like 6 months from now. *What are good sites to find jobs?* Besides famous linkedin, indeed, glassdoor, [angel.co](URL etc. *Is there still freedom of speech and ability to influence product in big companies that support H1B workers?* AFAIK Google won't let you talk shit in company chats anymore, and they are quite strict about it :( *Is it possible for a fairly small company to get you and H1B? Can I relatively easily switch companies if I don't like the direction where things are going?* &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR:** Senior in US college thinking about a career path. International student. *Skills:* Research, programming in multiple languages (C++, Ruby, Python, Java, Go, etc), arduino engineering skills, prototyping, anything a CS graduate is expected to know (*according to university description*), communication (both written and verbal). On top of that I can learn anything within a reasonable period of time if that's a requirement. *Achievements/experience:* 2 Ruby on Rails internships (+recommendations), a paper in IoT cybersecurity, multiple ridiculously small-but-useful side projects. Almost complete undergrad degree in CS. *Interests:* IoT, smart mechanisms from electric cars to robots, mycology (fungal biology), web, markets, natural sciences. *What I want:* \#2 position in a product-oriented team. Balance between computer and hands-on work. Preferably I'd do something that helps humanity. Alternatively, I could pursue a career in science, combining, e.g., biology and CS. High pay, obviously. *Restrictions:* Flexible schedule, no remote work. I have little to no network. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Thank you!"

Previously I worked in digital marketing for 5 years with a lot of big national and international brands but I didnt really keep a portfolio or anything so a lot of that information is either just lost or in my head somewhere. Fast-forward to now, been out of work for almost 5 years. Needed to get my mental health in order to deal with monsters from my colorful childhood littered with adversity. Worked odd jobs part-time every now and then as my boyfriend graciously let me live with him. He moves around a lot for work, so it was difficult for me to even try and reestablish my career. During this time I did attempt to get a masters in cybersecurity and Im 3 classes short with a 3.9 but I really didnt like the program and broke down from the pressure I put on myself (Im more put together now). The program was also lackluster and I did not feel I was actually learning anything useful and panicked about the idea of being wholly unprepared for any jobs I would get via that degree. It was all theoretical with barely any applied knowledge, Mental health is back on track and Im ready to take on a new career. Three issues though: How do I make these five years not look bad? I dont want to admit the reality (that I was mentally shattered and bouncing around the country) but have no idea how else to frame it. I managed an assistantship for a semester somewhere in there if that makes a difference. Boyfriend wants to move to Quebec to get a degree, so Im looking to re-establish myself there because were planning on staying after graduation and working there. We are both US citizens so I know it has to be done right and per Quebecs immigration rules. I personally speak French so language isnt an issue. In pursuing a career in CS, which would be the best option? I already have a liberal arts bachelors and was self-taught in SEO/SEM/Social media marketing/Web analytics/HTML/CSS/PHP/etc. -Online BA in Comp Sci from a state university (in-state tuition would be granted) -Online AS in Web Dev w/ a computer programming cert (C++, C#, Java). This one intrigues me because it is more practical knowledge, less theoretical, and at a community college so even cheaper than option 1 -Comp Sci Graduate Diploma in Quebec (international student tuition rates $$$$$$$) Im not as familiar with the weight of graduate diplomas and Ive done a few searches on Indeed and only a few mentions it. Ultimately, I want to start out in data analytics and move into data sci and ML. If there are any other programs youd recommend in Quebec or otherwise, Im open to suggestions. TLDR: Out of work for five years due to mental health issues. How to frame time unemployed without sounding sketchy? Which degree should I get? How do I make Quebec want me as a worker so that I can get to permanent residency status eventually?"

No hard feelings will be held. I recently moved to Florida to pursue a pilot program at Embry Riddle using my G.i. Bill. However, after discovering the costs of the training at this institution and all the other training programs available in the area to become a pilot, they all seem a bit unreasonable/impossible due to costs to get started. This leads me to try and pursue my back up plan. I've always had an interest in cybersecurity and computer science since my deployment in the middle east. Everyday I was constantly asking questions to our hired contractors that had computer jobs over there and it was fascinating to me the work that they did. Which led me to work a rewarding I.T. support/helpdesk role for over a year. As you can imagine I'm a little bit bummed out about not being able to pursue my pilot goal. Which is why I'm seeking advice on my back up plan to gain some re assurance about the positive life this could lead to. I'm hoping to gain more information on what kind of doors a Cyber security degree while minoring in computer science could open. Also would like to hear how this career outlook would line up compared to being a pilot. I know that is a tough question to ask since you may not know much about aviation. I'm working on getting into Stetson University for this program seeing it looks like the only reputable school in the Daytona Beach area. I have listed some general questions below. What's the possibility of working in a gaming company, government, or from home? How difficult is it to find work holding a degree such as this especially in California or somewhere similar? What is your least favorite part of working in this field if you do work in it? What's the most enjoyable aspect of your career? Is the work to life ratio okay? Any jobs that would require travel? Can you offer any advice or tips to help throughout my studies? I plan to approach this very professional and serious. I appreciate any feedback good or bad. I'll also add any information if you need. Thank you for your time reading this and I look forward to any responses."

I just graduated with a bioengineering degree last May, with a good GPA (3.87). I've always said I wanted to be a doctor. But, I look at the path ahead and I cannot say I want to sacrifice the years and endure the toxic lifestyle that medical school and residency (and potentially beyond) will bring. I realize now that i want to make a difference in someone's life, and I can accomplish this by continuing to be involved as an EMT/eventual paramedic. Thinking of a different career path is really, really new territory. My biggest regret in college is not allowing myself to try out any other potential careers other than medicine. I took one mandatory introductory CS class in college (Python based), and I absolutely loved it. I also took a Matlab based course, which I know doesn't really count for much. Anyways. I know what I want: and that is to work towards a simple family life. I want to be there for my family after a simple 9-5 job that I like. I don't want to start todo that in my mid 30's with longer hours, if I continue with the path of medicine. I want to work, and be able to provide sooner than later. I consider myself able to learn quickly, but with programming just being so vast, I don't know where to begin to try out and see if I really enjoy it as a potential career. Cybersecurity sounds really, really cool. But also, so does web design. I don't even know just yet. So, that brings me here. Am I employable with an engineering degree, if I get started with coding on my own (and have my own mini-projects)? Where do I begin? What websites/classes/tutorials should I consider, to at least get some **direction** of where to go next? Or if this is really something I could enjoy doing? Thanks for your time.

At the time I was also a finance and business major in college. I started working at an MSP focused on high end clients as a junior sysadmin from the start, and had a focus in Windows and VMware. At the time I was only making $30k/year. Transitioned to another MSP and did project work, which gave me a lot more experience with scoping, networking, overhauls, etc. I currently work as a sysadmin(making $85k/year) on a small team, overseeing Windows, VMware, and networking infrastructure, with a little Linux thrown in. I've got decent experience with Linux, some background in scripting(powershell), some self taught programming from years ago when I was a teenager (BASIC, very, very little C++/Java), and some exposure to BASH. In the last 2.5 years, I've completed a B.S. in IT, earned a slew of certs, gained a ton of relevant on-prem experience, and am about 20% through an M.S. in Cybersecurity. **Currently:** I realized I have sort of hit a self-imposed wall. I didn't want to learn much about the cloud because I didn't really understand it. I was comfortable with my on-prem VMware stuff, and wasn't interested in leaving that comfort zone, which is very abnormal for me. While I could continue moving up in the sysadmin world, it's not incredibly interesting for me, and I can see that future pay raises are going to be much more difficult and will hit a ceiling sooner than I would like. In the last few months, I've done a ton of research about DevOps, and that's the path I want to go down. I want to get way more involved in Linux, automation, cloud, and how they all relate to business. Business is another love of mine, and my background gives me more knowledge about it than most people who work in IT. I've already started studying for AWS certs, and will be sitting for the Architect Associate cert sometime this week or next. I already know I need to learn Python, and know the general CI/CD tools that I need to look into. What I'm not certain about is a focus for moving forward. I'm looking to maximize financial gains in both the short term and the long term. I'm willing to work more than 40 hours a week for the next couple years, and already do with the M.S. and studying for certs on top of full-time employment. Something I cannot do is travel often(&gt;\~10-15%), I'm married with kids. **The two primary things I'm considering at this time are:** 1) Try and get into cloud consulting. I'm expecting this would be things like solutions architect, pre-sales, project implementation, etc 2) Stay more in the DevOps pipeline, focus more on Linux and CI/CD. I would expect this would be a more traditional job at a company, as opposed to project work with other companies. I'm hoping to get some suggestions about which path will be easier/quicker to transition into, as well as which is likely to consistently pay better/provide better opportunities. Any suggestions are welcome, as are quippy insults."
518,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,"Undergrad not in CS, just graduated, strongly considering no prev. exp. Masters in CS for career?",4,camcjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/camcjs/undergrad_not_in_cs_just_graduated_strongly/,2019-07-09 01:18:23,"I just recently graduated from my undergraduate BSc. in Bio-medical sciences in June. I always knew I would have to do a Masters, but now I'm not feeling like science is best for my future aspirations and careers. The jobs are just so limited and all require PhD for decent pay. I'm $20k in debt and feel like I can't do much with this degree. I've always enjoyed tech &amp; computers, and have taken a couple programming classes in C++ a couple years back. Now my question is, I'm considering doing a no-CS background, online Master degree in Computer science (Debating between straight CS or Data Analytics specialization). With no previous work experience in CS, or an undergrad in CS, would it be worth it for me to do an MSc. in Computer Science right after graduating? Would I be able to land a job? I live in Ontario, Canada and there are tons of CS jobs where I'm located. I just don't want to waste another $10k on a degree if I can't get a job with it! I'm leaning towards the MSc Computer Science with Data Analytics option. All the science jobs I see require tons of experience and grad degrees publications. But CS job postings I see usually don't state any experience required, they just state the languages and software you need to know. There is also a Cybersecurity option but I don't think there are as many job options with that. I've looked around at the job market and broad CS/Data seems better for a job VS narrowing to Cybersecurity. Basically the goal is: Just graduated BSc. in June-&gt; Start CS Master's in Sept -&gt; (Degrees says 2 years part time, but I'd like to finish in 16 months or less, full-time) -&gt; Graduate MSc. Computer Sci,and find first CS/Data job with no previous CS work experience. Feasible/Worth the investment ($ &amp; time)? Thanks for you thoughts!"
519,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Are LeetCode &amp; CtCI required for non-SWE jobs?,0,bmtbdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bmtbdv/are_leetcode_ctci_required_for_nonswe_jobs/,2019-05-10 13:23:22,"Sorry for the long post. I have a BS in chemical engineering with a concentration in biology (molecular biology and biochemistry), and am now pursuing my MS in computer science after having completed a fellowship in a biomedical research lab doing bioinformatics-type work. I've also completed an internship as a project engineer in the manufacturing industry prior to that. I come from a major city in the southern part of the USA. Now I'm attending university in a major city on the west coast of the USA, and the tech industry here is very different. All my classmates are talking about grinding LeetCode problems and reading *Cracking the Coding Interview* (*CtCI*) so they can get to work in one of the major tech companies in this part of the USA (Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.). I'd never even heard of LeetCode or *CtCI* before pursuing computer science on the west coast. It all seems so bizarre, having to do this much prep work just for a shot at an internship at one of these companies. I didn't have to do this much when I was seeking work as a chemical engineer... Regardless, I picked up a copy of *CtCI*, and have started reading it and working through it. I've also started working LeetCode problems, slowly. I've done both of these just because other people are doing them. Everyone with a CS background seems to just be gunning for software developer positions, and apparently LeetCode and *CtCI* is what's required to get one. So if everyone else is doing it, I guess I'll do it too, right? But the thing is, I'm apathetic about a job/career as a generic software developer. I'm tepid about writing code; sometimes it's fun, and other times it's not. I'm not ""passionate"" enough that I have side projects outside of work. I don't care much for the ""geek"" and ""tech"" culture that seems prevalent at the major tech companies here. And I especially don't want to live on the west coast! (I don't like it here!) The only two ""areas"" of CS I'm interested in are bioinformatics (think biomedical research with some programming/tech mixed in), and cybersecurity (e.g. malware analysis). **But I'm unsure of what to do to get those kinds of jobs.** I have an idea of what I want, but I don't know how to get there. **I'm wondering if reading *CtCI* and working LeetCode is the best use of my time.** * Do interviewers for those roles ask LeetCode and *CtCI* questions? * Should I still grind LeetCode and read *CtCI* if I want to land a job as a bioinformatics scientist (or data scientist)? What about a job relating more towards security? * How do I prep for those types of jobs interviews? * Is there a LeetCode or *CtCI* equivalent for bioinformatics or cybersecurity? I know it's a lot of questions, but I feel like I'm in unfamiliar territory here. Chemical engineering was simple; you go to school, get an internship (or multiple), graduate, then go to work for the company you interned at (most likely). There were no outside side projects to do, no whiteboard questions, or any extra studying involved (other than the FE exam). But these tech jobs seem different, and **I'm wondering how best to prepare for CS jobs that aren't software development** (if there even **is** any special preparation required)."
520,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Get B.A.S. from community college or transfer to university?,3,bo1l6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bo1l6h/get_bas_from_community_college_or_transfer_to/,2019-05-13 20:08:23,My cc offers a B.A.S. in technology development and management with subplans in the following: Data analytics Cybersecurity Project management Software development It also has a guaranteed transfer agreement with a local university for a B.S. in Information Systems Management. It also has a CS AA transfer plan. My current plan is to transfer to an in state university for a CS degree. Just wondering if any hiring managers could weigh in. Is a bachelor's in CS (or Information systems management?) from a university much more preferable to the B.A.S. from the cc? Or does just having a degree check the box and everything else comes down to portfolio and networking etc. Is it worth transferring? The difference in price is almost negligible (~1k) but the local university isn't necessarily known for CS or too highly ranked. An6 advice would be greatly appreciated!

527,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,100 pieces of advice I wish I had been given when starting my career as a software developer 20 years ago,919,bu84u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bu84u7/100_pieces_of_advice_i_wish_i_had_been_given_when/,2019-05-29 10:54:29,"I found this subreddit a few months back because people were linking to my work on ""[How to Deal with Difficult People on Software Projects](URL in comments, and I saw the inbound link traffic in my server logs. When I first discovered cscareerquestions, I spent about three days answering questions before I gave up because there were too many questions to respond to, and I was starting to sacrifice quality for quantity. &amp;#x200B; I made a mental note to return to this sub and try to do something to answer as many potential questions as I could. Now that I've finished [my follow-on project to How-to-Deal](URL I had some free time to work on the following list that attempts to consolidate all the advice I would have liked to have given to the hundreds of career questions that are being asked here every day: &amp;#x200B; 1. **Make smart life choices**  You don't want to wake up one day as an old person full of regrets. If you have a chance to do something bold, daring, unexpected, and scary do it if you think not doing it will weigh on you for the rest of your life. 2. **Teach yourself to teach yourself**  All formal education does it get you to the starting line of your career. To win the race, you have to upgrade your knowledge and skills continually. To do that, you need to be continually learning new things; and to do that, you need to learn how to learn anything you want to learn. 3. **Find a software architecture mentor**  Learning to code is easy. Software architecture is a difficult skill to develop and having an experienced architect to mentor you will help immensely. Just make sure the architect is an actual architect and not just someone with an architect title. 4. **Find a business mentor**  Software developers generally are miserable at understanding what makes a business work. You can read all the books in the world, but having someone non-technical with a lot of business experience help guide your career will not only help you avoid a bunch of easily-avoidable pitfalls, but will most likely make sure you end up making a lot more money that you would have otherwise. 5. **Keep the salespeople happy**  If the product you are working on has a sales team, then make sure those salespeople are always happy with you. Salespeople are paid to talk and if they like you, they will talk to everyone about how much they like you; if they don't like you, they will make sure everyone knows how much they don't like you. 6. **Study, learn, and master communication**  The most valuable skill in your career is communication, your ability to code comes second. If you don't know how to listen and understand other people, as well as how to get other people to listen to you, your career is going to be stuck in neutral. 7. **Learn to negotiate**  Whether is negotiating deadlines, requirements, or compensation; your skills at negotiation will be invaluable for your entire career. 8. **Don't leave money on the table**  When negotiating a job offer, make sure that you get the maximum budget they allocated for that position. You never want them to celebrate hiring you with, ""Wow, we got them cheap!"" 9. **Develop a good handshake**  Developing a good handshake takes practice but can be learned quickly. Once you meet someone with a good handshake, take that opportunity right there and then, and ask them to teach you that handshake. Your handshake is one of the first impressions people have of you, and if it's a dead fish they will assume you lack confidence. 10. **Look people in the eye**  When you are talking to someone, or they are talking to you, make eye contact. Most communication is non-verbal, and you don't want to be looking somewhere else when they communicate something important non-verbally. 11. **Speak assertively**  Be open, honest, direct and respectful in all of your communication; if you are, you can say anything to anyone. 12. **Avoid offending people if possible**  If it is possible to say what you need to say effectively without offending someone, avoid offending them. If you can't say what you need to say without offending, at least try to limit the degree of offense by being polite. 13. **Never get upset or frustrated**  There is just never a good reason to let a job upset or frustrate you. It's just a job, and if you don't like it you can leave whenever you want. 14. **Leave work at work**  When you leave work, switch to focusing on your personal life. Jobs are temporary, your personal life is forever. 15. **Learn to influence other people**  If you have to choose between authority and influence, go for influence. Influence is primarily exerted by being someone people respect, and then persuading them to do what you need them to do. 16. **Plant many seeds**  Don't go all-in with any one initiative. Start a bunch of initiatives because some of them will fail and you want at least some to succeed. 17. **Don't pay attention to titles**  Titles are meaningless unless they bring you more money. Other people's titles may be deserved or not, so just judge them as individuals and not by their title. 18. **Read the seminal books on software design**  Stack Overflow can't teach you software design. The best way to understand software design is by reading the best books written on the topic by people who know what they're talking about. There are many, many recommended reading lists for software developers, so find one you think you can manage and get started. Since no software developer read these types of books anymore, you will be at a considerable knowledge advantage over your peers. 19. **Listen to audiobooks constantly**  When you have a chance to listen to an audiobook do so. That can be in the shower, while running errands, doing chores, on your commute, or as you're falling asleep. 20. **Learn cybersecurity**  Cybersecurity is an aspect of software development that is never going away, and it's getting more complicated to learn day-by-day. Make sure you do everything you can to learn as much as you can so that you are not the cause of the world's next critical security breach. 21. **Learn performance tuning**  You will most likely need to performance tune the software you write at some point, so you may as well learn how to do it. Performance tuning is a broad and complex topic and is often specific to a particular application. Just remember not to performance tune an application without measuring the current total performance, and the total performance after tuning, otherwise you may be tuning something that doesn't have that big an impact. 22. **Dive deep into Databases**  Databases are not going anywhere, so learn SQL back-to-front, and up-and-down; then learn how to write proper schema's; then learn how to write high-performance queries. SQL is so easy to learn that people think they have ""learned databases"" after they've written a few select statements. Databases have a lot of depth and are often an essential part of any application you are writing. 23. **Learn multiple programming languages**  Not only learn multiple programming languages but learn programming languages that are very different from one another. Java, Python, JavaScript, Haskell, and Swift are good candidates because of how different they all are from one another. The more different the languages you learn, the more approaches you will have in tackling problems  no matter what language you are tackling that problem with. 24. **Master your language runtime**  If you're going to be working with a programming language for years, dig below the surface and figure out how the language's runtime works beneath the surface. Not only will you learn more about the language itself, but it will be invaluable as you learn how to performance tune your applications. 25. **Mitigate your haters**  There will always be people who don't want you to succeed, especially the more success you experience. If you can't convince your haters not to be haters, then figure out a way to neutralize all the harmful bile they'll be spewing in your direction. 26. **Learn to focus**  You need to focus to code. If you're addicted to your phone take it as seriously as a substance abuse problem and get your habit under control. Once you have, you can learn how to enter into the flow state, which is a critical skill for a software developer. 27. **Get off of social media**  Social media is only suitable for virtue signaling and making other people feel inadequate. If you think your friends will miss you, stop using for a week and see who notices. Invite the people who notice out to dinner and learn how to communicate in-person rather than through a tiny screen. 28. **Stop playing video games**  you're an adult. Act like one. Video games take irreplaceable hours of your life and flushes them down the toilet giving you nothing in return. If you want to be a professional eSports competitor, then go all-in on that life. If willing eSports tournaments is that not your passion, then put down the controller and focus on things that matter in life. 29. **Be disciplined**  Discipline is doing what has to be done when it has to be done whether you want to or not. Discipline will be required to accomplish anything worth accomplishing. Suck it up and get it done. 30. **Always be polite and professional**  There is never a reason to be rude and unprofessional. Even if someone is being disrespectful to your face, you don't have to stoop to their level. If you're not sure how to burn someone while being polite and professional watch any British comedy. 31. **Never be intimidated by anyone**  Unless someone has the ability to inflict physical harm or take away your freedom, there is no reason to be intimidated by them. People in corporations will develop massive egos based on their own misconception that people can be intimidated by them, but don't feed into their fantasy. 32. **Stand up for yourself**  Never go looking for trouble, but when trouble comes your way don't back down. Backing down from a coworker or manager who is a bully will haunt you for the rest of your life. Even if you suffer the consequences for not backing down, at least you will be able to look at yourself in the mirror and live the rest of your life with no regrets. 33. **Have courage**  Courage is acting despite your fear, not the ability to feel no fear. There will be plenty of times when you will be afraid to do something, but don't let that fear rule you. 34. **Protect your reputation at all costs**  Your reputation follows you everywhere you go. A good reputation is very difficult to build, and very easy to destroy. If something or someone is threatening your status, you have to act no matter the costs. 35. **Own your strengths and weaknesses**  You cannot and will not be good at everything. You also cannot and will not be bad at everything. There will be things you are good at, and things you are not good at. That's life. The key is to be aware of the things you are good at and play to those strengths while minimizing any negative impacts of your weaknesses. 36. **Be conscious of your own biases**  We all have biases, but none of us spend the time necessary to understand them much less mitigate them. Do your best to understand the biases you have, and try to act in a conscious, deliberate manner rather than just doing what feels natural. If your biases are inappropriate for the workplace, acting naturally is the last thing you should do. 37. **Be aware of Dunning-Kruger**  You don't know what you don't know. None of us do. When you think you know something, question that assumption and try to find a way to verify that you know it. Chances are, what you think you know well you are still only a novice at. 38. **Don't worry about getting fired**  Getting fired is not the worst thing that can happen to you, and depending on the situation might be just what you need to point your life in the right direction. 39. **Don't ""suicide by cop""**  If you want to quit your job, then quit. Don't be a bad kid and hope that your manager eventually gets fed up and fires you because you lack the courage to quit yourself. 40. **Recover quickly from failure**  The more risks you take, the more you are going to fail. If you take no risks you won't accomplish anything worth accomplishing. Therefore, if you want to accomplish something worth accomplishing, you have to take risks and are going to fail. The key to failure is to learn from that failure and move on as quickly as possible. 41. **Be ambitious**  If are stuck in a job, you might as well be the person running the show. The alternative is to be happy with your position on the org chart and watch your peers get promoted around you. Having to congratulate people for a promotion they probably didn't deserve gets old quick, so you might as well work to get promoted so that someone you trust will be in charge  you. 42. **Don't be happy with your ""good job""** \- Almost no job is good, that's why there are people who sacrifice everything to form their own company and be their own boss. Your goal is to have a good life - your job is only there to support that goal. If you job doesn't support that goal, it's not a ""good job."" 43. **Present yourself as you want to be perceived**  If you want people to perceive as an immature slob, keep dressing like you're a freshman in college. If you want to be perceived as a powerful force to be reckoned with, dress accordingly. A tailored outfit and an expensive pair of shoes not only conveys seriousness but it makes you feel like a superhero. 44. **Put a filter between your brain and your mouth**  Master the skill of not saying what you think or feel as early in your career as possible. No one wants to hear your unvarnished truth about anything. Just because something pops into your brain to say, it doesn't mean it's a good idea to say it the way it popped into your brain. Learn how to phrase what you're thinking in a way that palatable to the audience you're speaking to. 45. **Learn to talk to executives**  Relationships with executives can make or break your career. The key thing an executive doesn't have is time, so if you can't convey a point in 10 seconds or less, refine and condense what you have to say until you can. Nothing frustrates an executive more than being cornered by an employee with nothing of substance to say. 46. **Read the company handbook**  Every company has a ""handbook"", even if that's not what they call it. Whatever it's called, your company has guidelines for behavior that they expect their employees to adhere to and you need to fully understand your company's expectations of you. 47. **Resign from death-march projects**  When you see that your project is going to fail, leave as soon as you notice. You may feel like if you stay you can save the project, but it's very rare that a single person can make-or-break a project. When you are in a no-win situation there's no honor in going down with the ship. 48. **Be your own cheerleader**  You will rarely if ever get authentic complements on your performance. In order to keep yourself positive and motivated, you need to celebrate your own accomplishments independent of the company you work for. 49. **Develop a support circle**  Occasionally life is going to kick you in the teeth so hard that you are going to need help getting up again. Your support circle are the people who will be there for you even when it's inconvenient for them. ""Fairweather friends"" are not your friends, they're just people who want company so they don't have to eat alone. 50. **Don't confuse confidence with arrogance**  It can be very difficult to tell the difference between confidence and arrogance in someone you just met. The key difference is that confident people believe they can do whatever they set their mind to, and arrogant people are just trying to get people to respect them without working to earn their respect. 51. **Change processes that don't work**  If you are using a process that is not working, change what's not working. Don't listen to people's excuses of what can't be changed, just start doing things differently and dare people to stop you. 52. **Do at least one startup**  Startups give you experience in how to go from nothing to a shippable product. Considering a software developer's job is to create shippable products, getting that end-to-end knowledge will be invaluable throughout your career. 53. **Do at least one enterprise**  Enterprises give you experience in how big-business runs. Even if your heart is in startups, understanding corporate bureaucracies, hierarchies, politics, and inefficiencies will help you anticipate their moves when you eventually have to sell to them or compete with them. 54. **Learn to manage your manager**  Your manager is just a person like you. They might have a few more years of experience, but sometimes they don't. ""Managing up"" is you giving your manager advice and guidance that optimally is in everyone's best interest. 55. **Learn to code fast**  Your ability to code fast will always come in handy. Being able to code fast doesn't mean you always have to; it just means that if you need to get something built in a hurry you can. Coding fast has almost no drawbacks unless you forget to pump the breaks when you're making your coworkers look bad. 56. **Don't chase certifications**  If you know you can't get a job without a certification then, by all means, get it. Otherwise, don't assume that just because you got a certification in something, that a company will find you more desirable. They may, or they may not. 57. **Don't work with your friends**  It may seem like a good idea to work with your friends it never works out. Eventually, someone gets promoted and the others are jealous, or someone doesn't pull their weight and expects their friends to cover for them; or other people start to resent you being a part of a clique they're not a part of. If your coworkers become your friends eventually then fine but don't actively seek out working with your friends. 58. **Do not define yourself by a technology stack**  You are not your technology stack. You will change which technologies you work with several times throughout your career, so don't paint yourself into a corner by going all-in on some technology that you just so happen to be using today. 59. **Don't obsess about trends**  Trends come and go and are most often are overhyped by the media. Just because everyone says something is the next big thing doesn't mean it is. Develop yourself as an intelligent skeptic that doesn't their own investigation before following the crowd. You have to stay on top of the trends of the industry to make sure you don't miss something important, but don't let trends dictate the course of your career. 60. **Always get plenty of sleep**  Sleep is critical for both your mental health as well as your performance as a software developer. There is never a good reason to not get enough sleep, as not getting enough sleep will eventually catch up with you in non-obvious ways. 61. **Avoid socializing with your coworkers**  Your coworkers are not your friends. Your friends are your friends because of some personal bond you share. Your coworkers are people who get a paycheck from the same place that you do. The more you socialize with your coworkers the harder it will be for them to take you seriously, and as a professional, you need your coworkers to take you seriously to be effective at your line of work. 62. **Understand the difference between friends and coworkers**  The people you work with are not your friends, they only work at the same place that you do. If you wouldn't bother to keep in touch with them after you left to go work somewhere else, they are your coworker. If you would miss them and want to stay in touch with them if you left - and they feel the same - then a coworker relationship has the potential to turn into a friendship. 63. **Don't be nave**  The world is messed up and jobs are no different. There are good people with good intentions, and there are bad people with bad intentions. Don't assume everyone around you has good intentions. Be skeptical of people's motivations, and trust your instinct when something feels off. 64. **Learn who to trust**  Just because you think you can trust someone with sensitive information doesn't mean you can. A good rule is to simply never share sensitive information unless you absolutely have to and only with people your company authorizes you to share it with. People love to talk about what they know that other people don't, and people can violate your trust accidentally such as when they hesitate in answering a direct question. 65. **Keep your enemies close**  This old adage is popular for a reason. When someone is clearly out to get you, befriend them and get to know them. If that turns into a genuine friendship, perfect. If it doesn't, at least you can glean why they're your enemy and adapt accordingly. 66. **Keep physically healthy**  The job of a software developer is sedentary unless you have a treadmill desk. You have to find the time to move your body and keep it healthy, or else you will end up uncomfortable in your own skin and in-and-out of the doctor's office due to living your life in front of a keyboard. 67. **Invest in a good chair**  You back and neck will give you trouble your entire career unless you learn how to hold your body while you code. Since most of us code in a chair, make sure it's an ergonomic chair that holds your body in the correct posture to avoid long-term physical maladaptations. You don't want to have a hunchback as you age. 68. **Protect your wrists**  Carpal tunnel syndrome is a real thing. Get the right keyboard and mouse, and learn how to use them in a way that doesn't permanently damage the way you make a living: typing. 69. **Protect your mental health**  Ignoring problems at work, working overtime, not dealing with problems as they occur are all a recipe for needing a lot of therapy later in your career. Deal with problems as they come, and refuse to accept any give of stress people try to give you. 70. **Keep your living expenses low**  Software developers make a lot of money compared to other professions, so you might think you're rich. You're not  you're just making a high salary. Wealth is time + freedom, and the measure of your time you have to enjoy your freedom. If you live above your true means, the things you own will eventually own you. 71. **Have a saving account with six months of salary**  Living check-to-check is insane when you start making decent money. Stash money away in savings such that if you suddenly need to find a new job, you don't have to stress about how to pay your rent or mortgage. 72. **Build your network of contacts**  When it comes to finding jobs, it's often who you know more than what you know. That's an immutable law of life. Level the playing field by making sure that in addition to knowing how to do the job, you also get introductions that are at least as good as other people leveraging their network. 73. **Speak at conferences**  Tech conferences are always looking for speakers who can present on the latest technology. Spend a weekend getting familiar with the hottest trendy technology and submit an abstract to a bunch of conferences when they put out their call for papers. Don't worry about being an expert in technology  almost no one speaking at a conference is. 74. **Recruiters are not your friends**  Recruiters tend to be friendly when they think they can make money from you but are only there to facilitate a transaction where you are the commodity being traded. Keep the relationship professional and business-like. Everyone should complete the transaction feeling good about the deal: you, your new company, and the recruiter. 75. **Have principals and stick to them**  Wherever you get your principals from your family; your religion; your ethics; your morals; your opinion; make sure you have them and don't violate them under any circumstances even if it costs you an opportunity. 76. **Live an intentional life**  Don't let other people dictate the course of your life because they don't know the life you want to live. Only you know what an intentional life is for you. You don't want to look back on your life and realize you are stuck in a life-plan you hate because someone else gave you that plan and you didn't question it. 77. **Trust your gut when considering an offer**  An offer may have all the cash, vacation, and perks you are looking for, but if something seems a bit off, and your instinct is not to take the job, don't take the job. Your brain is good at analyzing complex situations but bad at articulating them. Often, the collection of non-verbal communication and situational inconsistencies only show up as you have a bad feeling about the job. Trust your feelings. 78. **Help people who want your help**  If someone asks you if you have time to help them, always say ""yes"" and then figure out where the extra time will come from later. They will become your fan for life. 79. **Don't help people who don't want your help**  If someone needs your help, but doesn't want your help, leave them alone. No come comes from offering help to someone who doesn't want it. 80. **Stand up for people who can't stand up for themselves**  You will run into a lot of people in your career who for whatever reason are getting screwed over 81. **Be a team player**  Don't just give lip service to being a team player: put the needs and concerns of the team ahead of the team. Step up when something difficult needs to be done, back-up your teammates when they need your support, and if you have to drag the entire team kicking and screaming across the finish line so you can all win. 82. **Figure out what ""success"" and ""failure"" means at your company**  Every company is different and defines a successful or a failed software project slightly differently. Things are rarely as simple as they are presented in meetings, so ask questions to figure out what rewards or consequences await you for success or failure. 83. **Figure out what the mission is**  Managers are particularly bad and explaining the overarching vision that you are a part of, often because they don't know. Do your best to figure this out, because the mission is always broader than adding a feature of building a new app. 84. **Commit to the company's mission**  If you are receiving a paycheck, then commit to whatever mission you are a part of. This isn't about corporate loyalty, but about professionalism. If you don't want to commit to the mission, find another company with a mission you are willing to commit to. 85. **Never, ever gossip at work**  There is never a reason to start gossip or listen to gossip. If someone tries to gossip with you, politely decline to engage. People will respect you for your integrity. 86. **Don't get drunk with coworkers**  Grabbing a drink with your coworkers if often unavoidable, but never ever get drunk. Absolutely no good whatsoever can come of you slurring your words and stumbling around drunk with people you expect to have a professional relationship with the next day. 87. **Embrace capitalism**  If you are receiving a paycheck from a company in exchange for your labor, then you are part of a capitalistic system. It's easy to be a replaceable cog in a big machine if you don't understand that you are in a big machine. Learn the rules of capitalism, and position your career so that you're the person in charge making the most money, and not the person working overtime for hardly any money. 88. **Avoid brainstorming sessions**  Brainstorming is a social activity masquerading as an intellectual activity. There are going to be times when you need to work with people to solve tough problems, but you won't solve them by doing the corporate equivalent of a party game. Tough problems need to be defined and rigorously analyzed; practical solutions need to be proposed and either accepted or rejected based on real-world constraints. Brainstorming is just people pretending they care about solving a problem when in reality they usually don't. 89. **Be patient**  Often times to win big you have to hold your position rather than take an action. Sometimes that big initiative that will make your career is rejected but might be accepted if you pitch it again in the next fiscal year. Stalk your game and strike when the time is right. Don't get frustrated and miss an opportunity coming your way. 90. **Learn to make diagrams**  Anything that can be expressed in a document can be more clearly expressed in a diagram. Even a crude diagram can be useful if it simplifies a complex topic. You don't have to be an artist to create a diagram, just try to convey as much useful information in as simple a diagram as you can. With diagrams remember less is more. 91. **Treat your testers well**  The people who test your software can make your life a living hell, or they can make it a breeze. If you work to keep them happy, they'll usually return the favor. Remember, people who test software are your most valuable allies, as they guard against your inadvertent mistakes negatively impacting your reputation. 92. **Pay attention to the little details**  Being a software developer means you pay attention to the little details other people haven't even thought about. You have to think about the problems you are solving far more deeply than the people who are telling you what to build, so always go the extra mile and make sure you don't miss anything at all when you deliver your feature. 93. **Learn to compromise**  Sometimes to get what you need you have to give a little to the other party. If you are having trouble building consensus, then try to identify smart compromises and offer them to the people with objections. 94. **Treat people well**  You can tell the character of a person by how they treat people they don't have to treat well. Whether it's the CEO or the person emptying your trash, treat everyone with respect and dignity. 95. **Respect expert opinions**  Experts are a dying breed, but if you find one, learn to trust what they have to say. The difference between success and failure can sometimes be paying attention to what an expert says. To reap that benefit, however, you first have to acknowledge that experts exist and that their opinion is more useful than the opinions of non-experts. 96. **Be a Mentor**  Once you have a few years of experience under your belt, try taking someone under your wing to show them the ropes. You don't have to be a master of your craft to be immensely helpful to someone who is just starting out. 97. **Don't be afraid of taking small steps**  Often to accomplish something difficult you have to take things is small steps. People like to take big steps as it makes them feel more powerful, but Rome wasn't built in a day. Find the small steps that get you closer to your goal and follow them consistently until your goal is achieved. 98. **Reserve time for thinking**  Producing software requires you think of a solution, and then you type that solution into a computer in a particular programming language. Anyone can type something into a computer, the difficulty is in thinking up what to type. Before you start coding, always set aside some time to think of what you're going to write before you write it. 99. **Be open to other people's opinion**  There are going to lots of people you don't agree with, but that doesn't mean you should ignore their opinion. Sometimes, even a bad idea can be helpful if it helps you more clearly articulate what makes an idea bad. Remember, however, that being open to the opinion of others doesn't necessarily mean you should do what they are suggesting. 100. **Stop feeling like an imposter**  We're all imposters. The software developers at the NSA looking for global cybersecurity threats are imposters compared to the software developers who write code that pilots rovers on mars who are imposters compared to software developers who write missile interception software on battleships who are imposters compared to the software developers at the NSA. Everyone's an imposter compared to someone. Focus on your specialty rather than worrying about what other people are doing. &amp;#x200B; I hope people find this list useful.

Im not completely sure what exactly I want to focus on career wise, but data science is a growing interest. Interested in programming, statistics, big data, machine learning etc. If I were interested in doing data science / big data / data analyst type jobs what are my options? self learn? or more college? I've heard cybersecurity is very competitive, how is data science? Is it hard to get jobs? I dont have a strong math or statistics background. I can learn a lot on my own, but will I need educational proof of skills in order to pursue a data science career? Any suggestions? Should I consider more college or rely on self learning from other resources? If I went back to school it would have to wait though...

531,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,"Senior CS major, want to pursue software engineering/dev - but received a pretty good offer in a different field. Could I return to the SDev field later on?",1,bwe0wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bwe0wd/senior_cs_major_want_to_pursue_software/,2019-06-04 04:22:48,"Hi, everyone. I understand this is a first-world problem, but I could really use some feedback or discussion to help me out. Basically, I received an offer for a federal Director role in Information Technology. This was mostly due to some prior IT experience, a great interview, and a team wanting to shake things up and hire a wild card college kid. Don't get me wrong, I am extremely grateful. But, when I think of my professional career and future I see myself more in the role of a Senior dev or a DBA or cybersecurity network engineer and not IT. The position does not have a ton of career progession, and pay would be around 56k in a small, average CoL state. Plus, I think my chances of getting a developer job right out of college are pretty good considering the market - even though I am by no means a wunderkind. Here's my dilemma, I don't want to accept this position under the guise of ""I'm just gonna quit and find a software developer job when I graduate 6 months from now."" Also, I wouldn't want to be stuck at this job then try to re-enter the software industry after being a year or two removed from college without an entirely relevant prior job. But, I also don't want to be too greedy/spoiled to think I'm too good for this job. I'm sure I would be good at it, but I'm concerned I would be setting myself back by not finding a developer job right out of college (where the pay would be almost as much - with a lot more opportunity to work my way up.) Would it be terrible/unwise to work a somewhat unrelated albeit high-up job for a year or two, then try to find a job as a junior developer somewhere? Any advice or discussion greatly appreciated."
532,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Looking for advice on whether to leave software development and join the family business,1,bxbfr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bxbfr7/looking_for_advice_on_whether_to_leave_software/,2019-06-06 12:38:57,"I'm 26 years old and have been working as a software engineer for the past year and a half. My family owns a construction company (general contracting) and I'm considering joining but am very conflicted about it. &amp;#x200B; Some relevant details: * I currently make $85k/year total comp and have received a promotion and positive feedback. I think I'm pretty good at what I do. I pretty much never have to work over 40 hours a week. * To join the family business I would have start out at $30k/year, but would likely be making $60k after 2 years and $100k after 5. The financial benefit wouldn't come until my Dad passed over his shares of the company to me, then I would be making \~$200k most years but could make only $70k if the company doesn't do well that year. My dad is unable to give me any guarantees about when I would get ownership, but my best guess is in around 10 years. This would be in a medium cost of living area (The suburbs of north New Jersey). I know plenty of developers make more than $200k, but it seems like they're all in really high cost of living cities. I talked to a tech recruiter in that area and he said a developer with 10 years experience will make around $140k. * I don't like my current job, but do like software in general. I might enjoy it more if I switched to a different company (I've only worked at one company). * My Dad is retiring in the next few years, so if I want to join the business it has to be now. * I would be 4th generation, which is cool. All the family members at the business are enthusiastic about me joining. * I'm pretty confident about my family's ability to run this business without letting typical family drama get in the way. I think we're different from most families. I don't think I'd have an issue working with them. * I hate staring at a computer screen all day. I don't feel like it's psychologically healthy for me. In construction I'd be able to go out to job sites rather than sitting in a cubicle all day. * This is obvious, but it's worth emphasizing. I would be completely changing fields into a profession I know nothing about. I would have to start from zero and learn everything from the ground up. My main motivation for wanting to join is the money (after I get ownership), the freedom that would come from being my own boss, and the fact that the work involves going out to job sites and interacting with people. My main hesitation is the drastic pay cut that I would have to take before getting ownership, the fact that I probably wont like construction as much as I like software, and the fact that I would have to go through a lot of effort taking classes to learn this new field. Random thoughts: * I'd really like a job where I can set my own schedule and take time off when I feel the need. I'm honestly not sure which of these careers offers more of that. * I'd also like the ability to live in different parts of the country/world. I think that would be difficult at my family's business, but I don't know whether that's available in software either. * Cybersecurity and AI seem interesting too. Hoping to get advice from experienced professionals in the software industry because you guys have a good idea of what I'd be giving up if I went to the family business. Thank you in advance!"
533,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Have to make a hefty career decision by July 3rd and feeling uncertain.,1,bxp0xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bxp0xv/have_to_make_a_hefty_career_decision_by_july_3rd/,2019-06-07 11:58:46,"Hi guys, &amp;#x200B; I'm a cybersecurity/network engineering major. Last school year (freshman year) I was lucky to receive an internship opportunity for this summer, largely thanks to the side-projects I was a part of during the school year. The internship is going extremely well, and I have very high confidence that my employers will offer to bring me back next year due to the work I've managed to get done and the direction they're headed in. It's at a smaller startup type company which has been doing quite well for itself after a recent re-branding. The company has two buildings: the one I am in focuses on manufacturing/production and has one other IT guy. The second building focuses entirely on software development. The production site was victim to a substantial ransomware breach days after I received my offer letter, so there has been plenty to do. &amp;#x200B; This summer I was also part of a separate company's two day recruiting event. The company is a significantly larger international consulting firm, and I really enjoyed meeting some of their cybersecurity minds during the event. The company has extended an offer for the summer of 2020 (which I must accept or reject by July 3rd, 2019). It pays almost double what I am making at my current internship, along with a nice bonus. &amp;#x200B; The larger company offers much better pay and will be able to give me the specialized cybersecurity work and guidance I'm looking for. However, with the smaller, more startup-type company, I have been able to regularly interact with the company founder and other high profile executives. The other IT guy is my main supervisor, but I tend to report the major projects I've been working on to those executives. &amp;#x200B; I am trying not to boast. I know I am lucky to have this decision, but I'm unsure which direction to go. The larger company would let me specialize, early on and right where I would like to, along with a substantial pay increase and giving me a recognized name to put on my resume. But I feel that with the small company, even though I do a fair bit of help-desk stuff, I have better chances of moving up thanks to good networking opportunities. TL;DR: have to choose between startup where my work is more generalized, but I get to meet high profile entrepreneurs, or international firm with double the pay, more specialized work, and working under a recognized name, but fewer networking opportunities."

My local state college has an IT Management and Cybersecurity track that is cheap. I returned to college and pursued the degree. I already had some credits before I dropped out because I had no motivation or direction before. My favourite part of any of my classes has been programming. I really enjoyed C++ and working on the projects in the class . After this semester I will only have 7 courses left and I plan to complete it because I need to finish a degree and start working (Im 26 and need to focus on making a liveable wage) . I've wondered if I would have enjoyed a CS degree more. The calculus and physics classes kind of scared me away tbh. I haven't enjoyed learning how to use software or working with hardware that much, but I have enjoyed coding and the process of designing something. Basicly, I'm more interested in web dev and software dev. The IT degree was a more direct and easy degree for me to get based on my circumstances, but Im almost wondering If I should consider going back for a CS degree after I graduate with my IT degree. I doubt their is alot of cross-over between classes, plus I have not taking any calc or physics classes. I would expect it to take awhile. Doubt I could do full-time again either. So Im wondering if it would be even worth it. I know you technically don't need a degree for some dev jobs.... first step for me is to get a decent job after I graduate, but longterm Im wondeing If I should I chosen a CS degree"
537,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Career path: Internships and MSc,2,bccbvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bccbvf/career_path_internships_and_msc/,2019-04-12 21:15:09,"Hey guys, I want to ask your opinion about my near-future plans.

After that I went for two short internships in very big consulting firms as a Salesforce developer (at the end of which they both offered me a contract but I declined). I then switched to a very small company that does forensics and cyber security; I wanted to try this field and I'm enjoying it. By august, all the experience I'll have will be this cyber-security job (circa 10 months) and 5 months of internship; not much, I guess. I now want to go study for a masters, in CS or Cyber Security, one of those programs that last 1 year (there are plenty here in Europe, it seems), hoping that my BCs+Short Experience+1Year MSc can be somewhat valuable. Do you think it would be better to gain some additional work experience before getting a MSc? Do you think it's a good idea getting a 1-year MSc (how would a recruiter see it?) Are those 6 months spent in consultancy totally worthless, since I want to continue my career in cybersecurity?

Security looks also challenging, which is something I like. &amp;#x200B; My question is: how can I have better a feeling, how can I be more familiar with the field of security, what can I do to know if I will like security or not ?"

I'm currently in my first semester of Computer Science and in the upcoming semester, I have to select the subjects that are relevant to different majors in Computer Science. Currently, my school offers 3 majors which are software development, cybersecurity and Internet of Things (IOT). Initially, I wanted to take up software development as my major since I was really interested in creating software and the whole process that goes into it. However, after reading some articles about the increase in demand for cybersecurity majors, I'm starting to consider taking it as my major instead but I'm really not sure whether it would be something I enjoy doing. Aside from that, I've also started to take interest in the IOT major. From what I understand, taking an IOT major would allow me to learn about how devices can interact with one another and perform various tasks to solve many issues in the real world. The idea of that fascinates me but I'm not really sure whether taking up that major is much worth it than just taking up a software development major. Therefore, I'm currently in a crossroad when it comes to deciding which major I should really consider. I do plan to take up the other 2 majors as electives if I do end up taking software development as my major. If anyone could share their thoughts on this matter, I really do appreciate it!"

My university has an independent study option that I could do as a substitution to the second level of a Cybersecurity capstone class (the first level is a class I'm taking now). The independent study that is being offered for me is analyzing EEG data using Matlab. I guess my question is would an independent study look better on a resume than a standard second level Cybersecurity class? Would it increase my chances of getting a job? The one thing I'm considering is that I have a BA in Forensic Psychology, so an EEG assignment would be relevant and something interesting, but my conflict is that I want a career in cyber security, and I'm not sure if it would matter what independent study I've done. Secondly, if I'm graduating in the fall, when is it appropriate to begin looking for careers? Is it wise to find a job first, then go for a Masters? Thanks for any advice you all can provide!"

(University Senior),1,bhocsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bhocsg/which_summer_internship_should_i_take_university/,2019-04-27 02:33:39,"Tl;Dr at the bottom, apologies if this is a bit long. A little background about me: I'm a Computer Networking Major with minors in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. It's my senior year in Wisconsin right outside the Cities, and my goal is to move near the cities after I graduate this next December to be closer to my SO. I currently am employed at an internship with company A I've held since last summer, which was extended after good performance; essentially, I have a part time position as a full stack development intern. It is approximately an hour and a half away from my apartment, but half an hour away from my parents house whom I could move back in with this summer (but really don't desire to). They have offered me to stick around and stay for another summer with a pay raise to 23 an hour. I love the work I do, but I am not enthralled with the company or it's policies and don't plan to stay unless I have no other job prospects, but they have continually suggested they will be offering me a full time position. I work with C# mostly developing APIs, but lately have been working on automated patching with servers and Azure stuff. The work is constantly fresh and new, and the company is the best-in-class for their market, so I deal with apps that impact millions of users. Unfortunately, the downsides to this internship are that remote work is non-existent (making work while I'm in school very hard; 4 hours of unpaid commute every work day, gas is expensive and wear on my vehicle) and I have no peers that are within my age group, so it can be sort of lonely. They also have one location for IT work and it is here, and I do not want to stay here past graduation whatsoever, as it is very far from both my SO and my family. As well, even if I work here this summer and live with my parents, I would still need to pay for my college apartment while getting no use out of it. I was, however, recently offered a new internship at a company B that is 25 minutes from my apartment. I am enthralled by the work this new company does, and working there after I graduate is something I deeply desire. They have an office in the cities which they say I could move to once I graduate, and have a reputation for giving interns who work there full time jobs that pay well above market average. However, the internship is in product support, and only pays 12 an hour. I'm confident in my people skills and motivation to move up in company B, but I fear this experience for the internship will be less useful as a resum builder than the work I do with company A. As well, the lower pay would be difficult to deal with, but not impossible. However, I would desire a job with company B after I graduate infinitely more than with company A. Seeing as I am reaching the end of my studies, I am motivated to work for the company B that I would rather work for after I graduate, but although both companies can nearly guarantee me a job, only one of them is in development/project work, and that is the company A I would rather not stay on with. Development jobs are plenty at company B, but I would probably need to knock it out of the park impressions wise and study outside of work to land one. I also greatly enjoy the area around my college apartment and have many friends there, and not many anymore back home near my parents. I am a part of many clubs and activities that require equipment that I can't move to my parents house, and thus would be giving up these hobbies for the summer when I have time and weather to enjoy them if I stay with company A. Tl;dr: two companies offering me summer work with promise of full time after. Not sure which is best for my career, but don't want to work full time for company A after school. Company A: company I currently work for + 23 dollars an hour + fruitful full stack development work in dotNET, Windows Server, Azure, Web dev + have been working here for a year, extensive portfolio and good reputation - middle of nowhere and would need to live with my parents which is inconvenient, unable to practice hobbies - no peers in my age group, separated from friends geographically - I do not want to work for Company A when I graduate due to distance, culture, and policy, they don't offer any remote work either - commute during semester is 4 hours round trip, expensive gas and car wear Company B: new company near me + awesome company culture, enthralled with them after visiting + very short commute, can see friends and participate in hobbies + not paying for useless apartment + offers remote work during semester for interns + IT shop that is very reputable and fast growing + interesting benefits that appeal to me + full time positions pay much better than Company A on average according to glassdoor and other similar sources ~ java/apple shop, not familiar with this but want to learn. Seems easily transferable from C#, my primary language. ~ if all else fails, they are a major employer of networking, which is what my degree is actually in - 12 dollars an hour, not even competitive with convenience stores near me - support position which is not the most interesting, need to put in work to get a development position.

Having looked into bootcamps, I'm pretty confused as to what is a good idea and what isn't. From what I can tell, Hack Reactor has a good reputation but is way too expensive for me. App Academy also has a good rep, but a curriculum of mostly Ruby and Javascript, which I'm already familiar with. Coding Dojo, which has a campus near me, has 3 stacks in Python, MEAN, and Java (although they offer a C# stack at another campus an hour's drive from me) but the reviews aren't that great. Udacity also has a full-stack nanodegree (Python). Evolve Academy is the only cybersec course that seemed to fit my needs, and at $8K it's decently affordable. &amp;#x200B; (For those of you that are going to say bootcamps are a waste of time/money, I say I've done the self-study thing long enough to know I'm going nowhere fast, and you get out of a bootcamp what you put into it. I do best in immersive environments so I'm willing to give this a shot. College is NOT an option for me right now.) &amp;#x200B; My gut instinct is to either A) go with Coding Dojo at the campus with C# (because games) B) go with Evolve Academy supplemented with self-study for certifications C) brush up on my front-end while doing Udacity's full-stack course and learning back-end &amp;#x200B; Please tell me if any of these options seem entirely unreasonable, or if you have any advice when changing from a non-technical to a technical career. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR: WTF do I do with my life &amp;#x200B;"

No internships, no work experience in CS field. Limited income to try different things. Overwhelmed with what information and subjects to focus on to become a junior developer in Java (or any entry-level position).** &amp;#x200B; I am a college senior graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from an average university in May 2019. I am an international student, and was a collegiate athlete for all 4 years. Due to these reasons, I did not have time or was unable to get an internship, and as a result, I feel that I have fell behind compared to my peers. I constantly feel I don't know much about things, and although my theoretical knowledge is decent, I struggle in practice of coding and creating projects. I have a good GPA (3.6), and typically had good grades in programming classes, but I feel that my university classes that heavily focused on coding were very shallow and nothing that I couldn't learn by watching youtube for 20 minutes a day. &amp;#x200B; So far, I have started the grind on LeetCode, primarily using Java. I have purchased a couple of books to help with programming for additional practice. Additionally, I'm looking forward into learning Java frameworks and libraries like Node and React. I am also thinking about learning SQL and getting proficient in it. The problem is, I am overwhelmed in the amount of material that I think that I need for landing a programming job of any scope. Eventually, I would like to be in a cybersecurity field, but most of them require experience and multiple security certificates, which I cannot pay for yet (to take tests etc). So for now, I am focusing on getting an entry-level job as a Junior Developer, preferably Java (I have solid foundational knowledge of C++, Python, and Lisp as well but not comfortable with them). &amp;#x200B; I am not looking for a Big N or a dream $200k+ position right out of college - I am comfortable with an average/slightly below average pay for an entry level position. That is not to say that I am not dreaming big, but I feel like my current skills cannot land a big position job just yet. My biggest objective is to have stable income for now - as an International student, a lot of companies cannot sponsor my stay, so I feel like it's going to be much harder for me to land ANY job. Any stable income is important because I do not have much monetary support from my family. Fortunately, my Optional Practical Training (OPT) involves a 3 year option to stay and work in a CS related field due to STEM option (instead of just 1 year for non-STEM fields). Therefore, I do not need a work visa immediately (something that, looking from job postings, employers tend to avoid). &amp;#x200B; With all that in mind, to sum it up, a couple of questions: 1. What should I focus on to improve my skills in Java programming (frameworks, libraries, templates, anything) 2. Should I narrow myself down to coding (&amp; coding exclusively in one language), or should I expand my field with different languages and focus on different subjects (in regards to probability of landing an entry-level job)? 3. How likely is that a person with no internships or work experience in CS fields get employed in entry-level positions (companies of any size) 4. What would be an optimal approach into learning skills required for cybersecurity positions (technologies, certificates, languages) &amp;#x200B; Bonus: I have a lot of accomplishments in my sport that I have participated in college. That is the only thing that makes me stand out from other applicants, resume-wise. Do CS field employers care about that? (I know that for some jobs, athletic achievements are a huge plus on the resume - a show of acquired skills beneficial to the job culture and environment) &amp;#x200B; Thank you for your time reading this, and any help is greatly appreciated.

The major at my school offers specializations in AI, cybersecurity, graphics and visualization, mobile applications, information technology, network and operating systems, programming languages and compilers and software engineering. I am so new to this stuff and haven't looked at math/science since high school- all that makes it hard to know what specialization is worth it.

What should I be paid? Can I get a junior cloud engineering or cybersecurity role? I had a weird path. Dropped out of a top-tier school to work for a successful small business tech CEO that I met in high school. Finished my undergrad in Software Development &amp; Security through UMUC with a 4.0 GPA in just under two years. Currently have my A+, Network+, Security+, ITIL v3 Foundation, and associate-level AWS SysOps Admin, AWS Developer, and AWS Solutions Architect certs. Interned with said CEOs company throughout college while they sponsored me for my TS clearance. I have been working as a Tier 1/2 Help Desk Specialist for a high-profile federal client for about 5 months, but feel totally unfulfilled and underpaid for what value and skills I feel I can provide. With this company, throughout my internship and continuing into my full-time billable role, I have worked heavily on supporting internal projects (unpaid) including web design and administration, business development, and infrastructure setup (CAT6 cabling for new office, migrating 100 users data and email to our new O365 tenant, etc.) in addition to being one of the top performers at the client site. With all of this said, working in DC for a selective client and with a degree, certs, and TS clearance, I am being paid $55K. Several more senior engineers from the on-site DevOps team tell me that I am doing myself a huge disservice by being in this position, and that I could make a hell of a lot more with my credentials and work ethic. My question to you, r/cscareerquestions, is whether you think it is realistic for me to think I have a solid chance at getting a TS junior-level cloud engineering or cybersecurity position in NOVA/DC paying at least $80K with my current skill set. I have been perusing job listings, but am deterred by the experience and technical capabilities that they require. For example, while I have strong credentials, I have not really had the opportunity to do much of anything with AWS or any other DevOps tools in an enterprise environment, which makes me feel wholly unqualified. Also, while I have a strong understanding of core concepts for general IT that would lend themselves well to a cloud or cyber role, I do not have any real professional hands-on experience. I am confident that I can learn quickly, but do not feel like I could walk in and, on day one, crush a highly-technical interview. My boss tells me I could not qualify for any of these roles, but at this point, I feel that he may be intentionally keeping me down and skewing my self-perception. On a final note, here is a summary of my self-perception of my skills, followed by a final question: - Strong understanding of core AWS services and best practices (but no experience implementing these on a notable scale beyond basic school projects or certification training) - Strong understanding of fundamental enterprise cybersecurity best practices (but no experience performing any incident response or creating security policies) - Strong understanding of broad IT concepts, including the SDLC, database design, software development (but not algorithms or data structures, really), and networking - Excellent written and oral communication skills - Strong experience providing first-hand support to (irate) VIP customers and clients - Strong work ethic (even though I am extremely mad about being unpaid for the several hours I provide to the company on a daily bases, after putting in 8-10 billable hours at the client site) Am I out of line? Do any of you seasoned IT veterans have helpful input regarding finding a new job and my salary requirements? My biggest fear is that I look attractive on paper, but cannot actually implement anything technical without up front training over the first few weeks/months on the job. I imagine most other fresh grads are much more skilled. I appreciate you all taking the time to read and respond to this post. I am in a dark place right now, and your thoughts are much appreciated. Thank you!"

They both advertise themselves as programs targeting non-cs graduates. Both programs are roughly the same costs (\~$26,000) but I would like to commit to one that would help me get a career in the cs world most easily. I can cover the costs of both programs with some family help, so financially it is not a concern to me. I've heard that UPenn's MCIT program may be a bit easier (less credits) and because the degree would be coming from an Ivy League school, it may make it easier for me to work for reputable companies (read through statistics of many graduates of the program accepting offers at the Big 4) However, I am also concerned that UPenn's program may not provide me with adequate fundamental knowledge of computer science which would probably help me more at my actual job. &amp;#x200B; My end goal is to be working in cybersecurity, which I currently understand does not normally involve high-level coding/programming. Given this situation, would it make more sense for me to pursue OSU's program for a BS in CS or go for the MCIT at UPenn?"

595,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Just Another Second Bachelors in CS Post - a bit more organized though,1,aqoze9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aqoze9/just_another_second_bachelors_in_cs_post_a_bit/,2019-02-15 08:37:29,"Dear Wise People of Reddit: &amp;#x200B; I know this subreddit is filled with ""second bachelors in CS"" posts, but I have another one. &amp;#x200B; I have a bachelor's in business and an MBA (non target). I'm considering going back to school for CS at my alma mater (near home), but at 27, I'm worried that I would waste time (or fail) and miss out on potential raises and career growth. I took a Java course for fun about two years ago and got a C. I also took a Program and Algorithm Design course after and got a D. I also took a business course while taking these two courses and either got an A or B (more on this later). I have several options that I'm considering (yes, I know CS and IT are different): 1. **MSIT in Cybersecurity -** it would take a year and a half. There's one or two Java courses. Classes include: database systems, applied information security, software engineering process, software assurance and security, and database security. My school is an NSA approved Center for Excellence school. I could see myself doing this and getting a decent paying job. 2. **Bachelor's in CS (caveat) -** after scouring many posts here, many people seem to recommend getting a bachelors to have sufficient foundational understanding and learn the theory. Furthermore, people seem to agree that a CS background can easily go into IT or Cybersecurity than vice versa. It seems many believe that a non-STEM undergrad makes a bachelor in CS necessary. I have a FT job and my wife is in school for nursing. If I do this I would have to decide whether I would pursue CS full-time or part-time: 1. **Full-Time:** most realistic and would likely take 2.5 to 3 years. I'd be 30 when I finish. The pros are that I would be immersed and get the degree quickly. I learn better this way. The cons are lost income (I'd have to get some PT job and risk not having healthcare for me or my wife; it's hard to walk away from earning $60k now but if the urge is there, there must be a reason for it). 2. **Part-Time:** I'm leaning against this because it would take forever. I could stay at my current business analyst job (not nearly as glamorous as it sounds). Furthermore, I think the chance of failing increases with this option because I'm ""pulling a bandaid"" off very slowly. 3. **~~Boot camp~~** **-** I'm not interested in web development and, although I believe now is okay to have skills and no degree, it's in my best interest to get a degree. I believe that companies will require a CS degree in the future because they can (similarly to how many secretary jobs started to require a bachelor's degree after the Great Recession - everyone needed a job and companies raised the bar because they could). Computer Science program enrollment increases each year and is either being incorporated or already incorporated in public schools. 4. **~~MS in CS~~** **-** I worry that I won't have enough foundation to be effective. Many people here posted that undergraduate degrees are more skilled than non-cs undergrads with a master in CS. Even if I did this route, my school would likely require some undergrad courses, so it would likely take the same amount of time. &amp;#x200B; **About Me** **1) Do I find coding fun?** The concept of coding is fun. Although I wouldn't say I wake up and think, ""Damn, I'd love to code today"" I remember enjoying debugging past assignments. It felt like completing a math problem and then checking the answer in the back of the book to find out you were right. That feeling was fun. The thought of solving problems with code is fun. &amp;#x200B; **2) What about that C in Java and that D in Program &amp; Algorithm Design?** It could be that it's not right for me, but I believe working full time and taking other classes took away much time. I think that I was just comfortable with kicking ass with business classes and thinking that I can just learn to code. I'll admit, I did not code as often as my professor recommended. &amp;#x200B; **3) What's attractive about CS?** Aside from solving problems, I enjoy that salaries and career potential are great. I also believe that this is a skill set needed for the future. &amp;#x200B; **My Questions** * What do you think about my four options above (if you have another option, let me know)? * What thoughts or advice do you have for me? &amp;#x200B; Thanks!

Basically the title. For context, I live in Europe. So I'm a bit torn between these two. I'm thinking of getting a degree in Computer Engineering, however I've learned that the course eventually branches out into two directions, one towards programming and databases, the other towards networking. Thing is, I have no problem with either desk work or more practical work (although ideally I'd like to do both in order to keep it varied). I like programming, but not to the point of building incredibly complex programs. Programming-wise, I'm tending more to the side of web, phone apps and possibly videogame development (this last one would be something to do in my spare time perhaps as a side project, there's absolutely no way I'm getting into the main videogame development industry). I feel that my current qualifications are enough for that, although there is definitely room and desire for improvement, which could happen during the degree. I have also a strong interest in networking, mostly due to the technical aspects of it: conceptualizing, setting up networks, cable work, support, configuration... There's also a bit of curiosity in regards to cybersecurity, which I feel the need to learn more about even if I don't especialize in it. There's also a bit of an interest in the electrotechnical field, which sort of connects both the computer degree and my current qualifications (have a degree in sound engineering and almost zero knowledge of electricity due to the artistic nature of the school I went to). So there's a need to somehow fill the ""hole"" in that field and in a way unite all these qualifications. There is however something else that is troubling me... from what I've read lurking around Reddit threads (I could be wrong though), there might be more advantages to taking a certain degree and then ""stepping down"" to the other field, instead of the other way around (the example I saw was someone suggesting taking a computer engineering degree, then stepping down to the electrotechnical field through job experience/external resources/home practice I suppose). I'm not sure how relevant this ""stepping down/up"" aspect to my question, so if any of you could clear that up I'd be grateful. There's also the problem in regards to the future... I'm afraid of eventually running into trouble in the long run for picking a more technical field. Do you feel networking is at risk of being somehow automated to the point that only programmers become relevant in this field? Sorry if this text seems a bit confusing, I wrote this in a bit of a rush. Also there are a ton of questions running through my head at the moment, but hopefully I managed to be clear about them. My thanks in advance."

Long story short, I am currently a management information systems major at my university. I've added a finance minor in the past year, but realized that I am much more interested in coding. I don't have enough time to complete the CS minor track at my uni before graduation, but do intend on taking the courses up and through data structures and algorithms. What can I do to make myself competitive enough to land a good software development/engineering job upon graduation despite not being a CS grad, and how good/bad are my chances? More detail: my university does a five year, three co-op (aka extended internship) program. I've done two internships so far, one in cybersecurity with a healthcare company, and one in-progress in wealth management with a top investment bank. I'd say I'm decent at R and SQL, and was originally aiming to be a business analyst, but I feel like that career path is too narrow and there aren't enough jobs and flexibility in that field. As such, I realized that I think I'd be much happier as a developer. However, I don't have enough time to change my major and graduate on-time. I know that people from my major are considered ""weaker"" than CS grads, though I'm not sure how to quantify that. I have been self-teaching myself during downtime at work and after work on JS and Python, though I'm wary of my lack of fundamental CS theory and it's something I will improve asap. I'm unhappy with the finance field and how MIS feels restrictive, and how the prospect of being a manager isn't great if you can't understand what the software engineer guys are doing. I know some MIS major's have become successful devs, though I haven't found much info on what made a company choose them despite lacking a CS degree. While I plan to take some courses in CS and also continue to teach myself languages, what are things I can do to get myself in the door at respected companies and also through the interview? Should I consider pursuing another bachelor's in CS? Should I do a boot camp? Or should I just continue to work as much as I can on teaching myself and maybe building a few projects to throw on GitHub?

For example, iOS/Swift skills equates to an iOS developer. But, an iOS developer can also have html/css skills which give them an edge when it comes to using programs that develop mobile apps for iOS &amp; Android simultaneously. [According to CIO.com, in 2018 the top 5 hottest skills were:](URL 1. Information security and cybersecurity 2. Devops 3. Data science and database 4. Business application development 5.

Java 3. Python 4. PHP 5. C++ But this doesn't really correlate much to salary, if anything maybe the availability of jobs using a certain language. I would bet an iOS developer makes significantly more than a front/back/web dev and Swift/Obj-C isn't even on the list, and some big data jobs using Python probably pay more than both combined.

Web? etc. Granted I know a lot less about architecture, but I feel the same applies for 4, 5, and 6. Also when searching for salaries vs jobs, the categories can lead to incomplete data.

I've never taken a system design course nor do I have any experience in system design. (I'm a Cybersecurity analyst (CISSP) and project manager, not an engineer) . The recruiter stated that I wouldn't be getting security questions but would instead be expected to work vulnerability analysis into my system design answers.

TL;DR name a few tech companies (if at all) which are as exciting and adventurous as working at places with mission control rooms like SpaceX, NASA, NSA, NORAD etc. Need to be places which do not only hire US citizens cuz I ain't one :p &amp;#x200B; There are innumerable articles/rankings about which tech companies provide the best work environment, which ones give a lot of perks, which companies are the best to work at etc etc. But I haven't yet found even one article naming a few companies which might be the most exciting to work at. I understand that ""exciting"" doesn't mean the same for everyone; if someone likes the work they do, they will find their job exciting. Moreover, for us CS people, our jobs are usually at a desk which in itself isn't that adventurous or exciting. I don't know what kind of answers I am looking for, but I can at least give an example of one company that comes immediately to my mind - **SpaceX.** They are building rockets; and the employees keep working on one project for years and decades, and ultimately on one particular day they get to see if it all worked or not. There is that excitement, that nail-biting moment, that moment of adrenaline rush when there is a successful(or failed) launch, which really makes it feel like an achievement. Not to ignore the fact that their work is very meaningful too. I guess the workplaces I am looking for are the kinds of places that have something along the lines of a mission control room, or who work on a operation-to-operation basis. Something that comes to mind are maybe cybersecurity companies that might have those occasional nights when all/most of them might have to work to stop an attack(speculating), or organizations that do disaster management where they save lives when some calamity occurs(time being an important factor for both). Most tech companies usually just have certain products which they are improving, or adding features to. This is a continuous process, and usually happens on a team-by-team basis and not company-wide. It is not something like ""Oh, the entire company has worked on this for the past two years, and TODAY we get to know if this becomes a success or not."" Maybe launching a new iPhone might be something similar, but it is not even nearly as exciting what I wrote above. Can you name some companies, organizations where the work might be similarly exciting/adventurous?"

Everyone pushes to master on git. Also worked on another project using python and dealing with some basic data analytics regarding location data. I think overall I am okay with my job, but want something new in the coming year or two. # My Questions 1. Will a lack of significant experience using an OOP language and creating software hinder me in finding my next job? 2. If the above is true, is it worth it to make some sort of project in C#, Java, etc to brush up on skills? 3. I think my interviewing soft skills are fine.

Would it make sense to learn ansible, jenkins, and other devops tools to become more employable? Perhaps I can apply all these tools to a project combined with the above language that I dive into. 6. What percent of my time should I spend studying for algo/ds problems versus working on a personal project? 7.

I've completed a cybersecurity internship and have an above average grasp on IT fundamentals, as well. I wouldn't say im desperate, but I have about two months worth of savings left before I'm going to feel the pain of not being employed for 6 months in order to switch careers. The obvious red flags can be clearly seen in the marketing and grammar. But, +$60k/year is *twice the amount* that I've ever made and that definitely has some weight to it. I don't have anyone to go to for advice. I have immigrant parents who are reaching retirement ages and wouldn't understand all the factors regarding this to help me make a sound decision. My friends aren't tech savvy, and I'm at that stage in life where everyone is having kids and focused on their own families. Hopefully you guys could give me some input. **If I go..** I'll be leaving my girlfriend and two dogs here in SoCal and will essentially be setting up a life for us in Virginia for the next 12-18 months. This doesn't sound so bad, so long as the company that I'm working with is legitimate. And, if the offer that I have with them is worth itthus the reason for this post. **If I stay..** I'll spend the next month working on making projects for my portfolio, mastering common interview questions, attending programming meetups and applying and interviewing like my life depends on it. There is no guarantee of any success. I very well may run out of money, but I could snag a part-time gig to float me until I earn a decent dev job. **Notable facts** * I've read the Antra Inc.'s glassdoor reviews. It has given me cause for concern, but I need more feedback. * I can't find Antra Inc. on the VA Better Business Bureau site, which isn't a good sign to me. * I requested the companies Employer Identification Number which is: 26-1765515 and their E-Verify number which is 406519, but I don't know how to verify those numbers to any trusted database. Do I call the IRS and ask them personally? * Signing this initial offer letter doesn't commit me to the $12,000 commitment. \- It guarantees me accommodations in provided housing for the two week training/orientation. At the end of those two weeks, if I pass an exam, I will be presented with the actual contact with commits me to the contract details listed in the imgur link at the top of this post. For the entire duration of the training program, housing will be provided. * This would be my first job as a web developer. * I have about a week to decide if I should take the dive and fly there. If I do go and hate it, that's two weeks out of the two months that I have left for my savings. Thanks in advance for any help, everyone! &amp;#x200B;"

Where I live (not in the U.S.), there are only full time degree/diplomas courses which I cant attend because I have a full time job. There are post grad courses as well but they require a CS degree or years of experience in cybersecurity. Ive seen replies here that say a CS degree is not required to work in that field, and that certifications are more relevant. I currently work in an MNC and Im wondering it its enough to attain those certs as qualification? Im thinking it will be easier to move within my organization and gain some experience there to make up for the lack of formal education in CS. "

643,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Career advice for a web developer,1,ae0gne,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ae0gne/career_advice_for_a_web_developer/,2019-01-09 10:34:57,"Hi, web developer here. **TLDR**: I don't want to do web development forever, I want to do something that will be relevant for a long time (I don't think web will be). I think that's machine learning/iot/ai, but I don't know what to choose. I am starting this degree this year: [URL I am open to suggestions. **Who I am**: I started studying web development in 2016 from scratch, I landed my first job in Italy in 2017 (full stack Angular, Laravel, Linux). One month ago I (**unexpectedly**) received an offer and moved to London for twice the salary to work with Angular (front end position, C# on the backend). I tried to keep myself up to speed with the bleeding edge, and I did it until I found a job, then it became quite more difficult. **Where I am now**: I started a cybersecurity course at the university in Italy before even thinking about London, which was in October (2018). I thought I would be able to get out of Italy only after getting a degree. But just a few weeks later I started receiving HR messages on LinkedIn, and now I'm here. I am dropping out because I didn't study anything since I was moving here and I don't feel like going back to Italy 10 times a year to do the exams (It's an online course, but you have to go there for the exams). I still want to pursue a degree for the value of the piece of paper and the opportunities that come with it (mainly for immigration to other countries \[Australia, USA (maybe)\]). **Why I started**: I wanted to learn programming and JavaScript was the most accessible technology to learn at the time. **Why I want to change**: I want to know what's ""out there"". I don't want to work with the first and only path I have found. I feel like it's frustratingly tiring to stay on the bleeding edge, especially for web development. I also believe that in less than 10 (5?) years web development won't be paying as good as it is now unless I become highly skilled with something specific. But to me, it feels like digging deep until one day you hit the bedrock and can't dig anymore, then you have to find another place and start from the surface again. **The problem**: There are so many things to explore out there that I really don't know what to pick and where to start. So far I've been playing with JS (node), python and Linux only. I am enrolling again here in London for a BS degree in CS ([URL As you can see there are many opportunities for the specialization. I think web and mobile would be the easiest and most obvious choice, but I will feel like I would be missing out *a lot* of things. I think the future is in AI, IoT, decentralized things, machine learning, and not the web, but the web is the easiest path for me now. **What I like**: Money. JavaScript, Linux, Node JS, learning new things, automation. I get excited about learning new things. **What I don't like**: I'm not sure, java."

This semester's CS assingments have been getting tougher by the day and despite the fact that I start everything early, prioritize things, work in realistic and controlled periods , I still struggle. Don't get me wrong: So far I've managed to finish everything before deadline but the road hasn't been easy. Even when I put my hearth and soul into it, I can't possible finish any of the CS assignments without help from friend, TA or professor alike. Hell, the other day for an image filter I had to create an algorithm depending on the input to either do an NxN matrix of 1's or NxN matrix with 1's placed in a diamond shape (all zeroes outside the shape). It took me staggering three hours to do this one part of a bigger assignment when the median time for that was \~20min among my friends - these are guys who saw text editor the first time little over two months ago. It doesn't seem to matter how hard I try, how I break the problem down to smaller components and try different approaches&amp;analyze what has been asked, I still - almost constantly - fail to see the pattern for general abstraction. And even when by dumb luck see the goal my way of implementing it is (objectively) so subpar it ashames me - my algorithms are so, so bad. Before you even say it, yes I know what imposter syndrome is. I'm going to call it out now and say that I'm less smart - have lower iq; inferior fluid intelligence bare minimum - than my friends. These are guys who didn't know any single thing about programming few months ago and now find so elegant solutions that TA's seem to learn more from them that the other way around. The reason why I get by is because I can ask well articulated questions have good work ethics. That's it. That's the bag of tricks I have. Why I'm stressing/ranting this out is because for the past few weeks defeatism has loomed on my mind, and I have a pretty worisome picture that at best I'll be a person who has had his crystallized intelligence increased with all the algorithms I'm going to learn and nothing more. I would love to be a part of machine learning, AI or cybersecurity in the future but I don't know how well can you perform in those topics in the real world without having even a bit of creativity and/or ability to think outside the box. &amp;#x200B;"

I know a few things, but I'm aware that I will be constantly learning until I can call myself an ""expert"". While I know that you don't need a college degree in order to learn programming, I'd always been curious as to what is really taught in a CS degree, so I started doing some research on my own. Eventually I was reading through first year books about Introduction to computing and stuff and found it all really interesting. I think that I want to get back to college in order to purse a CS degree. My concerns are two: 1) Since I am going to be working at the same time, I have no choice but to sign up in a distant learning school. Has anyone got any experience with one of these? 2) Ever since I started programming, my mind has gotten more analitic and less mehanical, but I am aware that I still have not made the full switch to a mathematical brain. I plan to start September next year with a few subjects and see how it goes, so I have the rest of the year 2019 to get around a few subjects or courses on my own. What do you recommend? That would be everything. Overall, I'm a 25 year old guy, and I plan to do this degree in a MAX amount of 9-10 years. Do you think the movement is worth it, or would you advise a different career path? My dream job would be working in Cybersecurity somehow, and I think that CS would get me there somehow "

I already did a 6 month software engineer coop at a very small biotech company and the experience was ok. It wasn't anything great and I felt burned out at times.

I didn't really have a team there and worked alone on projects while getting feedback and code reviews from my seniors. For my second coop I wanted to try something security related despite not having security experience because it seemed interesting and would mean less coding. I still want to do some coding but I'm not sure how likely I can get my manager at PwC to allow me to do things such as pentesting. The job still seems interesting and is something I'd like to try but I'm afraid it'll hurt me later on if I want to go back to software engineering or a more technical security job.

Six months is also an extremely short time to make a change, but I must decide ASAP because if the divide is done, there is absolutely no chance of me transferring over without paying compensation.

Ive had an interest in computers since I was a kid, so a lot of concepts Ive come across researching cybersecurity werent completely foreign to me. I also go to a magnet school for IT, so Im alright at Java and Python (5 on AP exam for APCS). Definitely have the mindset that cybersecurity is the field I want to work in when Im older. Im considering going straight into the field instead of college (mainly to avoid student loans) and was wondering what you guys thought of that, as well as if I do go through with that an idea of a step in the right direction. The main thing Ive been looking at acquiring were a security clearance and certifications. Then just get some work experience to substitute for a degree. I went through Professor Messers Sec+ playlist and feel like I already know almost every topic mentioned in the course, so I could probably review a bit and just take the exam and pass it. The main cert I wanna get before im out of high school is the PWK/OSCP. PWK I plan on starting as soon as I get my first paycheck from the job im gonna start next week most likely. Any suggestions on other certs would be great, definitely looking at the CISSP as well. Main problem is that it requires 5 years of experience. Speaking of work experience, I would love to hear any suggestions on how to build that aspect of my resume. Im likely going to get a job as a help-desk technician, which I know isnt a huge deal, but at least its giving me some computer related experience to build off of. If you guys know any jobs that would allow a 17 year old to get a security clearance, that would be huge. Finally, I was wondering if anyone could give some estimates on what I could make if I went this route instead of college. Like 5 years down the line when I would hopefully have a good amount of certs and work experience (maybe TS clearance since thats one of my main goals), compared to if I was fresh out of college with no work experience and maybe a few certs. So to sum up all my questions: Would I be better off not going to college, and just straight into the field? And what salaries I would be looking at with each option? What would be a good certification path for me (given that I have a solid understanding of cybersecurity, but nothing too advanced)? Some websites and books recommendations would be great (Ive went through Cybrarys TCP/IP course, it was alright but still felt really basic). Any other general career suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

I want to move on, as I feel myself being pidgeonholed into superficial IT risk audit/internal audit type of work. Knowledge wise, I know a reasonable amount of Python scripting, I got my Security+ cert and I like to think of myself as having very good general technical sophistication - I know a bit about everything, but lack deep knowledge. I have too little experience to proceed with CISSP of OSCP which are my next targets in terms of certs.

I am at a loss here of what to do, but I feel like I could either: a) stay at my current role, continue to develop my cybersecurity and IT skills and re-apply for pentesting/cybersecurity engineer role in the next 6-12 months b) take the product manager role, befriend engineers and try to switch internally c) take the product manager role, do cybersecurity sales until I fall in love with it or until I can proceed to the next tier of cybersecurity jobs Ultimately, my goal is to become Cybersecurity manager, CTO or CIO and I feel like I have a reasonable start business-wise (Economics degree, business/market research consulting career with good track record, tenure at prestigious firms) but I am really lacking in technical skills, which is I would prefer engineering/consulting roles over sales.

671,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,I worked a college career fair earlier this week - some advice,567,9fiaz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9fiaz8/i_worked_a_college_career_fair_earlier_this_week/,2018-09-14 00:10:03,"I spent 5+ hours talking to prospective candidates for internships and full time positions. I met a lot of great people. I met a fair number of hard passes. Here are some things I'd recommend for career fair attendees, at least at the college level. 1. These things are meat grinders. You need to stand out, in a positive way, in a short timeframe. That being said, the bar for standing out is pretty low. We have to get through a large number of candidates in short order and I'm looking for something, anything. This environment is pretty much terrible for actually interviewing so we're going to keep it light but you have to give me something. 2. Phone screens or interviews will always follow the career fair and we'll get more detailed and technical then. Remember, this is a meat grinder - not an optimal interviewing experience. 3. Most of us are looking for people we want to spend 40 or so hours per week with. Things that positively stand out are bubbly personalities, some kind of interesting activity, the ability to answer questions in a conversational nature, displaying interest in what I'm saying, laughing, some kind of technical or non-technical project, etc. Remember, meat grinder. The bar is low for this stage. 4. Keep the technical detail relevant but somewhat minimal. If I ask you for more details, provide it. But don't bombard me with highly specific domain knowledge in some field I probably have never worked in nor know anything about. Even if I do know about the field, I don't want to hear about it. I've been talking for hours, there are people in line behind you, and I just don't have time to listen to high technical specific information. 5. They can become loud, especially during prime time. Speak up. If you're soft spoken you need to work on that. If I constantly have a hard time hearing you I'm going to pass. 6. Prime time is probably the worst time to go. Try showing up at the start of the career fair when there are less people there. Once it's prime time the meat grinder is in full on churn mode and we have to cycle through people more quickly because long lines won't stay long for very long as candidates drift away. 7. Dress appropriately. Suits are fine but not necessary. Don't wear shorts and sandals. I'll fast track you for the ""no"" pile before I even say a word. I'm not looking for the next cover model of GQ (but if you can pull that off by all means do so). 8. Don't try to bullshit me. I'm older, have a fine tuned bullshit radar, and have many more years of bullshitting experience than you. I'll pick up on it. You're still in college and haven't saved the world yet, otherwise you wouldn't be talking to me. Just be honest about your experience. 9. Know what you want to say about yourself beforehand but be prepared to deviate from the script. Handing me a resume and standing there like a log is bad. Nothing too long, please; if it's long I'm just going to cut you off and start trying to do my thing instead of hearing you ramble on. I would say a few, 3-4, sentences about who you are and what you're looking for is a good way to start the conversation. ""Hi, my name is ABC, I'm a sophomore in CS looking for an internship this summer. I have interests in both data science and cybersecurity. &lt;some personal fact&gt;."" Boom, great intro. 10. Remember, meat grinder. Stand out. You're not going to get leetcoded and we're not going to leetcode. Meat grinder."

I did an internship with Raytheon IIS, got an offer from there, but I hated the environment there so I asked for an interview with their branch that does vulnerability research. I got an offer from there as well as a Vuln Researcher but I passed on it since it was located in the middle of nowhere, and my biggest goal is to move out into a big city. I wanted to get into malware analysis. However, I didn't realize until a few months ago that cybersecurity is not a field you go into straight out of college.

Honestly, after spending so much money and effort on my college degree, I don't want to start off in the same place people with no degrees start off at. I was already planning on taking off 3 months after college (there are a lot of personal security projects I want to work on), so my start date would be late March-early April.

I am looking for advice if potentially taking another year on my CS degree will look terrible or not. I believe that the context of me doing so is a little outside the norm, so Ill go ahead and share it. I spent my entire life up through High School doing Classical Music and Opera, while honing my coding skills and doing front end web development as a hobby. I knew going into college I would want to double major in Computer Science while also getting a B.M. in Vocal Performance. This was necessary for any sort of Opera career. I was dead set on an opera career after studying abroad during High School in Italy. My entire worldview was shaped by going to a High School that heavily pushed music and I was heavily encouraged by my Vocal teacher to go school at the school she taught at, where I would basically guaranteed get roles. I wont give the name of the school, but it was a minor school within the UW (University of Wisconsin) college system. Despite being accepted into the likes of Carnegie Mellon and Texas A&amp;M, my Dad's alma mater and my #1 CS school pick(And now my greatest regret) , I chose to go to said no name school as my entire worldview was shaped by music. What a fucking mistake. In my Music program, I was taking 18+ credits of Music classes for my Freshman year, and while I was doing well, I was only able to self study for Computer Science. By my second semester, I was becoming worried that I would not be able to juggle both CS and music at this school, and made my concerns known to my advisor who also happened to be one of my professors (Huge conflict of interest, but small school made your professors sometimes overlap as your advisors). After speaking with my Vocal teacher who kept on pushing me in opera, which I was successful in, but was beginning to find just how much money I would have to spend on grad school and also terrified from sunk cost fallacy of how much money I had already sunk (Young Artist Programs and Vocal Lessons are very expensive) I began to see that the people in my music life were not out for my personal best interest. Couple this depression arising in second semester from being the only music major who also was self-studying CS and had a huge interest in it, while constantly being encouraged to stop (sometimes to an abusive degree by said vocal teacher) caused me to look into transferring. For the sake of my mental health and future financial wellbeing, I knew I had to transfer schools. This vocal teacher, who I turned down other schools for, turned almost abusive when I came to her in my Depression asking for help because I felt like an outcast from the other music students who shunned me for ""not fully pursuing music"". Despite this, I aced my juries and had a pretty good GPA. My twin sister had established in-state for my family at a state school that had a promising CS program. My Dad, thrilled I wished to fully pursue CS and now having just divorced my Mom ( Who was the primary force in getting me to choose the worse school for music) said he would help me financially pay for school as long as I had in-state. This eliminated Carnegie Mellon, A&amp;M, and the other dream schools that I had the pick of in HS, But this state school was still an INFINITE improvement over the music school. Luckily, I had not nuked my GPA from first semester, although it was starting to slip by second. In my Depression, I quickly submitted a transfer application second semester and direct admitted into the CS program. I finished out my freshman year at the previous school, and began taking CS classes as a full on CS major in the fall. Still trying to pursue Music, I took some music classes the first semester while taking my 100 and 200-level CS courses (I had already knocked out most geneds) . I quickly realized I no longer wanted Music as a career in my life, and switched fully over to CS. It has been a year, and I am happier than ever. Leaving the abusive music environment was the best choice I ever made and I am now on the prowl for internships as I am putting myself through Honors Data Structures and Algorithms. I love CS with all my heart. As a result of this chaotic freshman year, though, I feel somewhat quite behind in terms of CS credits. I need a certain amount of hours in 300 and 400 level classes, and am pursuing a Cybersecurity focus which requires me to take even more advanced math (Further than just Calc II which I have already taken and passed). Unless I take 17 credit+ semesters and classes over the Summer, I simply do not feel like I can finish within my 4 years. While I have taken some summer school, all the courses I need to take require a large commitment and I worry they would detract from my ability to pursue an internship with full commitment. Basically, knowing this information, would taking an extra year to finish my CS degree hurt me in the job market at all once I get out? Would it be conspicuous enough to hurt my postgrad and internship search? "

IDK which way to take my training though. From what I've been told a master's program is going to require serious dedication over 3-5 years if I'm going part time. Whereas a master's cert program is maybe 12 weeks but it's just a certification of master's level courses in a concentration (looking at Stanford master's certs in cybersecurity for instance).

So, I've noticed a lot of programs which are specific to Cybersecurity, InfoSec, etc. are designated ""Master's of Professional Studies"" at Penn State and Villanova (just two of the places I've looked at since I'm in PA) and the ME or MS are very general like MS in SWE, or ME CE/EE (and of you look at the classes for either of these programs they sound extremely general). I like security and enjoy doing DevOp related work (automation, pipelineing, etc) but IDK if a MSP is a legit degree or some bullshit program to make money. P.S. If you have recommendations for other online Master's programs related to my interests feel free to recommend them to me. I'm trying to keep credit cost per hour under $950 though"

686,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Name and Shame: FDM Group (a consulting company),214,985lxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/985lxd/name_and_shame_fdm_group_a_consulting_company/,2018-08-18 06:15:21,"I've seen the recent *Name and Shame* trend going on here, and figured I would get in on the action. One of the recent shames was about a consulting company *Revature* (which I was also unfortunate enough to be involved with); and it reminded me of my experience with a similarly shady consulting company known as FDM Group. FDM is very similar to *Revature*, but they offer consulting services for a variety of technology related services, not just Software Development. As they put it *""FDM Group is a global professional services provider with a focus on IT, FDM brings people and technology together.""* One of the most interesting parts about the position was the client list. FDM has dozens of fortune 500 clients, I believe Bank of America was even one of their clients. I thought any experience with a company of that size would look amazing on a resume for a future job. For a little background on me, as an Undergrad I was a dual major in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. This particular consulting position I applied for at FDM was a cybersecurity position; although I had a few Computer Science friends go through extremely similar experiences to the one I am about to describe. I applied to the position after being contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, we talked briefly about my background on the phone; after I threw around a few Cybersecurity buzzwords the recruiter seemed extremely eager to get me onto the next step. The position initially sounded like a very exciting opportunity. It promised 8 weeks of salary-grade paid training in NYC, paid housing throughout the training period, paid travel expenses, up to a $1500 relocation package once you were placed with a company, and a variety of other small benefits like this that I cannot exactly recall. The catch was, you had to work as an FDM consultant for two years; if you left before the 2 years were up, you would be billed for all of the expenses FDM incurred on your behalf during your time there. The recruiter said this was usually around $30,000. I had this conversation with the recruiter sometime in early February. I now realize in retrospect how many red flags were there, but I was somewhat desperate for a job and decided to carry on with the interview process. FDM claimed that 80+% of their consultants went on to work for the company they were placed to after their two years at FDM was up; which seemed like an easy way into a mid-level position at a fortune 100 company only two years into my career. The first round interview was a one-way video response screening, or as /u/berk_thrwaway so elegantly put it, [the] lamest method of interviewing that I have ever come across. For those that dont know, you are prompted with a question on screen, and then given 1-2 minutes to record a video response to that question. Absolutely none of these questions were technical, and many of them seemed like questions aimed at managing subordinates (even though this was a starting consulting position). The next round of the interview process was two separate Skype interviews with two different employees. These employees were somehow even less personable than one-way video interview, and they asked the exact same questions. My second interviewer called me 45 minutes later than expected, did not email me telling me he was running late, and did not address that he was 45 minutes late when he finally did call. A few days after this conversation I was notified by my recruiter that FDM would be extending me an offer, and that I was their top candidate for the position. Since I was their top candidate I would be guaranteed housing during my training in NYC (something that I was previously told was guaranteed). I was also told that the start date was June 25th. The recruiter I had was a pretty cool guy, and even encouraged me to keep looking for other positions during this time, which thankfully I did. While I was happy to have received an offer, everything started to go downhill shortly after that. About a week later, I received the formal offer letter; $45,000 for the first year, $51,000 for the second year, and NYC minimum wage during the 8 week training period. The salary being relatively low became quite a concern to me, as you have no idea what company you are going to be placed with after you complete your training. $45k a year in Kansas is much different than $45k a year in NYC. FDM had also gone back on the original job listing (which I had luckily downloaded), promising salary-grade pay during training. I brought up this discrepancy between the offer letter and the job listing to my recruiter, who said that the job listing must have been a mistake as all of their employees receive minimum wage during training. Another weird thing about FDM was they wanted letters of recommendation from all of its new employees, after they had already made the decision to hire them. We were told to bring two letters of recommendation with us on the first day of training, as well as a myriad of other paperwork and disclosures, that I luckily never filled out. In early April the 15-20 consultants that were getting hired with me were all invited to a WEBX on how to fill out a specific health-related benefit package, as well as getting the chance to ask general questions about the company. Half of the Webx participants could not figure out how to connect their audio to call, and a number of them called in from landlines and had no way of seeing the PowerPoint presentation. I might be a little harsh here, but I have no idea how these people were expected to somehow become CyberSecurity/Software engineer consultants in 8 weeks, when they lacked some of the most basic computer knowledge. Everyone that did manage to get their audio connected was extremely personable and well spoken, which I assume is how they breezed through the 100% non-technical interview process. At some point in late April, I received notice that FDM had reached its budget to house new employees during training, and would not be funding my housing during training in NYC. At this point I had already received an offer for much more money from the company I currently work for, and decided to try and leverage this offer with my FDM recruiter. The recruiter told me that the minimum wage pay during training and $45k-$51k salary was entirely nonnegotiable. I ended up accepting my current companys offer, and emailed my FDM recruiter in early May to let him know I was accepting a different offer and never received a response. On June 22nd I was emailed by another FDM employee about what to expect about starting work on Monday morning. I quickly emailed him back to let him know that I had already told my recruiter I had accepted another offer. He responded very personably, wishing me the best of luck, and let me know that my recruiter had left FDM close to two months ago. A Computer Science friend of mine actually went through most of the same process I went through and experienced many of the same things; including the broken housing/pay promises. He attended a week and a half of the FDM training before receiving an offer from another company in NYC, and said that the training was a disorganized mess. Half of his fellow trainees left within the same time he did, none of them had their housing/local transportation costs covered by FDM, all of them were told they initially would be during the interview. He actually talked with a couple of people working there that had recently completed training, but had not been placed into a company yet; by their own accounts they did almost nothing all day except wait to hear back from companies about placement. One person he met at the NYC had actually been placed at a company in South Carolina, received the $1500 from FDM to relocate, relocated and lived/worked there for 6 months before the company terminated all of its external contractors. He was told to move back to NYC and work from the NYC office until he could be placed again. Overall, FDM group struck me as extremely cheap and shady. They seem to pray on the naivets of recent college graduates, and abuse them for two years before turning them over to another company. My advice if you are going through the FDM interview process is to receive an offer from them, and use the more glamorous parts of that offer as leverage for any other offers you might get; I would not recommend getting involved with the company.

It's natural language processing with a cybersecurity impact, but no cybersecurity skills involved. My mentor wants me for my data science skills, and it's what got me into the program. I have no cybersecurity skills other than what I've taught myself, and I don't know why any other cybersecurity professors would take me on. I'm taking a security course this semester, and was excited to do a project to build my skills, but my mentor told me I will be using our NLP project as the project for that class.

So, I have not professionally chosen any streams or a CS path. However, I am usually eager to self-learn things and spend time on it and do not want to wait for a year more to focus on a specific CS field. My first interest in this year was ML. I dug into tensorflow and data science. Learned python for it. I realized that the data science part is pretty boring compared to the machine learning part. So, I preferred to not get my hands dirty with data but use it in a ML algorithm to produce something that is relatively fascinating to me (I am still amazed about how people have come up with these ""magical"" algorithms. Mind-blowing! esp. NNs). But as time moved on, I found that I have been doing the same things over and over again. Only the data I used changed. So I felt like I was doing nothing productive at all but rewrite a program using different dataset. I sought meaningful challenges such as Kaggle but I realized that the challenges there are heavily data mining and cleaning. And only 10 lines of ML code by using Sklearn library (it does everything for you.). So I took a break from ML and stopped practicing it.

But my problem is that, I do not know what I want to program. I have no projects in my mind. I feel like the dumbest when I realize that I know to program but I am not a programmer because I can't critically think for an idea to pursue.

Everywhere I read that there is a massive shortfall in cybersecurity engineers and it is going to continue to rise, because of this, so will salaries. Has anyone actually seen this? Besides statistics and companies saying they need people, I haven't seen any significant salaries beyond 85 to 100k in the field which as far as I am concerned is typical or a little on the low end. Now, I will say I do work for the federal government and would be happy to make those salaries but even in the federal government it would seem as if there are loads of qualified candidates. I spoke with a friend in HR after I wasn't selected for a position and he told me he had over 693 applications to the position. That doesn't really seem like a deficit to me."

I doubt Ill get an offer out of this regardless, theyre experimenting and Im sure they want someone whos more knowledgeable in business and finance (never taken a business class in my life).

My plan is to apply to all the software related positions I can find, both jobs and internships alike. I plan to solidify my computer science fundamentals, especially in data structures and algorithms in the meantime and when this internship is over (mid August). Is this a good plan? I was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences, and would give general advice. Im working in NYC, 40 hours a week at $15/hr. Ill never stop coding, I know that for a fact. Whether or not Im in a high level position one day in my life, Ill never stop. I could answer specific questions, I dont want to rant and have this be a huge post haha. Much love!"

Around October I was interviewed by the department sysadmin and he told me based on my interest in cybersecurity, I would be a better fit at one of the university labs that was doing research into that field. Come December, he emails me and lets me know about the open position. I email the contact and they get back with me over Winter break, apologizing for the delay, and they scheduled me for an interview in late January. Come interview, I pass the whiteboarding and the interviewer shows me around the lab, explains what work I will be doing, etc. All that is left is to fill our a form for human resources. I get the form but due to scheduling conflicts can't meet with him, so I turn it in to the department secretary in early February. I wait 2 weeks and send an email to the secretary, who responded that they did not get the HR form back from the lab, who was supposed to sign it. I wait another 2 weeks and tell a friend about this, who is shadowing at the lab. One of the lab managers they shadow under asks me to come up and they would get it sorted out. So mid-march I go up and meet with them and they explain they just have to sign the form and send it down to the secretary and I can begin \*volunteering\*. Yes, this is a volunteer position. Anyways, late April I still hear nothing so I contact the manager again and he tells me he has no idea where my form went. I send an email to another manager in June and they forward it to the director, who says he or the interviewer will get back with me in a few days. During the timeframe between April and June, one of my friends got hired in a paid position there, skipping the volunteering entirely. Anyways another month flies by and I send an email again asking what happened. Tonight the director replied and told me there are no more open positions. Almost one entire year later, a dead end. I've turned away half a dozen opportunities and patiently waited through a sluggish bureaucracy, just to still not have a position. I have a few ideas of what I can do now. I've been doing business consulting on Upwork to some success and could take it to local companies. I could do web design work for local companies too. Another option is reach out to the PD or Sheriff's department and see if I can intern/shadow there. I've also considered finding forensic projects on GitHub to contribute to, or making my own tools. Any suggestions from where to go from here would be nice. Skills, projects, jobs, even websites. "

This annoys me because work days go by faster if I have plenty of work to do, which I dont at my current job. I do realize that my problem is going to sound weak in comparison to some others, but here it is: Ive never needed to take a technical interview (so I have no experience with them for the future), Ive never needed to take a position other than whatever I looked at first (so Im not as familiar with whats out there other than what I read online), and even salary negotiations have gone in my favor without need for debate (making me think that Im still accepting too little). After all of this, I am left to conclude that maybe I am settling too low in my field. How do I know my worth, and whether I need to move to another state in order to find something better? (there are no big 3s in my area) What is the next logical step after Ive been here for a while? Im going for my masters in cybersecurity and have been asked by at least one professor to join their paid PhD program, but I have no interest in research and fear that more education will take me further away from hands-on work that I love doing. How do I accurately evaluate my self-worth and know when its time to move on to other places, if ever? I have no way of knowing if I lucked into my current position, or if I settled for less. I had no internships in college due to personal preference, so I realize that my inexperience in the workplace limits my current options - I would still like to plan ahead for the future, now rather than later. tl;dr Things are going too well... is it because Im accepting less than Im supposed to?

These programs allow people with no IT background to enter, the first half of the course teaches you the basics and if you have a bachelor's in IT you can skip some of the units.

I couldn't get an internship in the US for this summer despite getting a few interviews, so my parents got me a gig at a company where I'd be working in Beijing through a family connection. I reluctantly took it, because I'd be able to visit and live with family \(my grandparents\) while there. But the company, since they're based in China, doesn't really have an online presence outside, so I'm slightly worried about how that will translate to being able to at least get an internship for next summer. Today, we had a discussion regarding that, and they also want me to give up my next spring semester so I can go back and intern for a company in Shandong, because it's a cybersecurity type position. I haven't even gone for the summer yet, and they're adamant that I go and suspend my undergraduate studies for then. I told them I didn't want to go during that particular semester, because it would be the last time I would get to see and have classes with some of my college friends before they graduate, and am open to doing it a year from then, when I will have graduated, but they said I can't defer because my cousin would be there \(who is studying at UIUC, did this, and has internships in the US for the summer\) and I wouldn't be able to handle the area on my own. They're fixed on this because I haven't been able to get an internship despite trying for two years and trying to do projects here and there for my resume. I haven't told them about my plans to go to grad school though to study data science, which is what I'm interested in ATM, but they seem to be fixated on me getting as much internship experience as possible, which seems crazy to me as most of my other peers seem to have maybe one or two internships before graduating. I'm grateful for the fact that they're getting me these opportunities but I feel like I'm being forced one way and not allowed to do things my own way. Whenever I try and counter though, my parents keep telling me I'll be in a very tough reality for finding a job in the future and that I'm throwing away my career ""for a few friends.""

Granted, I got what I deserved since I procrastinated throughout the school year and didn't apply to as many companies as I should have (took the only offer I got). It's actually through my university (very\-large, well\-known nationally). The office that I work at specializes in cybersecurity. I'm not sure which subfield of CS intrigues me the most. I just know I like coding and the logic that is required for jobs like this. However, I have found myself hating my internship. Ignoring the managerial mistakes ( my supervisors regularly ignore me and are too busy going to meetings and conferences to give me stuff to work on), I do not like this field at all. It is waaaay less technical than I thought it would be. My resume/interview highlighted my experience as a sophomore with classes that I was taking and programming languages that I have used in the past. However, the little work that I do is mostly cleaning up spreadsheets, emailing people, or doing useless software training. So far, nothing I have done has applied my CS knowledge. I wish I could quit, but the internship pays well and I need money for the upcoming school year. I think I have mentally eliminated cybersecurity or anything IT\-related as a potential career path. It doesn't interest me at all and is not mentally stimulating to me in the slightest. I want to focus on software engineering 100&amp;#37; for my next internship and post\-grad employment. The problem is, this summer is kind of a waste so far and I am missing out on valuable knowledge/experience that I can acquire while I am not in school. I only work 4 days a week, so I can devote some time on the weekends to independent work. My question is: where should I start? I am pretty interested in app development, but never started. I'm not sure if I should do Android or iOS. I know Java decently well but I own mostly Apple products. What are the best resources that can I utilize to learn more about this? I am also reading Cracking the Coding Interview as I will be trying hard this upcoming fall/spring to get another internship in between my junior and senior year. TL;DR: My summer IT internship has proven to be a complete waste. What can I do to make my summer productive while focusing more on a traditional software engineering route?

My BS was in biochem, and I am thinking of going back for a comp sci degree of some sort, as my CS classes in college (and outside independent coding) were virtually the only academic pursuits that truly made me feel happy/fulfilled. So my question is very simple: Do I have any business getting an MS (1 year), and if so would said MS leave me at least as employable as the BS guys? Or should I simply just go back and get a BS (2 years)? I like my state school's program for an MS because the classes actually seem quite marketable \-\- they'll teach you things like AI, cryptography, and cyber security, which I *know* would look great on a resume for most companies. That said, the BS could make me look like I have more of a solid foundation. Obviously, doing both would be even better, but I'm really not looking to do another 3\+ years of school. If I was, I'd probably just go for a PhD and call it a day. So what do you guys think on this? Any thoughts and recommendations are welcome, with special attention toward what path makes me the most marketable as a potential employee.

I'm a soon\-to\-be college freshman, starting in the fall at a large university that, from what I understand, has a pretty solid CS degree program and I'm starting to seriously consider dual\-majoring in CS and Biology. I'm not entirely wanting a CS career for the rest of my life, but I'm going to need money fast after I graduate and, since I'm pretty good at math already, I feel like a CS degree might get me the cash I need. Basically, I want to be a vet. Specifically, though, I want to be a wildlife vet at a sanctuary, hopefully abroad, meaning I will be paid next to no money for the rest of my life. Also, vet school is normally about as hard and expensive as med school, but without the payout afterwards. Almost every vet on the planet goes into \*major\* debt trying to get their degree, and many spend the rest of their lives paying it back. It's honestly pretty fucked. Since I'm good at math, am pretty comfortable with computers, and like money, I'm thinking I might be able to swing a CS degree while in school (side note: I'm going to need damn near straight As to get into vet schools, so please let me know if this plan would actually kill me). My (probably kinda romanticized) idea is that I could work in tech during grad school and maybe pick up occasional projects afterwards to support myself while I pursue my dream of being a vet. Theoretically I don't even need a Bio degree, just the pre\-reqs vet schools want. It may also be worth noting that I would be aiming to go to grad school at UC Davis, so I'd be in the proximity of the Bay Area and hopefully would have more opportunities there or within commuting distance than the average city. The problem: vet schools admissions are *cut. throat.* In order to get in, most schools require at least a couple hundred hours working with animals, but a solid applicant is expected to have *thousands* in as many different fields as possible (large animal, clinic, exotic, marine, wildlife...). I'm going to be spending most of my undergrad years trying to get as many vet internships/jobs as possible, and I really don't see anywhere for tech jobs to fit into my schedule. I'm not wanting the Google/Facebook/Microsoft jobs that I think a lot of the people on here are seeking when they graduate, but I *would* want a job. It just seems like there's so many applicants out there that, even if I'm aiming low, I would lose the race to someone way more qualified trying to figure out a game plan while they wait for their big break. If I'm not going to be able to find a job, or if the job I could qualify for would only pay about as much as a job I could get with my veterinary experience (\~$30,000 a year), I just don't think it'd be worth it, so I was hoping for some help figuring this out. A couple questions: 1. What kind of job, if any, could I expect without any experience, apart from my degree? 2. What kind of salary could I get? 3. Are there any other tech\-related degrees that would be more useful for my goals than a straight computer science degree; CS Engineering? Cybersecurity? CIS? Software Engineering? 4. Everyone has pushed me towards STEM careers since I'm a girl who's good at math, and that would OBVIOUSLY make it sooooo easy to get hired /s. Would me being a girl actually make any of this easier? 5. Last but not least: would a major even be *doable* for someone with literally no CS experience? Would I be able to make good grades in it, or would I just burn myself out in the process? Once again, sorry this got so long, and thanks to anyone who made it all the way to the end. Just lookin' for some advice."

I've done a few web projects and really committed lots of time to them, but I hated doing the projects the entire time. Cybersecurity seems to be what I really enjoy doing.

I'm 25, in the military, and currently working a technical job, but not the one I want. I'm the navy equivalent of an electronics technician and I want to pivot into cybersecurity, with programming as a backup plan. For this I've decided I want to get a degree in compsci. Up until now, my plan has been to finish my enlistment, get out and go to a top-end school using my post 9/11 GI Bill. In particular I want to go to Berkeley, which i've heard has one of the best compsci programs in the country. The GI Bill would pay for tuition and give me an allowance that would be enough to cover housing and living expenses. On the flip side, I actually enjoy the military quite a bit now, and I've gotten to the point where the job is fairly easy. I'm currently living overseas in a great area and pulling in ~$4,500 a month plus free housing and medical. I could continue doing this and get my degree while still in the military, but it would be an online degree at a less prestigious college. All in all, I'm unsure of which option to go for. The first option would get me a more prestigious degree and (probably) better education, whereas option 2 would end with more money and less stress. There is also an option 3, which would be applying for the cyber security field **in** the military, and reaping the training and experience that it provides, while hammering out a degree. The downside is that i'd have to enlist for a minimum of 6 additional years, and it's not an easy program to get into. Anyway, I've probably said too much, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on what the real value of going to a high-end brick and mortar school would be. Thanks. TL;DR: Title. "

I am currently on track to pursue my school's accelerated masters program so that I'd be able to graduate with a masters degree instead of a bachelors degree. I do not plan on pursuing graduate school. I was recently accepted into an intensive 3 week coding bootcamp for the summer that essentially guarantees a local internship for the next summer. However I was also personally offered a research position under my cybersecurity professor for the summer that will be 8 weeks long with a $4500 stipend that will be mostly used to cover living costs. The only problem is that these two opportunities are conflicting with each other so I will not be able to pursue both.

I understand that both of these opportunities are amazing as a freshman, however I am not sure which one will benefit me more in the long run. Any input is appreciated! Thanks!"

I was rejected from CS at Purdue, and supposedly it is hard to transfer into their CS program due to competitiveness. I want to focus on Cybersecurity and eventually go into that field. Other differences aside, I am wondering about specifics of Purdue's Cybersecurity program (which is apparently ranked #1) vs. a degree at UMA with a focus in cybersec.

I want to become a great programmer and I find that cyber doesn't have much of is thus far. However, one thing that drew me towards cyber was the promise of a wider availability of jobs (meaning being able to take easier jobs at times, even if for less pay). I was also encouraged that if I liked programming, I could get a cyber job that would be more code-heavy. All I can really say is this: if cybersecurity is *much* more likely to get me a job (that I can code in), I will stick with it. Otherwise, I am switching to software (which is our version of a regular CS degree). "

Is anyone with experience in this field willing to share roughly your salary? I'm not fussed about making loads of money but I would hope to be able to earn enough to save money to eventually put a deposit down on a house etc. Secondly, I turned down multiple software engineering roles because I love coding, but I never enjoyed all the engineering principles that come with the role, all this ""waterfall"" and agile development bullshit bores me, but if I could earn significantly more money as a developer maybe I should reconsider...

I have a chance to earn my masters in cybersecurity to have some documented proof of knowledge and relevant skills before I try to apply for serious cybersecurity positions. My firm is currently growing a cybersecurity unit and I may get an opportunity to test some waters and maybe the first experience right there. But this is probably a year or two from now. So currently I am planning my self-development efforts to have a fairly good skillset by the time I would get an opportunity in my firms cybersecurity unit. AFAIK this field is very extensive and I do not know where to start exactly. I've taken some MOOC courses on general security of information and network systems and I plan to attempt some well-known certificates such as CompTIA. But I am unsure of what exactly do I need to know and how to implement this knowledge. I assume I need to feel confident working in Linux but do I need to know any other programming/scripting language? How far should I go with these languages and associated frameworks? I also assume I need to understand networks in more detail (routing, firewalls and all that jazz) but is there something else that I should learn about? I am also afraid that people who have worked in IT and software development before are going to have a significant advantage over me. If that's the case then where should I start my career in IT and how many years I might need to stay there before I could move to cybersec?"

I talked to my academic advisor last semester about switching to Computer Information Systems but he said that I was already so far into CS and completed the additional math and science requirements, so it would reflect badly on my GPA (~3.3) to switch to an easier major. I just keep hearing from my old high school friends and gaming buddies that they're majoring in cybersecurity, network security engineering, computer systems administration, etc. It makes me wonder what they're learning instead of parallel programming, algorithm complexity, data structures, etc. (Obviously some of these topics can still be relevant in computer security) Am I going to be at a disadvantage with a computer science degree if I choose to pursue a career more focused on network security or cybersecurity? Or does a CS degree carry the same weight as some of the other majors I listed above, assuming I attain relevant certifications?

I have a lot of AP credit so I'm pretty sure I could graduate in 3 years if I did the bare minimum for a CS major (maybe even on the lower end of courseload for 3 years). I think I want to go into machine learning or quantitative finance in which case I'd probably do a masters or PhD after that. The first thing I'm considering is a minor or second major in math or statistics. A minor wouldn't increase my required credits by much but a double major would add at least a semester to my time to graduate. Either option would also mean more difficult classes, but I like math and I think I'm good at it and it would probably be valuable for ML. Second, there's honors. UMD has a two year cybersecurity honors program [ACES](URL which would also add about a semester of credits. I'm not planning to go into cybersecurity, but I'm not opposed to it either, and a big appeal of this and similar programs is the ""living-learning aspect"", living with other ACES students in the nicest dorm on campus. Otherwise I could do the generic University Honors which wouldn't increase my credits as much. There's also departmental honors in CS or math. I'm not completely clear on it but it seems like it would require some research but not many credits? So basically which of these possibilities are worth the extra time, work, and difficulty in terms of getting a masters/PhD and/or a job? I'm getting full tuition and possibly full ride so there'd be little to no extra cost to spending more time in college, but obviously there's lost potential income."

I want to switch my major to IT, and make CS my minor. I would love to get a job in cybersecurity, but my current CS program has almost zero focus on that side of computers. If I were to change to IT, I would learn about networking/socket programming/security, and have more free time to do things that I want to do. For example, I would like to go for some security related certs while studying IT. I do not believe I could work on any certs while doing CS (at least with my capabilities). I have a good gpa in all my CS courses + math courses (3.5+), but I am struggling to stay engaged at this point. I really do not want to continue to have to code (for classes) for hours upon hours a week. I feel burnt out at this point with coding. I am not interested in software development at all. In fact, I would detest a job in software development after college. I really like cybersecurity. But in my current CS program, I am/will not learn almost anything about security in my remaining semesters. I have become proficient in java, C, and python. So I personally do not feel that I need to continue with CS on that side. I won't give up on coding at all, in fact I would keep continuing to improve my skills. But I just hate the idea of having to program for classes. I will also have a cybersecurity related internship this summer, so I'll gain some experience in the field. If I follow through with my plan, by the end of college I should have something like: IT BS degree, CS minor, 1 or 2 security related certs, and cybersecurity internship experience. I really dislike having to program so much at this point, I want to learn a lot more about security. But as it stands, I don't know if I could handle it with my current amount of work. Plus, the IT program provides insight into this field. Would my resume look better for security related companies with a CS degree, or an IT degree with a couple of certs and a CS minor? Like I said, it's not like I will be leaving college without any coding experience. Just have CS as a minor. I have taken many of the upper level CS courses and math courses, but I just want to learn more about the cybersecurity field. Classes I have taken: Calc I &amp; II, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math I &amp; II, Data Stuctures, Computer Architecture, Systems programming. I feel that with the classes I have taken, I am proficient at coding, but have learned nothing in the field I want a career in. Please give me some advice. Would my plan be a bad idea?"

I usually have my life figured out, but now I'm just confused and this is the only subreddit I could find. I've been interested in computer science for years, but my high school had no classes. I was really excited for college and to start to learn more. I went to a cybersecurity camp summer before my senior year of high school at Purdue University and loved every second of it. It really helped me to know what I wanted to do. I was going to go to purdue for a cybersecurity(new major there), but due to cost of it being out of state, I went to a public in state school for computer science. It's only my second semester and I've been in three classes(CS1 was split into 2 classes, A and B.), and I don't like it at all. I did good in CS 1A, and decent in CS 1B, but now I'm in CS 2 with a D. All these classes are are just learning C++. I'm really not into programming too much, and it is really not fun for me. I understand the basics, but I can't seem to do any of the projects or labs we have in the class by myself. The first project was a bigint project, which was supposed to be ""really easy"", and I got a low B. Not bad, but I'm happy with it considering I was confused the whole time, but it was surprising to everyone else when I told them because they all got like 95s and 100s. I tried to get help on it all, but didn't work. I started a study group for the class(I have anxiety so this was really hard for me to do.) I pay attention as much as I can during the lectures, but all it is is the professor coding at the front of the class for an hour and 15 minutes. We had a midterm and I wasn't sure how to study since all the note we have is random .hpp and .cpp files. I've learned nothing from it. Turns out for the exam, he expected us to basically memorize every thing and implement whatever he randomly chose, including from the bigint project, which since mine was incorrect, was difficult to do. Obviously I didn't do good. I plan on going to tutoring more often, but without knowing what I don't know, it won't help too much and I'll just try to get the projects and labs done so I can at least pass with a C so I can continue my major. The classes I'm interested in aren't until later since I need prerequisites for them, but if I can't even do this, I don't know if I'll be able to do those. This class is the prereq for every class after, so if I don't pass, I can't go on. I want to do more of the digital forensics side of cybersecurity, but my school doesn't have much about that except one class that isn't even offered at the main campus. I didn't just go to some random school with computer science and complaining they don't have what I want, I didn't realize it until I got into the classes. I'm in the information security concentration. I'm debating on just changing to forensic science since I loved that when I did it in high school, but I would have to transfer, which I don't really want to do, and I want to do the computer side of it. I do want to get my master's in cybersecurity no matter what. I'm just wondering if this is a normal feeling and if I should continue, or if I should change my major.

Both programs are ranked quite highly at my university. I ended up choosing to major in CIT due to the diversity of topics I would/am learning (I'm really interested in my Systems Design + cybersecurity courses for example), the more practical nature of the courses vs. CS's more theoretical side, and I'm interested in being a project manager one day and I believe the skills from the curriculum will help me achieve that. That being said, I've always been very interested in programming and have always done so as a hobby. I have taken/will be taking a good amount of programming classes in my major and am taking the CS minor for this very reason (even though I enjoy the practical approach of my major, I do see the immense benefit of CS's conceptual view). I've done really well in my programming-related courses for my major + my CS courses and have thoroughly enjoyed them (just finished my DS&amp;A course for CS). &amp;nbsp; One thing that kind of made me question my decision was one of my friends, a CS student, told me I should just switch into CS. He says that it will be better for getting a career in software development than what I am currently doing, I can learn everything I would learn/do from my major as a CS major, and doing a minor in CS isnt going to be sufficient for when I graduate and look for a job. &amp;nbsp; I do see his side of things, however I believe moving into CS will push my graduation back a semester or possibly more, which would mean more money spent (Im already paying a lot to go here). I have lots of mildly to very interesting side projects and two software engineering internships with two well known companies (not primarily software/tech based ones though) and hopefully will have a third next summer. &amp;nbsp; Would it be worth to spend the extra money and time to be a CS major in my position or will I be fine in my internship/job hunt with my current situation?

On top of that, because I had to move before graduating, the last year or so of my education was online, so I didn't have the resources that an on-campus student would have had. I have a few questions about getting started in the right direction, and this seems like a good place to find answers. If any of you could help me out, I would appreciate it so much. This is kind of a long post, so thanks for taking the time to help. Originally my plan was to get into Cybersecurity, which is why I took the effort to get my Cybersecurity minor. After spending some time searching for a Cybersecurity job, I realized that there are not really entry level positions in Cybersecurity and that jobs expect me to have related experience first. I'm starting to transition my goals to work in other fields like programming or network engineering first. This made me start to miss programming in general and I think I might just be happier with some sort of Software Engineering job anyway. Programming was my original passion and Cybersecurity was something I discovered later in college. I'm really conflicted about this and I think it's slowing me down. Everyone always tells me great things about Cybersecurity and I really did enjoy it in college, but now I'm not as sure. Maybe someone here with experience in either Cybersecurity or Software Engineering can help me decide what to focus on? With all of that said, I'm not really sure where to go from here. I'm reasonably comfortable in Java, since that's what we were taught in school, but I only have a little experience in other languages like C++ and Python. Should I be spending time learning new languages to broaden my options and look good to employers, or would my time be better spent reviewing more general programming concepts that I'm probably rusty on? How much information am I expected to know before getting my first job? Also, is looking for a job straight away my best option? Should I first spend time looking for internships, getting certifications, or working on personal projects? Lastly, since I don't have any related experience yet, I want to put as much as I can on my resume. I had a job at a movie theater in a leadership role that was somewhat tech related. I was the lead projectionist and I was responsible for managing and training the other projectionists, operating film/digital projectors, and making the film schedule each week for the theater. Also, I've moderated a relatively large subreddit (about 650,000 subscribers) for about four years now, which has included a lot of teamwork and responsibility. Would listing either of these on my resume seem ridiculous? People I have asked told me to include them, but I wanted the perspective of people more familiar with the industry. I guess what I'm really looking for is what my first steps should be. I feel like I was so focused on graduating that I didn't really plan for what comes next and now I'm not sure what to do. I'm thinking about just applying to as many places as I can and seeing what happens, but I don't want to go ahead and do that if more preparation would have been more successful. I know this seems a little rambly, but I've had all of it on my mind lately and no one to really ask. Again, thanks so much for any help you can offer. "

Depressed so I did more side gigs and extra curricular in my spare time. Got over it and improved performance, but during that time, I had less sleep = shitty performance at job = let go just now. I was working for a cybersecurity firm in Canada as a back-end java developer. I was working there for 9 months and just got let go this morning because of my performance. I'm kind bummed out, but at the same time, feel so less stressed. I felt like I was in limbo. This was a new grad position that I got during my Winter 2017 semester. I was supposed to graduate in the Summer 2017, but I didn't. I only had electives left and delayed it till now just because I couldn't handle working and studying together. It was an intensive role that I was pretty unqualified for. Heavy microservice development that used a lot of concurrency and database knowledge (which I sucked at, but developed my knowledge during my time there). I'm currently taking one course so I'm still a student and haven't graduated. This is my last course. I'll be graduating by May 2018. With that said, I have around 2 years of development experience. I've done: - 3 month internship as a Dev at a startup (kernel dev) - 12 month co-op at a large telecom firm (dev, test automation) - 4 month co-op at a well known company (not Big 4, web dev) - 9 months at this cybersecurity firm as a NEW GRAD (dev) Extra BS/Resume bloat: - 10 months as a co-founder of a startup (CTO), i left after - Went through a 4-month startup accelerator - One of the leads at a tech non-profit - I co-founded a non-profit (related to AI) that I run - I've done AI research at my university - I actively develop my knowledge on AI - Did the Deep RL bootcamp. - Did a rails bootcamp remotely (via videos) - I've done plenty of hackathons,conferences, meetups to build my knowledge and stay relevant - I have a strong back-end knowledge, especially in web development. I'm pretty good with straight up java development and can also work with databases (ie. Implementing Retention Periods &amp; Partitioning). I know the stuff above are just titles. The point is, I like to learn and I like to develop, but my heart wasn't at the job at all. I was ALWAYS depressed and wanted an escape. I wasn't fan of the culture at all and my team mates were discouraging af. I was also doing way too much concurrently while working. I was lacking sleep and every day was a grind, which affected my performance. That IS MY FAULT, but my heart wasn't there either. I'm now ready to drop some stuff and focus entirely on work because I need a stream of income to support myself and my family. At the same time, my heart is in AI &amp; Health, but that won't be a viable income source for now, especially if I join a startup. I need to calm down on the side hustle stuff. Lastly, I was in a relationship that went wayyy downhill and was toxic, which made me depressed AF and made me want to do more extra curricular stuff in my spare time, which meant less sleep = shitty performance at work. That ended like 3 months ago. I'm over her and don't think about it anymore. My question is: How hard would it be to get another dev job? How bad would it look? This time, I'm going to look very carefully at the culture and also make sure it's a product I actually care about. I also feel like I should just get an easier dev job at a telecom or something and avoid small sized companies. "

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of social good/international development and technology, as well as in picking up knowledge and skills in AI, cloud computing or cybersecurity, but anything goes really. I'm still relatively new to CS -- started self-learning a bit more than a year ago. Would sincerely appreciate any suggestions or advice! Thank you very much :)"

I have been through a lot of these pages as well as the ITCareerQuestions sub and other online sites trying to get a grasp on what I want to do when I leave service. I am being medically retired (nothing crazy, due to medication required to treat hypersomnia) after 11 years of service. I am 30 years old. I have held a TS/SCI clearance for the past 6 years (currently only a TS since I transferred out of my SCI job last year) and my background/specialty is in Physical and Communications Security/Crypto Management. Now, I know none of that has anything to do with cyber or even computers in general, however, I believe that my strict attention to detail and analytical skills, on top of the kicker of my Security Clearance can get my foot in the door as long as I devote my time to mastering my new craft by attaining certifications and a degree. I have a deep interest in the field and want to transition into it. I should be out of service by this time next year. I am going to an orientation at University of Tampa this weekend to meet with an advisor for the Cybersecurity BS degree they offer. With my military experience, half of the degree is done already, so I think this is a good starting path. I also have great resources to me as a veteran that give me free training for literally any IT certification you can name, provided by institutions such as Carnegie-Mellon, MIT, Georgia Tech, and many more. I know that was a winded backdrop, but here is my list of questions for everyone here.: 1) What is the best route of out of the classroom training (i.e. Certifications)? Is there a good order to do them in? 2) Is it worth my while to even get a BS in Cybersecurity? Could I save myself 2 years and get into the industry quicker? 3) As an outsider, I have no social contacts in the industry. What is a good way to meet and learn from people who do the job every day? 4) Finally, and probably more importantly, how do I choose the direction I want to go as far as my specialty in the industry or is it something that just comes to you during schooling/opportunities provided to you in the workplace? I thank you for all your time, advice and input. I'm excited for this new chapter in my life and want to make sure I am as prepared as possible."

My experience with my AP CSP so far has been positive. While the development side of my coursework is fun, i cant picture myself writing code for the rest of my life. Because of some personal family experience i found myself drawn to law enforcement for the longest time. No matter what my current career plans were i always kept law enforcement in the back of my mind. And in looking at the type of work done by Computer forensic examiners, i can get past the fact that they look at some truly disturbing material from time to time by looling at the demand for both forensic and cybersecurity specialists. I know that demand shouldnt be the only factor in deciding future job prospects. i am also aware that a degree is also not a ""golden ticket"" into a cushy salary. But in looking at the coursework for both degrees i found that an IT degree deals with the processing, organization, and security of data while CS deals with the development and improvement of code. based on these factors it seems like the IT degree would be a little better for this field (computer forensics). I could be looking at both degrees completely wrong, but this is the overall idea i got from looking at the classes and jobs typically associated with the degree paths. my university's IT program offers plenty of room for one or more minors which i plan to fill with a minor in Statistics. i am also in close contact with a Raytheon engineer that is able to get me an internship as an IT specialist. i have no real problems with aquiring a security clearance at the moment and plan to keep it that way. I hope to use this degree and experience to get into AFOSI and then hopefully with another agency such as the FBI. sorry if this post seems unorganized. im still recovering from the flu and have a 102 fever at the moment.

Just got an offer at both Amazon and Salesforce for a summer internship, and though I'm beyond excited that I was fortunate enough to have this opportunity, I'm torn trying to choose one over the other and wanted to hear what others had to say from their own past experiences or what they've heard of from companies from colleagues. The pros of Amazon from what I can tell is that I find Amazon's work really interesting. I have a huge interest in cybersecurity and somewhat of an interest in data science which draws me to Amazon with their work in AWS and Alexa. I'd love to be in Seattle and find the thought of living in a new city for the summer to be really interesting, and think that Amazon's 'name' would be impressive and would help me in the future. The issues I have with Amazon is the apocalyptic stories of their company culture, work-life balance, and expectations from their employees. Though I'm sure these stories are somewhat exaggerated for media attention, I have lingering fears that Amazon could be working their employees to the bone with little concern for their work-life balance especially when I contrasted it with Salesforce's ""Ohana"" culture. I have heard that any of these issues are few and far between when I asked my friends who worked at Amazon last summer and are largely team dependent, but I heard many complaints about the AWS team and that was something that I was interested in working on. I don't have an immediate interest in Salesforce's work but was really impressed with how well it seems like they treat their employees. They offered me a very large housing stipends which I could just keep since I live in the area and tons of cool perks that go beyond Amazon's free bananas and dog parks. My concern with Salesforce is that the location I was extended an offer from is not their headquarters in the Bay Area and am somewhat concerned that the office might not be what I expect. Salesforce pays less hourly but with the stipends would give me a few thousand more at the end of the summer, especially since I live in near the area so I could eat at/commute from home. If it means anything I thought the Salesforce interview was really easy, the technical question I was given would have taken anyone less than 2-3 minutes to solve. Amazon had a few rounds of many design-oriented questions where my interviewer would have cool conversations with me and created hypothetical situations to make me rethink what I was doing, even when it was 'right'. I'm not sure if that would reflect in the interns if one company was more selective than the other, but it's just something to note.

I just handed in my notice (less than 30 mins ago) to my office job since I just signed my new job offer to work part time at a helpdesk. The pay is $14.50 per hour, including weekends, which is more than my current job but less than overall because of the hours. I took this job because they are taking me with zero relevant qualification/cert/ experience and better a job now than a potential job few months down the road. One major reason is that this job allows me to have more time for study and it is actually in the ICT industry relevant to my interest! I do realise that my helpdesk role is going to be very scripted but it is for an MSP and a developer will be on hand at certain hours so I wanted to have the chance to grow horizontally. Unfortunately the HR has no good examples, only those who did dev and went into BD. I'm pretty sure their workplace is 90% programmers/developers and 10% IT. I do think I will need to pick up coding/scripting either way so I signed up for a free module at my alma mata university which will start in January. My eventual goal is to get into cyber security which might take 2 years to 5 years going by my plans. I'm also tempted to study big data and ML because i feel like it would definitely be useful for security but it feels like I would be spreading myself too thin... Should I drop the CompTia A+, take ITIL, the programing module (i'm 99% sure it will be C) and then maybe move on to CCNA/Network+/Security+ while taking the second degree/diploma in cyber security? Or just drop the CompTIA route, take the cyber security degree/diploma, and learn more big data (SQL, python, etc) in the meantime? The assumption is that my degree/diploma will be more recognised, which it is to local companies at least (outside of USA). I do want to have the opportunity to work overseas though..

I'm an international student, but I do have a work authorization EAD that allows me to work without the need for H1B, but I will definitely benefit from the H1B. 2- Before starting university, I was a game server administrator and in-game systems programmer of an online game project in MENA countries with over than 26000 players (it's a Korean game adapted into MENA countries). I utilized my cut of the revenues to get an education in the USA, but I think I chose the wrong university to start my bachelor's education in. My high school GPA - even with all the work involved in the online game - was 3.84 that was evaluated into 4.0 in the American system. So I could've chosen a better university for my education, what happened happened, so I won't cry over spilled milk. 3- Now at the university, I'm a student worker as programmer and Network engineer in the IT department for almost 2 years. In the last 2 months, CS department wanted me to do some TA work in cybersecurity and help setting up the CS systems cluster for expansion, so I'm working 50/50 in both jobs at school while maintaining a full-time schedule as a senior CS student. 4- I participated in ICPC NA regionals for two years, and my team got the 12th and 16th position on the site. Also, did a hackathon and won the third position. I'm also an active member of ACM chapter and a judge for their programming competitions. 5- I did intensive interviews a with fortune 100 company that decided to hire me for a very good salary, but they ended up not extending the offer due to my nationality and export regulations and sanctions on my country. So I basically lost a decent job offer due to that. 6- I received a network programming job offer at a local company to do part-time work for 23$/hr until I graduate. I will start working very soon, but I don't see myself doing a ~$50k job after graduation, especially after my experience with the fortune 100 company that might have offered ~$75k with tons of perks and bonuses. Now, I'm kind of lost, most top tech companies look for top CS schools graduates, and it feels that they insta-neglect people in my position. I don't have a sturdy connections base to find someone who could help me in my job hunt. Building myself up for this route took me years of intense hard work since the days of high school. I don't know where and how to effectively start. I applied to many tech companies that I see their set of requirements fit me, but only heard back from one or two. So any suggestions, pieces of advice, and recommendations are really appreciated. "

It was in data science and I learned a lot about Apache Spark, parallel computing, Oracle, etc. 3. I have really strong written and oral communication skills, but I'm not really sure if my resume is optimized because to be honest, I'm not 100% sure how a resume should be.

I'm planning to apply for the reddit software engineering internship, but it's already been broadcasted here so I imagine the competition will be S T I F F. Also, I don't have a LinkedIn or a portfolio. I legitimately don't understand what the point of those are. I'm not allowed to share the stuff I did in my internship because it's company property.

The one place that did interest me turned out to be super sketchy and seemed wayyy too eager to get me shunted down a pipeline that led nowhere good. I don't want to do cybersecurity, or make someone else's code more efficient. I used to want to do more data science but I don't really want to do that anymore either (hate statistics). I want to write code that furthers an unrelated cause. This could be game development that brings a story to life, designing a database for a hospital that doesn't have much standardization, or anything like that. What should I do? I was hoping to look into research opportunities with professors at my school to gain some experience for my resume. But the classes that brought my GPA down were CS classesI always get B's and C's. I think I've grasped the concepts in the classes more firmly over time, and if I went back and retook the early ones I'd do much better. It's the breakneck pace that I don't do well keeping up with. Anyway, it seems like most companies want to do super technical things, and everyone that works there is an engineer or computer scientist.

Then, my programming teacher wants me to help her teach her freshmen how to learn C++ because she is overwhelmed. She always call me her star pupil because I constantly ask her questions and try to get into my advanced assignments. I'm not trying to act like this but I feel like I far surpass the computer science students here because my determination and fast learning but now I have a on site networking event with JP Morgan Chase and I feel like there are going to be people outside of my university who will be my level or even higher. How do I compete with them? They know more than me. I really want this internship opportunity but when I tried to apply online, it asks me to rank my skills on different things like PHP, Ruby, Java, Python...etc. I am familiar with them but not really have done any hands on things. It makes me feel defeated that I haven't learned shit that can possibly affect my chances of getting a job. C++ is my strongest language and even with that, I only know the basic foundations of it. Or maybe I was taught wrong and I don't know all the terminology that I have done. I'm a junior and I haven't gotten internship on my resume besides the one I currently in now. People my age somewhere in other universities already have like 2 or 3. I just started this major and I feel like I need to do more things. But I have a part time job, internship, peer mentoring sessions, internship searching for 2018, and a full time courseload right now. I'm super exhausted and constantly want to cry. I get up at 6am because I commute and then won't come back home until like 10pm and somehow find a way to do homework. Sorry that this is really long. I was kinda of venting. **TL/DR**; I am a comp sci major junior and I feel like I don't have a lot of programming skills. I am being praised as a great coder but I feel like it's because I actually care about going into this field vs people who want it for the money. I barely have any time for myself, so I don't even know what I can do to better myself. "

I am thinking about other tech fields, and just want someone to share their experience with me in the cybersecurity field. Not so much the technical aspects, but also the culture of the career, day to day activities, how often you have to update your skill set, and the stress level. Are the expectations clear cut? Are managers concerned with whether you got the job done or get more involved with your work? My experience when I was on development team is that people would get too involved with my code, even when I demonstrated to them that it was working. I think this is a development cultural thing, since development you may not get results for a few months, people are more suspicious. I am more interested in a career where I demonstrate that something is working, and this is how everyone knows I did my job. (I know that is an oversimplification of what I'm asking, but I can't think of a better way to describe it) Since one is fighting off hackers, how much coding is involved and at what level? I understand a few languages at a higher level. Thank you in advance to everyone that replies :) "

I currently work at a small MSP focusing on small and medium sized clients. I am looking to get more into the security aspect by pushing the company into it or moving to a new one. I currently have my bachelors in Business Admin and Masters in Information Systems. Certs: CCNA (expired) I got the CCNA right after my masters when I was looking for work I thought it would help me get job placement. It ended up helping but unfortunately I did not get the chance to use it much in the aspect of Cisco but the knowledge was good. The company I work for focus' on Sonicwall with a handful having Cisco devices. As my company does not pay for certs I elected to not renew the cert as of yet. I am currently studying for my Sec + cert. I am at a cross roads of what to do for cont. education. Option 1 is to go back to night school or online school and get a degree in cybersecurity. Option 2 is to study and take the GSEC certification. As I do not have that much experience with IT security as my MSP does not focus on it. I am just looking to see what hiring managers would prefer to see.

First off, I love computers. I want to work with them for the rest of my life and I have found most of my CS classes to be really insightful, fascinating, and even fun. My computer architecture class was amazing, I even still play around in MIPS assembly and design some simple circuits for fun. But my love of computers is mostly because of networks, security, databases, and low-level computer operations. I've done some freelance back-end web development work and am pretty proficient in SQL, PHP, and running a CentOS home server. I've been pushing myself to my mental and physical limit these first 6 weeks of the semester and last semester with algorithm analysis, physics, and linear algebra, and I found my data structures last semester to be awful, although I still persevered through it and got an A. Lately, however, I've started having panic attacks (I don't have chronic anxiety), a hatred for school, I've stopped talking to my friends, and I've straight-up not even attempted several linear algebra assignments. I'm seriously considering switching to Computer Information Systems, because I noticed that if I were in CIS this semester, instead of taking my algorithm analysis class I would have been taking classes on database management and web development, two fields I have a passion for. My ideal career would be something involving system administration, network security, or cybersecurity. Worst-case scenario would be web dev or some other role in IT. I think the reason I stuck around in CS this long was because I was under the false assumption that CIS was just an easier version of CS and that I could make more money if my degree was in computer science, but I now realize how foolish that was and how fucked of a situation I got myself into. I feel like I'm a math major or something, learning concepts that, to me, seem only useful to my classmates who want to pursue software development (the very last job I'd want to do). I am not worried about being behind on schedule to graduate in 4 years since every single one of the required CIS classes up until junior year I had to take for CS as well. I already have fulfilled all requirements for a minor in computer science. Lastly, I am NOT making any decisions until I meet with my academic advisor tomorrow afternoon (also one of my CS professors), I simply want some input/advice from anyone who graduated in CIS/CS or who can warn me of any mistakes I'm making in this line of thinking. TL;DR: Hate my life, should I stick it out for 3.5 more semesters in computer science, or switch to computer information systems and get a minor in CS?"

I am now looking to make a switch to cybersecurity and need your advise on where to start. I tried to read up, but cybersecurity is such a broad field that I am still not clear. Why switch - I have always been interested in networking and security but did like writing systems software and didn't want to give it up early in my career. Now I strongly believe security is becoming more and more of an interdisciplinary area, very soon security engineers will also have to learn DevOps skills(and vice versa), so I will not have to give up software(I can pursue it on the side as well.) Switch to what - I am looking for a security solution architect role and advise on how to get there and in how many years. I do not want to be on the incident response team(while I am keen on identifying and fixing a breach, but on-call 24/7 is not for me. Neither is more than 20% travel.) My interests are more towards designing a security solution and integrating it with SDN/network management software to automate when possible after due analysis of data. I am interested in vulnerability and penetration testing of network and software, but not an IT operations role where I would just need to run pre-existing tools and report results.

After some research online and soul-searching, I've come to a point where it's time to ask random strangers online their opinions. The problem is, I'm not sure if a degree and/or career in CS is right for me, as I basically don't have any experience/exposure. I do have what seems like a pretty good book from Eric Matthes named Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming. Should I crack this open first and see if I like it before pulling the trigger on enrolling into a degree? In order to that though, I should probably drop out of my current courses and get a nearly-full refund, as I started classes on 10/1. I want to learn more about computers and open as many doors as possible later on down the line for my future. I see myself possibly working as some type of ""pure"" information security professional, sysadmin (they also do infosec duties too), or possibly as some type of developer/programmer. Hell, I think for certain infosec roles you really should know programming. How the hell are you gonna defend software if you don't know how it works? I could teach myself programming later on, but then I'd probably be missing some things that a formal degree program teaches and to return for a master's to fill in the blanks or something. I'm currently enrolled at WGU (Western Governors University) in their Cybersecurity and Information Assurance program. For some reason the content isn't engaging me. So far I understand it and don't doubt that I can overcome any difficulties, but I'm just not terribly excited about the program or the prospects of having a bunch of letters after my name, which I have to renew every 3 years. My current degree includes the following certifications along with my thoughts on them. * Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)  Associate of (ISC) designation - *I don't meet the experience requirements.* * Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP)  Associate of (ISC) designation - *I could pay for it on my own. Requires a year of experience in 1 domain, which I do have. It's a CISSP-lite and introduction to ISC2's testing standards.* * Certified Encryption Specialist (EC-Council ECES) - *HR likes EC-Council's CEH, technical people not so much. Many people think they're a shady organization. None of their other certs like this one really have much notoriety.* * Certified Incident Handler (EC-Council ECIH) - *HR likes EC-Council's CEH, technical people not so much. Many people think they're a shady organization. None of their other certs like this one really have much notoriety.* * Certified Internet Webmaster  Site Development Associate (CIW-SDA) - *LOL CIW, no one asks for their certs or has heard of them* * Certified Internet Webmaster  Web Security Associate (CIW-WSA) - *LOL CIW, no one asks for their certs or has heard of them* * A+ (CompTIA) - *Already have.* * Network+ (CompTIA) - *Might be better to just get CCENT/CCNA* * Security+ (CompTIA) - *Already have*. * Project+ (CompTIA) - *If I really wanted a project management cert, I could just go the CAPM-PMP route.* * ITIL Foundation - *Don't even get me started.* I don't mean to knock WGU. They're extremely affordably at right around $3k a semester and are a great choice for working adults who want to obtain a degree, but I don't think the curriculum for this program is so good or interesting/challenging, so I'm having some **serious** second thoughts. I'm honestly not too happy about the curriculum or execited about it; I think I made a mistake by enrolling because the program doesn't really feel right for me. It's also not too late to get a refund I believe. I can use the downtime (enrollment) before starting a CS degree to study Python and the CCNA. A CS degree would allow me to work in development **AND** IT, whereas an IT degree wouldn't do the same for me. Also, I've heard that my cyber degree is a meme. Oh yes, I know WGU has a BS in Software Development, but I don't believe it's the same as a CS degree. In terms of background I have a 2 year CIS degree from a local community college.

I'm trying to build a career path in computer science and I want some feedback on my plan. I am interested in (1) satisfying my own desires to build apps/programs I've imagined, and (2) earning a high income to retire early (Lots of folks on r/financialindependence are CS-related). Both are pretty important to me and I want to make sure my plan isn't crazy. Basic stats * Male, mid-20s, BA in economics I started my working career in financial services, but I realized that wasn't for me. Too much regulation on who can give advice, the companies are callous and predatory, and I think financial markets today are basically casinos. So I job-hopped a bit and ended up working as an IT Project Manager for an enterprise company (Fortune 1000) for about 1.5 years now, and I am currently prepping to take my CAPM exam in October. After that, I may spend another 2 years in the industry/this company to earn my PMP. Although all the projects I am managing are waterfall-type, there are teams that follow Agile/iterative project management methodology and I am studying that, too. Once I get my CAPM/PMP, I want to transition into software development. Many developers I've spoken with at this company (and some friends) suggest that I begin learning Java as this can translate easily into learning C# which my business uses. I also will want to learn Python to get involved in data science purposes. Not sure what to learn after that.. HTML/CSS for Web Dev? It's open-ended. Some time after that I'd like to transition into IT security - learning network, system, and application security. Ideally, I'd like to be able to build software that is as secure as possible. I know there is a large skills-gap in cybersecurity and I'd like to capitalize on that business need. I am also interested in contributing to various open-source cryptocurrency projects, so understanding security intuitively is critical. My questions: 1) Do these skills synergize like I think they do? Will my experience as a project manager help me build code successfully with a team?

I'm currently enrolled in my school's CS program, and this semester I'm taking Discrete Math, Data Structures, Calc 2, and a foreign language. I worked as an intern in a cyber security lab over this past summer, and it was the most beneficial experience I've ever had. I went in with zero knowledge of the field, and came out wanting to pursue it as my full time career. The only problem being that my school has no cyber security program, and transferring to another school with a program wouldn't be worth it when I could finish with a CS degree here. I've been putting in work to study cybersecurity on my own, but I've been drowning under my courseload recently, having to spend hours a day attempting to understand calc and discrete math. I interviewed with a cyber security company on Friday, and today I received an offer letter asking how soon I could start. This offer is incredibly attractive to me, as it's only a 20 minute commute, pays well, they're willing to work around my class schedule (meaning I can choose how many hours I work in a week, within reason) and I would be doing penetration testing which is exactly the field I want to pursue. I've been chasing this job for a month and a half now, but now that I finally received an offer, I'm unsure if it would be the best move for me to accept it. I don't believe that I can succeed with my current course load and be able to work at the same time, so my question is whether or not it's worth it to drop a class and possibly set myself back (I would still graduate on time, as I came in with a few AP credits). Right now, the most attractive option for me is to drop Calc 2, as it's not a prerequisite for any other courses in my major and I can take it at my leisure. I need to take Discrete Math/Data Structures in order to continue advancing in CS courses, and not taking either of those would result in me graduating late, which isn't an option. I'm in the 3rd level course for my foreign language, and if I drop that then I'm positive I'll forget everything I've learned and have to backtrack significantly. So to summarize, is it worth dropping a course in order to lighten my course load in exchange for an internship that I believe would propel my career in cyber security forward, keep my current course load and attempt to work at the same time, or turn down the offer and focus on school? Sorry for the essay, but I want to provide all the information I can. Thanks in advance."

I do enjoy the mathematics and physics, and I'm also working on a personal coding project. I am planning on applying for a course at The School of Informatics at The University of Edinburgh. I am stuck on the choice between a ""pure"" Computer Science degree and a combined Computer Science and Mathematics Degree. It is not like a double major in the US where you would be more than a full-time student, but rather a full-time program where with some cherry-picking I can get a 40/60 split between math and cs, respectively (though it could have been the other way around as well, if I'd prefered that). In a normal CS degree I would of course do some math like discrete mathematics, linear algebra, calculus and probability, thus ending up with a 20/80 split between math and cs, respectively. Now, I guess I would enjoy working with computer science topics such as machine learning, cybersecurity, robotics and data science, while I'm not as interested in software engineering. What mathematics is relevant for more theoretical fields like these? Statistics, graph theory, optimization, algebra, ""analysis""? I don't dispute that these fields could improve my understanding of computer science, but how valuable are they? One have to consider the opportunity cost, as a pure CS degree would allow me to take more CS courses. What do you guys think? Should I study Computer Science or Computer Science and Mathematics? And if I end up studying the joint degree, what math should I study?

I took classes on Python, JavaScript/web development , C++, and databases. Because of this and a couple of references, I was able to land an internship at a Fortune 1000 financial services company as an IT Engineer. So far I've been doing some Python development for some smaller projects and I'm about to start development on a user interface as part of a larger project (Python back end and web front end). It's been a good internship so far, and I could possibly see myself staying with the company after graduation, but for now I'm strongly considering looking elsewhere for the next 2 summers before I graduate. Ultimately I'm really interested in software engineering and cybersecurity. What should I focus on, be intentional about, and document during this internship in order to maximize how much this internship will help me when looking for internships next year? Also, as I've described my current situation above, I'm more than open to any other words of advice. I'm also willing to answer questions about the company I'm working for and my university.

I have a few major questions. * Do I have to uproot my life to join? I live in the Greater Boston Area and don't want to relocate to D.C. or be told that at any point I might have to relocate or lose my job as is the standard for military positions. * What agencies might fit the above condition? I know CIA is DC-only, FBI page says there are positions in field offices, I saw some options within Air Force and Navy. I don't know where to look for state/local positions if there are any. * Could I even qualify? I assume these organizations are filled with people who have some of the highest credentials, but I feel like its hard enough to find engineers that they might be more flexible than some other highly-sought-after positions within the departments. * Who are they looking for? My experience is low, only 1.5 years with no CS degree (long story). I spend all of my time learning how to code both at work and out of work, since I love the job. Are the only taking the best, or are they open to training a more junior person? * Any insight into the types of skills that would be appropriate to hone while trying to get the qualifications to be interviewed."

I'm about to start experimenting/learning about high-level CS fields (AI, Cybersecurity, etc.) this summer/school-year to see what interests me. However, as I'm researching on how to prepare, I keep hearing about the importance of having a solid grasp of certain mathematics concepts, especially for AI. My problem is that for all my life, I've gotten A's in all my math classes, yet I never developed an intuitive and comfortable grasp of it (linear algebra, differential equations, etc.). My question is: what mastery level of mathematics is required to dive into various CS fields such as AI? Do you guys have any resource/book recommendations for someone in my situation, who wants to learn math concepts that complement CS and develop a more intuitive understanding? While I'm not ruling out ""traditional"" textbooks, I would highly prefer resources that offer differing approaches. Thanks, any feedback at all would be greatly appreciated, and I hope others who have overcome a similar situation can disclose their secrets :) EDIT: Thanks for all the great feedback, I'll be taking everything into consideration!!"

After a slew of dead-end jobs and a personal battle with anxiety and depression that has mostly been managed, I decided to go back to community college for computer science. I have too many expenses to not work full time, so I have been taking 1-4 classes per semester. To be honest, I chose computer science because I did an internet search for ""highest prospective jobs per degree"" and CS was at the top (I feel too far behind to get student loans to pay back and not be able to find a career, like a lot of my friends). So far I have all A's and find the material very interesting. This was the final semester before I had to commit to a specific degree in CS, and due to a lot of the comments my different professors made in the courses I've taken so far, I've chosen to take the CyberSecurity path. The community college I'm attending has a brand new program starting for this degree, but it doesn't start until the fall, so I won't be taking any classes this summer. I thought it might be good to spend my summer getting a certification, so I could get a foot in the door to a job that actually has relevance to computers (right now I'm an assistant manager at a BP... very far below my skill level, but it pays the bills. Barely.), and also to help bolster my resume since I don't feel like it looks great right now. So I have a short-term goal and a long-term goal in mind when choosing a certification. I realize there probably isn't one certification that fits both of these goals, and even after attempting to do research I haven't found one that has jumped out at me as ""the answer"". I really appreciate some help. On a side note, once I've chosen a certification to work on over the summer, I'll have to figure out the best way to go about getting it. Do you just purchase a comprehensive book that has all the material there could possibly be on the exam and go to town on it? In advance, I really appreciate the help.

My strategy now is to explore some different niches/specialties and focus on those, to see if I am interested in pursuing them career-wise. Basically, so that I can be happier in my work and be more productive. Some of the fields/work I was considering: * Data Science * Machine Learning * sysadmin (posted some specific questions on ITCareerQuestions) * Cybersecurity (although I imagine that might fall into more specialized sysadmin work) Questions for anyone who works in the above fields: * What kind of training/schooling did you do to prepare you for your work? * What is a typical day like? (personal experiences, coding challenges faces, etc. anything that may give me an insight into what it is like to work in that field) * Can you recommend any online courses/resources that can give me insight and confirm/dispel any notions I may have about such a role?

I realize that the majority of the fields above are hot topics right now, but that is not why I have listed them.

I was able to get an interview with a team whose managing director was an alumnus of my current college. We've seen to hit it off and have exchanged informal emails and a phone call this past month. And today was the day I got the formal email scheduling my interview for next week. What makes me nervous is that I'm a Computer Science major without an extensive background in cybersecurity. I love learning about cybersecurity on my own and I've created 2 independent cybersecurity projects (Kali Linux Raspberry Pi and Buffer Overflow Attack research) as well as finished an interesting book on cybersecurity threats. I have a general knowledge of this field, but I have a huge passion to learn more about it. My question is: what types of technical questions should I expect to be asked? I'm going to be studying every single minute and I want to know what I should focus most on. Thanks in advance."

I have recently become very interested in the security side of IT but have no real experience, I'm just now setting up a lab at home to learn Sys/Net Admin skills. My grades will be good enough that I will have two options for a masters degree one from a lesser prestige uni, AUT, and one from my current, AU. I don't really care about prestige but employer might. AUT is really security focused and requires me to either write a thesis or do an applied research project. AU is much more of a general IT skills course however I can choose papers that allow it to be mostly focused on security and IT project management/design. The AU degree also has a compulsory internship with ""Industry partners"" which I assume means they will make it fairly easy to get an internship. This could be valuable as I live in New Zealand and there aren't that many internships/entry level jobs requiring no experience. If I was to do a masters degree it would be out of these two as I do not want to be in uni forever. What degree do you think I should go for? Any advice related to getting into IT security more so on the defensive side or a govt job would be greatly appreciated. AU degree: Masters of Information Technology AUT degree: Master of Information Security and Digital Forensics I also have done CCNA1 and CCNA2, with merit, and received the Cisco Cyber Ops scholarship which is to start in June. This would be during my finals for first semester and overlap second semester which would effect my masters if I took it."

I'm happy doing pretty much anything except games, can't afford to be too picky about this right now anyway. * Building a portfolio. Should I just reinvent the wheel and put sample projects up on Gitlab or similar simply to demonstrate that I have the ability to code? Are there any good open-source projects I could look into contributing to? * Internships - any places I should look besides government? I don't think I'm going to get this one with the DHS, but other government internships seem to accept only an AAS with no experience, which gives me some hope. Are there any other types places that look good on future resumes?

I loved bringing my ideas to life and finding ways to make the website more efficient, faster, and more secure.

I'd get super frustrated when getting stuck on a problem and it'd seriously drain me emotionally and mentally. This caused me to decide to switch out of a Computer Science major and go undecided. I was thinking that while I like making my own projects and figuring out the code for those, I don't think I'd like just being told what to program as a programmer working at a company. I have to be passionate about what I'm coding. So, I've been planning on heading into something in business instead. I still love the idea of programming though. I'd love to make my own apps, projects, or just other cool things. It's so powerful. You can do so much with it.

I've interviewed for multiple job types, and I'm now weighing between a Software Engineering position at Capital One and an Associate role at the Chicago office of a mid-tier consulting firm. Both of these offers are great in their own respects .. I'm struggling to determine which one has better learning opportunities and would more likely provide a path to product management in technology. I figure the best way to illustrate this is by listing the primary pros/cons that come to mind: **Capital One** *Pros* * Company is explicitly focusing on their tech division -- pushing towards the use of AWS and other, more recent technologies/frameworks. * 2 year rotation program allows me to try out another functional role within TDP (e.g. data engineering, cybersecurity). * Higher compensation. I do not know where I would be placed, but I suspect the McLean (HQ) or Richmond office. * More recognizable name brand. *Cons* * Initial team placement is not of your own choosing, and I've heard managers at Capital One tend to be hit or miss: there are competent and involved managers, and there are ones who are often remote / don't care. * There are a non-trivial number of contractors you may have to work with (though I've heard the company is leaning away from this). * With the recent aggressive hiring for TDP, the quality of people in incoming classes may vary, as will the general TDP experience. **Consulting** *Pros* * More facetime with managers and principals. Overall, there are many more chances to develop 'soft skills' when working with clients and communicating your findings (e.g. go-to-market strategies or revenue-side improvements). * Being a smaller, professional services firm, the culture is more defined. The community tends to be more tight-knit and collaborative. * Better placement in management positions in industry, especially for companies you have done client work for. Good chances of getting into top MBA programs. *Cons* * Consulting is generalist in nature, and it would be harder to sell yourself as a technically proficient when all you can point to is your schooling. * The work often consists of data analyses done in R/Excel/Tableau, which may become repetitive if working for similar client types (e.g. healthcare, travel, financial services). * Compensation is standard for the field, but lower than software engineering (by ~15K).

I was hoping that if I list out some of my strengths - You guys would be able to help me figure a path that would sort of fit what I'm looking for. I'm a big people person - I like talking to people, having meetings, collaborating, working in teams, and just sitting around a table brainstorming ideas and projects that would be interesting to work on. I like working on shorter projects and multiple projects. I enjoy working on projects that you can see the outcome of your results within the span of a year or so. But i'm also okay with working with longer projects. I dislike monotonous, pointless, and unstimulating tasks. In my old job, I felt like I was told to complete tasks that anyone could complete. It made me feel like I wasn't valued and could be replaced at any point. I really appreciate the help! TL;DR: I am overwhelmed with the options in CS and was hoping to get some help. I am a people person, I like working on shorter and a variety of projects, and I dislike monotonous, brainless tasks."

I just started my last year of high school here in Colorado and I'm planning on attending either CU Boulder (where I'm thinking at the moment), CU Colorado Springs, CU Denver, or Colorado School of Mines to get my BSCS. I would love to attend Carnegie Mellon or Stanford but I'm going to stay realistic for this post. I love coding and I'm planning on being a software engineer after college at the moment. I'm also considering Cybersecurity and Machine Learning. What I was wondering is, as of right now, what can I do to ""beef up"" my resum for future employers? **About Me** * I ""know"" Java, C++, Objective-C, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL (ew), and Python. * I've created two iOS apps in Obj-C but they're not on the app store (more for fun and education). * I run my own little website business (using WordPress though \_()_/ ) * I'm attending a ""technical"" high school that is teaching me Computer Science and Cybersecurity in conjunction with traditional classes while simultaneously earning me CS credit at my local community college. (this credit does not appear to transfer to CU though..) * I competed in Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest in April and got to the interview stage for their Codequest internship. While I did not get the internship, I'm going to give it another shot this year now that I know what they're looking for. * I did however get an internship at a government agency but unfortunately it's more of a tech support job rather than coding. * I have a 4.0 weighted GPA and at the end of the year will have taken a total of 7 AP classes. My ACT score is 31. * I am part of one after school club that does volunteer work (similar to NHS) and did marching band for 4 years. * I have 4 **very** basic certifications regarding computer hardware/security (lower than A+ so they're rather irrelevant) and I have one Oracle Database Design certification which according to my teacher is actually semi-valuable(?) I'm also planning to get my Certified Ethical Hacker certification which I know is a low level certification but you have to start somewhere right? * I'm completing a capstone related to machine learning (I'm taking the Stanford Machine Learning class on Coursera then writing a program to do some machine learning stuff). **My questions** * Would starting to build some reputation on SO and GitHub be a good use of my time or is there a negligible benefit? I searched around on this sub a little and I got mixed responses, some saying it's a total waste of time, others saying they got job offers at Microsoft from their SO profile... * I'm not too into the ""Big 4"" or whatever you want to call it, but I'm also not against it. I'll probably end up going wherever I can get paid the most while having a good location, doing work I at least semi-enjoy, and not having too many crazy work weeks. * If I'm thinking of starting my own software business 10-15ish years down the road is there anything I need to do now? This is obviously very tentative... * Living in Colorado, there's obviously a very good tech culture here - especially in Boulder and Denver - and I'm fine with California as well, but as far as outside the US goes are there a lot of job opportunities in say Europe? I would love to work across the pond for at least a few years. * Does anyone know how good (or bad) the CS programs are at Columbia University or Rensselaer Polytechnic? Both universities seem very interested in me and from what I can tell appear to be fairly good CS schools. * Is there anything else I can do to boost my resum that I'm not thinking of that won't ruin my social life 100%? Any questions, comments, or constructive criticism about either my poor formatting style or the post itself are welcome! Thank you to everyone who took the time to read through this!

And when some of them brought us computers, a newer type of job has allowed creation of software. And now in the information age software has changed the world even more, probably by orders of magnitude. Yet there is no standardized assurance of minimum education and competency for software developers. Given that so much of the modern world depends to some degree on software, do you think the lack of standardization has created a delicate house of cards waiting to topple down? Or do you think state certification for software developers would cause the opposite effect of its intention to provide standards of quality, by greatly crippling the workforce and how many developers get jobs? I've seen people complain about interviews being broken, but if the US doesn't have a certification process, perhaps any attempts to figure out how to standardize the profession are also broken too. Government programs have helped fund a lot of breakthroughs in computing, though, and I think the closest thing they have to computing-related agencies are all in cybersecurity for clear reasons. To me, I'm just going to go with the simple answer that government orgs are still behind the times in terms of how to qualify software developers as a profession."

Should he focus on another OOP language like Java, or a scripting language? He has taken a class that used C++ in the past. 2. Considering that he is interested in a cybersecurity specialization, should he learn a skill specific to that area? Should he look into earning any certifications, like the CCNA, with security?

So my questions are these: If I work in IT how could I transition to pentesting? Or would that be possible on a 5 year time scale? How much does a degree make a difference in ML and AI? I know some people have gotten a job in the field with no degree to speak of but how often does that happen? If I get an online degree and my eventual goal is (a masters in) ML should I go with comp sci or Math? Are online degrees completely self paced(I tend to do better on self paced courses anyway)? And what institutions actually look good on a resume? Best case scenario: I transition out of a financially pleasant few years of security into a job as a data analyst or software engineer(focusing on AI) with little debt to speak of and making as much as the guys/gals who put 6 years into a brick and mortar school. Worst case scenario: I work my way into ML with a mountain of debt and a degree from an institution that is the equivalent of HR herpes after working 5 years of shit-paying dead end jobs only to get paid less than those who went 6 years to a brick and mortar school. Life has a way of (usually) navigating the middle, but if you guys could help me come up with a working strategy I'd greatly appreciate it. "

Currently, I'm a CS major with minors in math and cybersecurity. I have taken one class on operating systems towards the cyber minor, and I'm one class away from finishing the math minor. My question is: is it worth it to take classes that will complete minors over classes that genuinely interest me more? For example, I have a choice between a math crypto class that would finish off my math minor and help the cyber minor, or a web development course that would be very useful for me to take as I have little knowledge of web development. Both of these courses are only offered in the spring, so it's one or the other. In essence, are minors really worth it when applying for jobs, or should I take classes that will be most beneficial for the development of new skills?"

Since then I have been working as an intern for my friend's dad's cybersecurity company dong low-level system stuff in C. Before that I took some CS/Math classes at a local community college and worked as an Intern for my friend's dad doing simple things like writing code comments. Now I am looking for my first entry level job as a software developer and I was hoping to get some perspective on an important decision I must make. I am confident I can get a job as a web developer at least somewhere in the next couple of months. I have been searching for a while and I have several prospects I am interviewing with and I believe at least one of them will turn into an offer. However my friend's dad has offered me a full time position working at his company. The two paths are drastically different. On one hand I would be learning kernel development with my friend's dad and brother in a very casual very small-business environment and on the other hand I would be a junior developer or apprentice at some sort of web consultancy shop probably either in Ruby or JavaScript. Now I feel either route would probably be valid career-wise but I think they lead to two very different paths and I just don't have the perspective to make an informed decision. On the one hand working for a web consultancy sounds more exciting because I'd be moving to the city (I'm a couple hours away in the suburbs) and working with more variety of people in a new situation and probably making more money (all relatively superficial things that still matter), on the other hand kernel development sounds kind of badass and mysterious and I'm skeptical that anyone else would give me (little experience no degree) an opportunity like that. Also in that vein I wonder if I take the job with my friend's dad if I will be essentially stuck there since perhaps even after I get experience it would still be really difficult to get hired as a kernel developer without a degree and also I might not even learn well considering the gaps in my knowledge (gaps that I don't even know how to estimate the size of because I don't know what I don't know).

A little background about me: I am Australian, and recently graduated from a top university here with a Bachelor in Political Science and Bachelor of Laws with Hounours. I will be admitted to practice as a lawyer either at the end of this year, or early next year. I spent a long time working towards law, built up internship experience, and after 6 long years here I am -- soon 25, and... not at all thrilled at the prospect of being a lawyer. I've always been interested in programming and computer/network security, and there's a little voice in my head telling me I should go for it instead of pressing on with a career that I'm not really committed to and ending up bitter and regretful. There are some obvious problems here I was hoping I could get some feedback on. (1) If I went for this, I would want to study in the United States. As a law graduate, my math and science background is relatively weak. What do you think my chances are for being admitted to a decent program? (I think my GPA is around 3.3 - 3.4 in my undergrad). Do most universities offer bridging courses? Is self-study at all recognised or acknowledged in the application process? What can I do to improve my chances? (2) Should I be looking at BS Compsci degrees, or MS Compsi degrees? Cost is not a huge consideration as far as this choice goes, as my debt is near 0. I'm primarily concerned with receiving a quality education and employment prospects. Does the choice of BS vs MS typically make any difference as far as internship opportunities? (3) Is there a chance that some employers might see my having a law degree as a positive (e.g. strong communication and analytical skills beyond the strictly technical side, and potentially legal intersections with some aspects of the technical work they do), or is it more likely to be a case of ""this looks like wasted time and indecisiveness""? (4) How do people feel about these ""Cybersecurity"" degrees? I've spotted a few of them while doing my research and I'm a little sceptical, but they do seem to focus more closely on the subjects I'm interested in."

From there, I would get a masters in Computer and Information Security from Purdue University (a school with a great regional reputation and a NSA school of excellence). After getting my masters, I would then move into the field. This approach is also somewhat expensive due to the lost income from being in school 2 years longer. My questions are, how useful is a CIS masters degree for entry level cyber-security positions? At what point will I hit a ceiling with only a CS undergraduate? I've also been thinking about double majoring to get a bachelors in business administration (from Kelly School of Business if it matters (it's from the regional campus though, not Indiana University itself if it matters)).

So far I've narrowed down my interests to software engineering, computer networks and information security. Now before I start, I know there will be someone who will tell me not to worry and that it is still early to make decisions. First of all, the goal right now is to gather information, not to make a final choice. Second, the CS industry is ridiculously competitive, and people who start early in their field will get an edge over other people, and that edge might just make the difference between having my CV thrown into the bin along with the 20 000 other CVs and getting an interview. Back to the point. Information security seems to be one of the specializations that offers decent modules (or courses, whatever you want to call them). I have dabbled a little in the area by taking two Coursera courses - Cryptography I and Software Security. Both seemed really interesting and the whole analytical thinking/puzzle solving process of breaking a system really intrigues me. However when I try to look for what information security specialists actually do, I can't really find anything except the very vague ""Ensuring that a software product does not have security vulnerabilities"" or something along those lines. I need more specifics than that. Also I should specify that I am only interested in the industry, because of various issues with nationality it's unlikely that I will be able to work for any government at any kind of serious position involving security. There also seems to be a lot of negativity regarding the infosec jobs when compared to software engineering. As in, less pay, less respect and attention because the managers don't fully comprehend the importance of security whereas a software product is something more tangible and more directly related with making money, and less open job positions as far the industry is concerned. And I am also concerned that the places who are very serious about their security won't hire someone who only got interested in security at their second year of university, they'll only hire the savants who hacked pentagon while still in mother's womb."

Now, some of you might ask why I don't get my masters degree. Well, that is another $50-70k in student loans, and I am maybe going to make around $50k per year with that MS degree.

Hell, John Hopkins has a Senior Research Assistant position available and that only pays $35k/yr and they want someone with a masters degree.

I am working two jobs (both of which I love), one at the company which provides my school with email, and one at my school itself (managing the cybersecurity lab). I don't have a car, I still live with my grandparents and my parents, and I really want to move out. I am confident in my programming experience, and I feel that I could learn enough of a company's stack in a week or two to make significant contributions. I have tried applying to various companies (there aren't really any in my area), but I haven't really heard anything back and, even if I did, I don't have enough liquid income to fly anywhere for an interview only to be turned down. Someone on devpressed.com suggested that I drop out of school because of the amount of stress I am under. I love school, but I love programming more, and I'm honestly just ready to start my career. I have toyed with the idea of starting a company, applying to Y-combinator, etc. Or just saving enough to fly to Silicon Valley for a week and apply everywhere. I don't really know what to do. Here is my github: URL As evidence I can pick up new languages/frameworks quickly, I wrote URL in a relatively short amount of time, and I knew literally nothing about C# when I started. Here is my resume: URL I want to reiterate that I love school and my jobs, but I am under immense stress (I work every single day, on weekends I get up @4am, and I have a full course load). If I could stay working at the places I am working at, but quit school and move out I would be fine. But I barely make enough to pay bills and pay towards my debts at the moment, not nearly enough to purchase a car or an apartment. If anyone knows of any opportunities I would love to hear about them, as well as any criticism of my github or resume. Thank you for your time."

Just curious, how much do these jobs pay?"
1010,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Getting into a specific discipline of Cybersecurity,1,2wh0oo,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wh0oo/getting_into_a_specific_discipline_of/,2015-02-20 08:07:15,"Disclaimer(s): 1. I feel this question is more appropriate in /r/AskNetSec or /r/NetSec or maybe /r/Hacking. Please redirect me if so. 2. I don't want to be a tool jockey and perform vulnerability scans I'm not looking for a job in *applied* security that requires certifications like CCNA/CISSP/Network+ ect.. Please read the description below before automatically assuming this. ________________________________________________ To start it off I have always been interested in Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering, analyzing the state of systems and areas like that. It's a dream of mine to develop Intrusion Detection Systems/Anti-Virus Programs. A typical cyber-security professional highlights insecurities of a company, I want to develop tools that detect incoming malware. So if it makes sense so far I'm not interested in penetration testing or finding 'holes' in a company's system but another area altogether. I'm currently a second year CS student with work experience in software development. This summer I want to find a job that can help me in this **path**. I'm not sure what to search for though and even at that I can't find any jobs related to what I want to accomplish in the future. I have a few questions: * What job or internship should I look for that sets me in this path for the future? * Above, where can I find these specific jobs if I'm qualified to get them? * Is this a hard field to get into in general or am I way too underqualified to consider it? Do I need a Masters before thinking of going into it? If I'm being confusing or if you want more info don't hesitate to ask."
1011,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Is globalization going to become a problem for programmers like it did for manufacturing?,2,2r2013,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2r2013/is_globalization_going_to_become_a_problem_for/,2015-01-02 12:13:06,I've heard that in the US and most first world countries programming and computer science are going to become the next things to be globalized. Basically that someone can do it better and cheaper somewhere else. Will this be the case and how can I protect myself? Right now the only solution seems to be to go into cybersecurity as that requires US citizenship and therefore can't be outsourced.

I was in the [SFS](URL program, which means that I have a commitment to work for the government through 2015. However, once I complete that commitment, I'm free to go wherever I'd like. The Federal position I'm in is a GS11(~65k), with a max of a GS13 (~90k), with small ""step"" increases after that. Since that time is nearing, I'm considering switching to work for a contractor or private industry. My skills are fairly versatile, but my biggest hangups are that I'm not willing to commute too far and I don't want a super-busy work schedule (&gt;40 hours a week, working weekends, or lots of non-local travel). Could anyone give me some insight into what I could be looking for or expecting within the DC-MD-VA area? Thanks"
1013,cybersecurity,cscareerquestions,Unfortunate guy... want to study computers. Need your help what to study,12,2tww4a,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2tww4a/unfortunate_guy_want_to_study_computers_need_your/,2015-01-28 12:49:33,"**I have my question and Tl;dr at the bottom if you don't want to listen to the sad backstory** Please guys/girls bare with me. I'm in a bad situation right now. I want to ask a **computer science education/career** related question, and I want to give important background to explain why I am asking the question. **Background:** I am a biology major currently in my senior year - 1 semester away from graduation. 6 months ago I noticed something wrong with my knee. I have seen several highly rated doctors regarding my knee, but they don't see anything wrong they can help me with. My mRIs &amp; X-Rays show nothing abnormal, but I do have a piercing pain in both of my knees. The pain has grown worse as time passed by. 3 months of physical therapy didn't yield anything. I cannot stand for more than 5 minutes at a time, cannot run/jump, and cannot walk for more than 10 minutes without pain. I love medicine and wanted to go to medical school, but with my knee condition, I cannot do that because 3rd and 4th year of medicine requires hospital rotations where I would need to be on my feet for 10-12 hrs. I do not want to do research because I don't want to be studying/writing research papers for a career. So, what this means is, for my career, I have to get into a field where I can work sitting down on a chair. **Leading to my question:** I want to study/work in field of computers. I just use computer and know nothing about how they actually work right now. With proper education, self-learning, networking, motivation, and **passion**, I believe I can work with computers and succeed. I can push myself to do everything with discipline, but I know that I will be miserable and mediocre if I do not have **passion** for what I am doing. I see so many terms such as computer science, computer engineering, coding, programming, IT, database ____, data analyst, cybersecurity, web development, etc... I feel like a certain kind of passion and aptitude is needed to succeed in each of the subject/career I mentioned. So my question is... **Question:** What are the general subfields in the study of computer? What are the subfields of those subfields? What 'kind' of passion do you think a person would need to enjoy/succeed working/studying each specific subfield? For example: I love editing videos. Lets say I want to make a video editing software. What subfield of computer would I need to study to build such a software? I also love teaching. What subfield of computer would I need to study to build an app that asks the more difficult question as a student gets the previous question right? In general, I would want to build softwares/programs/websites/apps for businesses/hospitals/universities to use. I like the idea of solving somebody's problem by building complex things they can readily/easily use. **Tl;dr:** I am unfortunate in that I got an unusual and unsolvable knee problem which makes me unable to stand or walk for more than few minutes. I want to study the field of computers. What are the different subfields in computer, and what kind of passion would somebody need to succeed in each subfield? "
