I'm not part of a MSP, posted this question I'm r/sysadmin and figured I'd post here as well. I work for a mediumish size company with around 130 employees. The culture is very start up like and I'm their first cyber security engineer. So far I've implemented a user awareness training program, upgraded our firewalls, implemented a vulnerability scanning solution, work on SOC 2 audit, participate in Incident Response, create compliance policies, create group policy for our data center access, changed all users from local admins to standard user, disabled USB for mass storage, etc Our company is looking to improve security and our CIO fully on board but he's main concern is our company culture and we don't want to enforce too much security . So right now we're looking to implement a mobile anti virus solution for our staff. All of the phones are BYOD. We don't currently have a MDM and our CIO would prefer an anti virus solution over an MDM. He feels having an MDM agent and and anti virus agent on employee phones would be too much for employees. Our CIO is on board for the anti virus solution but our Director of DevOps is concerned about his team being onboard. The DevOps director is onboard for the anti virus solution, he's main concern is user acceptance. Our staff uses their phones a lot for work (Slack, email, zendesk) so I'd like to secure it and we reimburse a portion of our employees cell phone bill. According to our employee handbook, those phones we pay a portion of the bill is considered company phones. But I'd like to avoid using that as a reason for implementing this solution. We're planning on sending out a survey to our users and getting their input on implementing an anti virus on their personal phones or if they'd prefer company phones. Regarding buying everyone company phones but I'm concerned users will still use their personal phones for work. I was looking for suggestions on how to go engage users in the process and get user buy in. Thanks in advance!"

My question is does anybody have any advice or is willing to point me in the right direction for information regarding liability, contracts, etc.? I would want to form an LLC and purchase professional liability insurance, but this is the extent of my knowledge on how to cover my ass. I assume I would also need to create my own service agreements and have a lawyer look at them. I dunno, I just feel like theres a lot of seasoned MSP owners here, and if any of them are willing to give me any advice at all it would be greatly appreciated.

22,vulnerability,msp,Our Commentary on Dattos #6 KPI: Newly Discovered Devices,1,gig4ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/gig4ju/our_commentary_on_dattos_6_kpi_newly_discovered/,2020-05-13 03:42:37,"For the record, RMM and billing processes do not play to SDB-Cs strength. Dattos #6 KPI: Newly Discovered Devices is all about Consumption Billing and depends on the RMM tool to identify devices under management. As Autotask Service Delivery experts, we are called on to assist with Consumption Billing configurations which are not quite yet automated. We do have a Cascading Contract Automation implementation project that reduces the burden on the Service Delivery Team down to answering one question: What Type of Work did you do?. The rest of the invoicing process is automated from the Time Entry and is working very well. But Consumption Billing still depends on manually updating the User/Device counts for billing purposes. Here is what Datto has to say on the subject: ### Takeaways from Dattos KPI #6: Newly Discovered Devices sub-article * Newly discovered devices need to be reviewed to understand which devices should be covered under contract. * Having an accurate view of all the devices in a customers network allows the MSP to ensure that the environment is secure. * Use a widget such as missing patches to see which devices are at a higher risk for a security vulnerability. * Newly discovered devices also help to plan and predict future levels of service. #### Our Commentary on Dattos Sub-Article **Datto**: Updating contracts monthly with accurate device counts can be very time consuming, and oftentimes device counts are only updated once per year. With the unification of Autotask PSA and Datto RMM, newly discovered devices are automatically brought over to the PSA to be reviewed and assigned to that clients contract. **SDB-C:** The reviewed and assigned process still sounds like a very time-consuming, manual process to me. The biggest benefit is that there is a better chance to identify new devices, and the Configuration portion of the Contract to Configuration Item linkages is known. For me, figuring out the Configuration Item ID is the most difficult part, as it is in RMMease. My guess is that once the linkage is in place, the Rule-Based Billing will automatically update the device counts in the Contracts and adjust the billing accordingly. We do not know anyone that has this working yet, but we are on the lookout. **Datto:** There is also a widget that can display new devices awaiting contract review to notify the accounting department and service technicians of the change. This will ensure there is no missed billable revenue for each contract, and that revenue can be recognized immediately. **SDB-C:** From our experience, the Accounting Department and Service Coordinators will most likely be the ones using the information and manually applying the Newly Discovered Devices to Contracts or not. I am not sure Service Technicians care or are even aware of these changes. **Other thoughts from SDB-C:** How does Mobile Device Management (MDM) play into this? For example, how does it work for someone carrying a tablet? The device doesnt belong to the employer, so how would the RMM system know who the device belongs to? Everyone has a cell phone  are they expected to keep up with them all? Do these devices also show up on the device discovery? This just points out that the network is not secured by how many devices are on it, but by how well it is maintained. When a new device is detected, it is already on the network. More importantly, we would like to see how many logins have been blocked and how many users have tried to get on the network. By now, you can probably tell that RMM is not our strength, as we raise more questions than answers. While we never profess to be RMM experts, we do claim to be PSA experts. Were especially excited for next week when we take on Contract Renewals and after that, my favorite subject: Project Status. Stay tuned! "

Since my father owns a small, but lots of insurance premium revenue, insurance agency, and due to my previous selling roles, he kept begging me to come on board to manage their IT infrastructure while also handling clients/selling/etc. This then allowed me to learn the ins and outs of the wild west in Insurance policies, cyber liability insurance/Cybersecurity insurance/all kinds of related names covering mainly the same things. Due to family politics and drama that his 3rd wife who graduated 3 years before brings to anyone who she doesn't like or people that she deems a threat to her own career, I am looking to get back in IT, maybe have to start on the bottom at help desk due to my jumping around and many hats situation. One thing I wanted to implement was a program where I'd work with an MSP multiple MSPs to provide a service that to their clients as all systems still have a vulnerability even with the best IT Security infrastructure you can buy. I'd be their Consultant and could also be their agent who implements and ensures their cyber policies requirements are met by their IT infrastructure, policies, guidelines, etc... A lot of cyber policies require that the business has all of these processes in place or the policy won't play out. FINE PRINT. Many don't know this. It could be seen as negligence from the insurance carriers eyes, so the business isn't covered from an attack even if they have a policy. As you can read daily, small businesses/medium business are the easiest targets for a system attack. 60% go out of business after a data breach/ransomware attack. What I'd like to do is jump into an MSP job doing help desk/jr system admin/system admin work, focus on getting a cyber certification, and also being a sort of cyber insurance consultant to the MSP and their clients to make sure they will be covered in case the inevitable happens. Where'd (MSP) have to approach it delicately when discussing with the client, so as to not think we are great at cybersecurity, but that we are and this will give the client and MSP an extra benefit of having some that can find/read/consult on cyber policies to help everyone sleep better. It also opens up the opportunity for the MSP to sell more of their Cybersecurity options. If you could let me know what you guys think of this strategy? Having a IT Specialist and Licensed Property and Casualty Agent (Cybersecurity insurance policies are under P&amp;C licensing. )? Tldr. I am a licensed insurance agent specializing in Cybersecurity insurance policies (the wild west of insurance policies today, very tricky) AND I've had and still do various IT Consultant/Support/Admin roles.

In essence, CMMCs governing body will train and license Certified 3rd Party Assessment Organizations (C3PAOs) and their assessors. In turn, these C3PAOs will be comprised of at least two assessors who can certify a contractors CMMC License Level. The assessors will not be CMMC Accreditation Board (CMMC-AB) employees.[\[iii\]](URL According to one source, the Pentagon wants these assessors to be independent, so assessors will not be allowed to sell contractors other cyber services.[\[iv\]](URL When CMMC will become, live is speculative as of this publication. According to Lockheed Martin, CMMC will be included in RFIs starting roughly in June of 2020, and in RFPs starting roughly in September of 2020.[\[v\]](URL Many industry experts believe that CMMC will undergo changes in the future, so contractors should remain vigilant. How the CMMC will apply to subcontractors is not explicitly apparent in the controlling documents. Merely, the CMMC V1 states that a contractor can, adequately protect CUI at a level commensurate with the risk, accounting for information flow down to its subcontractors in a multi-tier supply chain.[\[vi\]](URL Nevertheless, it is safe to assume that every contractor handing sensitive information will need to be certified to at least the fundamental level. **Covered Information Types** CMMC is designed to cover two types of information which are commonly held by contractors:  Federal Contract Information (FCI), which is, information, not intended for public release, that is provided by or generated for the Government under a contract to develop or deliver a product or service to the Government, but not including information provided by the Government to the public (such as on public Web sites) or simple transactional information, such as necessary to process payments.[\[vii\]](URL Initially, this definition is found outside of the CMMC within the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.204-21. This regulation is also known as Basic Safeguarding of Covered Contractor Information Systems.  Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), which is, information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with laws, regulations, and government-wide policies, excluding information that is classified under EO 13526, Classified National Security Information, December 29, 2009, or any predecessor or successor order, or Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. [\[viii\]](URL Broadly, the safeguarding of CUI is found in Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting (DFARS 252.204-7012).[\[ix\]](URL The CUI Registry is quite extensive and contains numerous categories and subcategories. Depending on the engagement and specialty of the contractor, they could be handling information from any number of CUI categories.[\[x\]](URL Contractors are encouraged to reference the CUI categories found at [URL **CMMC Levels** The CMMC contains five cumulative levels which will be mandated by government depending on the particular contract. They can generally be understood with the following descriptions: Level 1: The contractor practices basic cyber hygiene by utilizing the basic safeguarding requirements found in FAR 52.204-21.[\[xi\]](URL At this level, contractors will presumably be dealing only with FCI. Level 2: The contractor satisfies the requirements of Level 1, but also documents and implements practices and policies to comply with part of NIST SP 800-171 and selected other sources.[\[xii\]](URL At this level, contractors will presumably be dealing with CUI though in the CMMC it is described as a, transition step.[\[xiii\]](URL Level 3: The contractor satisfies the requirements of Level 2, but must also demonstrate, good cyber hygiene. They must also have a plan that demonstrates the management of implementation. This could include having necessary training, plans, goals, and buy-in from stakeholders.[\[xiv\]](URL This level includes safeguards and other practices from NIST SP 800-171, DFARS 252.204-1702, and other selected requirements. Level 4: The contractor satisfies the requirements of Level 3, but also reviews and quantifies their security practices for effectiveness. In addition, they must demonstrate a proactive approach to combating advanced persistent threats (APTs). This level includes safeguards from NIST SP 800-171, DFARS 252.204-7012, certain requirements from NIST SP 800-171B, and other practices.[\[xv\]](URL Level 5: The contractor satisfies the requirements of Level 4, but must also optimize their safeguards implementation across the business. This level further refines the protection of CUI from APTs. This level includes safeguards from NIST SP 800-171, DFARS 252.204-7012, certain requirements from NIST SP 800-171B, and other practices.[\[xvi\]](URL For further clarification, contractors should reference CMMC Version 1 Appendix B found at: [URL **CMMC Domains** CMMC contains the following 17 domains. These domains contain titles that may be distinct from those found in the soon to be mentioned publications on which CMMC is based. However, these domains are detailed in CMMC Appendix A to level requirements which are mapped mainly against the various referencing requirements noted below. The seventeen CMMC domains are:[\[xvii\]](URL  Access Control (AC)  Asset Management (AM)  Audit and Accountability (AU)  Awareness and Training (AT)  Configuration Management (CM)  Identification and Authentication (IA)  Incident Response (IR)  Maintenance (MA)  Media Protection (MP)  Personnel Security (PS)  Physical Protection (PE)  Recovery (RE)  Risk Management (RM)  Security Assessment (CA)  Situational Awareness (SA)  System and Communication (SC)  System and Information Integrity (SI) Within the CMMC Appendices, each domain listed above is broken down into capabilities. In turn the capability lists the required practices for each level with reference material. As stated within CMMC, the majority of compliance efforts at all levels originate from FAR 52.204-21 and DFARS 252.204-7012.[\[xviii\]](URL For this reason, they will be discussed in detail below. Levels 2 through 5 also contain other compliance references. These additional references will not be mentioned below, so they should be reviewed with the necessary consulting expert and/or legal counsel. In a hierarchy chart, the CMMC system can be displayed as the following: (original graphic omitted) CMMC &gt;&gt; Overall Certification CMMC Level &gt;&gt; Various requirements for certification levels 1-5 Domains &gt;&gt; Ex: Access Control (AC) Capabilities &gt;&gt; Ex: C001 Establish System Access Requirements Practices &gt;&gt; Ex: Ac.1.001 References&gt;&gt; Ex: FAR 52.204-21 b.1.i **FAR 52.204-21** As noted within CMMC, Level 1 encompasses the FCI basic safeguarding requirements found in (FAR) 52.204-21. Level 1 of the CMMC is, equivalent to all of the safeguarding requirements from FAR Clause 52.204-21.[\[xix\]](URL Per FAR Regulation 52.204-21, the following safeguards are **mandatory** and are considered the **minimum** requirements for any business handling FCI: (i) Limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, or devices (including other information systems). (ii) Limit information system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute. (iii) Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external information systems. (iv) Control information posted or processed on publicly accessible information systems. (v) Identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices. (vi) Authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information systems. (vii) Sanitize or destroy information system media containing Federal Contract Information before disposal or release for reuse. (viii) Limit physical access to organizational information systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals. (ix) Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity; maintain audit logs of physical access; and control and manage physical access devices. (x) Monitor, control, and protect organizational communications (i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational information systems) at the external boundaries and key internal boundaries of the information systems. (xi) Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically or logically separated from internal networks. (xii) Identify, report, and correct information and information system flaws in a timely manner. (xiii) Provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations within organizational information systems. (xiv) Update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available. (xv) Perform periodic scans of the information system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed. (2) Other requirements. This clause does not relieve the Contractor of any other specific safeguarding requirements specified by Federal agencies and departments relating to covered contractor information systems generally or other Federal safeguarding requirements for controlled unclassified information (CUI) as established by Executive Order 13556. (c) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts under this contract (including subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial items, other than commercially available off-the-shelf items), in which the subcontractor may have Federal contract information residing in or transiting through its information system.[\[xx\]](URL Naturally, complying with the above is no easy task. However, any company wishing to do business with the government  either as a prime or subcontractor  should consider CMMC Level 1; at a minimum. **NIST SP 800-171 &amp; DFARS 252.204-1702** Within the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 48 is commonly referred to as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This regulation governs the formation and administration of contracts with the federal government. Within FAR, there are more than 20 supplements, but the cybersecurity requirements within the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) are the most important for businesses with Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. Broadly speaking, DFARS governs the majority of procurements made by DoD, General Services Administration (GSA), and all branches of the armed forces. CMMC Levels 2 through 5 are, variously testing the CUI security requirements found in 48 C.F.R. 252.2047012 Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting; with the addition of selected other practices. DFARS contains the relatively new provision known as Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting (DFARS 252.204-7012).[\[xxi\]](URL If a contractor stores, processes, or transmits covered defense information, they are likely subject to the 7012 regulation. Per the DoD, covered defense information is defined as unclassified controlled technical information (CTI) or other information as described in the CUI Registrythat requires safeguarding/dissemination controls AND IS EITHER marked or otherwise identified in the contract and provided to the contractor by DoD in support of performance of the contract; OR collected/developed/received/transmitted/used/stored by the contractor in performance of contract.[\[xxii\]](URL To remain compliant with DFARS 252.204-7012, firms and their legal counsel should be aware that the regulation contains two main provisions. The first deals with protecting covered defense information  generally synonymous with CUI  via NIST Special Publication 800-171 Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations. Proper compliance with this framework can require significant time and resources as it covers policies, process, secure IT configurations, and possibly additional hardware and security-related software.[\[xxiii\]](URL NIST SP 800-171 contains the following fourteen specific requirements with general explanations:  **Access Control**  Who can view this data?  **Awareness and Training**  Are those who can view the data trained properly?  **Audit and Accountability**  Can the firm identify and track who accesses the system?  **Configuration Management**  Can the firm establish, maintain, and enforce secure configuration requirements?  **Identification and Authentication**  Does the firm possess the ability to verify the identity of users, devices, or process prior to viewing the information?  **Incident Response**  Does the firm have a system for testing and handling incidents?  **Maintenance**  How will routine maintenance be handled and who is responsible?  **Media Protection**  How does the firm handle hard copy and electronic records, including backup storage?  **Personnel Security**  Are those allowed access to information appropriately screen before access and is there access revoked upon termination?  **Physical Protection**  Does the firm limit the physical access to systems and is access recorded?  **Risk Assessment**  Are there routine vulnerability scanning and risk assessments of the organization and its systems?  **Security Assessment**  How will the firm continuously assess and improve their security controls?  **System and Communications Protection**  Are communications monitored, controlled, and protected at crucial internal and external system boundaries?  **System and Information Integrity**  How is the system integrity maintained and monitored for intrusions?[\[xxiv\]](URL While that may seem relatively straightforward, contractors should understand that within the fourteen requirements, there are an additional 118 total basic and derived security requirements.[\[xxv\]](URL Previously, if the contractor wanted to vary from the standards present in NIST SP 800-171, they will need to submit a request in writing to the Contracting Officer, who will forward it for consideration to the DoD CIO.[\[xxvi\]](URL It is currently unknown if this requirement will change under CMMC. If the contractor wants to use an external cloud provider to store, process, or transmit covered information, the business must contractually require and ensure that the cloud provider meets the security requirements listed in the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).[\[xxvii\]](URL The cloud provider must still meet the requirements of DFARS 252.204-7012 pertaining to cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.[\[xxviii\]](URL Any IT system or service other than the cloud provider requirements are still subject to the security restrictions found in DFARS 252.204-7012, [\[xxix\]](URL and CMMC.[\[xxx\]](URL The second main provision deals with the rapid reporting of cyber incidents and cooperation with the DoD. Per the regulation, cyber incidents are actions taken through the use of computer networks that result in a compromise or an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information system and/or the information residing therein. When a cyber incident is discovered, the firm will review the incident in accordance with the regulatory requirements and report the incident within 72 hours.[\[xxxi\]](URL CMMC has a slightly different definition of a breach, stating, An incident where an adversary has gained access to the internal network of an organization or an organizationally owned asset in a manner that breaks the organizational policy for accessing cyber assets and results in the loss of information, data, or asset. A breach usually consists of the loss of an asset due to gained access.[\[xxxii\]](URL Contractors should note the particular use of the word, usually in the above definition. With a strict interpretation of the definition, a ransomware event may require notification as information could have been accessed even if not potentially acquired. This is a topic that contractors should clarify with their assessors, and if possible, the CMMC-AB. Per DFARS 252.204-7012, if it is determined that malicious software was on the computer system that contributed to the incident, the firm must submit the offending code to the DoDs Cyber Crime Center. From there, the DoD can decide to formally assess the damage caused by the incident. During this assessment, the firm may be required to submit the media to the DoD and further aid in their evaluation.[\[xxxiii\]](URL Failure to follow the safeguarding requirements of DFARS 252.204-7012 could result in detrimental actions against the contractor per DFARS 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information: A breach of these obligations or restrictions may subject the Contractor to  (i) Criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual actions in law and equity for penalties, damages, and other appropriate remedies by the United States, and; (ii) Civil actions for damages and other appropriate remedies by the third party that reported the cyber incident, as a third-party beneficiary of this clause.[\[xxxiv\]](URL **Draft NIST SP 800-171B Requirements -CMMC Levels 4 &amp; 5** Of note, NIST SP 800-171B is not a new standard per se, but merely a supplement to the previously note NIST 800-171. The purpose of the supplement is to protect CUI from advanced persistent threats (APTs).[\[xxxv\]](URL Some or all of the approximately 32 requirements found in NIST SP 800-171N may be contractually required  via the CMMC  to be implemented in addition to the basic and derived requirements found in NIST SP 800-171.[\[xxxvi\]](URL It is not unreasonable to assume that implementing enhanced security controls will be costly. According to the NIST report on the estimated cost of implementing NIST SP 800-171B, compliance could easily exceed $10M for a company with 25-50 endpoint networks.[\[xxxvii\]](URL For interested parties, the DoD cost estimate for NIST SP 800-171B implementation can be found for free at: [URL Perhaps more interesting than the cost analysis found in the above document is the estimated number of affected contractors that will require NIST SP 800-171B implementation. Per the analysis, We estimate that 69,000 contractors have controlled unclassified data. However, less than one half of 1% of DoD contractors develop critical capabilities for DoD.[\[xxxviii\]](URL Although there have been no official pronouncements yet on the number of contractors requiring Level 4 or 5 compliance, this would point to only less than 400 companies nationwide. **Other Referenced Requirements** As stated previously, the majority of CMMC is based upon FAR 52.204-21 and DFARS 252.204-7012.[\[xxxix\]](URL However, there are additional references found in the appendices that will require investigation by contractors should they be deemed necessary, or mandatory. These include, but are not limited to: CERT RMM v1.2, CIS Controls v7.1, NIST SP 800-53, UK NCSC Cyber Essentials, ACSC Essential Eight Maturity Model, DOEs C2M2, NIST SP 800-39, NIST CSF V1.1, and FIPS PUBs 199,201, and 197. While important, these publications will not be detailed here as doing so would prove too lengthy. Any contractor who is interested in these references should seek qualified compliance experts and/or legal counsel. **CMMC Certifications and Compliance** In January 2020, the CMMC-AB (Accreditation Board) was formally incorporated. As of this publication, there are no licensed CMMC assessors who can issue a certification. The CMMC-AB is still waiting on a number of issues to be resolved before assessors can be trained. Directly from the CMMC-AB website, The CMMC Standard is not yet finalized and no Assessors or C3PAOs are formally accredited or certified by the CMMC-AB. Therefore, it is currently inappropriate for any Assessor or C3PAO to claim to provide formal CMMC assessments that will meet the requirements for a DoD contract.[\[xl\]](URL This does not mean that businesses should neglect preparation until assessors are available. With hundreds of thousands of potential contractors that will require certification in short order, there could be a serious lack of assessor for the foreseeable future. Any business who could work with the DoD should consider a good faith internal assessment in light of their perceived future requirements. For smaller contractors, or those with smaller cybersecurity budgets, there is hope when considering the costs associated with CMMC Compliance. According to Katie Arrington, the special assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition for Cyber in the Office of the Under Secretary of Acquisition and Sustainment in DoD, security is an allowable cost.[\[xli\]](URL However, she also noted that eventually, certification requirements will be placed in contracts and will be used as a, go or no-go decision. [\[xlii\]](URL Contractors are thus highly encouraged to begin working towards their applicable certification level as soon as possible. **Additional Legal Concerns** Beyond failing to secure new contracts, or falling victim to a cyber attack and losing critical national defense information, businesses must remain vigilant of the cybersecurity claims they make to the government. Consider the allegations found in the case of *United States v. Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.* where the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California held that an alleged failure to adhere to government contracting cybersecurity requirements.[\[xliii\]](URL In this case, the relator, Brian Markus, worked for Aerojet as the senior director of Cyber Security, Compliance, and Controls for approximately 15 months. [\[xliv\]](URL The defendants, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. and Aerojet Rocketdyne, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Aerojet) develop and manufacture products for both the aerospace and defense industries. Through the course of business, it was alleged that Aerojet dealt with contracts that required compliance with DFARS 252.204-7012 as well as 48 C.F.R.  1852.204-76  NASAs functional equivalent to DFARS 252.204-7012. [\[xlv\]](URL Markus alleged that Aerojet fraudulently misrepresented their compliance with minimum required cybersecurity standards as required by the contracts. He further alleged that Aerojet knew they were not compliant with the requisite standards after a third-party compliance audit. Nonetheless. Markus alleged that Aerojet nonetheless continued to misrepresent their compliance status when communicating with government officials. Markus finally alleged that these misrepresentations led to Aerojet receiving a government contract. [\[xlvi\]](URL Amongst other causes of action, Markus filed a False Claims Act (FCA). Based on Markuss claims on this count, the court held that he, plausibly pled that defendants' alleged failure to fully disclose its noncompliance was material to the government's decision to enter into and pay on the relevant contracts. [\[xlvii\]](URL Understanding this ruling, contractors should keep a close eye on their cybersecurity compliance requirements lest they find themselves subject to similar claims. Adequate adherence will likely require constant vigilance between CMMC certifications.

46,vulnerability,msp,Response from ConnectWise CEO,1,etj2mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/etj2mw/response_from_connectwise_ceo/,2020-01-25 11:08:30," From recent email: Dear Partners, Earlier this week, a story was published about potential security vulnerabilities with ConnectWise Control. In the spirit of transparency, I wanted to provide an update on this story and outline what has been done and what our ongoing efforts are to ensure the security of our products, your business and your customers. In late September, ConnectWise received notification from an organization that operates as a consultant in the security space, stating they had identified eight potential vulnerabilities in ConnectWise Control. While our product and security teams felt that many of these potential vulnerabilities presented a low risk of actual attack to our partners, we take security extremely seriously and investigated, resolving six of the areas of concern by October 2, 2019. While the threat landscape is ever changing, we seek to constantly and proactively manage security efforts not only through the updating of our products, but through the education of our team and collaboration with third-party security experts. As security is of critical importance to us, here are some of things we have been doing and where we are today: ConnectWise recently passed an independent SOC 2 Type 2 audit for the benefit of all current and prospective Partners. We regularly conduct penetration tests performed by both internal and external resource and have implemented ethical hacker training, OWASP processes, and consistently run vulnerability assessments on our systems and products. We have implemented tools that automatically evaluate behavior to reduce misuse of our products, started implementing machine learning to detect anomalies in logins, and we are about to launch a bug bounty program, as well as started the rollout of MFA and SSO across the platform. In Q4 of 2019, we also invested in a comprehensive developer security training curriculum to increase the security skills of our teams and assure that our developers are training on the most recent and relevant application security coding practices. On January 21, 2020 we launched the ConnectWise Security Trust site, which will be a primary source of information on security incidents, relevant alerts and of course critical patches and product updates. We hired GuidePoint, an independent third-party cybersecurity solutions company, to further validate our patches and confirm that the vulnerabilities were mitigated. We have published a matrix outlining each potential vulnerability with the perspectives from Bishop Fox, Huntress Labs and GuidePoint, along with our stance on the issue and any action being taken. One of the remaining two suggested areas of remediation is Cross-site Scripting (XSS) which is the potential for abuse of the Control Administrator roles ability to customize the application. This customization ability is a key feature of Control that many partners value. This issue is considered a low actual risk, but we will be removing the option from our trial offering. The final identified issue is related to Security Headers. The strongest defense involves layers of security. Security Headers represent one option for implementing certain layers. In the absence of Security Headers, ConnectWise does implement security layers addressing the types of threats reported in the consultants assessment. As we continue to investigate potential vulnerabilities and implement mitigation plans, we will be posting updates to our Security Trust site. I encourage you to check this site for the latest information, as well as furture updates from our work with GuidePoint. In our conversations with Huntress Labs to compare our findings and their results, Kyle Hanslovan, CEO of Huntress Labs has this to share: Bugs happen. And its not about when bugs happen, but its about what you do when they happen. We were happy to work with CRN earlier this week to confirm that ConnectWise had already patched 6 of the 8 items found. I think three things matter in this scenario: Were the bugs acknowledged, were the bugs fixed and was the company passionate about fixing them for the right reasons? I think ConnectWise came through on all three things, and after our positive conversation on January 23, were excited about continuing to work with ConnectWise and other vendors for the benefit of the channel as a whole. I want to assure you, our partners, that we understand the trust you place in our products and people and we take that trust seriously. We have and will continue to invest heavily in security, and you have our unrelenting commitment to security and transparency, and we appreciate your questions and feedback to our continuous improvement. Thank you, Jason Magee"

The second identified issue is related to Security Headers.

50,vulnerability,msp,RFT Network Detective Alternatives for Discovery/Prospecting,1,evsyk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/evsyk9/rft_network_detective_alternatives_for/,2020-01-30 07:46:06,"Long time user of RapidFire Tool's Network Detective for Discovery and Prospecting. It's ""okay"" for what it is, which is basically a discovery tool for Windows Domain Environments, and it does that job fairly well. It collects a lot of Data and presents it as Information, but not quite at the level of Intelligence/Analysis (which is probably beyond the capabilities of any automated tool, unless we're to believe in the pipe dreams of the AI/ML evangelists). I've never once felt like any of the Generated Reports were refined enough to present for the C-Level discussions, so I spend a lot of time combing through Word Documents and Excel Spreadsheets to do the refining myself. But Network Detective's usefulness for non-domain Windows environments, Linux environments, and Mac environments is quite minimal. Sure, I understand with no centralized endpoint platform in place there's no way around installing scan agents everywhere, but the amount of Data and Information I get from these scans is almost never worth it. But when it comes to the actual network (firewalls, switches, Wi-Fi, SDNs, etc) then ""Network Detective"" does basically nothing for me except an IP scan and external vulnerability scan. So go around logging into devices and downloading configs and manually reading them for analysis, drawing network diagrams in Visio or LucidChart. Network Detective is also provides no insight on SaaS and IaaS clouds, which is becoming increasingly relevant as more and more new companies are going cloud-native. My last complaint about ND is that the Inform Interview Templates are terrible. They're just free-form Q and A text boxes, which I might as well do in a Spreadsheet. I can't really define data types, constraints, or default values, nor can I relate other aspects of the report in a object-oriented type of way. tl;dr Network Detective provides some value, but for $100/month/module, I spend way too much time utilizing other point products, rolling my own scripts, and generally doing a ton of manual labor to get the level of Analysis that my customers pay for. As I've begun to move beyond the SMB scale and into the Enterprise, I'm feeling the pain even more so, and I'd like to explore alternatives if they're out there.

We are on the latest version and we found 7 vulnerabilities. All of these are various settings within the application that just need to be tuned. I sent details about each vulnerability to ConnectWise support requesting information on how to tune the specific settings and the response I received was ""This is server operating system hardening, we don't help with that"" This is the only ConnectWise product we have and based on this support experience, I will likely be looking elsewhere, even though I love the product. Screenconnect support was always great, Connectwise support is horrible. Has anyone else gone through vulnerability assessments of their self hosted ConnectWise Conctrol server and figured out the correct way to tune various settings in the application? I don't want to break anything, but I have various things that need to be changed to harden the application."

I have handled a variety of things from break fix, building computers, vulnerability testing, network and security administration, designing computer networks, compliance checks, even repairing mobile devices and laptops in my spare time. Currently I am a part time admin for a dental company and am a 1 man consultant and doing field work and projects for other bigger companies, which is fine for paid work but I am not cultivating clients or businesses but representing a different bigger business, (on the plus side it allows me to work on higher end equipment and bigger networks from a field side though not a level 3 side) I have thought about the MSP route, but feel it is saturated. shrinking margins, and seems a lot of mom and pop places tried to go that route. I pride myself on quality....What about with the mobile device repair market is that saturated... Missed the boat on the independent hosting companies when they came around years ago. Maybe I am wrong, thoughts? It seems there are so so many different avenues that researching you end up with analysis paralysis.... Where does the 1 person shop/consultant focus to grow, continue IT consulting/Field Work or try and grow into a company? I'm interested in opinions and also thoughts on where IT could be shifting...I love IT and not trying to find the next great thing, just don't want to focus my energies on an area that has peaked. I just find some of my skill sets while great are becoming less needed.... the days of figuring out windows errors isn't as great like it was in the 98/2000/XP/7 days.... windows 10 has a lot less problems...

Long-time listener, first-time caller. I'm the recently promoted to full-time in-house IT guy for our \~100 person non-profit. I'd describe myself as Tier 1&amp;2 support; desktop, printer &amp; basic AD support. If I can't handle the issue or feel that it's above my head, I'll kick it up to our MSP, who also handles our network infrastructure. They can be slow to resolve problems and aren't amazing communicators, but overall I'd say we have a good working relationship. At this time there have been no discussions to replace them. New C-level management has come in, and they want an ""IT Assessment"". Leading the charge is our CFO, who in true C-level fashion, is very vocal about the topic of IT while not having the working knowledge to effectively talk about IT. The result is a constantly moving target with no clear goal in mind. He gave me a laundry list of items and told me to go get proposals from different outfits. This is what he wants for a review of our internal environment; * Map of our network configuration and analysis of its limitations and how it can be improved. * Policies and Procedures (e.g., patching, hardware and software installation, support, maintenance and maintenance contracts) * Communication systems: internal/external file sharing, email, e-mail encryption * What services are we being provided, and what additional services should we be provided. * Systems inventory - hardware and software age / support * System vulnerability - security - firewalls and configuration * Backup and redundancy systems * Anti-virus and anti-malware protection * Physical security &amp; disaster recovery 90% of that list we already know, or could easily find out from our MSP. I'm under the impression that we're also not trying to spend a ton of money on this (maybe a \~12k ceiling?). So I've been going to outfits in the area, and lo and behold, they're not too keen on approaching as a competitor and working with our existing partner to conduct a surface level assessment because that's all we can afford. I cant imagine that our MSP is going to be too jazzed about us bringing in a potential poacher either, even if we're not looking to change. From the conversations I've had so far, I'm under the impression that whoever we bring in is going to run some sniffing, assessment &amp; diagnostic tools to gather the basic info, give us a report of what we have, take their 10k and say have a nice day. We've already done an external pentest and re-mediated the found issues. I'd say our biggest pain point is our network structure, which we're trying to come up with a plan to re-do, but we could be moving our facility so that whole discussion is up in the air. I guess I'm just not sure how I'm supposed to proceed, or what I should be asking for. Spending the money for an ""assessment"" of what we have seems like a waste of time and money and risks alienating our existing partner. Approaching it from the perspective of auditing our MSP's practices seems more reasonable to me, but I haven't talked to anyone who is willing to do that, or even know if that's a common practice. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks."

Looking for a spot check on our process, and specifically a big question mark as it pertains to our RMM and RAT with respect to the BDR's. &amp;#x200B; We're currently doing the following to harden our BDR's: * TPM with secureboot * All disks encrypted * DUO to protect normal ""console"" access. * Windows firewall blocking everything inbound AND outbound on the BDR except for Veeam specific traffic and all of which is deny-by-default and only white-listing required IP's. * Network edge firewall blocking the same. * Using the encryption within Veeam for the backup files, with different keys for every system. * Backups are shipped offsite daily to two different locations, one within Azure cold storage and one at our colo for hot access should a client's building burn down or theft, cold storage being in a totally different geographic region in case the shit truly hits the fan. Hot storage is held on a very large NAS using ZFS with ZFS snapshots of the dataset in case the changes replicated from on-prem are compromised/suspect too. The NAS is air-gapped and only accessible via iscsi lun on the Hot Storage Clout Connect Box. The 2 offsite systems have similar protection and isolation as the on-prem BDR's. * VAC is similarly hardened/isolated (as much as it can be anyway since it does need to communicate with the endpoints) and all that traffic is also deny-by-default unless we've white-listed the client's IP where the BDR is at. * Keeping the BDR's NOT domain joined * Using unique credentials (including the username!) for each and every BDR admin login * No access to the backups via shares. * AV that does NOT have any remote command execution abilities. * No Manufacturer bloatware (looking at you Dell: SupportAssist) * I might be forgetting to list something, but you get the idea. &amp;#x200B; Here is where my big question mark is: Currently we put our RMM and RAT on the BDR's *and I think that has to end*. I am nervous that one day our RMM or RAT will get breached due to some unknown vulnerability. Even with all the above steps, if our RMM/RAT is hit and used against us, much of the above is meaningless. SO, I'm also considering NOT putting our RMM or RAT on the BDR, and only using a separate RAT (no rmm) that isn't internet connected, but accessible across a VPN tunnel we'd pull up as required to do management, maybe VNC or RDP (both on non-standard ports, and also all restricted to only listen from across the VPN or a reserved IP at the client-ip we'd use if needed while onsite). The goal is that so even if the absolute shit hit the fan, the damage would be limited in scope with respect to backups, compared to what has already been demonstrated to be the case with the Webroot fiasco some other MSP's experienced when their tools are used against us (yes I realize poor opsec was true cause, but my point about tools being used against us still stands). &amp;#x200B; Thoughts on our process, especially about the remote management strategy?"

The product lines i'm looking to pull out of are my RMM, phish testing, vulnerability scanning, and spam filter - to be able to give C-level reports of a few pagers, as well as the verbose indepth to the techies. &amp;#x200B; Appreciate any feedback anyone has!

We're looking for an all-in-one software we can deploy at a customer's site, run scans, then create a report that we can use and also provide to the customer. I'm thinking we'll need to create a toolkit consisting of different programs rather than relying on one main program but I would like to learn how other MSPs handle this subject. "
87,vulnerability,msp,Is anyone delaying new server hardware purchases due to Meltdown/Spectre/ForeShadow?,4,99mam3,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/99mam3/is_anyone_delaying_new_server_hardware_purchases/,2018-08-23 20:39:41,"Hi all, since the announcement last week of yet another vulnerability related to Speculative Execution Im having thoughts about delaying an upcoming server refresh of a bunch of blade servers. We host customer virtual machines and carious apps, the recent Foreshadow vulnerability along with the original Spectre vulnerability were quite severe as it opened up the possibility that a malicious user could access data from a neighbouring vm. In the world of cloud/vm hosting this is a huge security risk. As a result we have to go through the motions of patching/bios updates etc at short notice. My main concern is that there has now been 3 significant variations of this vulnerability arise this year and since there is no true fix other than replacing the hardware its likely to continue into the future. The latest Foreshadow vulnerability also comes with significant performance penalties depending on your platform, e.g having to disable hyper-threading. We are at a point where we need to start planning for a server refresh soon but I dont really want to take on new hardware that is vulnerable that well have to maintain for another 4 years. Ive read that the next gen of Intel Xeon Cascade lake is due out late 2018/2019 which supposedly has resolved the issues but without a confirmed date who knows? Is anyone else in the same boat? What are your thoughts? "

The trouble is, I've been searching for quite some time to find a reasonably exhaustive list of services (Rather than recreating the wheel) which could help us better define and organize what value we're providing to our existing and prospective clients. Part of the trouble I'm having is that lots of the available resources are geared toward colleges / universities - which I'm not afraid to model after - although beneficial, they seem to be a bit more narrowly defined than the space in which we operate. My customers represent several verticals, albeit, most seem to operate with PCI:DSS compliance as the underlying, core-focus. To that end, we're transitioning into an MSSP model - retaining some of our core MSP deliverables (which nicely compliment the MSSP services we've built.) We've found that it's increasingly difficult to sell (even based on value) using a custom consulting-fee basis to customers who sell a series of modular packages of services. Our ideal company would have a detailed list of services we offer - ""in buckets"" - which could then be further customized based on the end-goal. For example: We perform the following for most of our customers: - HelpDesk (Desktop, 3rd Party App Mgmt, Printer/Telephony Support services, etc.) - Asset Management - Backup/Disaster Recovery - Change Management - Hosting Services (email, datacenter, etc.) - Network Management - Patch Management - Policy Creation/Management - Penetration Testing - Server Management - Server Virtualization - Vulnerability Scanning (Internal &amp; External) This is a very succinct list, but should serve to describe our average PCI customer in a nutshell. There is no granularity, however, with added granularity, most of this is sufficient to achieve Level 1 PCI Compliance. Ideally, I would like to be able to better define packaging of services which appeals to this niche as well as others (general MSP services/service bundles) which could eventually extend into other compliance variations (CJIS, FINRA, GDRP, HIPAA, etc.) Here are a few resources I've found which seem to be heading in the right direction: 1: IT Service Taxonomy: (a mindmap/list of IT Services): URL 2: ITIL v3 Service Lifecycle Model: (this chart shows some great organization methodology that I would like to follow in some manner): URL 3: NITC Service Catalog: (This service catalog is one of the end-results we would like to have as a final product - though I don't believe we need a CMDB tool like ServiceNow just yet - perhaps later down the road.) URL 4: Solutions-II Security Service Catalog: (this is a great example of a Customer-Facing Catalog): URL Clarification: (Just in case this helps, here is my thought-process behind this project.) 1: Refer to an existing Service list - no use recreating the wheel here as we provide a wide array of services to date. 2: Incorporate vendors, software, or customized solutions we provide that align with the service list in step 1. 3: Define and document our margins and pricing strategy for each service / vendor. (For instance, we utilize at least five differing BDR solutions based on the customer's deployment scenario - each with different costs and margins.) 4: Define and document our intended SLA for each service. (The Internal Service Catalog should be complete with this step.) 5: Compile various commonly-purchased services into bite-sized service bundles for use by marketing / sales. (The Customer-Facing Service Catalog should be complete with this step.) 6: Continuous improvement - change management, etc. I am not currently ITIL certified, nor am I exorbitantly familiar with the concepts and/or definitions entailed, though at our current scope and size - it doesn't seem enormously valuable at the moment. However, as our company scales, I do definitely have an interest in focusing more on this aspect of our firm. Any advice and/or resources would be greatly appreciated!

However, with the changes they have made to Tenable.io, my CISO and CTO have decided they want to move away from Nessus.

Here is the fix **THE FIX** So you need to log into either machine having the issue, or if you use the Global Policy manager to manage multiple clients, you need to adjust the policy of the client(s) from there. The actual setting that needs to be changed is: **Realtime Shield&gt; Scan Files when Written or Modified.** Change it to **Off** on Draft. Save changes and then **apply to Live policy**. I recommend you first create a copy of the current policy in place, make the change on the copied policy, apply it to the workstation, remote into the workstation, right-click the Webroot icon (if enabled) and choose ""Refresh Configuration"". I recommend a reboot at this point. Then from there test to see if the user can now download files from Edge or Explorer, or see if (this was the issue in our case) whether or not they can open in-browser PDF files. I know a lot of medical clients have the latter for some healthcare websites. Its inane why they require IE or Edge, but I digress. Of course, there is now an implication to turning off that setting. It is normally disabled by default on the default server policy due to the high amount of changed files per second on typical servers. This is not the same for workstations, who SHOULD have the setting on, as these machines are the ones most likely affected by Ransomware and having the behavior enabled should detect any unauthorized file changes. My worry is that by disabling this policy, it opens our clients to a vulnerability for malware. I have not yet heard from Webroot about this issue. No response to any of my tickets made. I created one but it doesn't appear in my queue regarding the issue. If anyone else has encountered this issue, please post what Webroot support has told you and maybe we can come to a consensus on what should be done."

112,vulnerability,msp,Our Experience From Solarwinds to Ninja,10,72xc79,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/72xc79/our_experience_from_solarwinds_to_ninja/,2017-09-28 12:50:49,"EDIT: Caveat emptor, I realize there is a lot of Ninja hate, some of it well deserved, this is strictly our impressions during the first month and openly acknowledge it is far from the right RMM tool for everybody. Given we see regular posts asking about RMMs I thought I'd take a moment to write up our experience moving from Solarwinds RMM MSP (the Hounddog/Logicnow/Maxfocus one, not the N-Able one) over to Ninja. We were experiencing a lot of problems around the vulnerability scanner (either unresolvable failures, even on pristine new installs, or not running for a month without even a whisper), the Bitdefender implementation, and powershell scripts not actually firing off on Solarwinds (as well as being a real PITA to add a script to all endpoints at all customers/sites). We trialed quite a few RMMs and most had their redeeming qualities but we ended up getting a fantastic package price for Ninja/TeamViewer/Webroot that was too good to pass up. Here is a rundown of what our experiences have been during the first month: On Solarwinds we had enabled most everything so we had monitor, patch, AV (Bitdefender), tasks (scripts), web filter, and TeamViewer. We did not use the Solarwinds backup, we usually use Cloudberry to backup user data to B2. Initially, we were not keen on Ninja as I had run the demo but didn't quite get it at the time as I didn't realize they offered packages. I saw one of /u/emeffinsteve 's webinars with /u/AJNinjaPM though and decided to give it another go. Running it through its paces with the understanding that it was a package made a big difference and the APAC distributor, while a tad flaky at times with follow through, offered us a great package price that came in cheaper than what we were paying for Solarwinds. Things we've noticed on the company side: * The Ninja devs really take pride in their product and work to fix it and make it useful for their customers. * As a younger RMM the devs walk a bit of a balancing act between ironing out/maturing the platform and adding features. * They are pretty responsive to feedback and pretty forthright; Solarwinds used to give quite the runaround or not follow through for us so this was kind of a pleasant surprise. Things to note when switching: * There is a bit of a UI dance to get to a customer as you would hit dashboard -&gt; Overview -&gt; the client; however, once you get used to some Ninja mentalities like the search bar that can call up pretty much anything it helps. * Right now you can't send or schedule scripts/actions for systems that are offline; however, scripts run and they run immediately. No waiting 20 minutes and crossing your fingers like Solarwinds often requires. * If a windows service is missing, the windows service check will not fail. It has to both exist and fail as far as I've been able to ascertain. We had to account for this difference as we had used service checks to tell us if the software was installed and if it was running. * There isn't any integrated web protection so you'll need Umbrella or something along those lines. We are currently using Comodo which has been working okay aside from some odd miscategorizations. Actually, and I can't believe I'm saying this about Comodo, it seems more robust than what Solarwinds had in the product as we can go ahead and filter the whole site via DNS and it's been nailing phishing attempts pretty aggressively. * We had a fair amount of slowdown with the Solarwinds implementation of Bitdefender on some client systems, since moving to Webroot those slowdowns disappeared. Also, one of the Webroot engineers in APAC called up the other day to tell us to make sure we contact them if we run into any issues. As far as I know, we couldn't get tech support direct from Bitdefender under Solarwinds. * ""Search"" is really core to sorting or running an action/script on many systems at the same time. It can do some surprising things too, like if you select workstations and then type ""home"" you'd be seeing any Windows instances that need upgraded to Pro (curse you random Asus laptop sales!). * Beta has third-party patching (and installing) and it works pretty well and is much more intuitive than the clunky Solarwinds process (well... now it's two different processes in Solarwinds... weird). * Windows patching works well; however, if you have full control set then it doesn't appear to run unless the system is on during the update window. It doesn't have an option to run at first boot for systems that were off so you'll need to plan accordingly. * The community for Ninja is not terribly active compared to Solarwinds, but then again the Solarwinds community is very active with mostly complaints about the same issues with the agents. * The asset management agent installs will be missed, we sometimes had clients who would shelve laptops and sometimes bring them back out for staff, it was nice to just set a site under the client called ""unmanaged"" for those and bump them back to the site when they went back into rotation. Overall that has been our first-month impressions, while it isn't 100% perfect yet it's night and day from the weird unresolvable issues we had with Solarwinds. Hopefully this helps people debating between or planning on moving between the platforms."

A lot of comparison threads have been made about Nessus and Nexpose, but I haven't seen much QualysGuard and almost nothing about Retina. I'm working at what would be consider a network-security contractor to clients at an MSP. We would be using this product to scan potential future clients as well as our own network. I'm not sure how feasible this would be, because I've read that some of these products price based on IP address, or can only be installed on one system, and I'm not quite sure how that would work with what we're trying to do. Can anyone share with me their experiences when using these products, or their opinions on which ones are better for them? We are leaning towards Nessus Professional. Thanks."

We do vulnerability scanning through Retina and are looking at implementing LepideAuditor for file integrity monitoring.

Trying to figure out what best practices are, and which areas are still evolving. It seems like the best practices that most MSPs follow are: * Managed antivirus (e.g., Webroot) * Some kind of web hardening (e.g., OpenDNS, ZScaler) * Managed backup and DR (too many to list) * Managed firewalls (SonicWall, Meraki, pfSense for the brave) * UTM add-ons on those firewalls that do IDS/IPS/content filtering * Scanning of inbound emails for phishing/malware (e.g., Proofpoint, Reflexion) * Encryption of outbound emails for compliance (same) * Secure remote working (VPN, forced laptop encryption, etc.) * Simple vulnerability scans (e.g., Nessus, Qualys) * A contractor they can recommend to help write security policies* RMM of choice to handle patch management * RMM of choice to enforce and/or audit OS security settings, like password strength, UAC, etc. * A monitoring tool that tracks system performance. Not directly IT security related, but a machine burning CPU or huge amounts of bandwidth could be the first sign of an attack. The challenges and issues that keep popping up: (1) **Log management.** Gathering all the logs from the systems listed above. Put the logs in one place where someone can make sense of them. Per this post a few days ago: URL (2) **Unusual behavior.** Once you have the logs, watching for anomalies. Like a machine hitting a random port when it usually only uses 80 or 443. Or the machine uploading 10GB when it normally does 10MB/day. Or the successful VPN connection from Croatia when all of your employees are in the US. (3) **Customer or supplier InfoSec questionnaires.** I've seen a TON of these. The MSP's customer is a vendor that sells into the financial services, healthcare, or government space. You get a 100 question survey that you have to answer about your IT security practices. The stakes are pretty high because you don't want the customer to lose their revenue. (4) **Advice on specific categories of security solutions.** I've seen a few of these on /r/msp. It's less ""which XYZ is the best"" and more ""how do I know when I need XYZ."" Things like endpoint detection and response, network sandbox, data loss prevention, threat intel, etc. And trying to understand how they tie back to regulations like HIPAA/PCI/GLBA/etc. What are the other big challenges around IT security that you're seeing?

121,vulnerability,msp,"X-Post from /r/MaxFocus: Lots of ""vulnerabilities identified"" by Vulnerability Scan on Windows 10",7,68ov9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/68ov9l/xpost_from_rmaxfocus_lots_of_vulnerabilities/,2017-05-02 07:25:33,"Don't think I can post a link in this sub, so [this is a cross-post of this post](URL from /r/maxfocus as that sub seems somewhat dead. I have lots of fully-patched Windows 10 machines with nothing except for Office 2013/2016, Google Chrome, and occasionally Skype and Dropbox installed, and yet the MaxFocus/MSPRMM (what's the current name?) vulnerability scan detects a huge number of vulnerabilities on each one. Some of these vulnerabilities were patched a year or two ago. Is this a bug in the vulnerability scan? If not, how do I resolve this? I have clients asking why their weekly email reports mention a large number of vulnerabilities. The first couple of entries (AutoRun, admin shares, shutdown without login) I understand and don't care about (is there an ignore list?), it's all of the seemingly patched CVE's that confuse me. And why are Skype and Dropbox considered vulnerabilities? Here's an example from a fully patched machine: AutoShareServer The administrative shares (C$,D$,ADMIN$,etc) are available on this machine. For Internal networks these are normally turned on for administrative purposes. For Web server(s) these are normally turned off in order to solidify the possible entry points (since it is more exposed to attacks.). If you don't use them set HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters\AutoShareServer to 0 to prevent creation of these shares. For more information, visit: URL AutoShareWKS The administrative shares (C$,D$,ADMIN$,etc) are available on this machine. For Internal networks these are normally turned on for administrative purposes. For Web server(s) these are normally turned off in order to solidify the possible entry points (since it is more exposed to attacks.). If you don't use them set HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters\AutoShareWks to 0 to prevent creation of these shares. For more information, visit: URL Cached Logon Credentials Microsoft Windows NT caches the logon information of users who would have logged on, so that they would be able to logon when the server is unavailable. When a domain controller is unavailable and a user's logon information is cached, the user will still be allowed to logon. The cache can hold up from 0 to 50 logon attempts, with the value of 0 disabling logon caching. If the value is set to a high value and an administrator logs in to computers to solve specific problems, an attacker might obtain the credentials of the administrator at a later stage, and logon with such an account, having powerful privileges. The registry value for setting this type of caching is: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\CachedLogonsCount. Ideally it should be set to either 0 to disable caching, or else it should be set to 1 to provide for functionality (allowing the last user to logon immediately next time) and security. Also, why are Skype and Dropbox considered vulnerabilities? Shutdown without logon Anybody is allowed to shutdown this computer. For more information, visit: URL IM installed: Skype Skype instant messaging client is installed. AutoRun is enabled Microsoft Windows supports automatic execution in CD/DVD drives and other removable media. This poses a security risk in the case where a CD or removable disk containing malware that automatically installs itself once the disc is inserted.

Hello! Over the years we've worked with different vulnerability scanners like Nessus, OpenVAS, etc. They're great. Not hard to use either. Lovely auto-generated PDF reports that make us look super smart. The hard part is dealing with the output. It's overwhelming. Those tools report even the tiniest vulnerabilities. It takes a senior consultant to parse through them and figure out what to remediate and what to ignore. This leads to a couple problems that I've found make it challenging to include in an MSP offering: 1. Gotta pay senior consultants a lot of money to look through detailed reports, eliminating the pricing efficiencies of most MSP engagements 2. If we choose not to remediate lower-risk threats, they'll keep showing up on the reports every month and we have to keep spending labor time to ignore them. This is not scalable. Any suggestions on how to make vulnerability scan reports more actionable and efficient to remediate? Thanks! :-)"

Myself, I am adamant that if a system is known-infected, the only proper approach is to completely wipe that system and reinstall the OS (or re-image, or whatever your capabilities are). This is an easy argument in the enterprise space, but very tough at the small business level since rarely does a small client have redundancy (thus, the machine being down is a big deal), and the cost of rebuild is $100's they didn't plan for. I have been tuned into cybersecurity on a daily basis for years now. One theme that is common is that malware gets embedded deeply into the system, uses obfuscation and various ways to hide, living off the land techniques most notably powershell, persistent and often encrypted C&amp;C access that enables new malware transfer, etc. So my argument is always: why take the chance. Problem is, this never jives well with the smaller clients. Especially if a lot of work is involved to rebuild a system that wasn't being backed up or managed so that you have quick access to license keys during reinstall, passwords, etc. So my questions are these: Do you rebuild a system, or just scan, or some other option #3? If you do system rebuilds, do you focus at all on alternate storage spots like firmware/EPROM, or just hope everything is on disk and is handled by a disk wipe? I'm also curious about tips on those manual rebuild scenarios. I do this from time to time so am fairly experienced, but just wonder if I should do anything differently: Assuming there are no backups to restore from, I take that system to the office, boot it once without network access to get eyes on what things look like for the user: which apps are default, where stuff is being saved, etc., retain browser-cached credentials if I can. Then power down, take the drive out, attach via USB dock to a lab computer, run a full scan, hope for the best on that, backup what I can from the drive to media I will never use here again and plan to destroy or give to the customer later. Then wipe the machine, rebuild, and restore things from that disposable media. Depending on the urgency of things, if I have the option to let the system age a bit on the shelf I'll do that, so definitions on my lab scanning system update to latest while whatever is on the infected machine isn't updating. But that's usually not an option. Thanks all."

A lot of small to medium-sized businesses cannot afford to maintain their cybersecurity on their own and by outsourcing this to the MSSPs lets them focus on their area of expertise. An MSSP offers solutions such as firewalls, end-point security technologies, and many other data loss prevention methods that are custom-made for the small to medium businesses (SMBs). MSSPs offer services based on the need and utility and their charges also vary based on the same. Now that we understood how the MSSPs work lets look at the [benefits of MSSP.](URL"

I'm specifically talking about some of the heavier, more advanced endpoint tools. It doesn't make sense to compare a lightweight tool like Webroot with something more robust like S1. First, it doesn't seem like ease of deployment is that big of a differentiator. My impression is that all of these heavier endpoint tools have challenges. They're hooking in to some deep OS and application shit. In our tests, none of them were trouble-free even with very small deployments. Seems like there's going to be some heavy lifting for the IT team no matter what. Second, the management console. This is one area where we totally get the Sentinel One love. They've created a user experience that puts every other endpoint vendor to shame. But neither of these focus on the actual cybersecurity value of the tools. They all use machine learning. I would argue this is an area where being an established company (like BD or Sophos) is a big benefit, since they will have seen more data to feed models. And they've been doing it for 10+ years. They all have capabilities to inspect processes at run-time and pre-launch to look for malicious activity. They all have EDR capabilities that send activity logs back to a cloud console. They all look for simple signs of fileless attacks, like unusual PowerShell scripts or port scans. Though in our testing, there were some surprising things that S1 didn't catch in this area. But Sentinel One seems to be missing some important things: (1) Very limited file scanning, and the ""DFI"" scan only scans certain file types of certain sizes and focuses on file headers. This missed some obvious malware at a client where we tested it recently. (2) No local machine firewall / IDS control. I feel like this is becoming more important as people are working remotely more. (3) No sandbox capabilities to detonate suspicious or unknown files to see if they do anything malicious. And most importantly, Sentinel One seems to have performed poorly in almost all comparative tests in the recent past. Or they're entirely missing from the ratings. I know that vendors respond to this by saying ""the tests are no good,"" but it seems pretty telling when you compare across NSS Labs, av-test.org, and av-comparatives.org. So help me understand -- why the love? What am I missing?"

Since my father owns a small, but lots of insurance premium revenue, insurance agency, and due to my previous selling roles, he kept begging me to come on board to manage their IT infrastructure while also handling clients/selling/etc. This then allowed me to learn the ins and outs of the wild west in Insurance policies, cyber liability insurance/Cybersecurity insurance/all kinds of related names covering mainly the same things. Due to family politics and drama that his 3rd wife who graduated 3 years before brings to anyone who she doesn't like or people that she deems a threat to her own career, I am looking to get back in IT, maybe have to start on the bottom at help desk due to my jumping around and many hats situation. One thing I wanted to implement was a program where I'd work with an MSP multiple MSPs to provide a service that to their clients as all systems still have a vulnerability even with the best IT Security infrastructure you can buy. I'd be their Consultant and could also be their agent who implements and ensures their cyber policies requirements are met by their IT infrastructure, policies, guidelines, etc... A lot of cyber policies require that the business has all of these processes in place or the policy won't play out. FINE PRINT. Many don't know this. It could be seen as negligence from the insurance carriers eyes, so the business isn't covered from an attack even if they have a policy. As you can read daily, small businesses/medium business are the easiest targets for a system attack. 60% go out of business after a data breach/ransomware attack. What I'd like to do is jump into an MSP job doing help desk/jr system admin/system admin work, focus on getting a cyber certification, and also being a sort of cyber insurance consultant to the MSP and their clients to make sure they will be covered in case the inevitable happens. Where'd (MSP) have to approach it delicately when discussing with the client, so as to not think we are great at cybersecurity, but that we are and this will give the client and MSP an extra benefit of having some that can find/read/consult on cyber policies to help everyone sleep better. It also opens up the opportunity for the MSP to sell more of their Cybersecurity options. If you could let me know what you guys think of this strategy? Having a IT Specialist and Licensed Property and Casualty Agent (Cybersecurity insurance policies are under P&amp;C licensing. )? Tldr. I am a licensed insurance agent specializing in Cybersecurity insurance policies (the wild west of insurance policies today, very tricky) AND I've had and still do various IT Consultant/Support/Admin roles.

174,cybersecurity,msp,Here you go for free - Damage Control: Cyber Insurance and Compliance,1,fjmmhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/fjmmhb/here_you_go_for_free_damage_control_cyber/,2020-03-17 02:21:47,"Im back with my second book, Damage Control: Cyber Insurance and Compliance. This builds upon book #1 that I released here previously, but includes an additional 29% new material and 81% more cited court cases + however many additional stories not in the court records. It comes in at about 123,000 words with 940 citations. Other material throughout the book has been tweaked or updated. This book can be used for sales/marketing/advising to all clients; regardless of industry. Ideally, we can get businesses to start taking cybersecurity and privacy seriously. Considering how many of your clients also ask for help with their cyber insurance application, Id recommend you also reference the application chapter(s). This book took me the better part of 5 years of my life and untold thousands of hours away from my family to research/write/edit/etc. While I had different plans for its release, use, and marketing, the declaration of a national emergency dictates a change of those plans. **You are now welcome to send my whole book out for free to everyone and anyone who would benefit.** Ultimately, Im releasing this early due to the mad rush for remote work. Were already seeing cyber insurance claims spike due to remote workers making mistakes (phishing scams, social engineering, being tired/stressed etc.), or misconfigurations in various systems that were exploited by malicious actors. Were also seeing coronavirus-specific scams, and no slowdown in municipalities and hospitals being hit with ransomware. Breaches and ransomware will escalate as the stress builds and more employers make a mad dash to remote work or the situation worsens. With so many businesses already taking a huge economic hit, uninsured data breach costs will certainly lead to massive financial difficulties, or bankruptcy. Those losses could result in MSPs or other IT/technology providers facing a wave of claims if businesses have nowhere else to turn. **-If youd like a free copy, upvote this post to get the message out and chat/message me an email address.** **-As per last time, I care about privacy and cybersecurity. Unfortunately, the wider business world doesnt care as much as we do. Hopefully this book changes that mindset.** **-Please dont add me to your newsletter. I wont add you to mine.** **-Best of luck to you all. This is quickly turning into ""MSP Appreciation Month.""** **-We're all in this together and we're all going to take a big hit in the coming months. I would urge everyone to do their part and find a way to make the world a little better with their own skillsets.** (Mods: My apologies for violating the rules in the previous post.)

Before we engaged with them their IT was a complete mess. It's practically trouble-free now. And because of the COVID-19 crisis and everyone working from home they are now asking ""considering their new platform"" i.e. working from home, if there was a possibility of them changing to hourly or on-call. I have an email composed detailing everything we provide for them but I'm afraid my point will be missed and they'll just be reading and seeing ""patch management...blah...blah...cybersecurity...blah... test restores... whatever..."" Funny thing is, the company isn't hurting for money. They are famous for a niche product that is in every outdoors store in the country. The company and founder/owner is easily worth millions.

In essence, CMMCs governing body will train and license Certified 3rd Party Assessment Organizations (C3PAOs) and their assessors. In turn, these C3PAOs will be comprised of at least two assessors who can certify a contractors CMMC License Level. The assessors will not be CMMC Accreditation Board (CMMC-AB) employees.[\[iii\]](URL According to one source, the Pentagon wants these assessors to be independent, so assessors will not be allowed to sell contractors other cyber services.[\[iv\]](URL When CMMC will become, live is speculative as of this publication. According to Lockheed Martin, CMMC will be included in RFIs starting roughly in June of 2020, and in RFPs starting roughly in September of 2020.[\[v\]](URL Many industry experts believe that CMMC will undergo changes in the future, so contractors should remain vigilant. How the CMMC will apply to subcontractors is not explicitly apparent in the controlling documents. Merely, the CMMC V1 states that a contractor can, adequately protect CUI at a level commensurate with the risk, accounting for information flow down to its subcontractors in a multi-tier supply chain.[\[vi\]](URL Nevertheless, it is safe to assume that every contractor handing sensitive information will need to be certified to at least the fundamental level. **Covered Information Types** CMMC is designed to cover two types of information which are commonly held by contractors:  Federal Contract Information (FCI), which is, information, not intended for public release, that is provided by or generated for the Government under a contract to develop or deliver a product or service to the Government, but not including information provided by the Government to the public (such as on public Web sites) or simple transactional information, such as necessary to process payments.[\[vii\]](URL Initially, this definition is found outside of the CMMC within the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.204-21. This regulation is also known as Basic Safeguarding of Covered Contractor Information Systems.  Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), which is, information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with laws, regulations, and government-wide policies, excluding information that is classified under EO 13526, Classified National Security Information, December 29, 2009, or any predecessor or successor order, or Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. [\[viii\]](URL Broadly, the safeguarding of CUI is found in Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting (DFARS 252.204-7012).[\[ix\]](URL The CUI Registry is quite extensive and contains numerous categories and subcategories. Depending on the engagement and specialty of the contractor, they could be handling information from any number of CUI categories.[\[x\]](URL Contractors are encouraged to reference the CUI categories found at [URL **CMMC Levels** The CMMC contains five cumulative levels which will be mandated by government depending on the particular contract. They can generally be understood with the following descriptions: Level 1: The contractor practices basic cyber hygiene by utilizing the basic safeguarding requirements found in FAR 52.204-21.[\[xi\]](URL At this level, contractors will presumably be dealing only with FCI. Level 2: The contractor satisfies the requirements of Level 1, but also documents and implements practices and policies to comply with part of NIST SP 800-171 and selected other sources.[\[xii\]](URL At this level, contractors will presumably be dealing with CUI though in the CMMC it is described as a, transition step.[\[xiii\]](URL Level 3: The contractor satisfies the requirements of Level 2, but must also demonstrate, good cyber hygiene. They must also have a plan that demonstrates the management of implementation. This could include having necessary training, plans, goals, and buy-in from stakeholders.[\[xiv\]](URL This level includes safeguards and other practices from NIST SP 800-171, DFARS 252.204-1702, and other selected requirements. Level 4: The contractor satisfies the requirements of Level 3, but also reviews and quantifies their security practices for effectiveness. In addition, they must demonstrate a proactive approach to combating advanced persistent threats (APTs). This level includes safeguards from NIST SP 800-171, DFARS 252.204-7012, certain requirements from NIST SP 800-171B, and other practices.[\[xv\]](URL Level 5: The contractor satisfies the requirements of Level 4, but must also optimize their safeguards implementation across the business. This level further refines the protection of CUI from APTs. This level includes safeguards from NIST SP 800-171, DFARS 252.204-7012, certain requirements from NIST SP 800-171B, and other practices.[\[xvi\]](URL For further clarification, contractors should reference CMMC Version 1 Appendix B found at: [URL **CMMC Domains** CMMC contains the following 17 domains. These domains contain titles that may be distinct from those found in the soon to be mentioned publications on which CMMC is based. However, these domains are detailed in CMMC Appendix A to level requirements which are mapped mainly against the various referencing requirements noted below. The seventeen CMMC domains are:[\[xvii\]](URL  Access Control (AC)  Asset Management (AM)  Audit and Accountability (AU)  Awareness and Training (AT)  Configuration Management (CM)  Identification and Authentication (IA)  Incident Response (IR)  Maintenance (MA)  Media Protection (MP)  Personnel Security (PS)  Physical Protection (PE)  Recovery (RE)  Risk Management (RM)  Security Assessment (CA)  Situational Awareness (SA)  System and Communication (SC)  System and Information Integrity (SI) Within the CMMC Appendices, each domain listed above is broken down into capabilities. In turn the capability lists the required practices for each level with reference material. As stated within CMMC, the majority of compliance efforts at all levels originate from FAR 52.204-21 and DFARS 252.204-7012.[\[xviii\]](URL For this reason, they will be discussed in detail below. Levels 2 through 5 also contain other compliance references. These additional references will not be mentioned below, so they should be reviewed with the necessary consulting expert and/or legal counsel. In a hierarchy chart, the CMMC system can be displayed as the following: (original graphic omitted) CMMC &gt;&gt; Overall Certification CMMC Level &gt;&gt; Various requirements for certification levels 1-5 Domains &gt;&gt; Ex: Access Control (AC) Capabilities &gt;&gt; Ex: C001 Establish System Access Requirements Practices &gt;&gt; Ex: Ac.1.001 References&gt;&gt; Ex: FAR 52.204-21 b.1.i **FAR 52.204-21** As noted within CMMC, Level 1 encompasses the FCI basic safeguarding requirements found in (FAR) 52.204-21. Level 1 of the CMMC is, equivalent to all of the safeguarding requirements from FAR Clause 52.204-21.[\[xix\]](URL Per FAR Regulation 52.204-21, the following safeguards are **mandatory** and are considered the **minimum** requirements for any business handling FCI: (i) Limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, or devices (including other information systems). (ii) Limit information system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute. (iii) Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external information systems. (iv) Control information posted or processed on publicly accessible information systems. (v) Identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices. (vi) Authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information systems. (vii) Sanitize or destroy information system media containing Federal Contract Information before disposal or release for reuse. (viii) Limit physical access to organizational information systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals. (ix) Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity; maintain audit logs of physical access; and control and manage physical access devices. (x) Monitor, control, and protect organizational communications (i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational information systems) at the external boundaries and key internal boundaries of the information systems. (xi) Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically or logically separated from internal networks. (xii) Identify, report, and correct information and information system flaws in a timely manner. (xiii) Provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations within organizational information systems. (xiv) Update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available. (xv) Perform periodic scans of the information system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed. (2) Other requirements. This clause does not relieve the Contractor of any other specific safeguarding requirements specified by Federal agencies and departments relating to covered contractor information systems generally or other Federal safeguarding requirements for controlled unclassified information (CUI) as established by Executive Order 13556. (c) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts under this contract (including subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial items, other than commercially available off-the-shelf items), in which the subcontractor may have Federal contract information residing in or transiting through its information system.[\[xx\]](URL Naturally, complying with the above is no easy task. However, any company wishing to do business with the government  either as a prime or subcontractor  should consider CMMC Level 1; at a minimum. **NIST SP 800-171 &amp; DFARS 252.204-1702** Within the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 48 is commonly referred to as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This regulation governs the formation and administration of contracts with the federal government. Within FAR, there are more than 20 supplements, but the cybersecurity requirements within the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) are the most important for businesses with Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. Broadly speaking, DFARS governs the majority of procurements made by DoD, General Services Administration (GSA), and all branches of the armed forces. CMMC Levels 2 through 5 are, variously testing the CUI security requirements found in 48 C.F.R. 252.2047012 Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting; with the addition of selected other practices. DFARS contains the relatively new provision known as Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting (DFARS 252.204-7012).[\[xxi\]](URL If a contractor stores, processes, or transmits covered defense information, they are likely subject to the 7012 regulation. Per the DoD, covered defense information is defined as unclassified controlled technical information (CTI) or other information as described in the CUI Registrythat requires safeguarding/dissemination controls AND IS EITHER marked or otherwise identified in the contract and provided to the contractor by DoD in support of performance of the contract; OR collected/developed/received/transmitted/used/stored by the contractor in performance of contract.[\[xxii\]](URL To remain compliant with DFARS 252.204-7012, firms and their legal counsel should be aware that the regulation contains two main provisions. The first deals with protecting covered defense information  generally synonymous with CUI  via NIST Special Publication 800-171 Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations. Proper compliance with this framework can require significant time and resources as it covers policies, process, secure IT configurations, and possibly additional hardware and security-related software.[\[xxiii\]](URL NIST SP 800-171 contains the following fourteen specific requirements with general explanations:  **Access Control**  Who can view this data?  **Awareness and Training**  Are those who can view the data trained properly?  **Audit and Accountability**  Can the firm identify and track who accesses the system?  **Configuration Management**  Can the firm establish, maintain, and enforce secure configuration requirements?  **Identification and Authentication**  Does the firm possess the ability to verify the identity of users, devices, or process prior to viewing the information?  **Incident Response**  Does the firm have a system for testing and handling incidents?  **Maintenance**  How will routine maintenance be handled and who is responsible?  **Media Protection**  How does the firm handle hard copy and electronic records, including backup storage?  **Personnel Security**  Are those allowed access to information appropriately screen before access and is there access revoked upon termination?  **Physical Protection**  Does the firm limit the physical access to systems and is access recorded?  **Risk Assessment**  Are there routine vulnerability scanning and risk assessments of the organization and its systems?  **Security Assessment**  How will the firm continuously assess and improve their security controls?  **System and Communications Protection**  Are communications monitored, controlled, and protected at crucial internal and external system boundaries?  **System and Information Integrity**  How is the system integrity maintained and monitored for intrusions?[\[xxiv\]](URL While that may seem relatively straightforward, contractors should understand that within the fourteen requirements, there are an additional 118 total basic and derived security requirements.[\[xxv\]](URL Previously, if the contractor wanted to vary from the standards present in NIST SP 800-171, they will need to submit a request in writing to the Contracting Officer, who will forward it for consideration to the DoD CIO.[\[xxvi\]](URL It is currently unknown if this requirement will change under CMMC. If the contractor wants to use an external cloud provider to store, process, or transmit covered information, the business must contractually require and ensure that the cloud provider meets the security requirements listed in the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).[\[xxvii\]](URL The cloud provider must still meet the requirements of DFARS 252.204-7012 pertaining to cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.[\[xxviii\]](URL Any IT system or service other than the cloud provider requirements are still subject to the security restrictions found in DFARS 252.204-7012, [\[xxix\]](URL and CMMC.[\[xxx\]](URL The second main provision deals with the rapid reporting of cyber incidents and cooperation with the DoD. Per the regulation, cyber incidents are actions taken through the use of computer networks that result in a compromise or an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information system and/or the information residing therein. When a cyber incident is discovered, the firm will review the incident in accordance with the regulatory requirements and report the incident within 72 hours.[\[xxxi\]](URL CMMC has a slightly different definition of a breach, stating, An incident where an adversary has gained access to the internal network of an organization or an organizationally owned asset in a manner that breaks the organizational policy for accessing cyber assets and results in the loss of information, data, or asset. A breach usually consists of the loss of an asset due to gained access.[\[xxxii\]](URL Contractors should note the particular use of the word, usually in the above definition. With a strict interpretation of the definition, a ransomware event may require notification as information could have been accessed even if not potentially acquired. This is a topic that contractors should clarify with their assessors, and if possible, the CMMC-AB. Per DFARS 252.204-7012, if it is determined that malicious software was on the computer system that contributed to the incident, the firm must submit the offending code to the DoDs Cyber Crime Center. From there, the DoD can decide to formally assess the damage caused by the incident. During this assessment, the firm may be required to submit the media to the DoD and further aid in their evaluation.[\[xxxiii\]](URL Failure to follow the safeguarding requirements of DFARS 252.204-7012 could result in detrimental actions against the contractor per DFARS 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information: A breach of these obligations or restrictions may subject the Contractor to  (i) Criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual actions in law and equity for penalties, damages, and other appropriate remedies by the United States, and; (ii) Civil actions for damages and other appropriate remedies by the third party that reported the cyber incident, as a third-party beneficiary of this clause.[\[xxxiv\]](URL **Draft NIST SP 800-171B Requirements -CMMC Levels 4 &amp; 5** Of note, NIST SP 800-171B is not a new standard per se, but merely a supplement to the previously note NIST 800-171. The purpose of the supplement is to protect CUI from advanced persistent threats (APTs).[\[xxxv\]](URL Some or all of the approximately 32 requirements found in NIST SP 800-171N may be contractually required  via the CMMC  to be implemented in addition to the basic and derived requirements found in NIST SP 800-171.[\[xxxvi\]](URL It is not unreasonable to assume that implementing enhanced security controls will be costly. According to the NIST report on the estimated cost of implementing NIST SP 800-171B, compliance could easily exceed $10M for a company with 25-50 endpoint networks.[\[xxxvii\]](URL For interested parties, the DoD cost estimate for NIST SP 800-171B implementation can be found for free at: [URL Perhaps more interesting than the cost analysis found in the above document is the estimated number of affected contractors that will require NIST SP 800-171B implementation. Per the analysis, We estimate that 69,000 contractors have controlled unclassified data. However, less than one half of 1% of DoD contractors develop critical capabilities for DoD.[\[xxxviii\]](URL Although there have been no official pronouncements yet on the number of contractors requiring Level 4 or 5 compliance, this would point to only less than 400 companies nationwide. **Other Referenced Requirements** As stated previously, the majority of CMMC is based upon FAR 52.204-21 and DFARS 252.204-7012.[\[xxxix\]](URL However, there are additional references found in the appendices that will require investigation by contractors should they be deemed necessary, or mandatory. These include, but are not limited to: CERT RMM v1.2, CIS Controls v7.1, NIST SP 800-53, UK NCSC Cyber Essentials, ACSC Essential Eight Maturity Model, DOEs C2M2, NIST SP 800-39, NIST CSF V1.1, and FIPS PUBs 199,201, and 197. While important, these publications will not be detailed here as doing so would prove too lengthy. Any contractor who is interested in these references should seek qualified compliance experts and/or legal counsel. **CMMC Certifications and Compliance** In January 2020, the CMMC-AB (Accreditation Board) was formally incorporated. As of this publication, there are no licensed CMMC assessors who can issue a certification. The CMMC-AB is still waiting on a number of issues to be resolved before assessors can be trained. Directly from the CMMC-AB website, The CMMC Standard is not yet finalized and no Assessors or C3PAOs are formally accredited or certified by the CMMC-AB. Therefore, it is currently inappropriate for any Assessor or C3PAO to claim to provide formal CMMC assessments that will meet the requirements for a DoD contract.[\[xl\]](URL This does not mean that businesses should neglect preparation until assessors are available. With hundreds of thousands of potential contractors that will require certification in short order, there could be a serious lack of assessor for the foreseeable future. Any business who could work with the DoD should consider a good faith internal assessment in light of their perceived future requirements. For smaller contractors, or those with smaller cybersecurity budgets, there is hope when considering the costs associated with CMMC Compliance. According to Katie Arrington, the special assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition for Cyber in the Office of the Under Secretary of Acquisition and Sustainment in DoD, security is an allowable cost.[\[xli\]](URL However, she also noted that eventually, certification requirements will be placed in contracts and will be used as a, go or no-go decision. [\[xlii\]](URL Contractors are thus highly encouraged to begin working towards their applicable certification level as soon as possible. **Additional Legal Concerns** Beyond failing to secure new contracts, or falling victim to a cyber attack and losing critical national defense information, businesses must remain vigilant of the cybersecurity claims they make to the government. Consider the allegations found in the case of *United States v. Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.* where the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California held that an alleged failure to adhere to government contracting cybersecurity requirements.[\[xliii\]](URL In this case, the relator, Brian Markus, worked for Aerojet as the senior director of Cyber Security, Compliance, and Controls for approximately 15 months. [\[xliv\]](URL The defendants, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. and Aerojet Rocketdyne, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Aerojet) develop and manufacture products for both the aerospace and defense industries. Through the course of business, it was alleged that Aerojet dealt with contracts that required compliance with DFARS 252.204-7012 as well as 48 C.F.R.  1852.204-76  NASAs functional equivalent to DFARS 252.204-7012. [\[xlv\]](URL Markus alleged that Aerojet fraudulently misrepresented their compliance with minimum required cybersecurity standards as required by the contracts. He further alleged that Aerojet knew they were not compliant with the requisite standards after a third-party compliance audit. Nonetheless. Markus alleged that Aerojet nonetheless continued to misrepresent their compliance status when communicating with government officials. Markus finally alleged that these misrepresentations led to Aerojet receiving a government contract. [\[xlvi\]](URL Amongst other causes of action, Markus filed a False Claims Act (FCA). Based on Markuss claims on this count, the court held that he, plausibly pled that defendants' alleged failure to fully disclose its noncompliance was material to the government's decision to enter into and pay on the relevant contracts. [\[xlvii\]](URL Understanding this ruling, contractors should keep a close eye on their cybersecurity compliance requirements lest they find themselves subject to similar claims. Adequate adherence will likely require constant vigilance between CMMC certifications.

On 1/30, Involta was successfully served the complaint by Boardman Molded Products. You can find the allegations of Boardman here: [URL On 2/24, defense counsel requested that they be given a 30 days extension to move, plead, or otherwise respond to the allegations made by Boardman. Per the motion, this was unopposed by Involta. You can find that here: [URL As of 2/25, we obviously do not have the response from Involta. That will certainly be interesting to see what their defense will be to the allegations. If/when that becomes available, I'll post the court documents to this sub. I wouldn't really read too much into this, except that both parties may be digging in their heels for a prolonged fight. Boardman alleges a loss of about $1.7M due to social engineering. With a loss that big, they're probably willing to duke it out for a while to at least get a settlement of some size. Likewise, I'm sure that Involta is going to stand on the idea that it wasn't their responsibility. At the end of the day, this could take god knows how long. Whatever happens, this just proves that the legal system is a process. I'm sure both parties probably feel like they are 100% in the right, but the process - however long - must play out. **TL;DR:** Grab some popcorn. This could take a while. Make sure you're getting proactive about educating clients on the risks they face. I'll give out my upcoming book on cyber insurance and cybersecurity law for businesses in general in about 2 weeks on this sub. If you haven't already, I have book 1 available if you message me your email address. (Book one is for CPA firms, but can be applied to many businesses)"

Thought others in the MSP community might find them helpful. Would love to hear other ideas to add as well. \--------- In the past few days, the CDC updated their guidance for businesses about the coronavirus COVID-19. Here's a link to the guidance: [URL Beyond the items mentioned in the CDC guidance, we wanted to suggest a few other steps that you should take inside of your business to prepare for a possible pandemic: 1. Please review your business continuity plan, and make any updates that are needed. 2. Now is a good time to review the list of people who have the ability to work remotely. If your office needs to be closed for 2+ weeks, make sure that everyone who needs remote access has it. 3. If your staff occasionally works remotely, have them test their remote connectivity sometime in the next few days. 4. We'd recommend having a discussion with your staff now to make sure that your plans are complete. The scenario you should be planning for is a 2+ week closure of the office, which hopefully is a worst case scenario. 5. Make sure that your contact list of cell phone numbers and home phone numbers is up to date in case you're unable to reach people via email and need to urgently communicate something. 6. Make sure that any web conferencing tools that you use have a subscription large enough to handle your whole team, if needed. 7. Consider whether to stock up on soap, hand sanitizer, gloves, and masks (which are already in very short supply). 8. If your employees don't have laptops but may be expected to work from home, now is the time to consider getting them company-issued laptops. Be careful not to compromise security by letting employees use personal computers that bypass all of your cybersecurity measures. 9. With supply lines with China disrupted, we may start to see shortages on technology items. If you're planning any critical technology purchases in 2020, consider expediting them. 10. As with any world news, there are already coronavirus phishing messages making the rounds. Remind your staff to be extra careful about clicking on links or opening attachments in emails about coronavirus (even if they appear to come from inside the company)."

188,cybersecurity,msp,How to implement a security awareness program?,1,elmlcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/elmlcy/how_to_implement_a_security_awareness_program/,2020-01-08 14:04:16,"As part of the activities I do at [wizer-training.com](URL (free security awareness solution) I asked the LinkedIn community this question. I summarized the comments and created this crowdsourced quick guide on How to Successfully Implement a Security Awareness Program. I really liked how this turned out and I am planning to share it with all of our customers. I believe that a true solution cannot be based only on technology... Heres the link to the original post [URL I thought this may also be useful to the reddit community. I am also planning a version 2, so if you have suggestions please let me know. So, let's get started... ## IT ALL STARTS WITH ONBOARDING Its crucial to instill the importance of security from the very beginning. New hires are often targeted by cyber criminals because they dont know many co-workers and are more likely to follow direction from someone who pretends to be an executive. ## WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME Cyber criminals do not discriminate and often use the same methods to hack organizations and individuals. People are more accepting of learning when its personal. So, make training personal and teach them how to protect themselves at home, they will soon apply the same behavior at the workplace. ## STAY AWAY FROM JUST TICKING THE COMPLIANCE BOX After all, we just want employees to learn something and change their behavior, so take the time to explain why you are implementing the program. If they don't understand the importance of security, then they won't take it seriously. And dont make it a once a year thing, it should be a continuous effort all year long. ## GET THE BOSS TO BUY-IN Show how security training aligns with organizational goals and specific targets. Remind them that they have a huge target on their back because they have access to valuable and sensitive information. This is also where compliance can help. ## GETTING THE EMPLOYEE TO BUY-IN Employees will probably complete training if they are forced to, however it is much better to get their buy-in. Establish a supportive presence by creating a circle of influencers that will act as ambassadors of the training program. ## DONT JUDGE PEOPLE WHEN THEY MAKE MISTAKES Create an open culture where everyone can ask questions without fear. Whenever mistakes happen, use them as teachable moments and not to cast judgement. ## ENGAGE AND FOLLOW UP Training is not set and forget. Ask employees for feedback and be open to constructive criticism. Search for solutions and always follow-up. For example, maybe training needs to be tailored per department, based on current knowledge level, or shorter and to the point. ## KEEP IT SIMPLE AND REAL Dont assume employees have a technical background, so use simple terms and real life examples they can relate with. And dont make it childish, adults dont appreciate content appearing like it was taken from a kids TV show like Dora the Explorer. ## FACE-TO-FACE IS STILL A THING Yeah, training people in a classroom is still a thing and very effective. This is usually more expensive, however if you have the budget then dont rely only on automation, do offline training once a year in addition to your online training. ## MAKE IT EASY TO CONSUME Employees think like consumers, you dont want them to disengage, so make training frictionless. For example, it should be accessible through their phones with a single click. And leverage existing channels such as slack for notifications. ## TAP INTO EXISTING RESOURCES Collaborate with the communication or marketing team to create unique content and embed it into existing communication channels. For example, create posters and hang them in the coffee area, write a blog post, or publish a newsletter. If possible, record an intro video that includes people from within the organization. ## AVOID SURPRISES Many people dont like being surprised at work. So, if you are planning on running a phishing simulation for example, let them know in advance and explain the goal. ## GET YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS FAST People are busy, so be short and to the point. Find a balance between continuous awareness training without overwhelming or boring your team. "

My new year's resolution was to find a way to help the most people understand the utter insanity that is the cyber insurance and cyber law world. My background: Former IT, Bachelor's in Robotics, Master's in Cybersecurity Law. Currently I work in the insurance world. (long story but I love my job) I wrote a book on cyber insurance and cybersecurity law for CPA firms. Due to the scope of the book - 454 pages - it can apply to many other businesses - even an MSP. I'm writing another book that is almost done that will be for businesses in general. It contains plenty of real horror stories and actual cases. I've done my best to boil down all of these insane laws into the most digestible size for you and your clients. If this does well here, and I haven't angered the mods, I'll offer that book as well.

193,cybersecurity,msp,Response from ConnectWise CEO,1,etj2mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/etj2mw/response_from_connectwise_ceo/,2020-01-25 11:08:30," From recent email: Dear Partners, Earlier this week, a story was published about potential security vulnerabilities with ConnectWise Control. In the spirit of transparency, I wanted to provide an update on this story and outline what has been done and what our ongoing efforts are to ensure the security of our products, your business and your customers. In late September, ConnectWise received notification from an organization that operates as a consultant in the security space, stating they had identified eight potential vulnerabilities in ConnectWise Control. While our product and security teams felt that many of these potential vulnerabilities presented a low risk of actual attack to our partners, we take security extremely seriously and investigated, resolving six of the areas of concern by October 2, 2019. While the threat landscape is ever changing, we seek to constantly and proactively manage security efforts not only through the updating of our products, but through the education of our team and collaboration with third-party security experts. As security is of critical importance to us, here are some of things we have been doing and where we are today: ConnectWise recently passed an independent SOC 2 Type 2 audit for the benefit of all current and prospective Partners. We regularly conduct penetration tests performed by both internal and external resource and have implemented ethical hacker training, OWASP processes, and consistently run vulnerability assessments on our systems and products. We have implemented tools that automatically evaluate behavior to reduce misuse of our products, started implementing machine learning to detect anomalies in logins, and we are about to launch a bug bounty program, as well as started the rollout of MFA and SSO across the platform. In Q4 of 2019, we also invested in a comprehensive developer security training curriculum to increase the security skills of our teams and assure that our developers are training on the most recent and relevant application security coding practices. On January 21, 2020 we launched the ConnectWise Security Trust site, which will be a primary source of information on security incidents, relevant alerts and of course critical patches and product updates. We hired GuidePoint, an independent third-party cybersecurity solutions company, to further validate our patches and confirm that the vulnerabilities were mitigated. We have published a matrix outlining each potential vulnerability with the perspectives from Bishop Fox, Huntress Labs and GuidePoint, along with our stance on the issue and any action being taken. One of the remaining two suggested areas of remediation is Cross-site Scripting (XSS) which is the potential for abuse of the Control Administrator roles ability to customize the application. This customization ability is a key feature of Control that many partners value. This issue is considered a low actual risk, but we will be removing the option from our trial offering. The final identified issue is related to Security Headers. The strongest defense involves layers of security. Security Headers represent one option for implementing certain layers. In the absence of Security Headers, ConnectWise does implement security layers addressing the types of threats reported in the consultants assessment. As we continue to investigate potential vulnerabilities and implement mitigation plans, we will be posting updates to our Security Trust site. I encourage you to check this site for the latest information, as well as furture updates from our work with GuidePoint. In our conversations with Huntress Labs to compare our findings and their results, Kyle Hanslovan, CEO of Huntress Labs has this to share: Bugs happen. And its not about when bugs happen, but its about what you do when they happen. We were happy to work with CRN earlier this week to confirm that ConnectWise had already patched 6 of the 8 items found. I think three things matter in this scenario: Were the bugs acknowledged, were the bugs fixed and was the company passionate about fixing them for the right reasons? I think ConnectWise came through on all three things, and after our positive conversation on January 23, were excited about continuing to work with ConnectWise and other vendors for the benefit of the channel as a whole. I want to assure you, our partners, that we understand the trust you place in our products and people and we take that trust seriously. We have and will continue to invest heavily in security, and you have our unrelenting commitment to security and transparency, and we appreciate your questions and feedback to our continuous improvement. Thank you, Jason Magee"

Based on this, I have three questions for my fellow Managed Services Providers: 1. Are my expectations here too unreasonable? 2. Is it just me, or are they avoiding my questions entirely? 3. For those who are ConnectWise Partners, does it not frustrate you to no end when ConnectWise support immediately changes all tickets to 'Completed' after their initial response? &amp;#x200B; **- - - - Original Email to ConnectWise (01/22/2020) - - - -** ConnectWise Team, As users of ConnectWise Control, our management team would like to know what ConnectWise's current plans are for addressing security within its products and in particular on patching the vulnerabilities discussed in the following article: [CRN Article](URL Our clients have more and more frequently begun to question the security of the tools we use, and while it's completely understandable that our clients complete a vendor due diligence process, it's also equally important that we do the same.

Thank you for your Partnership, ConnectWise &amp;#x200B; **- - - - Follow-Up ConnectWise Response (01/23/2020) - - - -** Hello PaidGoogler, ConnectWise takes the security of our products and our partners very seriously. ConnectWise previously remediated most of the items suggested by Bishop Fox. Within the next two weeks we will resolve one item that is much lower in risk.

Best, ConnectWise Control Team &amp;#x200B; **- - - - Ticket Immediately Marked as Completed - - - -** **- - - - Second Email to ConnectWise (01/23/2020) - - - -** ConnectWise Control Team, Why did we, as a partner, first learn about these vulnerabilities and subsequent partial patches through a news article and not through a notification from you? Had we known a patch for six of eight items had been released on October 2nd, we would have **immediately** patched our systems. Instead, we first learned of these vulnerabilities and subsequent partial patches almost four months later. While we do patch our systems regularly, thats four months of *potential* exposure of our systems and our clients systems because ConnectWise failed to properly notified its partners. That is unacceptable. To follow-up on my question above, will we be notified when each of the two final vulnerabilities are patched? and have there been other recent patches for Control (or any of the ConnectWise products) which we havent been notified of that should justify immediate patching? Sincerely, PaidGoogler &amp;#x200B; **- - - - Second ConnectWise Response (01/25/2020) - - - -** Thank you for contacting ConnectWise Control.

This customization ability is a key feature of Control that many partners value. This issue is considered a low actual risk, but we will be removing the option from our trial offering for increased security. There is no patch necessary here. The second identified issue is related to Security Headers. As mentioned by Bishop Fox and Huntress Labs, the lack of these security headers is low risk, as the configuration of them is considered a best practice, but optional. We are actively investigating where it would be beneficial to apply certain security headers without negatively affecting current product features and integrations.

I am working to try to come up with the best mitigation steps to prevent these problems and I was hoping that you fine people could poke some holes in my proposals. As a precaution I am generalizing my steps as to not really provide too much information about my setup: 1. Regular and recurring Cybersecurity awareness training for ALL employees (Phishing, Physical, Desktop, Mobile, Wifi, Social, etc.) 2. Darkweb monitoring for credentials that may have been leaked 3. Utilize and enforce MFA (obviously) on all RMM tools 4. Enable GEOIP blocking in my firewalls in front of my RMM tool and lock down to only areas that are serviced by my company 5. Enable SSO with the RMM and ensure my Password policy is extremely strong (16 character password length, changes every 60 days, complexity rules etc. etc.) 6. Create segregated client sets in the RMM tools to mitigate a full client breach. Example is create client territories and techs are assigned to the territories, no 1 person as all access to all clients. 7. Create time barriers for some or all of my techs. For example if my tech works from 7AM to 4PM, they have a 6AM to 5PM window where they can access RMM. &amp;#x200B; So my question to you all is what am I missing?"

Here is the summary of their response. This cybersecurity guide is for early-stage startups. In many cases, these types of startups use freelancers and remote developers they have never physically met. Remote workers probably use their own laptops, and you are likely unaware of their working location. For all you know, they may be working from a coffee shop while connected to public Wifi without a VPN, firewall, or anti-virus. Additionally, their machine may not even be patched. Yes, resources are limited; however, moving fast without even basic security is asking for trouble. This guide is part of the activity I do for Wizer Free Security Awareness Training ([wizer-training.com](URL - I am sure for many of you these tips are nothing new. The intention was to compile something, you can share with your customers. Lastly, I hope no one here will get offended or consider this spam by dropping our name here... and if you wish to partner with us, send me a message. I will also have a PDF version soon. **Let's start!** So what can an early-stage startup with limited resources do to secure their environment? ### SOMEONE needs to take responsibility This may sound obvious, but before you do anything someone needs to take responsibility; otherwise, it just wont work. The R&amp;D manager, product manager, developer, or founder could assume ownership. That person doesnt necessarily have to be a security expert, its more about taking responsibility and managing the project. ### Dont do it yourself If you are not a security expert, then find someone who can help. The risk of doing it on your own is far too great, partner with an individual consultant or company. ### Start with assessing the risk Identify the top security and compliance risks - what are you trying to protect, why do you want to protect it, and what are the potential risks. For example, is it IP theft by competitors or ransomware that may lock you out from your data? Also, are their regulations and contracts you need to comply with? A generic list of controls that fail to take compliance obligations into account opens an organization up to liability. A best practice is to create a data flow diagram that maps where the data is and how it moves through the business. This will make it easier to identify where your data may be at higher risk. ## Now, lets talk about technology ### You need to provide an isolated environment to work from. Since you probably are unable to control remote worker laptops, provide them with a **hardened virtual machine** (VM). They will use this VM only for your project. There are free solutions such as VirtualBox that can be used to run the VM. You can also use Linux Mint as the guest VM, it's easy to use for both Windows and Linux users. **Enabling vt-x** on the computer BIOS this will make the virtual machine so fast that it is practically indistinguishable from the host system. Lastly, make sure to install the VM on an **encrypted partition,** this will help in the event a laptop is stolen or lost. ### When you build the VM image make sure to include: **VPN** \- Implement a VPN for all your team members. Its not just for remote workers, founders also need it as they tend to travel often and connect to their resources using airplane, airport, and coffee shop WIFI networks. When traveling or working remotely, connect only using a VPN. **Patch management** \- Apply the latest security patches and software updates across all your endpoints. **Endpoint protection -** Use anti-virus or EDR solutions. **Firewall -** Make sure the firewall is properly configured and always on. ## What else? **Backups** \- Backups are extremely important and are a must-have. This is especially important in the event a hacker uses malware to lock you out of your computer(s). Make sure the backups are located off-site and not connected to your network. Lastly, dont forget to test that you can restore a backup in case you need to. **Implement 2FA** \- Many of the cloud apps you are probably using have basic security features, so take advantage of those. Dont just use the default settings, this is especially true for your cloud resources (e.g., AWS, GCP, and Azure), email (e.g., GSuite, and O365), and source control (e.g., GitHub, and GitLab). **Code Peer Review** \- Don't allow anyone to add new code to the project without a peer review. It's basically when developers check each others work. And make sure they are not syncing any config files to GIT that contain keys/tokens **Use role-based access instead of all or nothing** \- For example, most developers dont need access to the production environment - make it read-only if it is required. **Use secure communication -** Instead of slack consider more secure communication solutions such as MatterMost or even Telegram. **Complex Passwords** \- Implement a method or use a password manager to generate truly unique, random, and long passwords for all your services (e.g., Dashlane, and LastPass), including managing your API keys. **Legal Stuff -** Make sure to sign a nondisclosure agreement with everyone, do background checks and make sure you have full contact details. not just skype or social media profiles **Policies and Procedures** \- Create a handbook for how to work securely. Keep it short and to the point so they will actually read it. **Security awareness training -** Educate your team about cyber threats! If the team is not trained, then the risk they will become infected increases dramatically. Develop a mindset where theyre looking out for suspicious emails and practicing how to avoid becoming a target. There are many security awareness solutions, including free ones such as [URL that include comprehensive training videos, quizzes, and analytics to track user progress. **Monitoring** \- Use something like Azure Security Center to centralize your security operations ## And what if things dont go as planned? An incident response plan is basically a plan for what to do if your business gets hacked. How you respond to each incident depends on what has happened. For example, if all of your computers were locked by a hacker demanding payment to unlock them, you may take different actions if you have a backup and can restore everything versus no backup. An incident response plan will guide you to who you should notify and what actions you should take to put an end to a breach. To speed recovery, you may find it valuable to have pre-staged simple flowcharts and contact lists of people and organizations requiring communication in the event of a breach. These suggestions are important to ask whoever is responsible for securing your network, and make sure the plan is easy to read and is rehearsed...you never know when you will need to use it. ## Additional useful resources The first is the U.S. NIST Small Business Act, it was passed into law in August of 2018, it provides cybersecurity resources to SMBs to help protect them against cyber attacks. The second is the UK Cyber Essentials, which is a government information assurance scheme that encourages organizations to adopt good practice in information security. Both resources are government-backed frameworks designed to help small businesses in protecting against cyber threats. &amp;#x200B; Please comment bellow if you have any suggestion on how to improve it."

We see it being a security vendor. Customers don't want to pay anything more than they absolutely have to. But when they don't have the right AV, Email security or bad internal procedures, do you fire them as a client? I've seen many MSPs here do that and I applaud them for it. But then the next MSP Startup who is desperate for clients takes them on as a client to keep the lights on. They cave to their demands because the deal is too big to lose. Do you risk your reputation for growth and sustainability, then fire the client when you can afford to not have them anymore? I bring this up because many people companies that we prospect or reach out to us have been riding Office 365 base filtering on Business Premium and I sit here scratching my head. Or I hear they have no centralized AV or standard AV offering in their stack. Or they don't enforce policies and procedures. We hear a fair bit from our MSPs because we enjoy listening and it scares me sometimes how much some MSPs allow/put up with but others are very strict. Is money the real motivator or is it something else? Are there ever good reasons to allow a customer to undermine security?"
209,cybersecurity,msp,The MSP Dilemna? Security Adoption,7,dj8f5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/dj8f5f/the_msp_dilemna_security_adoption/,2019-10-18 03:01:05,"I was reading this article: [URL and I had some thoughts about this issue. There are probably 3 major elements of security. AV/infrastructure, Email security, and policies/procedures. I would lump awareness training and phishing simulations into the latter. I read stories here almost daily about customers. I hear it from our partners as well. Customers always push money ahead of security. That has been changing but not nearly as quickly as it needs to. But what I see is usually 1 of the following situations if the customer won't cave: * MSP Fires the client * MSP makes clients acknowledge/sign something to absolve the MSP of liability Any way you look at it, neither of these is ideal. Either the customer will find another MSP that won't enforce the standards or they will get breached relatively easy in the near future and you'll still look like the bad guy. Especially if it's a big breach. So the question is, how do we fix these problems? Well, there is no direct fix IMO because it requires literally everyone to get on the same page. If you're an MSP and not rolling some sort of email security on top of the business premium, or opting for E3+ATP then that's a problem. If you don't have a centralized AV or at least a solid AV in your stack with sandboxing, that's a problem. If you don't enforce strict policies such as admin rights, powershell access, phishing testing, awareness training, etc, that is a problem. I feel bad for mentioning this but it feels like you have to strongarm many of these customers into this and to be honest, it's barely profitable upfront if at all in many cases. On the backend, it definitely can reduce costs absolutely no doubt about it. But these items are honestly the best interest of any customer, even with 1 endpoint in many cases. But without mass adoption, I think it will still be the impossible uphill fight. It's like SPF adoption. Many people don't understand that SPF works backward. Your published record helps other mail servers determine spoofing. Sure SPF checking at your mail server/relay is essential to you, but if the sender doesn't have a published or properly written record, it's useless. Which is why most of our customers don't opt for checking all domains, just against their own. Way too many FP's because of the substandard adoption rate. Anyway, these are just my thoughts for the day, would encourage conversation below and get even more insight about security and policies from our fellow MSPs."

211,cybersecurity,msp,Adoption Rate is killing Cybersecurity Improvements,8,dpnfks,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/dpnfks/adoption_rate_is_killing_cybersecurity/,2019-11-01 00:19:47," Working in the cybersecurity space, we are often concerned about the slow adoption rate of good security practices. Whether its not configuring your SPF Record or not encrypting your data in transit, we know that the adoption rate is one of the biggest hurdles we face today. The problem we see in cybersecurity is, many of these best practices do not help you directly but the other person or communication partner. For example, the SPF record. What this does is, publish to the world, the list of domains that can send on behalf of your domain. If you use a CRM like Salesforce or an accounting system like QuickBooks, then you need to tell the world that these services can send on your behalf. However, these do not actually help your security directly, only when checking SPF at your relay/mail server. More times than not, it is not a good idea to check the SPF record of every incoming email, because if the person's SPF record is either: not set or not set correctly, it will be quarantined/rejected depending on what the DNS server tells the relay/mail server what to do. In this case, more than 50% of the clean email you receive would not be delivered and thus would be a nightmare. So what most people do is, only check the SPF record for emails that claim to come from their own domain, which stops spoofing your domain, but not spoofing of other domains. Therefore, the adoption rate is hurting cybersecurity, because you need the other person to adopt these security practices to increase your defenses. Another issue we often see is encrypting your data during transport. The current version of TLS (1.3) has many improvements over 1.2, but the inherent issue with TLS is, the way SMTP works does not allow TLS to be enforced in its entirety. For example, say you have office 365, you use a 3rd party filter/encryption service and your emailing someone who has a 3rd party filter in front of an old mail server that does not support TLS. The email from Office&gt;relay will be encrypted via TLS, the email from the relay to the recipients relay will also be encrypted via TLS (you can force this). But what you cannot force is to encrypt via TLS from the relay to the older mail server. Again, adoption is one of the biggest hurdles we face in cybersecurity. The best form of transport encryption is content-encryption such as SMIME. The problem with this form of encryption is, historically the keys system used in this form of encryption was very cumbersome and flat out annoying to manage. However, with newer encryption services, the implementation and deployment have become 10 times easier. Previously, you had to manually import a key on each device and load it into Outlook, then the user had to manually encrypt when sending as well as importing any new keys sent to them by the recipient. Nowadays, at least with Hornetsecurity (cannot speak for others), you can encrypt and decrypt automatically at the relays with a secure TLS connection (there is no middle hop) from your mail server to the relay. The key management, extraction of keys and encryption/decryption are automated at the relay level and require zero end-user input. So much so, users do not even know its happening, which is fantastic! However, the adoption rate is killing this movement yet again. See how content-encryption works are, a set of keys is generated for the user, a public key and private key. What happens is, your public key is the scrambler, it will allow people to use it to scramble an email into a giant wall of text. However, the only way to reverse it is with the private key that only you have. Where this leads to is, for you to SEND a content encrypted email with SMIME, you need the recipient's public key, so they must also engage in SMIME encryption for you to send encrypted emails this way. Ordering keys only allow others to send you encrypted emails. The adoption rate is the culprit once again! So how do we solve this? Well in some cases, these practices may cost very little or even free. Just because you need others to comply does not give you a reason to not do so. The idea that ""well this doesnt help me directly, I just need others to do it"" is how we got into this mess in the first place. Upgrade your security policies but remember, the best security will always be changing. Cybersecurity is not a set and forget kind of thing. It requires ongoing analysis and changes to best practices. That is why it is so important to align yourself with the right people. Whether that is an internal cybersecurity expert, the right MSP/Partner or cybersecurity vendor, there are cost-effective ways of doing this. Taking cybersecurity seriously does take a conscious effort and time, but it doesn't always cost a ton of money, and while time is money, the amount of time &amp; money you stand to lose avoiding this is a multitude more (10x or more) than just doing it in the first place."

It's been a great experience dealing with this company and their solution is on-point for the needs of small businesses and our company. I would highly recommend it! We've already deployed it to most of our customers, and they are THRILLED with the solution. Not only is it making our jobs easier providing service to our customers but it's also ensuring that our customers are far better protected! Equally, they don't say it below, but it's not only software that the company deploys in the solution, they also provide hardware (Firewalls, switches, APs, etc.) to ensure that it's all compatible and up to date all the time. We made the switch from our old RMM solution and it's been eye opening not only how much we save but equally the completely different level of capabilities we have now. Treetop also provides residual payments, on a monthly basis, because rather than large scale solutions, Treetop partners with your MSP (like they did us) to assist you in providing service to your customers. Here's the verbiage that the company, Treetop Security, provided to me when we were thinking about getting on the solution. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Treetop Security Verbiage:Small businesses care about cybersecurity, but don't want to go broke doing it. We've developed a solution to assist in protecting business and customer data. Cybersecurity is an ongoing process, not a ""set and forget"" product as many want you to believe. We also provide value by educating the customer to help them understand their cybersecurity needs to protect their business. Our slogan is ""4x the capabilities at a 14 price"" and we can say that slogan didn't come about until after the design was complete and we started seeing it in action versus what's currently on the market. We use common sense defenses for real world attacks. Our lead designer has over 20 years of working with small business on their IT and cybersecurity. He also ran his own MSP for over 13 years. He has many accomplishments including his GSE, which is often considered the highest certification in the information security industry. The platform itself took 2 years of full design and development followed by 6 months of ""beta testing"" with customers to ensure that the solution was ready for others in their environments.During the beta testing phase and since, customers were more than impressed with their experience on the Peak solution. We have seen the solution stop multiple attacks via the security monitoring, including but not limited to ransomware, crypto mining, phishing, etc. Because of the holistic approach to the platform, customers also receive ad-hoc security awareness training regarding any security event within 20 minutes of its occurrence. Customers with an MSP also report back that they received higher levels of engagement and more responsiveness as a result of deploying the solution because once again, we partner with you and you have access to many of the same tools we do. We're looking to grow this solution as much as possible and getting it out to the masses. Not only does it allow for small businesses to tighten up their security without breaking the bank, but it also allows for smaller MSPs to provide solid solutions and gives them the necessary tools to assist THEIR customers at a higher level and faster than before. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If anyone has any questions or even thoughts on the solution let me know! Either via the comments or just shoot me a direct message and I can get you in contact with the company, I should be able to answer some questions also based on our experiences! Equally, the lead developer let me know that he will soon have the ""No B.S."" pricing tool available on the website for you to see exactly how much it would cost. They have a sample pricing tool for different environments that is already available on the site. So, I can update this post when that comes available. [URL Thanks!"

Not lost on the technical side, but more so lost on the price and process side. Couple questions * I am torn between NinjaRMM, Solarwinds, and Atera for the main MSP services. * Question: What are your suggestions and experiences? I've read a lot of bad news from SolarWinds and I've also read good news * I have cybersecurity monitoring to meet and risk assessments to perform. I can use monitoring from the webroot offers. This will allow me to meet the required monitoring and alerting controls. As for the risk assessments, I don't believe ninjaRMM, atera or SolarWinds offer this with their MSP solutions. However, I see ONLY solarwinds offer risk assessment tools. * Question: what do you guys use? * Active Directory - These customers need to meet centralized logging. This can be done with O365 services which after getting off the phone with them, it is about 12.50/user a month and will allow me to have different ""Tenants"" (AKA customer segregation). According to them this will also offer AD services like logon to the PC and such. * Question: Is this true/ what are your experiences? * How do you do backups? Do you overwrite the existing backup? Do you just continue to increase storage size and perform incremental backups? 500GB \*.20 is expensive per month. and I don't see myself making any money storing 10 devices. * Question: How do you even make money off backups? Do you perform full backups? Do you only backup images or certain files and folders? Do you limit storage then charge X amount for more? * Pricing: NinjaRMM just quoted me at 175-225/mo for 50 users. They didn't mention backup storage pricing but indicated the price will not change until I go OVER 50 users/devices. Atera is $79 a month per tech and then 0.20 cents /GB per storage backups. that can come out to a lot of money per hard drive where I just don't see myself making money and basically working for free. I also don't see the customer wanting to pay .20cents or .50 cents per GB of backup space. * Question: I don't see how you guys make money from the backups alone unless you bill for storage as well. However, to make math easy, 100 dollars a user - 500 GB HD storage is 100 a month charge for atera, which means you're doing that work for free/ losing money?"

224,cybersecurity,msp,Selling Cybersecurity to SMBs,15,chn26o,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/chn26o/selling_cybersecurity_to_smbs/,2019-07-25 22:32:38,"Selling Cybersecurity products are easy for some and hard for others. Here are few trends we've seen and some tips to help you sell better. I'd love to get some thoughts and feedback from the reddit world! &amp;#x200B; * Your existing customers just dont want to spend anymore money * The services were positioned wrong, and didnt make sense for the customer * Most prospects see it as a cost center rather than an investment * They just arent convinced they need it When you can properly position cyber security products, it can not only increase your monthly recurring revenue (MRR), but it can be the driving force to get you new clients. Here are a few tips for positioning and selling cybersecurity to SMBs ## Educate The small business world is massively under-educated in the world of cyber threats. Because of this, they often have large vulnerabilities within their organization. This is where you come and educate them about whats out there and how they can stay secure. Youre not pushing product, but purely educating. Not only will it delight your customers, but it will give you massive ROI downstream. Educate your audience, and they will naturally gravitate toward you. One quick thing, though. Dont techsplain. Your job isnt to explain how amazing your technology is or walk through the detailed features of your services. Your job is to story-tell. When talking about cyber security with a project youll likely hear things like: Im not a target I already have a firewall and anti virus My employees arent going to click on a phishing email You can overcome these objections by storytelling. Show the business impact of cybersecurity, or lack thereof. Tell the story of the situation, impact and resolution of cyber threats. When you position people over systems and help create best practices, youve built trust and the products are a much simpler sell. Another way to educate and build credibility is by providing case studies from other clients. First, approach an existing client that got real results from your services or a brand new client whos excited to get started. Then, ask their permission to share that information and even cooperate in building the case study. You could even offer them a discount for doing so. Real proof of your service is better than anything you could ever say. ## Provide Value Similar to #1, your job as an MSP or VAR is to provide tons of value to current and future customers. This is can be in many forms: blogs, ebooks, presentations, social media, videos, and more. Youre responsible for helping them discover overlooked areas or misunderstood threats within their company. This aspect has massive implications on the future of your business. To scale back and think about this, lets take 2 cleaning companies, for instance. Company A has little online presence and a simple website featuring a form to order a cleaning, and not much else. They were told to create a blog. They said And what, teach people how to clean their house?! We want them to pay us for that! Company B has a blog and distributes the articles on social media. Articles such as How to remove stains with items you probably already have and Best cleaning products when you have a newborn. They get exponentially more traffic, and in turn more business. These are real companies. Company B cleaned my house recently more than a year after I read an article by them. Providing value builds trust and wins customers. Simple as that. Now, take that example, and see if you can apply it anywhere within your organization. ## Put yourself in their situation When selling cybersecurity products, think about your customer. Whats important to them? What is the information they need to make a smart decision for their company? Often times, the person youre talking to doesnt care about flashy tools, they care about results. You need to make a business case for their success. Also, avoid fear as your driving factor. Position the relationship as a consultancy, rather than shoving fear, uncertainty and doubt down their necks. This is most important when explaining cost. If you can help SMBs operate more effectively and efficiently with cybersecurity, you can make a real business case thats worth the dollars. ## Know how to Bundle As a manager of several different services, you have a lot of different things to offer. It can be tempting to bundle every security product together and call it a day. But businesses are all different. Rather than creating a one-size-fits-all security product, know how to evaluate their needs and bundle together a suite of services that works for them. Making the right vendor partnerships is paramount in this as well. Good vendors will work with you to best position their services for each situation. ## Measure and Deliver results. So youve made a sale, youre bringing in MRR, and youre feeling good. But you forgot about the first R in that acronym: Recurring. If your clients arent seeing or understanding the results, they may question their purchase. After all, nothing happening is the best case scenario for most security situations. How can you take credit for nothing? Proper reporting and communication is so important to keep a cybersecurity relationship healthy. Show the value in what youve done, and deliver results that make sense for the dollars they spent. Use the storytelling skills youve already acquired for this. ### I dont even have any leads. How do I start selling? If you havent started having the cybersecurity conversation yet, you can start with a few things. For existing customers, approach them with case studies and a business case that makes sense for them. If youve been solving their problems for a while, they should trust you, and helping create fewer problems is a natural progression for the relationship. If youre starting fresh and looking for new customers, start with a combination of points 1 &amp; 2. Create valuable, educational content in the form of ebooks and reports, and use these as lead generation tools. Selling cybersecurity to SMBs comes down to positioning your service in a way that makes sense for your customer. It has to make sense financially, and frankly they need to know what youre talking about. Meet them where they are and build trust, and youll start seeing cybersecurity as the highest source of MRR in your company."

I'd love to know when THAT is scheduled for roll out! Text of the email from Webroot... Webroot Customer, We know that SMBs and MSPs are becoming a larger target for threat actors. Last week, a small number of MSPs were impacted by a threat actor who could have been thwarted with more consistent cyber hygiene. Since then, weve talked to customers and worked across our product and engineering teams to assess our current product functionalities. I want to underline that Webroot was not breached, and our products were not compromised. As a response to the threat activity, we made it mandatory for all customers to use our secondary security code. After thoughtful consideration to both the product and customer impact, Webroot also decided to disable agent commands used to remotely execute files. Disabling these agent commands prevents potential misuse in customer environments. This is part of our ongoing strategic approach to provide additional cybersecurity measures to protect against the evolving threat landscape. We will continue to evolve our product and appreciate the input from our customers. If you need additional assistance, please open a ticket with our customer support team or connect on our Community. Sincerely, Chad Bacher SVP, Products WEBROOT, a Carbonite Company "

I sent him my current business license with legal address in California. 2. He asks me to Name three clients of mine that I am currently serving so he can reach out to in order to verify my identity.

According to the report, 68% of respondents said that it took one month or even multiple months for their organization to realize they had been a victim of an attack. While it isn't completely shocking, it is sad to see just how many companies don't take cybersecurity seriously, especially in this day and age. Do you do anything to convey the importance of cybersecurity to your clients? Do they take you seriously, or do they just blow it off like the report shows?"

257,cybersecurity,msp,Digital transformation of business: What's the MSP's role?,5,7fv6dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/7fv6dl/digital_transformation_of_business_whats_the_msps/,2017-11-28 00:32:20,"In the early 1990s, a popular marketing campaign presented a cool notion of what technology can do for us. However, what we have learned since then is that technology usually just sits there. Companies need a little push to apply it and change the way they do business. They need consistent help and expert guidance on how they can better use technology. Businesses face the staggering task of just getting their work done, and they have very little luxury time to improve their operation practices. Process innovation needs to be woven into the fabric of daily commercial pursuits, and MSPs are helping to initiate and empower these changes. Cybersecurity strategies: Best-of-breed or integrated security suites? Digital transformation is the ultimate destination for all that MSPs do. As we have been participating in the evolving paradigm that we term managed services, it's leading to the application of cutting-edge technology to all areas of life. The point of thinking differently about how MSPs provide IT and related services to a company is to take care of all their technology problems before they occur. But that is only the starting point. Digital transformation is the ultimate destination for all that MSPs do. We need to understand that, just as break-fix to MSP was a transition, we need to be prepared to facilitate digital transformation of business. MSPs provide the proactive momentum to help customers better leverage technology and improve their bottom line. For example, if we saw a client using an old laptop, we would recommend an upgrade. Digital transformation is taking the next step: injecting expert technology innovation into each area of a business to transform it into something better, whereby it can achieve its goals. While MSPs are in the midst of making what we do more obvious to our clients, we often do this in the background. We observe, identify an opportunity and guide clients to a solution, not only by employing computers or software, but by identifying a change in process. This takes time and understanding, and currently results in project work. But we are transitioning digital transformation to be a core part of our MSP offering, where the client is explicitly aware of our valuable role and our all-in-one price offering. Promoting digital transformation ultimately provides a real, tangible benefit that enables businesses to be more successful, make more money and free people to more effectively focus on their areas of expertise."

Here are the top 5: 1. Ransomware attacks will get worse 2. Phishing attacks will become a bigger threat than in 2017 3. Leaked exploits will make the spread of malware attacks even harder to defend 4. Malware be more targeted 5. Stupidity will persist Thoughts? Anything you're doing to specifically to prepare for these predictions?

One thing that stood out in particular to me is that while survey respondents thought that security is a priority (40% of respondents answered that maintain privacy and securing data is the top IT challenge this upcoming year) when asked to rank their top IT concerns cybersecurity doesnt even break into the top three. This means that despite the largely publicized breaches so far in 2017, cybersecurity still is not a top priority for most enterprises. Does this surprise you? Because I found this to be pretty shocking. Was there anything else you found in the responses to be revealing? "

I own a small MSP that is going through a merger with another MSP over the next six months, we will do close to 500k next year in MRR to give you an idea of size. Now to my question, I hope someone has some thoughts to contribute. I got a referral from an existing client. The potential client is one of the wealthiest families in America, and they need a lot of help with cybersecurity at their home and tiny office as well as help with implementing a basic CRM and task management system. They also want monthly management. For their size, I would normally only charge $1K per month as they only have 7 workstations, however I know that they will be needier than most small businesses due to the fact that we won't have complete control over their environment and just based on our initial consultation. Their needs vary quite a lot. My question is this - I am going to give them a flat monthly fee of around $2000-2500 for standard managed services and maybe only allow up to a certain amount of time on site and only certain types of issues to be covered. My concern is that they spend most of their time working from home or traveling the world and i don't want to get roped into tons of non-maintenance related things and constantly nickel and dime them. So I want it to be a win win on both sides. Any thoughts about how to structure this better? Thanks in advance! "
