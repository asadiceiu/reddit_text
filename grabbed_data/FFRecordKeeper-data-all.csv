We have an actual Final Fantasy game collab from another publisher! In this case... Final Fantasy Record Keeper and Brave Exvius collaboration event! From Grandshelt to the Royal Academy (or whatever Dr. Mog calls it now), heroes across both games will work together and fight against a common enemy in the ""Brave Exvius"" records, leading to new fight content that we Keepers have not fought yet. For this Weekly Event's Multiplayer battle, Veritas of the Frost is chilling around on the D80/120 Multiplayer battle arena, while the Veritas of the Earth is lounging around on the D160/220 Multiplayer battle arena. Also yes, another month, another Infernal Multiplayer battle... but this one is going to be unique in many ways. Okay - I'll start with the bad news. The bad news is that this is the LAST monthly Infernal+ battles we are going to face. Soon Infernal (D300) and Infernal++ (D400) are going to be the norm for the part 2 of the Weekly Multiplayer Battle once the next FFVII Weekly Event comes rolling in... For the good news, Infernal Multiplayer battles are going to replaced by an equivalent monthly Multiplayer battle but at a higher difficulty (or its analog - in a sense) and that this is the probably the first time we will see a Beyond-realm Infernal Multiplayer battle featuring a collab (Global missed out the Infernal Metalslime battle from the Dragon Quest collab - unless of course if we'll get it in the future...). Either way you take this news, I hope you get to enjoy this Infernal battle, its seems to be a rather challenging one. Good luck and enjoy our FFRK x FFBE Collaboration event! :D &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Veritas of the Frost (Beyond)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Veritas of the Frost with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed * **Status Effects:** Stop * **Elements used:** Ice * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Slow, Reflect, Blind, Interrupt * **Special Notes** * Wear Ice resist gear to help mitigate Veritas of the Frost's ice-cold attacks. * A form of Astra and/or Stop resist gear are highly advised to prevent Stop. * The Veritas of the Frost can buff himself with ATK/MAG and DEF/RES buffs.

After a brief stint of cooperation and working together, the villainous Borgen and Gottos has shown up once more, deciding that they make do with their ""divide and conquer"" schemes to defeat us - sadly its their funeral. For the first half, Borgen has taken over the D80/120 Multiplayer arena, but has apparently left all of his equipment in his haste to conquer. He does nothing lethal and is actually cheesable - see the fight notes below - to get an idea how. Meanwhile, Gottos has smarten up and reduced his drinking (well,for most of the time, he IS still drinking) by actually doing something training, enough that he has occupied the D160/220 Multiplayer arena. Unlike last time, Gottos will try to beat your party up with his new moves, then resort back to drinking to gain more confidence and motivation later on thru the fight. So, uh, where's Josef in this fights you ask?

Then there's the Cardia dungeons update, and along with it, comes the Dreambreaker dungeons! @_@ Wooo! Many updates came tonight and are flooding us with end-game content indeed. Of course, with new end-game content, comes new tools for us to fight the bosses with... Limit Breaks! A Realm-version of Magicite deck. ;) Moving on... for this post-maintenance, we are treated to a standard Weekly Event from the Realm of IX, an event story that came a month earlier than original scheduled. But, why does every time a FFIX event happens... it comes before or after a Fest? How suspicious DeNA! ;| For our opening act, a Worm Hydra has appeared in the D80/120 Multiplayer Battle arena, its a worm and a hydra at the same time and its got 5 heads too! King Ghidora would blush with envy. Later on, an ~~eyeball~~ Ahriman (IX) and a ~~doge~~ Cerberus (IX) will both show up at the same time to challenge us on the D160/220 Multiplayer Battle, I guess they are both eager to work together and get featured. They bring some good stuff though! Also, I'm ~~trying a new format for~~ simplifying the ""Elemental Damage Taken"" section by switching out numbers to simple english, mostly to make it understandable at a single glance and to make it easier for the new players reading this. &amp;nbsp; *** [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Worm Hydra (IX)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat the Worm Hydra with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** 100% Magical * **Status Effects:** Poison, Stop * **Elements used:** Lightning, Fie, Wind, Non-elemental * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Slow, Stop, Reflect, Blind, Sleep, Petrify, Sap, Interrupt * **Special Notes** * Nothing to note here except that it can apply Stop and Poison status effects. * A Magic Break/down should keep its DPS output down. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |RESIST|WEAKNESS|NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Thunderball|NAT|Single|Magical|Lightning|heavy damage|-| |All|Flamethrower|NAT|AOE|Magical|Fire|medium damage|-| |All|Aero Breath|NAT|Single|Magical|Wind|heavy damage|-| |All|venomous Breath|NAT|AOE|-|-|-|chance to apply Poison| |All|Cold Breath|NAT|Single|Magical|Non|heavy damage|chance to apply Stop| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Ahriman &amp; Cerberus (IX)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat the Ahriman &amp; Cerberus with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** * Ahriman: 100% Physical * Cerberus: mixed * **Status Effects:** * Ahriman: Instant KO, Doom: 60, Petrify, Interrupt * Cerberus: n/a * **Elements used:** * Ahriman: n/a * Cerberus: Fire * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect (applies to both Ahriman &amp; Cerberus) * **Special Notes** * We fight against Ahriman &amp; Cerberus at the same time.

Meanwhile, Exdeath is extending his roots as he tries to bringing everything into the Brink of the Void. As much as the event is titled and seemingly directed to be about our favorite ""evil Tree""-guy, the main battles aren't focused on him, and it seems to be turning into an event title and content mismatch again perhaps? Anyways! Coming along with the Weekly Event's release, the Antlion (V) has returned and made another den on the D80/120 Multiplayer Battle, clearly it didn't learn a thing since the last time it showed up! And after power-level-ing since their last Multiplayer stint, Magissa &amp; Forza has returned to do battle with us on the D160/220 Multiplayer Battle, and they're way more deadly unlike the last time they showed up as a D80/120 Multiplayer boss a year or so ago. &amp;nbsp; *""To the ~~N-Zone~~ Void with you!""* &amp;nbsp; *""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!""* &amp;nbsp; *** [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Antlion (V)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Antlion with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** 100% Physical * **Status Effects:** Sap * **Elements used:** n/a * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect, Berserk * **Special Notes** * Antlion uses a bunch of PHY-type attacks that can be easily nulled by a dedicated Tauntilator. * Antlion's chance to counter will increase the lower its current HP is. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL|NULL|NEUTRAL|WEAKNESS|NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL|NEUTRAL| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Critical|PHY|Single|Physical|-|medium damage|-| |All|Odd Soundwave|NAT|Single|-|-|-|auto-hit ATK/MAG/DEF/RES -X% for Y secs| |All|Digestive Fluid|PHY|Single|ranged Physical|-|normal damage|auto-hit attack; chance to apply Sap| |All|Counter Attack|PHY|2-hits, random|Physical|-|normal damage|response to all attacks| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Magissa &amp; Forza (V)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Magissa &amp; Forza with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** * Magissa: 100% Magical * Forza: 100% physical * **Status Effects:** * **Elements used:** Fire, Ice, Lightning, Dark, Wind (Magissa only) * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect (both) * **Special Notes** * The fight begins with Magissa only present on the field.

Last month, the birb reared its ugly head by having us fight against the entire Holy elemental Magicite pantheon from 3 to 5 in the Shady Forgery, this time we're facing their Dark elemental Magicite counterparts. If the last set was pretty straightforward, this week will be super different and involves misery-incuding fights, as the Dark elemental magicites bring out all sorts of cheats and underhanded means to kill off our parties in many different ways. This means an almost mandatory ""Astra, Last Stand, and Blinks"" to save your skins - especially for the players who couldn't handle the actual Magicite fights yet - and meaning that those players are going to be hard-pressed here for utility and DPS.

Juggling them both will help avoid the Interrupt and ""status hell"" if timed properly. * If this fight follows the original script, Hades will use DISPEL AT 50% HP mark, make sure to put up your buffs or else you will take heavy damage or worse die from the next attacks. * Dark resist accessories are highly advised here. * For those raiding teams that are reaching planning to fight Hades in his Overtime Phase, this Hades has added a single-target Doom (it can be Runic/Grand Cross though) in his arsenal to keep you from stalling. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |RESIST|RESIST|RESIST|RESIST|RESIST|RESIST|WEAKNESS|ABSORB|RESIST| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Strike|PHY|fixed ?-target|Physical|-|massive damage|Targeted slot varies between Solo and Multiplayer| |All|Flare|BLK|fixed ?-target|Magical|Non|extreme damage|Targeted slot varies between Solo and Multiplayer| |All|Black Cauldron|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|super massive damage|chance to apply each of Poison/Silence/Paralyze/Confuse/Slow/Sleep| |All|Dispel|WHT|AOE|-|-|-|removes all positive buffs| |All|Savage Shadow Flare|NAT|AOE|Magical|Dark|piercing damage|ignores RES| |All|Savage Black Cauldron|NAT|AOE|Magical|Dark|piercing damage|ignores RES; auto-hit Doom: 60| |Default|Savage Strike|PHY|AOE|Physical|Dark|massive damage|high chance to apply Interrupt| |Overtime|Death|BLK|Single|-|-|-|high chance to apply Instant KO| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Deathgaze (VI)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 350 (Infernal) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Deathgaze with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed, 100% piercing damage * **Status Effects:** n/a * **Elements used:** Dark * **Break Resistance:** 70% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect * **Special Notes** * This is the Multiplayer battle counter-part of the ""5 Magicite"" Deathgaze fight but at a much lower difficulty.

In Very Weak phase, instead of reducing Doom timers, Deathgaze will apply Doom: 5 instead to kill the afflicted instead. * Bringing Affliction Break and slotting it one of your character with 6 Support access is highly advised here to prevent Deathgaze from sticking his Doom and timer reductions on your characters. A Legend Dived Ramza, with his IC0+Haste LMR armed with fight-relevant tools, is a good choice here for carrying Affliction Break and Holy Chain (if you have it). * Try to delay your party's Hastega as Deathgaze will apply his Slowga early on.

13,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Speedrunning - A conceptual framework,10,ge7oap,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/ge7oap/speedrunning_a_conceptual_framework/,2020-05-06 08:28:31,"With a few weeks of speedrun data now posted , I thought others might be interested in learning some of the basic principles underlying the runs. Speedrunning for me has been a great way to provide goals for personal improvement, keeping the game interesting and forcing me to evolve my thinking. Candidly, without something like this, I probably would have dropped this game years ago. Much of this guide will be common sense/a rehash for many vets, but will set up some foundational concepts that I may touch on in future posts. Most of this is broadly applicable, i.e. your relics dont have to be whale tier for this to be applicable. While it's most helpful for very fast runs, the concepts are mostly universal. # The Framework The conceptual ""formula"" dictating any fight in FFRK boils down to: (Team health + total healing)/(Boss DPS) - (Boss HP + total boss healing)/(Player DPS), with a positive number being a victory and a negative being a wipe. This is a *gross* oversimplification and could trivially be read as kill them before they kill you, but the important observation is that it allows you to isolate the levers you are pulling to affect the outcome: 1. Increasing your teams overall health, via HP boons/crystal waters, healing, and/or last stand. 2. Reducing the Bosss average DPS via Wall/Proshell, debuffs, or shields/blinks. 3. Increasing your teams average DPS, which can be decomposed into the damage vs. the pacing elements: * Damage by increasing the number of DPS characters in your party (sometimes), running chains or other buffs, upping DPS character stats/magia, increasing BDL via AASBs/SASBs, adding crit boosts for physical guys, magicite/equipment boosts, and so on * Pacing via reducing input delay, cast times (e.g Allegro, quick cast, high quick cast, instacast), adding fastcast, and getting haste up as early and maintaining it Every battle has a finite number of turns, so every strategy is definitionally a series of trade-offs that the player makes to affect the various factors in the formula. Looked at in this way, speedrunning isnt just whaling and unloading a bunch of SBs; its the practice of identifying the absolute minimum number of ingredients needed to satisfy the formula, with a particular emphasis on the third component, and ruthlessly cutting everything else down to the bone. # The Phases of Battle I personally tend to think of each battle as effectively having several key phases: * **The Setup**: Choosing your characters, abilities, SBs, RMs, LMs, magicites, etc. All the stuff that happens before the fight actually begins. * **The Ramp**: The initial moments of the battle itself, where you're casting haste, adding mitigation, and gearing up your DPS for the next phase. * **Max DPS**: This is the stage when all cylinders are firing and you're cranking out as much damage as possible. Generally the simplest part of most fights. Optimizing a run across each of these phases is generally very boss specific. For speedruns, what I am generally most focused on is the boss's overall HP count. Think of it this way: If the bosss HP is a distance that youre trying to travel, your DPS is the speed at which youre traversing it. To add more nuance, you can think of your Max DPS as being your top speed and the speed of your Ramp phase as being akin to your rate of acceleration. In the same way that you wouldn't try to use a rocket ship to get to your neighbors house across the street, you're not always trying to get the highest Max DPS in every fight. You tailor it to the distance you need to travel. Most people understand this intuitively - e.g. you dont line up a chain, a boostga, and lifesiphon up all of your AASB-wielders to tackle a d30 boss, you just whack it once or twice out of the gates and move on. However, people tend to get fuzzier on what this means when they put together strategies for magicites or Torments, as theyre generally considered hard content, particularly for those that are still relatively new to the game. A lot of the setups I see tend to overindex on getting to a higher max DPS output (e.g. a chain + 3 AASBs, or stacking multiple SBs all firing at once!), without considering that having a lower max that starts significantly earlier could potentially be a more efficient means of clearing the battle. # Phase 1: The Setup This should come as no secret to many, but the setup is immensely impactful, and will effectively determine your starting DPS, your Max DPS, and the amount of time it takes to get from one to the other (i.e. the length of time needed for the Ramp phase). The ideal setup will raise your starting DPS as much as possible, set the foundation for a short Ramp, and provide you with enough Max DPS that you can quickly cruise through the fight once you're up and running. Although no guide can tell you exactly how to always have the right setup, below are some conceptual pointers: **1. Choosing your characters** Most people already get this, so I'll touch on just a few points. * The setups at the highest levels of play these days are generally two DPS, one boost (usually a chain), an entruster, and someone that can cast hastega. The hasting party is generally a healer, particularly if they can cast ACM to speed up everyone else. * This composition is largely dependent on how far you've gone through the game. If you have not yet finished the 5\* magicites and obtained Fabula mage, for instance, then having a healer that casts hastega and does jack afterwards would no longer be optimal. You would rather have someone that can cast Fabula Raider and then do damage afterwards. * Why only two DPS? This is largely because the damage that can be done post-CSB/AASB is *significantly* higher than it is during the Ramp phase. Adding another DPS squeezes out room for an entruster, substantially lengthening the Ramp phase. It also means that one of your DPS (usually the primary) loses the benefit of beneficial RMs like TGM. * As may be apparent by now, actual healing tends to be unnecessary in anything at or below the 5-star magicite level. The runs are just too short. The only thing you generally need healers for these days are some form of hastega, as well as ACM in mage parties. This is why you tend to see a lot of Orran in speedruns, because he can provide haste, add ACM or some other bard song to the mix, and then focus on dropping 6-star magicites or Fabula Mages - all while using nothing more than his H/IC3 LM2. **2. Positioning your characters** The positioning of your characters is important for a few reasons. First, proper sequencing can help make it easier to track who will be going next, making the run easier to memorize, have less input delay, and just easier to track in general. Second, it can help modestly with SB generation depending on the run, which can result in a turn of difference on getting SBs up. My general guidelines for positioning: * First, make sure that in the menu, you are having turns go by party order, not ATB. This is fundamental to ensuring consistent runs. * Determine the relative speeds of your characters, i.e. who's turn will come first in sequence. Note that characters with haste or full ATB will generally hit that level first. You will generally want to have the sequencing of your characters start with higher speed characters at the top, then have them go down in descending order. The goal of this exercise is to get your turn order to be very consistent, and to also make it so that when you click one character's actions, the turn will flow to the next character in clean fashion (i.e. eliminate the need to skip, not have characters with higher speeds suddenly mess up the turn order, etc.) A few provisos: * Characters with Full ATB RMs are basically in a different bucket, given that they'll be starting with \~1s of difference relative to the other characters in your party. You can put them at the top or the bottom of the stack, it doesn't matter. I would avoid mixing them into the middle of the stack if you can, although this isn't always possible * If you have multiple characters with similar speeds, you can shuffle them around in whatever order makes sense to you since they'll all get full ATB at the same time regardless. If any of them need to select from multiple SBs, this generally takes more input time, so I'd bias them towards the bottom unless there's a specific reason not to * If you have characters that are using instantaneous commands, put them as high up the stack as possible without messing up the ATB fill order. The rationale here is that you can input commands while their attack is being animated, which will eliminate input lag on subsequent commands * Check if the boss has attacks that target specific slots in the initial few turns of the battle (or frankly at any point in the battle, to the extent it matters for SBs that will come up later in the fight). Parallel shift your turn order stack such that the primary characters that will need extra SB generation are in those slots. If there are multiple characters that need to be in specific places and this conflicts with your character stack, you may have to do a bit of shuffling and live with a slightly imperfect turn sequencing. **3.** **Elevating your starting DPS** This is also fairly well-trodden ground, so I'll be quick here. * **Spheres**: Everything except for 6\* motes are now abundant and farmable. If you're going for endgame content, get over your Elixir syndrome and legend dive the characters you are using. Job spheres are also abundant (at least for vets), so use those as well. The 3% boost isn't much, but every little bit adds up. * **Magia**: Free stat boosts, and easy to farm with all the technology posted on reddit. I personally prefer the macro approach, which really only takes about 20 minutes to set up. +100 in your primary damage stat is a significant gain for almost every character, so go get those points. * **Equipment**: Artifacts are plentiful, although rainbow shards may not be, depending on how long you've been playing. A fully honed artifact can add somewhere in the zipcode of 70-100+ points to your main damage stat, along with the elemental boost. Don't forget that some characters get type-specific damage boosts from LMs and also their dives. Beyond that, prioritize having two pieces of +elemental damage gear on all your DPS and get the max +40% bonus. * **Magicite deck:** There have been a bazillion guides on this. My one comment is that most guides prioritize a generalist approach, balancing damage vs. mitigation. As you shorten the length of the battle, you may not need as much mitigation. For instance, I almost always have triple empower and double stat boons. It is almost always composed of two Madeens and one Deathgaze. In instances where all of my SB is generated up front, I will drop something and use a Dragon Zombie instead. For mitigation, I stick to HP boons and elemental dampens (no more than two). I tend to stay away from spell/blade wards unless a specific attack is killing me by a hair and I need to whittle that down. Throw two fast acts in if I have the extra space. I personally find Dirge's guide to be the most similar to my own building preferences, given its focus on modularity. * **LMs**: Most speedrunners will focus on IC/QC and w-cast LMs. enElement is useful if you're using an AOSB, but otherwise loses out to damage boosting LM1s or +damage with a weapon LMRs given that most AASBs provide their own enElement. **4. Choosing RMs** This is a bit more complicated, as it's where you tend to do the most balancing between reduction of the Ramp time vs. increasing starting DPS. * Mako Might/Dr. Mog's Teachings are pretty much staples, as expected. Typical setup is for one to be on the CSB holder and the other to be on an entruster * Raw Power is the default for whoever is providing Hastega, and its clone Lupine Swiftness is frequently used when employing the Quina 3-SB starting strat. * TGM is a staple on most DPS characters. Aside from increasing the number of turns that they will have (which can result in fairly massive DPS boosts in short runs), it also has the side benefit of providing faster SB generation in slightly longer runs * While there's a strong temptation to use things like +40% ability school RMs or Tyro's +30% damage to vulnerability on your DPS, these tend to have really low pay-offs unless they're being used by characters with some form of IC at the beginning of the battle. In runs that are 15s or less, spending 3.5+s to cast the AASB is extremely costly * Ace Striker types are also valuable as another way of getting an extra SB up, particularly on H/IC3 types **5. Use RWs to fill holes** You dont always need to use an SB gauge to get a certain effect. If you cant fit in haste, then use Raider. If you cant fit in healing (but still need it), then use Fabula Priestess. When youve cleared all the requirements, then Fabula Mage becomes your best friend. Fabula Guardian is very rarely used. **6. Adjusting your setup** It is very rare to stage a setup and then have it work perfectly as planned. Getting the right setup is an iterative process, where you refine the pieces until you get to a place where you can do exactly what you had planned. The piece that tends to get tweaked the most is the amount of mitigation that you're pre-loading. Without doing a bunch of math, it is very hard to tell how far you can get into a run without dying. Putting in the right amount of mitigation, usually by tinkering with your magicite deck or sometimes your DEF/RES levels, takes some time to figure out. But if you do it correctly, you can usually find a way to last one more turn, which can make the difference between a fast stable clear vs. consistent defeat. # Phase 2: The Ramp Most of the analysis on reddit or Discord tends to cover either the Setup (Phase 1) or conceptual discussions for how to boost Max DPS (Phase 3). Speedruns, on the other hand, are generally differentiated *by the efficiency of the Ramp phase (Phase 2)*. There's a very simple reason for this: The Ramp is almost always the most costly part of a battle. Putting up Wall, Haste, buffs, ProShell, etc., or organically generating enough SB to put up a chain and multiple SBs can easily soak up 8+ seconds, if not more. Moreover, not only are you doing relatively little damage, but youre also absorbing more damage from the boss that will need to be healed, draining even more time or SB gauge. Multiple bosses, particularly magicites, also have more punishing attacks deeper into their phases (e.g. Geosgaeno's stone punch, Tiamat's flame breath thing, etc). Pushing phases faster can help you skip those entirely. Speedrunners generally approach the ramp as follows: **1. Eliminate unnecessary mitigation** Most people start with a preconception that they absolutely need Wall, Pro/Shellga, some very high level of healing, and so on. While theres always the better safe than sorry approach, mitigation isnt free - it costs some combination of SB gauge, an RW slot, and time. The *need* to use these things becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the more you de-prioritize DPS, the more mitigation you will need. In todays world, it is possible to do the equivalent of an AOSBs worth of damage *every single turn*. For anything with less HP/Defense than a 6\*, that significantly reduces the amount of total damage that youre expected to take, so long as you move fast enough. While the shots you tank may hurt more, you will simply be tanking fewer shots. This is *especially* true for 3- and 4-star magicites, where the top runs basically do away with pretty much every element of set-up except for haste (and sometimes even that). **2. Eliminate unnecessary boosts** This may feel a little counterintuitive, but especially for lower level magicites, you dont need to go in with a full stack of damage amplifiers, e.g. chains, OK pUSB, Tyro's Awakening. Now that its generally pretty easy to double-stack your DPS with +element boost, get an extra 100 on main stats from magia, another extra 100 from artifacts, and legend dives are no longer rare, its nowhere near as hard to get really solid damage with virtually no buffing. Check how much damage you're doing with and without all of these things before deciding that you absolutely have to have them. Also, while the sub is replete with comments talking about how great this SB pairs with that one, the reality is that there are very few situations where the extra time is worth the cost, except for Cloud and Sephiroth strats. While stacking is virtually required in 6-star fights, it tends to be done in stages to offset the diffusions. Outside of those scenarios, it is almost never the case that building the gauge to have two SBs go back-to-back is the optimal strategy, unless you simply have no one else thats even remotely worth a damn (which can happen when you're starting). **3. Divert the time/SB gauge youve saved into your main DPS** **options** The specifics of SB management - particularly in the Ramp stage - are fairly detailed, but worth going into in some amount of detail. As a consequence, I'll be delving into that in more detail in a separate post. For now, what I'll say is that the earlier you get your primary DPS characters going, the better off you will be. Specific examples of how to do this have already been outlined in my prior speedrun data posts, which are linked to at the bottom of this post. **4. Cut down SB casting times** Do this whenever possible. If your chainholder has a Quickcast LMR, use it. If your primary DPS can use TGM and get entrusted the bar, rather than just starting off with Mako Might, do that. If someone casts things faster when tranced, put an H/IC3 character in and have them trance that character in Round 1. If you have an H/IC3 character that is roughly equivalent to the other DPS that you were planning to use, use them instead. The incremental benefit from doing this gets diminished the longer the fight, but the reality is that casting an SB by itself costs an immense amount of time. # Phase 3: Max DPS This is generally the easiest part of the battle. Everything is more or less set, all you have to do is spam your abilities, build chain, dead boss. If you have a source of quickcast, make sure that those are up and running at all times also. Done! At least in most fights. There are some runs (e.g. Ark, Deathgaze, Adamantoise, Shiva) where the boss will throw up impediments to your DPS in the form of barElement, Pro/Shell, etc., and you will likely have to find a way to course correct. **This is where reading the AI comes in handy**. You will specifically want to understand if the mitigation is skippable (e.g. by pushing phases faster), and what it would theoretically take to do so. Can you push damage faster, either through a faster Ramp or more w-casts and consequently avoid the attack (see [my write-up on Adamantoise](URL for a very specific example of what I'm talking about)? If not, then you need to understand what triggers the debuff, and have the counter or preventative measure cued up to land ASAP (this happens in a number of Odin runs). As an example, the most frequently encountered impediment is enrage, which for most bosses can lead to a substantial reduction in damage. Well-timed uses of Fabula Mage or 6\* magicites can help recoup a lot of damage that might otherwise be mitigated, but requires knowing the enemy's run well enough that you can time casting it just prior to when your DPS would attack. This is a key element for runs such as Odin, Deathgaze, and a bunch of others. # Other tricks of the trade Having the right setup, efficiently moving through your Ramp, and successfully navigating any resistance during the Max DPS phase is generally about 99% of the battle. That said, there are a few other things that are worth focusing on. **Know how many turns you have** I wont spend too much time here as I wrote [a pretty extensive post](URL about this a long time ago, but most speedrunners develop an innate sense for how many turns they have to work with. This is important, as it creates a concrete understanding of the trade-off cost for each turn that you take. For instance, a fight that would take 8 turns will generally place a lot more value on something like an AASB, and can be a bit more lax in terms of the ramp. A fight with only 2-3 turns will be more oriented towards AOSBs on H/IC3 characters, and virtually no ramp. **Figure out how you want to balance your Ramp vs. your Max DPS** As you go through your setup, think about whether your choices are going to benefit your Ramp or your Max DPS phase, and what the trade-off is that you're making. To take a simplified example, should you have three DPS, a chainholder, and a healer, or two DPS, an entruster, a chainholder, and a healer? This question is completely nonsensical in a vacuum. A boss with only 1M of HP will have a very different optimal strategy than a boss with 5M HP. Let's assume the latter for now. At 5M HP, the amount of damage that needs to be done is crazy, crazy high. Assuming all the DPS are using an AASB, are capping right off the bat, and getting some amount of w-casts, that would mean something close to 20 total turns under AASB (5M / 250k per AASB turn, using round numbers and assuming a 25% bonus from w-casts). 20 attacks split between two DPS would mean you need at least 10 rounds where both of them are using their AASB (set aside the fact that this is basically impossible). 20 attacks split between three DPS, on the other hand, would be closer to 6-7 rounds. So long as the loss of an entruster doesn't cost you an extra 2-3 rounds of Ramp time, then this very simplistic example would dictate going for a longer ramp so that you can shorten your Max DPS phase. People can get really deep into the theory here, but this concept is the key foundation for optimizing your team structure, at least for timing purposes. **Try new things** The number one thing I suggest to most aspiring speedrunners is to just try things out. You dont know what is possible until you try. I have seen tons of posts and Discord conversations where people with multiple chains and AASBs are too nervous to try a 5\* magicite or a Torment. And it's understandable, because those are some big bosses! But you'll never get there unless you take a first step, and you'll often be surprised by how much your team can do if you give it a really hard push. Speedrunning, more than anything, is about testing different strategies, seeing what works, what doesn't, and then continuing to refine. By pushing yourself to try new strats, you can get better insight into just how far you can actually go. **Resources for getting better** There are many, many resources for improving your game, for those that are so inclined. The two that Ive found most relevant are the FFRK Discord speedrun channel (which I manage with others) and YouTube. The FFRK Discord #gl\_speedrun\_challenge channel is where most of the speedrunning community congregates and posts their times and setups. We have an extensive leaderboard with thousands of submitted runs. Through the magic of Discord, you can search for setups and see what others with faster times have done to get there, going back through years of data if you're so inclined. It being Discord, you can also reach out to people and just ask them what they did. YouTube also has a wealth of videos that you can watch to see how others have executed their strategies, with many of the video creators being here on reddit. For anyone that's interested in joining the community, all you need to do is come visit us in [the #gl\_speedrun\_challenge channel on Discord](URL and we can help you get going with guidance on how to speed up runs, and start getting your runs submitted on the Board. It's a friendly and collaborative community, and we're all happy to help people figure out how to improve their times (there's a separate channel for people that need help clearing). Hopefully this has been helpful to some people in the community, and even inspires people to look at their runs differently. If there's interest, I'll try and write up a few more on some of the finer points later on.

All of these Multiplayer Fight roughly follow their actual Magicite fights except at a slightly lower difficulty and that we do not have access to our Magicite decks - so using your original clear parties for these fights will still serve you well (for solo runs at least). In exchange, the usual rewards are made higher than the standard Multiplayer Battles, making this quite a good exchange. There is much shady businesses happening all around here - so becareful! &amp;nbsp; Also, this is a public service, I suppose. **Please be informed that starting from this Dark FBC event, the usual FBC Weekly Event format is now changed to a speed-run format where going fast-and-furious will reward you with more Krakka greens, the fights being pulled directly from Magicite battle (adjusted slightly to a lower difficulty appropriate to set difficulty), and that every FBC Multiplayer Battles will now feature 4 different (higher level) Multiplayer Battle version of the Magicite battles (adjusted slightly for Multiplayer format).** Thank you, good luck, and we will be needing both to survive the Magicite battle burn-out. &gt;_&lt;;; &amp;nbsp; *** [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy &amp;nbsp; [Original 3 Magicite Enemy Stats and AI](URL - for Mist Dragon &amp;nbsp; [Original 4 Holy/Dark Magicite Enemy Stats and AI](URL - for Siren &amp;nbsp; [Original 5 Holy/Dark Magicite Enemy Stats and AI](URL - for Lakshmi and Madeen *** **BOSS: Mist Dragon (IV)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Mist Dragon with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed, mostly magical attacks * **Status Effects:** n/a * **Elements used:** Holy, Ice * **Break Resistance:** 80% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect * **Special Notes** * This is the Multiplayer battle counter-part of the ""3 Magicite"" Mist Dragon fight and follows the same rules but at a much lower difficulty. * The Mist Dragon will occasional shift from Dragon form to Mist form and vice-verse during the fight. * The Mist Dragon is invulnerable when Mist form and attacking her when she is in this form with result to Counter Mist Breath. * It is advisable to wear Ice AND Holy resist gears.

A dedicated Runic/Grand Cross user can help reduce incoming damage to your party and/or out right nullify some of these attacks. * Bringing Affliction Break and Astra will help you deal with Siren's status ailments. The most dangerous one here is Silence - especially for your healers and if the Raiding teams are fielding Mages to this fight. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|-200%|120%|50%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Haste|WHT|Self|-|-|-|grants Haste| |All|Thundaga|BLK|fixed ?-target AOE|Magical|Lightning|extreme damage|Targeted slot varies between Solo and Multiplayer| |All|Thundaga|BLK|AOE|Magical|Lightning|super massive damage|-| |All|Blizzaga|BLK|fixed ?-target AOE|Magical|Ice|extreme damage|Targeted slot varies between Solo and Multiplayer| |All|Blizzaga|BLK|AOE|Magical|Ice|super massive damage|-| |All|Venomous Clasp|fixed ?-target AOE|Single|Physical|-|extreme damage|high chance to Poison| |All|Holy|WHT|fixed ?-target AOE|Magical|Holy|extreme damage|Targeted slot varies between Solo and Multiplayer| |All|Savage Holy|WHT|fixed ?-target AOE|Magical|Holy|extreme damage|Targeted slot varies between Solo and Multiplayer| |All|Savage Lunatic Voice|NAT|AOE|Magical|-|extreme damage|chance to apply Silence; grants Regen to Siren| |Weak/Very Weak|Savage Venomous Clasp|fixed ?-target AOE|Single|Physical|-|extreme damage|high chance to Sap; uses Esuna on Siren| |Very Weak|Counter Curaga|WHT|Self|-|-|-|response to all attacks; restores HP| *** **BOSS: Lakshmi (VI)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 350 (Infernal) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Lakshmi with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** 100% Magical * **Status Effects:** Doom: 60, Imperil Holy, Sap, Confuse, Sleep * **Elements used:** Non, Holy, Lightning * **Break Resistance:** 70% * **Status Vulnerability:** n/a * **Special Notes** * This is the Multiplayer battle counter-part of the ""5 Magicite"" Lakshmi fight and follows the same rules but at a much lower difficulty.

In the first part of the Weekly Event, a pair of Red Dragons have shown up on the D80/120 Conquest Battle, though they are still dropped by a strong Ice or Wind parties. Later on, Lani &amp; Scarlet Hair shows up to challenge us on the D160/220 Conquest Battle, both are bringing out their specializations against us.

This triggers instantly and can be negated with Tauntiliate if desired. * Due to the multiple types of attacks being thrown, RW/One's Divine Veil Grimoire and a dedicated Dancer doing debuffs will keep the damage down, and with or without Pain you are expected to be taking damage from them! * Raiding teams who wishes to farm D220 Lani &amp; Scarlet Hair for 'greens' should look somewhere else or make one due to their inherent elemental neutrality.

For the unaware, welcome to the **5th Anniversary's Ice-focused BANNER 5**!!! Okay, yeah, the 5th Anniversary is already over but this was originally a post-5th Anniversary Weekly Event. So what do we have here in FFVIII Weekly Event that makes it different from the other Weekly Event and why was it considered a part of the 5th Anniversary? Let's see... * Weekly Event Banner 1 brings us an excellent Ice elemental option for your one-stop shop to slay the upcoming 6-star magicite Valefor. ~~Personally, I'm skipping this for the FFVI eve... *gets stab by angry VIII fans*~~ * DeNA finally remembers Kiros and Ward! They both get access to Record Board and new stuff to play with the ability access upgrade a few weeks ago. This update makes it viable enough to field a full VIII team of Ice gunners (Sharpshooters and Machinists!). * Of course, this event also brings about the Record Board access for Squall and Rinoa, leading to their unique Hero Abilities! Say goodbye to those Ice Crystals of yours if you are planning to get both of them! * In place of our weekly Revenge event challenge... we are getting the new Transcript Dungeon as a replacement weekly event challenge - it features one Boss in two different difficuties. From what I can gather, this should be around the level of a 3/4 Magicite fight, and the second part of the Multiplayer battles are their ""lower level"" counterpart. Also, while not part of the Anniversary, I've added my [The State of the FFRK Multiplayer Nation 2020](URL post up there (and here in this sentence) to remind people of the future Multiplayer Raid updates coming to us in 5 months. &amp;nbsp; Anyways, to our other main topic, Multiplayer Battles! The Weekly Event opening brings us into a battle against 2 Propagators for our D80/120 Conquest Battles. Nothing to see here but you need to defeat both win the battle! Meanwhile, the second half of the Weekly Event brings up Tiamat (VIII) for our D160/220 Conquest Battle, consider this as a preview/training battle before you actually do its Transcript Dungeon counterpart! &amp;nbsp; *** [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Propagators (VIII)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat the Propagators with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed * **Status Effects:** Silence, Blind * **Elements used:** Lightning * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Poison, Silence, Slow, Stop, Reflect, Blind, Sleep, Berserk, Interrupt * **Special Notes** * We fight against 2 Propagators at the same time.

What applies here also applies to that fight. * Bring a Dancer who can use ""Enfeebling Jitterbug"" to counter Tiamat's ""Roar"" buffs. Selphie for those doing full-VIII realm setup. * Astra is a mandatory here due to the auto-hit Sleep/Blind/Sap. Probably not an issue for most player but better prepared than not. Transcript Dungeons is a different matter though. * Bring Fire resist and Power/Magic Break/down to help mitigate Tiamat's attacks. Most of its AOE attacks comes in either Non-Elemental, ranged Physical, or, piercing-type flavors. * mBlink can help here avoid the AOE gravity and most of the AOE magical attacks. * Raiding teams who want to farm for 'greens' will need to run an Elemental that can Imperil to keep things faster with this Tiamat resisting all four Fire/Lightning/Earth/Wind elementals. As an extra, from here on and until the next Type-0 Weekly Event arrives, all of the D160/220 Bosses are either sporting resist/absorb/neutral elemental resistance. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |50%|100%|50%|50%|50%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Flare|NAT|Single|Magical|Non|extreme damage|-| |All|Roar|NAT|Self|-|-|-|grants ATK/MAG +X% for Y seconds| |All|Ultimate Meteor|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|piercing damage|ignores RES| |All|Ultimate Reaper|NAT|AOE|ranged Physical|-|piercing damage|ignores DEF| |Default|Dark Flare|NAT|AOE|Magical|Fire|extreme damage|-| |Default|Meteor|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|extreme damage|-| |Default|Gravity|NAT|Single|-|-|current HP% gravity damage|ignores Instant KO resist| |Default/Weak|Reaper|NAT|AOE|ranged Physical|-|super massive damage|-| |Default/Weak|Ultimate Sleep|NAT|fixed target AOE|-|-|-|auto-hit Sleep| |Default/Weak|Ultimate Blind|NAT|fixed target AOE|-|-|-|auto-hit Blind| |Weak/Very Weak|Graviga|NAT|AOE|-|-|current HP% gravity damage|ignores Instant KO resist| |Very Weak|Apocalypse Dark Flare|NAT|AOE|Magical|Fire|piercing damage|ignores RES and mBlink; auto-hit Sap|"

As the opening tag line says: ""When darkness veils the world, ~~four~~ Warriors of Light shall come!"". Now, pick up your gear, adventure awaits us! ""After a long journey, four young travelers did at last appear..."" or so it says! But apparently, the Weekly Event says it is wrong and we are thrust into a battle against the Four Fiends for D80/120 Conquest Battle, but please relax as this is a Boss Rush format and they can be easily defeated by a well-equipped party. Meanwhile, lurking in the shadows, the curtains of the D160/220 Conquest Battle opens up and reveals the Vampire from the Cavern of Earth! Smug creature isn't he - of course, it has enough stats to make it look smug for a D160/220. ""The Servant has becomes the Master!"" so says this Vampire. Yes, a **normal mob monster** has been uplifted and ranked up by the FFRK devs into a proper Boss fight (its not the first time though...), mostly to give some challenge and lots of annoyance. &amp;nbsp; *** [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Four Fiends (I)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat the Four Fiends with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed * **Status Effects:** * Lich: Slow, Sleep * Marilith: Blind, Paralyze * Kraken: Blink * Tiamat: Poison * **Elements used:** * Lich: Ice, Lightning, Fire, Non-Elemental * Marilith: Fire * Kraken: Lightning * Tiamat: Lightning, Poison, Ice, Fire * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Slow, Reflect, Interrupt (all) * **Special Notes** * We are up against the Four Fiends for this fight in a Boss Rush format. The Boss order is Lich -&gt; Marilith -&gt; Kraken -&gt; Tiamat. Defeat them all to win! * A Wind/Water/Holy/Dark/Poison-oriented raiding party is highly advised here as they are the elements that the Bosses do have not resistance too. In the case of Holy, Lich is weak against it and will die here very fast, enough that he might be casting Haste on his 1st turn then die horribly before he even gets to his next turn. * For new players wishing to Solo-run this fight, please prioritize Lightning resist accessories then Fire, alternatively anything that provides Fire/Ice/Lightning resist will give you sufficient mitigation. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Boss|Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |Lich|200%|50%|100%|100%|100%|100%|200%|100%|100%| |Marilith|50%|50%|50%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| |Kraken|50%|100%|200%|50%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| |Tiamat|50%|50%|50%|50%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Lich)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Blizzara|BLK|AOE|Magical|Ice|heavy damage|-| |All|Thundara|BLK|AOE|Magical|Lightning|heavy damage|-| |All|Fira|BLK|AOE|Magical|Fire|heavy damage|-| |All|Haste|WHT|Self|-|-|-|grants Haste| |All|Slow|WHT|AOE|-|-|-|chance to apply Slow| |All|Sleep|BLK|AOE|-|-|-|chance to apply Sleep| |All|Flare|BLK|AOE|Magical|Non|heavy damage|-|&amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Marilith)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Fira|BLK|AOE|Magical|Fire|heavy damage|-| |All|Blind|BLK|AOE|-|-|-|chance to apply Blind| |All|Stun|BLK|Single|-|-|-|chance to apply Paralyze| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Kraken)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Ink|NAT|AOE|ranged Physical|-|medium damage|chance to apply Blind| |All|Thundara|BLK|AOE|Magical|Lightning|heavy damage|-| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Tiamat)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Thunder Bolt|NAT|AOE|Magical|Lightning|heavy damage|-| |All|Poison Gas|NAT|AOE|Magical|Poison|heavy damage|chance to apply Poison| |All|Icestorm|NAT|AOE|Magical|Ice|heavy damage|-| |All|Blaze|NAT|AOE|Magical|Fire|heavy damage|-| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Vampire (I)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Vampire with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed * **Status Effects:** Paralyze, Poison, Sap * **Elements used:** Poison * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect * **Special Notes** * Equip Poison-elemental resist gear as the majority of the Vampire's AOE magical attacks are Poison-elemental and piercing. * Leave Wall at home as everything here is piercing damage except for Apocalypse Bloodsuck.

But Iast (2?) years I only solo the raids and hardly join any coops. I was thinking how should ffrk improve raids or is it good enough right now? My suggestions: None of those suggestions should force players to farm coop. I don't like forced coops either. 1) Add some new rewards for coops Instead of farming 5 star motes in motes dungeon or major arcana in magicites. Isn't better to join coop If you can also grind it there? Adjust the stamina/difficulties for those rewards. I really like abilities as reward (blizzaja anyone heh). Maybe add (one) ability each event as first time reward? It would help the newbies. Some fluff/minor reward Like you can earn new coop stickers? Or double magia exp :D Or even old wardrobes/ old music records? 2) Add some new mechanics during coop. Make it more fun to play coop than solo. Maybe auto wall so you don't need to bring tyro? Or Leader can choose between any elemental/realm chain to start the battle? Boss has some vulnerability like the old days off ffrk where old abilities are useful? There is many possibilities to make coop more fun. 3) different raid mode Each player can only bring 1 char? Record dungeon raid? A lot of possibilities here."

For this Weekly Event, we are once again ushered back to the Realm of VI to join Celes and friends as they fight against the Gestahlian Empire's Magitek forces. This time around, Celes gets her Sync and Hero ability as she takes front, while Umaro, Setzer, and Gogo (VI) showcases their new tech against the ever-growing competition they face! If that was not enough; we also gain access to a 5 and 6 Dark-elemental Shooter abilities that will allow Setzer and Rufus and to actually play the DPS game, though Shadow and Jecht may also like this as extra options - even if these aren't their forte. HM? Oh yes, back to our main topic... the Multiplayer battles! For this Weekly Event's launch, we fight against the doom-loving Nelapa in D80/120 Conquest Battle arena, just try not to bring non-summon mage parties if you don't want to see your spells bounced back at your party. On the second half, and accompanying as part of the ""Stroke of the Brush"" event, Number 128 (and his blades) guard the D160/220 Conquest Battle arena from any escaping Returners!

Yup, you read those bolded words up there right, Infernal Conquest Battles now properly reward Anima Lenses on top of the usual Gil rewards. Yay! &gt;o&lt;/ Even if its still a very small amount - it is still an important source for mythril-poor players. For intermediateish-transitioning-to-veteran players may want to start reviewing and weighing their options if they can do these fight Solo (easily with proper buff support and/or AASBs) or do these with your friends. For this month, we are up against an old school Boss that we have not seen for almost a year, the formidable controlling unit of the Giant of Babil. Unlike its gimmicky version found in the Nightmare dungeons, the [Infernal+] CPU follows the classic fight mechanic of its origin, except its upgraded its lethality to a higher form. For instance, this will be our very first Conquest Battle Boss that uses the ""Pain"" status ailment mechanic, meaning if you stall too much you won't be able to survive the fight as the higher your Pain level is - the higher damage you will receive. Consolation prize? Be grateful that we are NOT facing the SNES version of CPU (IV) who auto-counters every physical attacks with 9999 damage. &gt;.&gt; &amp;nbsp; *** [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: CPU (IV)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 350 (Infernal+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat CPU with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed * **Status Effects:** Pain (CPU, Attack Node only) * **Elements used:** Lightning (CPU only) * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect * **Special Notes** * The fight against with the CPU, Defense Node, and, Attack Node - all active in the field. Defeat all of them in order to win! * The CPU will apply Reflect on itself at the start of the fight. * The CPU has a ccess to a bunch of AOE that involves current HP% and max HP% gravity attacks, a piercing lightning AOE, and a Pain Lvl1-inducing piercing lightning AOE. * If the Raid Party takes out both Nodes at any time, the CPU will reset its ATB and removes its own Limiters, then use Infernal Globe 199 on its next immediate turn. Then, on same turn as the Infernal Globe 199, the CPU revives both the Attack Node and Defense Node at full HP. * The Defense Node only uses Restore to recover HP - almost always the target is the CPU. * The Attack Node only uses AOE ranged physical attacks. All are pBlink-able but the main worry here is the Pain Lvl2-inducing Infernal Laser Barrage. * Suggested kill order is: CPU -&gt; Attack Node -&gt; Defense Node. * Raiding teams wishing to challenge the CPU will need to bring a Physical-oriented party to avoid the CPU's Reflect, and if going the Summoner route, will need to be careful with their AOE attacks.

Much later on, the Wingvern (a Pterosaur it is not) shows up on the D160/220 arena and comes to attack us in the name of the Concordian Army. Probably in revenge for Shinryu Celestia's defeat.

The spawned ""Breaksight"" (a large yellow target recepticle) must be targetted manually and defeated (reduce to 0 HP) in order to make Shinryu Celestia vulnerable and lower her defenses. Do note that the ""Breaksight"" vanishes after a few turns (usually Shinryuu Celestia's). This vulnerable status is indicated by Shinryu Celestia falling and staying on the ground for around 2-3 of her turns - greatly reducing both her DEF and RES status and her no doing anything for this duration. * For veteran players and raiding parties... ignore the ""Breaksight"" mechanics and just burn Shinryu Celestia quickly using a combination of Chains, Imperils, and AASB to be done with it. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Fire Breath|NAT|AOE|Magical|Fire|medium damage|-| |All|Thunder Breath|NAT|Single, 7-hits RT|Magical|Lightning|medium damage|-| |All|Cannibalize|NAT|Single|Physical|-|heavy damage|-| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Wingvern (Type-0)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Wingvern with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed - leaning more Magical * **Status Effects:** Sap * **Elements used:** Non-elemental * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect * **Special Notes** * The Wingvern uses the basic ""gravity damage and Sap status"" combo to wreck Raiding parties. Make sure to have a source of Regen(ga) and/or Last Stand to counteract this if one is feeling that RNG is against you. * The Wingvern uses max HP% gravity attacks with its Talon Strike - so try to have your party's HP as high as you can. * The Wingvern uses ""Menacing Threat"" to five itself with Haste and a ATK/MAG buff.

No, its not Vincent Valentine, but the term ""Infernal"" and ""Hot"" literally describes this guy accurates.

Yeah, I know that this may not be the [m] 6-star Ifrit many are waiting, but it IS still an Ifrit on an end-game level scale. And, yes, I suppose the retired Mote Ifrit would be proud of its relatives dominating part of the end-game I suppose.

This is something common with all of the previous end-game Ifrits we've fought before. * For damage mitigation, Fire-resist gear and Power/Magic Break/downs are highly advised to lessen the impact of Ifrit's attacks, this is in consideration that he will later transition to more piercing attacks + counters. Of note, Fire-resist gear is required due as most of Ifrit's attacks are Fire-based, as he will begin putting up Imperil Fire and that will add up fast starting on Weak phase thru his Counters (important for Physical-oriented Raiding Parties). Power Break/down is kinda mandatory here, especially if he keeps demolishing your raiding party, to counter and debuff Ifrit's Brave/ATK buff during his Weak phase transition. * Bring a refresh-able form of Astra for this fight to prevent getting Interrupted (Front Row only) or Stop (Back Row only). Both of these are Auto-Hits and cannot be prevented by status resist gear and/or Affliction Breaks. * Physical-oriented Raiding Parties may want to bring a form of Dispel to remove Ifrit's Protect during his Very Weak phase transition. * Magical-oriented Raiding Parties may want to bring someone who can Imperil Water and/or stack MAG buffs as Ifrit's counters against magical attacks with an AOE auto-hit 10% Debuff Water.

You are advised to not bring singular ATK, DEF, or RES buffs as Folmarv and Loffrey's debuffing attacks will replace them soon enough. To note, Loffrey's Apocalypse Crush Weapon does an ATK/MAG debuff, does bringing a ATK/MAG buff may not be good a thing. * Unlike his fellow Knight Templars, Cletienne is a Sorceror and has a access to Holy and Dark magic attacks, the standard magic spell being easily negated by Runic/Grand Cross.

36,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Notes on Realm Chains,1,eosrl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/eosrl2/notes_on_realm_chains/,2020-01-15 09:32:34,"Hello Keepers! This isn't meant to be an exhaustive guide, but I thought it might be a helpful reference for folks that have picked up a few of these things and are trying to decide how useful they are (or not). Currently their greatest utility is to assist with clearing the following dungeons: (1) **D??? Tormen**t: Using a realm chain allows teams to choose ""Rejuvenation Grimoire"" as their RW in lieu of ""Bonds of Historia"", boosting healing options for realms where you don't yet have a USB+ medica or just need more help staying alive (and without pulling in an out-of-realm elemental chain holder). (2) **D350 Dreams**: These recurring event dungeons are probably an even better case for realm chains, as evidenced by the freebie Core chain for Dr. Mog that was recently released with the Core Dreams dungeon. There's no ""Bonds of Historia"" option, and not all realms have an elemental chain holder that matches the typical DPS options for that realm. However, it's worth noting that Dreams are much more forgiving with out-of-realm characters: **""Elemental Vulnerability &amp; Break Resistance""** |In-Realm|D??? Torment|D350 Dreams| |:-|:-|:-| |5 Heroes|Vulnerable / 7|Vulnerable / 5| |4 Heroes|Neutral / 8|Vulnerable / 6| |3 Heroes|Resist / 9|Vulnerable / 7| |2 Heroes|Resist / Immune|Neutral / 8| |1 Hero|Resist / Immune|Resist / 9| |0|Resist / Immune|Resist / Immune| Bottom line, both types of realm-focused dungeons have a use for realm chains: in Torment dungeons it's more critical to have 4-5 in-realm characters, but you do have ""Bonds of Historia"" as a chain option and these dungeons are ""one and done"" once you've collected all the time rewards; Dreams dungeons have more recurring utility and no inherent chain option, but they really only push you to have 3 in-realm characters, so you have some flexibility to bring in an elemental chain holder from another realm for support if desired. And just for reference here's the descriptions for ""Bonds of Historia"" &amp; realm chains: * **Bonds of Historia**: 150-hit chain, 30% field bonus for in-realm characters * **Realm Chains**: Same as above, plus party Haste &amp; 30% ATK/MAG bonus I'm going to skip over the **Cardia** dungeons for now because I haven't studied up on them yet, but if you're interested in this next iteration of permanent realm-based dungeons, u/ElNinoFr put out a great guide recently on the topic, so check it out: [URL My quick take on realm chains in the context of Cardia dungeons is that they're going to be pretty awesome, since that content is a realm-based parallel to the current elemental-focused Magicite dungeons. It's also probably worth noting that with the 5th Anniversary regular events will be getting D300-400 stages (which would be another positive sell for realm chains), and on the ""supply &amp; demand"" side it doesn't appear that realm chains will be available via selection any time soon: the refresh to the current CSB Selection relic draw ""only"" adds more Gen 2 elemental chains, and between now and June there are only 2 banners that include more than 1 realm chain (FF 2/3/7/9 Focused Relic Draw &amp; FF 1/5/13 FRD...but no guarantee we'll see those draws in Global - thanks very much to u/cerebellumd for his post: [URL *Enough expository banter!* After tinkering around with some of the realm chains I've picked up, I came to the conclusion that not all realm chains are of equal value...even though they are technically identical :-) I won't attempt to rank them, because as with any utility SB, their value is largely dependent on the team you can field and what other options you have. However, here's the 3 points I considered when evaluating realm chains: 1. What other chain options are there in that realm? (Especially Gen 2) 2. How well does than realm synergize elementally? (E.g. FF X = water vs. FF XI = ???) 3. Is the chain holder a good choice? (Do they have other utility or would I rather use them for DPS?) So with those questions in mind, here's my (hopefully quick) explanation of what I put in the table below: * The 4 columns after the realm listing are for **other chains available in that realm** \- Free, Gen 1 (PHY/MAG are not broken out since they don't add a stat bonus), MAG Gen 2 and PHY Gen 2. Elements are abbreviated as ELWFINDH for Earth, Lightning, Water, Fire, Ice, wiNd, Dark &amp; Holy. * ""**Matching DPS**"" is a shorthand summary of how many realm characters have offensive, USB or greater SB's for the listed element. If it's as high as 5 or 6 that realm is clearly made for a specific element; some of the smaller realms can only coordinate 2-3 characters thanks to a multi-elemental DPS guy like Onion Knight. Also, I know this will blow some people's minds, but the elements are listed in order of relative ""strength"", not necessarily number of characters. *Please just skip this next bit if you don't want to know*: I gave 1, 2 3 or 4 points to an element for each offensive USB, AOSB, AASB &amp; SASB, respectively. This was just to keep it simple; obviously the numbers will change as more of the main FFRK characters add a 2nd primary element, but in general the results seemed to match the available elemental strengths in each realm. Of course YMMV, so please don't shoot me if you've got a rocking FF X fire team ;-) * **Number of playable characters** currently available in each realm; average is currently 11, with FF IV &amp; VII on the high end (&gt;16) and Core/I/III/XI/XV on the low end (&lt;10). * **Realm chain holder**; FF IV, XIV &amp; FFT have none. * More extreme shorthand on **pros/cons for that chain holder**...I'll try to add some discussion after the table to expand on that part. &amp;#x200B; |Realm|F0|G1|M2|P2|Matching DPS?|\#|Character|Notes| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Core|\---|\---|\---|\---|HLF (x3/3/2) Dr. Mog + \_\_\_|5|Dr. Mog|\-Lead DPS| |1|\---|DH|\---|\---|H (x2), L (x2), E (x2)|9|WoL|\-Lead DPS| |2|\---|\---|E|\---|E (x3), H (x2), D (x2)|12|Gordon|\+Support &amp; Breaks| |3|\---|E|LD|N|NWE (x2) Onion + \_\_\_|8|Onion|\+Support &amp; pUSB/mUSB| |4|W|L|DH|\---|L (x3), H (x3), D (x2)|18|\---|N/A| |5|\---|F|W|EFN|E (x6), N (x4), F (x5)|11|Krile|\+Dual Element| |6|\---|F|W|I|F (x5), N (x3), H (x2)|11|Mog|\+Dancer/White &amp; Buffs| |7|EL|N|EF|L|E (x4), N (x5), D (x2)|17|Cid VII|\+SSB2 (Machinist?)| |8|\---|I|N|ID|I (x4), D (x3), F (x4)|14|Irvine|\+Support &amp; Breaks| |9|N|\---|L|\---|N (x4), L (x4), F (x3)|11|Steiner|\+Multi Element| |10|\---|WD|\---|WF|W (x6), F (x4), D (x2)|11|Rikku|\-Why not Wakka?| |11|\---|L|\---|\---|IL (x3/2) Prishe + \_\_\_|9|Prishe|\+SSB/Dual Element| |12|I|\---|\---|D|L (x3), D (x3), F (x2)|10|Balthier|\+Machinist| |13|\---|I|IH|\---|I (x3), H (x3), D (x2)|10|Fang|\+SB2/SSB (Breaks)| |14|\---|\---|N|\---|F (x4), N (x2)|10|\---|N/A| |15|\---|\---|\---|L|LFE (x3/3/2) Noctis + \_\_\_|7|Ignis|\+BSB/SSB| |FFT|\---|\---|\---|H|H (x6), D (x3), L (x4)|14|\---|N/A| |T-0|\---|\---|\---|E|F (x4), E (x2), I (x4)|14|Ace|\-Lead DPS| ***Important Note***: the info in this table is current as of the release of the FFT ""Blood Against Destiny"" event on **9-Jan-2020**. At this point there are 60 chains listed in the FFRK Community Database, and only 5 out of 8 Free chains have been released with the Fat Black Chocobo Events (most recently the Earth chain on 7-Dec-2019). If there's enough interest I can create an abbreviated table that's updated with our 6 months of Japan foresight to include new chains being released this year and the upcoming Gen 2.5 chains. &amp;#x200B; # TL;DR Realm chains are nifty! If you've pulled one at some point but never used it, consider taking it out for a spin on D??? Torment to see what kind of team composition options it opens up for you. The extra buff is nice, and it may give you some flexibility to fit more defensive passives into your Magicite deck if (like me) you're having a hard time staying alive. If you're already past that content, there's a major uptick in realm-focused content coming this year with D300-400 regular events and the Cardia dungeons, so these SB's will likely appreciate in value significantly over the coming months. Comments welcome, especially if you want to vote for your ""**Top 3 Realm Chains** I'd really like to have"" or ""**Worst 3 Realm Chain** options because \_\_\_\_"" (fill in the blank). Hopefully some of these notes were useful, and I'll add/update this post based on input from the community. THANKS FOR READING! :-)"

It has been awhile but the Realm XI is no longer the holder of forgotten realm (its XIV now, sadly, please cry for this realm. :'( ) , but on the flipside we are introduced to a new playable character Naja, coming along her is a new boss fight from one of its expansion sets! For this Weekly Event's Conquest Battle, the D80/120 arena is held by the Minotaur (XI), one of whom many are sick of fighting a long time ago and I think its been years since I last saw this guy in a Weekly Event (almost every XI events I believe). On the D160/220 arena, we fight against Alexander (XI) from the FFXI Treasures of Aht Urhgan's expansion set, one of the newer Conquest Battle boss to grace us and it also serves as it first appearance in FFRK - YAY! Anyways and as far as I can gather, Alexander (XI)'s fight mechanics seems to be an amalgam of the various quest battle it is involved with, and our resident XI expert can probably confirm this. The unrelated good news is that... expect for more XI-related Boss according to our future sight sources - like the upcoming Christmas Fest's new Transcendent Proto-Ultima fight and the Diablos of 6-star Dark Magicites! :D Well then, let's go Adventurers, we have quests to complete and monsters to battle!

You only need to defeat Alexander in order to win! * Alexander begins the fight with access to Holy magic only and later on gets Fire magic upon transitioning to Weak phase. * Alexander Image only uses Holy magic. * Alexander will cast AOE Shell during Default phase and AOE Protect on Very Weak Phase. You might want to bring a source of Dispel to remove the buffs if Alexander is too tanky for your raid party. * Depending on your party configuration, bringing a source of refreshable Regen is advised to counter the Sap that Alexander and his images will be applying regularly. * Several of Alexander's attacks comes with DEF, RES, or ATK debuffs on hit. This is specially bad for parties running Shout (Space and Onion Shouts too) as their primary Boostga+Hastega and might need to refresh. * When Alexander enter Very Weak for the first time, it will use Perfect Defense, becoming invulnerable to all form of damage for a short time.

You read that right, the God of Magic Kefka returns from a Fest event end-game boss as an Infernal Conquest Battle, once again attempting to destroy our world again just as how we saw it back then on the World of Balance. As one of the foremost highly successful villain (in gaming history) who actually managed to destroy a world, [Infernal] Kefka will show the players that previous month's Infernal fight ([Infernal] Xande)'s antics as mere child's play, having access to a nearly omni-elemental resist suite and incredibly damaging attacks (mostly AOE with some ST to mix things up) befitting of an actual Final Fantasy series Last Boss.

Make sure that your healer can use their medica to recover from this. * Kefka uses a variety of strong AOE attacks to keep us on our toes. While his early attacks are non-piercing, Kefka tends to prefer piercing ones as he transitions to Weak and Very Weak phase, thus a combination of the usual ProShellWallga and Power/Magic Breakdowns are highly advised for this fight. * Wearing Gigas Armlets (medium Fire/Ice/Lightning) and/or Black-Armored Echoes (medium all element resist, accessory from Dark Odin clears) will help mitigate Kekfa's (Ultimate) Fir/Blizz/Thund-aga attacks. * Bringing a renewable source of Astra is highly advised as Kefka has access to some pretty accurate and debilitating status ailments to raiding parties - especially the ones that will become auto-hit on Very Weak phase. * During Kefka's Weak phase, prepare to refresh your buffs as Kefka will use ""Vengeance"", an AOE Dispel to remove your ProShellHastega. * During Kefka's Weak and Very phase, Kefka will begin countering attacks (probably of proccing is high) with Hyperdrives (ST piercing magic with Sap) and then Ultima (AOE piercing magic), respectively. In order to survive these attacks, try to reserve your Soul Breaks and/or Summon attacks for these phases, allowing you to minimize the chance of triggering those counters as you try to kill Kefka and before he kills with you them. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|120%|50%|0%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Heartless Angel|NAT|AOE|-|-|overflow damage|This is an ""HP-to-1"" attack.| |Default|Firaga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Fire|super massive damage|-| |Default|Blizzaga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Ice|super massive damage|-| |Default|Thundaga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Lightning|super massive damage|-| |Default/Weak|Havoc Wing|NAT|?-target AOE|Physical|-|extreme damage|targets specific slots; target varies with solo and MO| |Default/Weak|Forsaken|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|extreme damage|ignores mBlink| |Default/Weak|Trine|NAT|?-target AOE|-|-|-|targets specific slots; target varies with solo and MO; high chance to apply Blind and Silence| |Weak|Ultimate Firaga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Fire|piercing damage|ignores RES| |Weak|Ultimate Blizzaga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Ice|piercing damage|ignores RES| |Weak|Ultimate Thundaga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Lightning|piercing damage|ignores RES| |Weak|Vengeance|NAT|AOE|-|-|-|Removes positive effects| |Weak|Counter Hyperdrive|NAT|Single|Magical|Non|piercing damage|response to all attacks; ignores RES; high chance to apply Sap| |Very Weak|Meteor|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|piercing damage|ignores RES| |Very Weak|Infernal Havoc Wing|NAT|?-target AOE|ranged Physical|-|piercing damage|targets specific slots; target varies with solo and MO; ignores DEF and pBlink| |Very Weak|Infernal Forsaken|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|piercing damage|ignores RES and mBlink| |Very Weak|Infernal Trine|NAT|?-target AOE|-|-|-|targets specific slots; target varies with solo and MO; auto-hit Blind and Silence| |Very Weak|Counter Ultima|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|piercing damage|response to all attacks; ignores RES|"

For our Weekly Conquest Battle... We have Bahamut (Beyond) occupying the D80/120 arena and is preppings it Mega Flare for us. Meanwhile, is that... a Gear? Oh, nope, its not. :( Apparently its a new boss from the WoFF, the Omega God, a mechanized unit (was it called ""Cogna""?) that has taken over the D160/220 and is priming its algorithm and programs to attack our raiding parties! For a Beyond event, this Weekly Event is rather balanced in terms of the Boss' resistance suite and fight mechanics, though if they are a push-over or not unlike the previous Beyond events will depend on how you will tackle them.

Battle awaits us!""** &amp;nbsp; Behold! Another history is made once on FFRK as we get a (definitely late but better than never) Collab Event, hailing from the Realm of Collabs, Valkyrie Anatomia graces us. My inner VP fanboy is quietly shouting and loudly whispering at the same time!! :D Business as usual and like the Collab Events before it, Valkyrie Anatomia graces us with a Conquest Battle against Lezard Valeth in 2 different difficulties, Hard and Apocalypse+! While this battle is a Year and a quarter old, do be careful as Lezard Valeth has some tricks up his sleever and this battle features a different battle scheme for the whole collab event, an approach that is something similar to the Valkyrie Profile's battle system. Since we have no proper write-up for the actual Global event, I WILL go out of my way abit and will cover the actual higher battles (2 lower difficulty and 2 higher-end), just for the benefit of everyone's convenience. Also before you read up on the Boss fight, please read the Event's Special Battle System rules first: &amp;nbsp; **VP Collab Special Battle System rules:** * The VP Collab Special Battle System is time-limited battle system where FFRK attempts to mimic how the actual Valkyrie Profile combat system works. * All of the Collab Event Fights (both Event proper and multiplayer) will use a turn-based battle system with the Players and Enemy taking turns alternately. * The Enemy will act twice per turn. At the end of the enemy's turn, the enemy will fire a Valkyrie Arrow, switching to the Player's turn starts and vice-versa. * During the Player phase, the Player must deal as much damage as they can, doing so will extend the Player's turn time limit. * After dealing a certain amount of damage, a special RW(?) """" will be activated. Note: I do not have any data on this - both official JP Wiki, Altema.jp and our Community Database don't have either. But from what I can understand, this should be a special Soul Break that deals a large amount of damage to the Boss as a turn finisher, kinda like those ""Purify Weird Soul"" attacks (its like Soul Break) we use in Valkyrie Profile series to finish the attack combo. * When the Valkyrie Arrow stops, the player's party (MO: ALL player character of the Player Raid's team) will be afflicted with an auto-hit Interrupt (ignores resist/Astra as far I as I can see; ATB is set to 0 and paused I believe.), then the Enemy's turn will begin once more. * The cycle will repeat until one side is completely defeated. &amp;nbsp; *** [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **Main Collab Event** **BOSS: Lezard Valeth (EX)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** * **Event:** 15-stamina normal and 1-stamina ???

Do note that it is imperative AND important to remove Spell Reinforce (MAG buffs) as I've heard this buffing the Boss for a very good amount - enough to guarantee overflow damage on overflow-capable ones on the Heretic/Queen fights. * Bring a form of Astra, Ultra Cure, and/or Affliction Break to prevent or recover from Lezard's Silence and Petrify. * The Multiplayer D120 (Hard) and 220 (Apocalypse+) Lezard Valeth is basically a copy-paste of the [Heretic] fight. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |Default|Guard Reinforce|NAT|Self|-|-|-|grants DEF/RES +X% for Y secs| |Default|Spell Reinforce|NAT|Self|-|-|-|grants MAG +X% for Y secs| |Default|Dampen Magic|NAT|Single|-|-|-|high chance to apply Silence (medium chance in normal and MO)| |All|Stone Torch|NAT|Single|Magical|Dark|piercing damage|ignores RES; low chance to apply Petrift| |All|Dark Savior|NAT|Single, 2-hits RT|Magical|Dark|piercing damage|ignores RES| |All|Shadow Servant|NAT|3-target AOE|Magical|Dark|piercing damage|ignores RES| |All|Meteor Swarm|NAT|AOE|Magical|Dark|piercing damage|ignores RES| |All|Fire Storm|NAT|Single|Magical|Fire|piercing damage|ignores RES| |Weak/Very Weak|Prismatic Missile|NAT|Single, 3-hits|Magical|Holy|piercing damage|ignores RES; can deal **Overflow** damage.| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Iseria Queen (EX)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 20-stamina normal and 1-stamina ???

This is a scaled-down version of the Infernal Tyrant fight, so, what works there will also work here! &amp;nbsp; *** [Weekly Event Megathread]() by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Flans (XII)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat the Flans with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** 100% Physical * **Status Effects:** Blind * **Elements used:** n/a * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Confuse, Slow, Stop, Reflect, Blind, Sleep, Berserk, Interrupt * **Special Notes** * The fight begins with 4 Flans and all must be defeated to win this fight! * Wearing Blind (for Physical parties) and/or Instant KO resist accessories arer advised for this fight. * Mage parties are advantageous for this fight to skip the Blind issues. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |200%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Slap (front)|PHY|Front Row AOE|Physical|-|normal damage|Flan A and B only| |All|Slap (back)|PHY|Back Row AOE|Physical|-|normal damage|Flan C and D only| |All|Blind|BLK|Single|-|-|-|low chance to apply Blind; Flan A, C and D only| |All|Cure|WHR|Single|-|-|-|Recovers HP| |All|Attack|NAT|AOE|-|-|current HP% gravity damage|Flan B and D only| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Tyrant (XII)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Tyrant with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed but mostly magical * **Status Effects:** Sap * **Elements used:** Fire, Ice, Lightning, Dark * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect * **Special Notes** * Tyrant begins the fight with Protect and Shell. * Tyrant only uses piercing attacks rendering ProShellga and Wall useless for this fight, instead, bring stat debuffs for mitigation! * Tyrant uses a variety of elemental attacks that will make it hard to mitigate for players who haven't cleared Odin yet (or have no decent resist gears). For those who cleared Odin will find this easier by wearing the omni-resist accessories for extra mitigation. For those who haven't, well, put on your Gigas Armlets (medium Fire/Ice/Lightning resist) and/or Dark resist gears on your squishiest characters, then put as much Fire/Ice/Lightning/Dark double-resist gears that you could slap on the rest of your party. Alternative, Soul Breaks that give Attach Element Fire/Ice/Lightning/Dark can also function as an extra elemental resistance, albeit a bit expensive. * Tyrant's Apocalyse Sonic Fang is now a 2-target AOE and can still be avoided with pBlinks! * Unlike the previous Infernal fight, Tyrant doesn't have his Piercing Graviga, thus you can save up your pBlinks to avoid those annoying Apocalyse Sonic Fangs! Watch out for Apocalyse Bile though as they can also eat up your pBlinks! &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |50%|150%|-200%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Ultimate Firaga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Fire|piercing damage|ignores RES| |All|Ultimate Blizzaga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Ice|piercing damage|ignores RES| |All|Ultimate Thundaga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Lightning|piercing damage|ignores RES| |All|Apocalyse Darkga|NAT|AOE|Magical|Dark|piercing damage|ignores RES and Magic Blinks| |Default/Very Weak|Apocalyse Bile|NAT|2-target AOE|Physical|-|piercing damage|ignores DEF; chance to apply Sap| |Weak/Very Weak|Apocalyse Sonic Fang|NAT|2-target AOE|Physical|-|piercing damage|ignores DEF; chance to apply Instant KO|"

Traveling from the Temple of Chaos of the past Realm of I, into the Cavern of Earth of the present Realm of I, and back into our mobile phone screens (or PCs for emulator users) of the Realm of FF Record Keeper! Like the Boss of the NES era, the Lich (I) has decided that it will keep things simple by unleashing magical attacks (mostly AOE btw) upon our raiding party, while attempting to speed itself up with Haste or hampering our party with Slowga and Sleep!

Yes, you read it right, DeNA has really opted for ""soggy"" as the best description for a Water-oriented collection event. While I will not question their reasons for this choice, the title somehow reminds me of soggy bread for whatever reason, well as Squall famously says: ""Whatever."" So let's get on to this Weekly Event's Multiplayer fights, named ""A Soggy Request"", this Weekly Event focuses on improving our Water elemental and that means we are up against Water-weak Fire-oriented Bosses! For D80/120 openener, we have the Djinn from the Realm of III, and he uses a super-simple AI mechanics compared to the main ""A Soggy Request"" event. Meanwhile, the Flame Eater (and its explosive friends) has setup shop in a burning house right in the middle of D160/220 arena, challenging you to in a literal fire fight! Considering that the main Fat Black Chocobo event bosses are super limited. and repeated but with different difficulties, consider this as warm-up or an advance write-up on how to deal with Flame Eater. Meanwhile, the other boss (Brynhildr) is not converted here as a Raid battle, although it remains with its Doom opener and ""attack you fast"" like in the previous Corridor of Trials. &amp;nbsp; *** [Weekly Event Megathread]() by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Djinn (III)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Djinn with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed * **Status Effects:** n/a * **Elements used:** Fire * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Poison, Confuse, Slow, Reflect, Blind, Sleep, Berserk, Sap, Interrupt * **Special Notes** * Like all the NES-era enemies, the Djinn takes it AI mechanics in a very simple manner, its attacks you with either a ST PHY attack or a ST BLK fire attack.

Grenade counters all PHY with Self-Destruct and Balloons counter all BLK with Self-Destruct. * It is advisable to bring a Water-oriented Summoner party to this fight to not get bothered by the Flame Eater's Protect/Reflect buffs and the adds' Self-Destruct gimmick.

And, oh boy, it is truly a Trick or Treat situation! &amp;nbsp; Note: This one isn't confirmed in game but Datamine has it translated and tomorrow is Halloween in my side of the world so, this might be early for some of us. I've had this prepared over half a year ago - so I tell me if I got something wrong. Also, for the Succubus and Lilith ver.

The Twilight is the harder and features an extra mechanic * Succubus and Lilith **begins the fight with 0 HP**. Like the Pupu UFO mini-event last month, your goal is to heal both Succubus and Lilith to full HP, all the while dealing with gravity-based attacks and status ailments! * All of the enemies' gravity attacks ignores KO resist gear. * Use healing spells (Curaja, Ultra Cure, etc) or any enemy-targetable healing abilities to fill their HP gauge and win the fight! * Don't bother bringing Burst healings and Curada as they CANNOT target or affect enemy units and will always default to a random party member - even if manually targetted!

Yup, the D160/220 battles this time is kinda simpler compared to the previous XV one, but this doesn't mean that one should be careless and get carried away by their newly acquired toys from the Fest! ...though, I doubt the Boss will survive from the initial Awakening's overflow damage spams. &amp;nbsp; *** [Weekly Event Megathread]() by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Rapps (VII)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Rapps with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed * **Status Effects:** Poison * **Elements used:** Wind * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect, Blind, Sap * **Special Notes** * Wear Wind and/or Poison status ailment resist. * All physical attacks here can be easily negated by a dedicated Tauntilator. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Scorpion Tail|PHY|Single, 2-hits RT|Physical|-|normal damage|chance to apply Poison| |All|Aeroga|NAT|Single|Magical|Wind|medium damage|-| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Godo (VII)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Godo with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mixed * **Status Effects:** Poison, Sleep, Stop * **Elements used:** Lightning, Poison * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect * **Special Notes** * Godo changes his attack patterns every turn and is indicated by the color of his mask. * All of Godo's attacks are AOE with a 50% split between non-piercing and piercing ones.

This fight only reward Gils and more Gils~ *** On-Going: [Of Love and Honor](URL MP Megathread *** &amp;nbsp; Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Another month, another Infernal Conquest Battle, but that's not the reason I'm screaming... For this month, we are treated to a rare superboss battle, one that was entirely skipped by Global: **XI/Vana'diel's Absolute Virtue**. For the first time, Global is stepping into one of video gaming's ""Black History"", for we are to battle one of the most notorious monsters (pun intended for XI players) known in Final Fantasy history. The Absolute Virtue is one of the two controversial monsters in FFXI history, mostly because the devs are picky on how players kill it and/or being too vague on their tips on how to kill it ""legally"", leading players to get creative with their means on how to kill it. Yeah, this is probably one of those actual superboss made to be undefeatable, but tell that to players who does ""Instructions unclear - we're going to beat the unbeatable anyway!"". ;) In our case, the Absolute Virtue has arrived in Global, for the original fight was skipped due to a Japan-only collab tied to it. Compared to the original fight when I anticipated this would come to Global, this [Infernal+] Absolute Virtue has a simpler arsenal with less RNG-y move compared to the original incarnation, which could use Maiden's Virelai and do Counter Comets at any point of the fight. So theorically, this fight should be easier (Awakenings and powercreep!) at our current point in Global, but this does not mean that we should be over-confident and stuff. The fight is still an Infernal fight after all against one of the most infamous Superboss of its time. &amp;nbsp; *** [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Absolute Virtue** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 350 (Infernal) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Absolute Virtue with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** Mixed, mostly magical * **Status Effects:** Silence, Slow, Petrify, Confuse, Interrupt * **Elements used:** Wind, Non, Dark * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect * **Special Notes** * Dark and Wind elemental resistance are advised. * Bring and stack as much magical damage mitigation as needed. * A renewable source of Astra and Affliction Breaks are highly advised for this fight due to the number of status ailments that Absolute Virtue likes to apply. * If your raiding party could slot one, a dedicated Tauntilator can help you control where the Wing Thrust and Medusa Javelin are going, potentially allowing your Raid Team to leave Protectga and Power Break/down at home. &amp;nbsp; **Special Barrier Status** * Yes, this warrants a seperate section due to being an important fight mechanic here. * Unique to this superboss, Absolute Virtue begins with special barrier status, which provides it some boosted stats and an unremovable Regen. In order remove both, players must hit him with a specific elemental (kinda like those Anavapta or Manasvin Warmech mechanics), 30 elemental attack for Multiplayer raid or 15 elemental attacks for Solo raid. Thus with this fight mechanic, a Raiding team would probably needs to align their attempt at a day where they are at most comfortable and optimal elementally, allowing them to do the most optimal damage. For the daily elemental requirements, you will need: &gt; SUN: Holy and Dark &gt; MON: Ice &gt; TUES: Fire &gt; WED: Water &gt; THURS: Wind &gt; FRI: Lightning &gt; SAT: Earth and Poison * Be aware that Multi-hit (like Quadruple Spellblades) are considered **1 attack** but a W-cast/Ability double/chase are countered as a different attack. E.g. Bartz uses Engulfing Quadstrikes and does not trigger W-cast against Absolute Virtue that attack is considered **1 elemental attack**. However, if Bartz uses Engulfing Quadstrikes AND triggers W-cast, that is counted as **2 elemental attacks**. * Please note that Absolute Virtue will not emote when the special barrier is removed. Though, the removal of Regen is a signal that the special barrier is done, which also means that Absolute Virtue's stats is no longer boosted. * Raiding teams should note Absolute Virtue resists Holy, thus, Sunday raiding teams should opt for Dark team instead. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|50%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |Default|Aeroga IV|NAT|AOE|Magical|Wind|super massive damage|-| |Default|Aero V|NAT|Single|Magical|Wind|super massive damage|-| |Default|Auroral Wind|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|super massive damage|medium chance to Silence| |Default|Wing Thrust|PHY|Single, 4-hits|Physical|-|super massive damage|high chance to Slow| |All|Tornado II|BLK|Single|Magical|Wind|extreme damage|-| |All|Medusa Javelin|PHY|Single|Physical|-|extreme damage|medium chance to Petrify| |All|Impact Stream|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|super massive damage|Inflicts DEF -X% for Y secs, low chance to Interrupt| |Weak/Very Weak|Comet|BLK|Single|Magical|Dark|extreme damage|-| |Weak/Very Weak|Ultimate Aero V|NAT|Single|Magical|Wind|piercing damage|ignores RES| |Weak/Very Weak|Ultimate Aeroga IV|NAT|AOE|Magical|Wind|piercing damage|ignores RES| |Weak/Very Weak|Ultimate Maiden's Virelai|NAT|3-target AOE|-|-|-|high chance to Confuse| |Weak/Very Weak|Infernal Meteor|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|piercing damage|ignores RES and Blinks| |Very Weak|Infernal Explosive Impulse|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|piercing damage|ignores DEF and Blinks, high chance to Interrupt| &amp;nbsp; *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe.

Rather I look a bit foolish and let people know than get through the battle only to make the same mistake I did. 2nd time I finished a bit faster and mastery with an ASB to spare. &amp;#x200B; His 2nd turn is bar fire and I had initially used Vincent CSB so I could imperil him but switched to Gilgamesh CSB instead who can't imperil. I ended up brute forcing through Odin's bar fire and thus never hit his weakness. All I had to do was hit 2 fire attacks instead of 1 at the start (wouldn't have noticed if I had dualcast). &amp;#x200B; Basically as long as you see vulnerability above the boss it counts."

Meanwhile, the Weekly Event's Conquest Battles also follows that slightly, except for D80/120.

Yes, that's right, they are giving out **25 x Anima lenses Lv3** for this fight.

Gigas Armlets are a MUST for your most squishies members. * A portion of Pecil and Golbez attacks can be easiy nullified with a dedicated Tauntilator and a Runic/Grand Cross users. This is a good form of mitigation for Pecil's solo phase but it is completely useless if you are fighting Golbez's solo phase. * One can put up Reflect on the enemy team and see their Curagas bounce off to heal your party. Niche but this also prevents Pecil from healing and prolonging the fight. * It is HIGHLY advise that raiding parties defeat Golbez first all for the reason that he carries a few status ailments and Osmose that can debilitate your raiding party. Also, one should be reminded that he gains access to the dreaded Black Fang (ST 100% chance to Instant KO) during his solo phase, something that the old-Torment Golbez and 3-star magicite Shadow Dragon uses to annoy many players and keep them from winning at varying degrees of RNG. * Pecil is the easiest of the two but is suggested to be defeated last as his arsenals are easily mitigated with resistance/debuffs and even negate some of them with just a dedicated Tauntilator - and this holds true during his Solo phase. *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle. This more apparent and important during Multiplayer but not on Solo. * No one bringing buffs/mitigation/wall/healers?

So try to bring Haste/Protect/Shell-ga to refresh your buffs. Wall and Stat+ effects are safe though. * If a party member is inflicted with Mounting Contempt - Target's Targeting status, Wladislaus will reset its ATB and then pause for 3 seconds, and then unleashes Mounting Contempt - Damage on the party member with Targeting status as an instant action and then reset its ATB. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |150%|150%|150%|150%|150%|150%|150%|150%|150%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Idle Blade|PHY|Single|Physical|-|super massive damage|-| |All|Idle Blade|PHY|AOE|Physical|-|massive damage|-| |All|Ultimate Idle Blade|NAT|AOE|-|-|3000 fixed damage|Auto-hit damage| |All|Mounting Contempt - Target|NAT|Single|-|-|applies Targeting status, Dispel, DEF-only -30%, and RES-only -30% for 10 secs; [1]| |All|Mounting Contempt - Damage|NAT|Single|-|super massive damage|Damage potency increase with each use. [2]| * Notes 1: Mounting Contempt - Target's DEF and RES are tagged as separate debuffs. Thus, you will need a DEF-only and a RES-only buff to overwrite each debuff, leaving your choice of Wall (DEF/RES +200%) safe. Abilities that stack like Protect, Shell, or Wall will not remove then. Targeting status cannot be removed. * Notes 2: Mounting Contempt - Damage will only hit party members with Targeting status. After the attack is used, Targeting status is removed from the party member, even if the attack fails to hit. &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * If you are fast or lucky enough, a party member with Targeting status should probably Block to help mitigate the damage received from Mounting Contempt - Damage, this is consideration that you are already debuffed and had your Protect Dispel-ed by Mounting Contempt - Target. * Leave your Shellga at home. Wladislaus is purely a physical attack, thus, stacking physical mitigation is highly advised here! * Bring HP stocks and/or Stoneskin effects to help mitigate damage from Ultimate Idle Blade. * A source of pBlink and a dedicated Tauntilator will mostly keep you safe from the damages outside of the AOEs and Mounting Contempt - Damage. * Unlike its former Mote dungeon form, Wladislaus is slightly vulnerable to all elements and NOT resistant to them, thus bring your favorite elemental teams and quicky burn it before it slices your party into ribbons! *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe.

Dawn of (Cloud) Strife('s demise from Sephiroth AASB)! Kidding aside, the argued Fest Banner 6/7 - depending if you count the Core banner as such and note that in JP this event occured during Fest - will come at the same time once the Weekly Event starts! So what better way to make people envious and/or share the awesome power of your phat loot by showing off in the Conquest Battles! ;) For this Week's Dissidia Conquest Battle, we are off to face against the 3 protagonist in both Conquest Battles, which only contain the highest difficulty for Part 1 and Part 2... * Part 1: For D120 arena, we fight against Vaan, Ramza and Bartz; Bartz being the usual flurious attacker like the previous battles. * Part 2: Meanwhile, its girl power for D220 arena as Y'shtola, Terra, &amp; Shantotto as they unleash their magical power against our teams, and its elemental attacks galore! As usual, the difficulty for these fights are going ramped up despite their told D120/D220 difficulty, as almost all of the attacks NAT and will hard like the previous Dissidia Conquest Battles. So, no Tauntilate/Grand Cross/Runic tactics for this week, and also probably not a good time to farm gysahl greens/magia for end-game players. :( &amp;nbsp; Just like the last time we had a Dissidia event, I will post the heroes' Arsenal seperately because it will be a cumbersome wall-of-text to overcome, what with incredible amount of attack options that Bartz and Shantotto has on their list. &amp;nbsp; *** [Weekly Event Megathread]() by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Vaan, Ramza, &amp; Bartz (Dissidia)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Vaan, Ramza, &amp; Bartz with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** Mixed but mostly Physical.

The stats are *terrible* even at +++ (67 def, 28 res) but moderate resist isn't usually available on an armor slot and in heavily piercing fights that may not matter."

For this fight, our goal is to deal enough damage to temporarily cripple the X-ATM092 into submission, all the while trying to have everyone escape the fight before it gets back up! Sounds simple right? Yes and no!

Coming out as one of the monster-of-the-week candidates for a certain masked-hero (HENSHIN! I'm sorry I have to say it. XD) genre, the D160/220 arena is being held by the not-insect-kaijin Abaddon, who appears to taken the ""keep it simple"" idea as it causes for highly efficient killing purposes. Do note that in the actual JP timeline/release, this IX event was the last Weekly Event before the actual 4YA fest, which is unlike ours that it has happens AFTER the 4YA fest.

Goodbye Shout, OK pUSBs, and Chains v2! :( * Focus on one target at a time! Unlike the infamous Mandragoras of XII, the Knights of Pluto don't do any party buffs to each other, thus it is better to kill the adds first to reduce the incoming the party is going to take. * Because we've got AASB earlier thanks to the KH collab and everyone who pulled it are using it in high-end fights, this Infernal Conquest Battle should go easier than normal, especially on a party that fields a proper-support to help the AASBs do some incredible havoc against out Infernal-level boss fights. *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe.

For this Infernal MO, we are treated to a fight against the equally infernal Dr. Hojo, along with his diabolical experiments! Like the previous Infernal MO, Dr. Hojo renacts his famous last stand on top of Midgard's Sister Ray from VII, except this is elevated into a more challenging and threatening fight than he did in the actual VII and/or VII Realm Dungeon's D142 Sister Ray battle. &amp;nbsp; *** [JP Boss Guide](URL by /u/spirialis [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Hojo (VII)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 350 (Infernal) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Hojo with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** Mixed, but Phase 3 is mainly physical with scripted magical follow-ups * **Status Effects:** Blind (Bad Rap Sample/Lifeform-Hojo N), Sleep (Heretic Hojo/Lifeform-Hojo N), Poison (Heretic Hojo/Lifeform-Hojo N), Confuse (Heretic Hojo), Doom: 60 (Lifeform-Hojo N), Slow (Lifeform-Hojo N) * **Elements used:** Poison (Bad Rap Sample, Heretic Hojo), Fire (Poodler Sample) * **Break Resistance:** 50% (all of them) * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect (all of them) * **Special Notes** * We fight against Dr. Hojo and his experiments! In this case, the whole Infernal Hojo fight is divided into 3 phases, each with its different quirk and mechanics. I will be dividing it accordingly because they also have different enemy sets per phase. * Due to a large amount of PHY and BLK attacks here, bringing a dedicated Tauntilator and/or Runic/Grand Cross will help relieve your party of the damage and potential status hell that you will be facing on Phase 1 and 2. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Damage Taken (all enemies)** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Phase 1** * We initially fight Hojo, who does nothing for the entire Phase, but will summon a Bad Rap Sample and a Poodler Sample at the same time to fight for him. Hojo will spawn them indefinitely if they are defeated. You only need to defeat Hojo in this Phase! * Bad Rap Sample uses a lot of PHY-based attacks. The poison-elemental ones are ranged physical that can causes Blind and the rest are just plain damage. A dedicated Tauntilator will null everything it throws at you. * Poodler Sample uses a lot of BLK-based fire elemental attacks. A dedicated Runic/Grand Cross uses will null everything it throws at you. &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Phase 1: Hojo)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Capsule|NAT|-|-|-|-|Summons Bad Rap Sample and Poodler Sample| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Phase 1: Bad Rap Sample)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Ultimate Evil Poison|PHY|Single|ranged Physical|Poison|super massive damage|high chance to Blind| |All|Evil Poison|PHY|Single|ranged Physical|Poison|massive damage|high chance to Blind| |All|Ultimate Big Fang|PHY|Single|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|Big Fang|PHY|Single|Physical|-|super massive damage|-| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Phase 1: Poodler Sample)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Fira|BLK|Single|Magical|Fire|super massive damage|-| |All|Ultimate Fira|BLK|Single|Magical|Fire|super massive damage|-| |All|Ultimate Firaga|BLK|Single|Magical|Fire|extreme damage|-| &amp;nbsp; **Phase 2** * Once Phase 1's Hojo is defeated, all of the samples despawn and Hojo mutates into Heretic Hojo, spawning a monstrous Right and Left Arms to help him crush you. Defeat Heretic Hojo and/or the Left Arm to win this Phase! * Whenever the Right Arm is defeated, Heretic Hojo will enter an vulnerable state, suffering a large decrease to his DEF and RES stats. While in this form, Heretic Hojo loses some of the his attacks but gains access to Ultimate Bio Gas instead, and he will remain in this state until the Right Arm respawns 25 seconds later. * The main goal of this phase is to... **1) Ignore the Left Arm (the one closest to your party)**, **2) Kill the Right Arm (the one farthest to your party)**, and **3) Unleash all of your damage attacks on Heretic Hojo to quickly got to Phase 3**. &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Heretic Hojo)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |Default|Bio Gas|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|super massive damage|high chance to Poison| |Default|Attack|PHY|Single, 2-hits RT|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Sleep|BLK|Single|-|-|-|high chance to Sleep| |All|Attack|PHY|AOE|Physical|-|super massive damage|-| |All|Bioga|BLK|AOE|Magical|Poison|extreme damage|-| |All|Confuse|BLK|Single|-|-|-|high chance to Confuse| |All|Counter Bio Gas|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|super massive damage|response to all attacks; high chance to Poison| |Right Arm dead|Ultimate Bio Gas|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|extreme damage|high chance to Poison| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Right Arm/Left)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Absorb MP|NAT|Single|-|-|-|100% chance to reduce an ability's uses by 20% of max uses, rounded up| &amp;nbsp; **Phase 3** * Phase 3 begins with the defeat of Heretic Hojo and/or the Left Arm. Lifeform-Hojo N spawns and uses a turn 1 Doom: 60 on your party. Under this time limit, you must defeat Lifeform-Hojo N to win the fight, or dying trying from the overflow attacks and/or Doom counter! * Make sure you have a dedicated debuffer on this Phase as Hojo likes to chain his attacks into more dangerous ones like RT or AOE Overflow attacks. This is also compounded that the majority of his attacks come with Status Ailments RNG that may make the fight unbearable. Thankfully, most of these can avoided by blinks or dampened by HP Bubbles, and maybe Last Stand! (just beware of the Poison ticks) * Grand Cross will save you from ST Slow and partially from Bioga. &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Lifeform-Hojo N)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |Turn 1|Doom|AOE|-|-|-||auto-hit Doom: 60| |All|Slow|WHT|Single|-|-|-|Low chance to Slow| |All|Counter Attack|PHY|Single, 2-hits RT|Physical|-|massive damage|high chance to Poison| |Default|Combo (1)|NAT|Single, 4-hits RT|Physical|-|massive damage|high chance to Poison| |Default|Ultimate Combo|NAT|Single, 4-hits RT|Physical|-|overflow damage|Forced after Combo (1) is used.| |Default|Combo (2)|NAT|Single, 4-hits RT|Physical|-|massive damage|medium chance to Blind| |Default|Bio Gas|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|extreme damage|Forced after Combo (2) is used. high chance to Poison| |Default|Bioga|BLK|AOE|Magical|Poison|extreme damage|Forced after Bio Gas is used.| |Default|Combo (3)|NAT|Single, 4-hits RT|Physical|-|massive damage|low chance to Sleep| |Default|Rampage|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|super massive damage|Forced after Combo (3) is used.| |Weak|Combo (4)|NAT|Single, 4-hits RT|Physical|-|massive damage|high chance to Poison| |Weak|Ultimate Combo|NAT|Single, 4-hits RT|Physical|-|super massive damage|Forced after Combo (4) is used.| |Weak|Ultima|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|extreme damage|Forced after Ultimate Combo is used.| |Weak|Combo (5)|NAT|Single, 4-hits RT|Physical|-|massive damage|medium chance to Blind| |Weak|Infernal Combo|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|overflow damage|Forced after Combo (5) is used.| |Weak|Combo (6)|NAT|Single, 4-hits RT|Physical|-|massive damage|low chance to Sleep| |Weak|Ultimate Rampage|NAT|AOE, 2-hits|Physical|-|massive damage|Forced after Combo (6) is used.| &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * Bring Astra, Ultra Cure, Esunas, and Blinks!

The fight is serious and humorous at the same time. This is mostly a parody, a reflection, and the enemy AI's actual application of the stuff we are doing to them when multiplayer raiding. XD * Wear Water resist! * Bring Astra and/or Hastega to help counter-act the Sleep and Slow here. * If you can bring it, the 5-star Dancer ability Crushing Tango can and will over-write Cagnazzo's ~~Sentinel's Grimoire~~ Stamp (I'll Defend!) buffs. * Rubicante is kind to us as usual. The best bro amongst Golbez's Four Fiends! :D *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle. This more apparent and important during Multiplayer but not on Solo. * No one bringing buffs/mitigation/wall/healers? Why not try bringing them yourself, you can't win a fight with an entirely DPS team only, especially not with the recent set of Bosses having access to either 1-hit killers or AoE spammers. * Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss tend to have a slightly lower HP, and sometimes, stats. A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3. Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss follows the normal casting time. "

For us lucky (and unlucky) Keepers, the call for battle is once again within our ears as an ancient mechanical terrors has appeared to challenge us... a wild **Omega (XI)** has appeared! Unlike previous the Omega battles, Omega (XI) sports neutral resistance to all elements and will use a bunch highly advanced weaponries to attack us with, these ranged from missiles to lasers befitting his artificial nature of course! Of course, as an extra added challenge, Omega (XI) has Radiant Shield to mess up our strategies (but only on Default phase). Get your parties and friends ready, Omega (XI) represents the pinnacle of ancient and sophisiticated technological weaponry of FFXI, and it comes here to FF Record Keeper to triumph where Omega (V) (and the other event-limited superbosses) has failed. * A curious question to actual XI players: Is this really how Omega (XI) fights in the actual XI game? If this is accurate, I can only say that DeNA did a good job on this, and well played too. *** [JP Boss Guide](URL by /u/spiralis [Episode Cardia megathread](URL by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Omega (XI)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 180 (Ultimate++) and ???

Whenever you deal damage, your hate is increased by 100 * [damage dealt], while if you heal, your hate is increased by 200 * [amount healed]. Your hate value affects who is hit by Pile Pitch and Colossal Blow (whoever has the highest hate will be the target). The good news is both abilities can be mitigated to basically nothing (6% chance) if you wear instant KO accessories. Blinks are also viable, but a bit harder to manage in such. Hectic battle. * When Omega uses Discharger, it gains a version of Radiant Shield (visually indicated by electricity on its body) for 7 seconds that reflects 30% of all damage received back to the attacker. This damage can be reflected by your own Radiant Shield, but reflected damage from your own Radiant Shield doesn't trigger Omega's version. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Ultimate++)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|---|---|---|---|---|:---| |All|Ion Efflux|NAT|Front Row AOE|-|-|-|Ignores Astra; low chance of Paralyze| |All|Rear Laser|NAT|Back Row AOE|-|-|-|Ignores Astra; low chance of Petrify| |Default|Pile Pitch|NAT|Single|-|-|gravity damage|current HP% damage, applies **Dispel**; low chance to Interrupt.

See note 2.| &amp;nbsp; **Notes:** * [1]: Pile Pitch and Colossal Blow's target is dictated by your character's hate value affects. * [2]: Disaster Target Analysis: Applies Full Break -20% debuff on target and self ATK/MAG/DEF/RES +20% Buff for a few seconds to all party members who aren't using Defend. Party members with the Target Analysis status receive 50% increased damage and have the damage dealt by their attacks reduced by 1/3. Additionally, all damage Omega deals is multiplied by (1 + .5 * [number of targets hit by Disaster Target Analysis]) and all damage it receives is divided by the same number. &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * Bringing Full Break is advised here to negate Omega (XI)'s Target Analysis self-buff. * Last Stand is advisable but a form of Regen or CT0 medica are advised for Very Weak phase because Disaster Laser Shower applies Sap. * Because of the countless Dispel Omega (XI) has, it advisable to bring un-Dispel-able effects to help your party survive. Wall and DEF/RES stats buffs will help reduce damage. Try not to bring DEF +X% effects as Weak Phase's Laser Showers will negate and replace that with DEF -20% instead. * Due to Omega (XI)'s Row-based status ailments ignoring Astra, bringing Affliction Break/Resist Accessories will help you avoid those, aside from that one Astra will save you from the other remaining ones. * Instant KO resist accessories are the best choice in negating most of the Pile Pitch and Colossal Blow damage. * Alternatively, Front Row characters should wear Paralyze resist, while Back Row characters should wear Petrify resist. * It is highly advised to leave your BSB at home or use it up early before you push to Phase 3. BSB will replace your Defend command and it is highly advised to defend against Disaster Target Analysis. Being unable to defend against Disaster Target Analysis will escalate the fight to a quick end with Omega (XI) wiping out your party fast. * **Default Phase (100% - 61% HP)** is Omega (XI)'s physical phase and you trying to dance against the Pile Pitch hate mechanics. Nothing dangerous except for the RNG involving Hyper Pulse. Just watch out for its Discharge/Radiant Shield! * **weak Phase (60% - 21% HP)** is Omega (XI)'s debilitate phase and you trying to dance against the Colossal Blow hate mechanics. Astra will be a huge boon against the Blind, Silence, and Paralyze that it will be throwing at your almost every turn this phase. * **Very Weak Phase (&lt; 20% HP)** is Omega (XI)'s overdrive phase where you will engage a DPS race against it. It is VITAL AND IMPORTANT that everyone is must be in defending status before he uses Disaster Target Analysis on his 4th turn. Not being able to defend the attack is basically a party wipe after this point. After Disaster Target Analysis, turn 5 (and every 5 turns after that) will have Omega (XI) throwing Disaster Colossal Blow at your party, while spamming Disaster Laser Shower instead every turn. Try to not to get overwhelmed and try to end the fight as quickly as possible! *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle. This more apparent and important during Multiplayer but not on Solo. * No one bringing buffs/mitigation/wall/healers? Why not try bringing them yourself, you can't win a fight with an entirely DPS team only, especially not with the recent set of Bosses having access to either 1-hit killers or AoE spammers. * Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss tend to have a slightly lower HP, and sometimes, stats. A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3. Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss follows the normal casting time. *** [Solo D180 Omega (XI) Example Setup - Mastery Clear]()"

This fight only reward Gils and more Gils~ *** On-Going: [Breaking the Chain of Sorrow](URL MP Megathread *** &amp;nbsp; Another month, another Infernal, and this ones literal! Before anything, I'd like to say that this is the COOLEST Ifrit I've seen and my most favorite design, BUT... I REALLY HATE this Ifrit's fight mechanics ever since I've encountered this guy as my ""wall to scale"" back in my early days of FFRK (The Lord of Crags, to be specific) and then have to fight him early in Realm Dungeons! So, this one is rather a love-and-hate Ifrit for me, just like how Mote Ifrit was to others. XD Anyhows and anyways, as I said before this month's Infernal fight is **literally INFERNAL**, with Infernal Ifrit potentially raising the bar of D350 difficulty on to another level thru the use of fight gimmicks. Like the previous Infernal bosses before it, Infernal Ifrit and his fight gimmick appears to be copied directly to its actual in-game counter part, I believe this is the Extreme version (I think? please correct me if I got this wrong as I haven't played XIV and only heard this from discussion and/or hearsays) of the Bowl of Embers fight. It has everything down to having accurate XIV fight mechanics (according to what I can gather and wiki) and access to its raid-wiping Extreme Hellfire if you did not meet the safety condition (Kill those Infernal Nails ASAP!!). Kudos to DeNA if they actually get this right as per XIV fight! Enough expository banter, now we dive straight to the actual informations that we can review and I'm going to follow /u/spiralis 's pattern because... I'm not really a fan of this boss fight as preparing, re-writing, imagining, and just thinking about this fight is already causing me PTSD. &gt;_&lt; &amp;nbsp; *** [JP Boss Guide](URL by /u/spiralis [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Ifrit (XIV)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 350 (Infernal) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Ifrit with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** Mixed * **Status Effects:** Interrupt, Sap, Imperil Fire * **Elements used:** Fire * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** * **Special Notes** Copy-pasted as per /u/spiralis notes because its the clearest explanation! * Each phase ends when Ifrit's HP is depleted, or when a certain number of Ifrit's turns have passed. In either case, Ifrit's HP is fully restored and he transitions to the next phase. Phase 7 can only end by depeleting Ifrit's HP, which results in a victory. * At the start of phases 2, 4, and 6 Ifrit will spawn Infernal Nails (number specified in each section). Each nail uses Infernal Surge when destroyed, and when all nails are destroyed Ifrit uses Hellfire (weak version). If you fail to kill all nails by the time Ifrit shifts to his next phase (either by depleting his HP or taking too many turns), Ifrit uses the strong version of Hellfire. * Every 10 seconds, Ifrit uses Inferno Howl as an interrupt on one of your two party members with the highest MND, causing the adjacent characters above and below them to take Searing Wind damage (see Special Attacks) three times at 3-second intervals. [If there's a tie for the highest MND, one character in the tie will be chosen randomly. If there's only a tie for second highest MND, the character will be randomly chosen between the character with highest MND and a randomly chosen character among the ones tied for second-highest MND] &amp;nbsp;

It IS a must to survive this fight! * A form of Last Stand, Regen, and both Blinks will be a great boon in surviving Infernal Ifrit's fiery assault. * When the **Infernal Nails** spawn, drop everything and try to kill them ASAP, failure to do so will cause Ifrit to cast Hellfire (Nails not killed) on that Phase's end to instantly wipe your raid party without any chance of recovery! * I suppose its time for Aria and her USB to shine! Aria's BSB might also work here, but then, she'll get screwed from the Radiant Plume... * This is one of the most gimmicky fights we have... Do your best and good luck! *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle. This more apparent and important during Multiplayer but not on Solo. * No one bringing buffs/mitigation/wall/healers? Why not try bringing them yourself, you can't win a fight with an entirely DPS team only, especially not with the recent set of Bosses having access to either 1-hit killers or AoE spammers. * Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss tend to have a slightly lower HP, and sometimes, stats. A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3. Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss follows the normal casting time. "

(Nothing I can do with my end due to less than stellar network coverage and such is a problem when one lives high in the mountains.) Moving on... This week's Weekly Event challenge and Conquest Battle is brought upon by the World of FFIX!! With an almost not-FFI setting with more twist and quirks, this world brings us the anchor-equipped Hill Gigas for our D80/D120 Conquest Battle as the first half, then Taharka drops by to give us some freezy-blowy action for our D160/220 Conquest Battle. For this week being a Torment bringer, the Conquest Battle bosses bring in some simple mechanics as they desperately hinder us, though they can be a total push over to properly-equipped raiding parties or ones that are bringing the right elements together. ;) &amp;nbsp; *** [JP Boss Guide](URL by /u/spirialis [Weekly Event Megathread](URL by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Hill Gigas (IX)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Hill Gigas with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** completely Physical except for a magical AOE attack * **Status Effects:** Poison * **Elements used:** Poison * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Slow, Interrupt, Reflect * **Special Notes** * Hill Gigas has a chance to self-heal when its HP gets low. * Wear Poison element and/or status ailment resist to resist either or both effects of the Poison Gas attack. * Tauntilators will completely negate all of the its physical attacks &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Bash|PHY|Single|Physical|-|medium damage|-| |All|Hip Hop|PHY|Single|Physical|-|large damage|-| |All|Poison Gas|NAT|AOE|Magical|Poison|normal damage|medium chance to Poison| |All|Curage|WHT|Self|-|-|-|Recovers HP| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Taharka (IX)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Taharka with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** 100% Magical in Normal Form, 100% Physical in Flattened Form * **Status Effects:** n/a * **Elements used:** Ice (only in Normal Form) * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect * **Special Notes** * Each time Taharka's ATB fills (with the exception of the first time), it has a 25% chance of shifting forms between Normal and Flattened. This does not reset its ATB, allowing it to start casting an attack from its new form immediately. * Taharka has its Defense stat increased by a large amount whenever it is in Flattened Form. * **Personal musing:** Looks like Taharka and Isgebind (from the recent XIV event) didn't get the ""Boss Improvement"" notice and programme to bring their A-games for Conquest Battles and brought out their standard PHY/BLK moves from the yester-years instead.

Much of Taharka attacks are coded are either BLK or PHY and only Ultimate Chop is tagged as NAT. * Considering that Taharka increases its Defense stat during Flattened Form... burn it with your strongest Fire spells just like the recent Lord Ochu! * Fire/Wind teams who are running Fire/Wind Chains and/or Fire/Wind-based USBs may wish to extend their legs and go on a rampage against Taharka! Both Fire and Wind element are excellent choices in running a CM-style party because Magus said: ""Play with Fire and you get burned!"". ""You"" = ""Taharka"" in this case. &gt;:D *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe.

Of Nightmares and Torments, **Infernal Long Gui** returns with even more cheesier and trickier ways to defeat our heroes in many ways that it could not do efficiently before, such is life and there is enough to cause much wide-spread dispear across the digital land. So how do we defeat? *insert obligatory Star Wars reference here on how to destroy AT-ATs* Erm, nope, that's not it. For once again (in a month), our very much unused Poison elemental and Poison status effects are once again relevant, even if brief or gimmicky. At least Thief(I), Leila, Edgar, Kefka, Quistis, Vivi (if you have old tech), Marcus, and Thancred can unleash their poisonous rage upon this giant disaster of a turtle!

120,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"My experience with Celes LD (USB, BSB1/2, OSB)",39,9f8ly3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/9f8ly3/my_experience_with_celes_ld_usb_bsb12_osb/,2018-09-13 01:12:04,"Good news everyone! Once again it's late (well, early) and I have a desire to wax poetic about a waifu of mine. Naturally, this leads into another exciting(?) installment of ""My experience with..."" the series where I talk about my experience with various characters, their LD's, and soul breaks. For those interested in my previous installments, they can be found at the following links: [Fujin!](URL [Agrias!](URL [Refia!](URL [Relm!](URL [Ayame!](URL [Zell!](URL [Bartz!](URL [Rem!](URL Today, I wanted to focus on that most perfect of waifu's, Celes Chere. As beautiful as she is kind and one of the two holders of a ""runic"" effect (the other being everyone's favorite evil tree Exdeath) she has a unique Legend Dive that plays well with imperil teams and allows her to keep her runic effect up more easily as long as you're regularly hitting a vulnerability. She also rocks a leotard, cleans up nicely in formal wear, and has a voice so sweet she can drive a man to kidnap. **So, who is this most waifuist of waifus?** I'm *so* glad you asked. FFRK classifies her as a ""rune knight"" and she fits comfortably in the role of a physical spellblade dps with a side of knight, white magic (4-star record dive) and black magic. She has a sky-high resistance stat, the highest in game, making her ideal for any kind of magic tanking scenarios even without one of her runic effects active. As a trade off, her defense is rather low for someone who has access to 5-star knight abilities, but that can be easily remedied with a high def piece of armor or shield and the right suite of buffs. However, tanking, at least in the traditional ""soak damage"" sense isn't what Celes is about. Her runic effect (technically ""high"" runic), found on her BSB2, USB and SSB Indomitable Blade (aka Indonesian Blade) causes all single target non-NAT-type offensive magic to auto-target her and restore a single hone to any skills she has for each hit she takes. She also absorbs non-NAT aoe attacks, which doesn't do much for her allies but at least saves a little on healing. Practically speaking, this gives Celes both power and utility. With her runic effects, she can act in a defensive capacity while at the same time boosting her own offensive capabilities. **Hey Quor, get to it, I'm here for soul break and legend dive discussion!** I like that eager attitude. Her legend dive is nothing particularly unusual, at least until you get to her LM2. You get your standard suite of stat boosts and damage boosts, with an LM1 that increases spellblade damage and your typical passive dmg boosts to spellblades. Her LM2 is, as far as I'm aware, currently unique in the game, and it provides a large boost to soul break gauge generation when attacking an enemy with an element they are vulnerable to. This boost stacks with other forms of gauge generation boosts, specifically stuff like Ace Striker, Knight's Charge and Lionheart. Combining her LM2 and Ace Striker with a 5-star ability that hits vulnerability generally means she will have a soul break available by her third or fourth turn when you factor incoming damage. That's about on par with what you would expect from Ace Striker plus Lifesiphon. Given her lack of 4-star combat access, the message is clear; her LM2 is a way of making up for her lack of Lifesiphon access, and it excels mightily in this regard. Of course, if there are no vulnerabilities to hit, or she is somehow relegated to relying on bio or dark damage, then the relative value of her LM2 goes down by quite a bit. But you don't really take Celes for bio/dark-weak fights unless you either *really* need her runic (and you don't have one of Exdeath's) or you just have no other option as far as characters go. **How about those soul breaks?** Of the set that I have, three (her SSB, USB and BSB2) come with a runic effect. Her first BSB, Maria's Song, comes instead with an en-holy effect (her only en-element effect currently) and an atk/mag buff for her and her party. I'll go into more depth about the uses of her BSB1 a bit later, but for now we're going to focus on the thing that makes her (almost) unique; her runic soul breaks. For those that don't know, the ""runic"" term comes from the original Final Fantasy 6 game, where Celes' unique skill is called Runic, and would drag single target spells to her, negating their damage and restoring some of her MP in the process. Given that no such thing as a NAT-type attack existed in FF6, her Runic allowed her to soak all kinds of insane stuff, and generally trivialized parts of the game if you knew what you were doing. Likewise, runic effects in FFRK can trivialize a lot of stuff in game, which is part of why we have all these damnable NAT-type attacks. Despite this weakness though, her and Exdeath's runics still see some use, such as against the Magus Sister's in the current Crystal Tower. But despite these advantages, the main draw of her BSB2 and USB are not the runic effects they bring, but rather the way they open up Celes' damage options. Her second burst, Invincible Blade, is a pretty standard 8-hit single target entry for holy/ice that adds her runic effect and provides a moderate atk and small def buff to her, on top of her normal burst mode stat boosts. Her cmd1 is a 4-hit single target holy/ice that boosts spellblade damage by a small amount for 2 turns, and her cmd2 is a 2-hit aoe holy/ice atk/def bargain, boosting her atk and lowering her def. The conclusions are easy to draw here; while her BSB1 is a nice hybrid buff with en-holy (and fire/holy ice/holy 4-hit cmds) her BSB2 is a self-buffing masterpiece that allows her to fit easily on any team. She leans slightly more to ice and holy, but thanks to her spellblade access and the buff on her cmd1, she can work on any element as long as it doesn't absorb ice and holy. Most importantly though, she can slot into a magical team thanks to all her self buffing, and with the quadstrike spellblades and her LMR (25% w-cast spellblade) she can still put out meaningful damage despite lacking an en-element. So as far as bursts go, Celes has some of the better ones, bringing useful buffs and remaining situationally viable even in this USB-driven world we live in. However, if you should luck into her USB, you're in for a real treat, as this brings with it a mighty increase in her power. Whetted Blade as it's called, is a 10-hit wind/holy/ice/NE entry with runic and a moderate spellblade damage boost (30% increase) and spellblade ability double, meaning all spellblade abilities uses cast twice per turn and use two hones per turn (one for each cast). For the knowledgeable, the advantages with this USB are obvious. The biggest of course is the ability double, which effectively doubles her per-turn damage. The next big thing is the ability damage boost. A 30% increase is almost as much as an en-element (which is 50%) and goes a long way towards making up for her lack of en-element. The ability double and ability boost really open up Celes' ability to meaningfully contribute damage with 6 out of 9 possible elements. If there's a 4-hit spellblade for it, then it's possible for Celes to deal &gt;70k in damage to the target each turn. Even omni-resist bosses can feel the pain with Flare Strike. While she won't hit quite as hard thanks to the lack of vulnerabilities, the 2x5-hits on Flare Strike go a long way, especially if you're able to RW Noctis USB. Finally, her OSB is a pretty standard dual element (wind/holy) single target overflow attack, with an iteration of damage based on the number of magical attacks she has absorbed via runic, with four thresholds for damage. Practically speaking, it's best to treat this like your average OSB. She gets more value out of it with her BSB1 en-holy, and the lack of NE damage means if you won't be hitting holy/wind then you're better off using her gauge on a re-cast of her USB if that's possible. But in a pinch, damage is damage. Just remember that it lacks NE! **What's the practical use of all of this?** The math is pretty simple; her LM2 boosts gauge generation when you're hitting vulnerability, allowing you to hit that soul break faster and buff her damage/absorb enemy spells. That's really it. And yeah, on it's own it's a bit underwhelming. If all you have is her default soul break, then what even is the point? Well, there isn't one really, unless she's your waifu of course. The real star for her is the USB, with her BSB2 as a solid consolation prize. If you should happen to pull either of those on the upcoming FF6 RoP, then you're in luck, because you scored a strong attacker with unique utility who can fit on a myriad of teams. If you nabbed her USB, then you've got a top-tier spellblader, almost on par with Bartz and Squall. What Celes lacks in specialized spellblading is made up for by her ability to work on any team as long as you have the hones. Furthermore, her damage under USB is often more consistent thanks to the guaranteed ability double. Squall and Bartz can spike higher, but Celes will always yield that same reliable 8-hits-per-turn, with a chance at 12 hits if you have her LMR. This also gives her chain-building power to rival that of Bartz. Yes, Bartz with USB1 can certainly build a chain way faster than Celes, but it's all RNG. You might get lucky and have 28 hits added in a single turn, or you might win the reverse lottery and get 5 turns in a row of 5 hits each. Meanwhile, Celes is over in the corner, putting in a solid 8 per turn. She doesn't have time for your random chance. She's a general, not some opera floozy. But even if all you have is her BSB2, you're still doing pretty good. It takes a bit more time to set things up, but her cmd1 provides almost the same boost as her USB does, and while you'll lack the bonus damage from the ability double, you'll get a lot of self-buffing in return. USB Celes wants to run with a buff like OK pUSB, whereas BSB2 Celes doesn't give a damn about your atk buffs; she can buff herself just fine thank you. However, neither will say no to a good crit fix. Ladies love crit fixes. **Ok, but what if I don't have one of those runic SB's for her?** Well, in that case, that sucks, but it doesn't mean she's trash or anything. Even if all you have is her BSB1, you still get a good hybrid atk/mag boost alongside her only en-element buff (holy) which enables a solid amount of damage from knight skills like Assault Saber, and even aoe holy in the form of Aegis Strike. She's no Marche or Orlandeau, but her 4-star white magic access coupled with the boostga on her BSB1 gives her a lot of slot-saving utility. You can also use her standard spellblade suite to hit all kinds of vulnerability, including bio, or lean on her 4-star black magic to hit dark. She'll never be anywhere near a ""true"" mage, but it's possible to utilize her skill set, even sans-soul breaks, to great effect. Hell, even her default SB provides a buff to resistance that stacks with quite a few other buffs and can still be relevant in contemporary content. **And your conclusion?** Absolutely 100% full dive. Everyone should do it. The whole dive. Even if you have nothing for her and you're short on 5-star motes. Just fucking do it. Of course, I'm biased as fuck because I've probably put over 700 mithril towards getting shit for her ever since she first appeared and she's always been my waifu ever since Locke first stumbled upon her as a prisoner in South Figaro and she helped heal his wounded heart and then survived the World of Ruin and got the Team Back Together and defeated Evil Clown Nietzsche with the power of love and friendship, so I will attempt to be a bit more objective. Do you have her USB? Absolutely dive her. She's reliable and versatile, and has the benefit of being a steady source of chain-building while also always benefiting from the chain thanks to her own lack of en-element. The sooner you get her USB online the better, and while her USB is awesome, it's generally not worth using MM or DMT as her RM over slotting those on healers or buffers. Personally, I prefer Gathering Storm to maximize her uptime under USB and to get her into USB ASAP, but +weakness or spellblade w-cast also work well. Do you have her BSB2? She might be worth a dive. If you're looking for generalist power and utility, you can't really go wrong. Especially if you're a newer player, her BSB2 is a huge power spike, and she can form the core of your A-squad with her ability to bring 4-star white magic and heavy-hitting spellblade or knight abilities. Do you have her BSB1 (and only her BSB1)? Eh...maybe not dive her. Thanks to the atk/mag buff on her BSB1 and the fact that Hastega is now an actual spell that can be used, you can make an argument for slotting DMT/MM on her and opening with her BSB1 for the party buff. In that case, the benefit from the LM2 is largely wasted, as repeated casts of her BSB1 have far less value than repeated casts of her BSB2 or USB. A partial dive may work, but if the primary use of her BSB1 is for the atk/mag buff, then I would advise holding off on throwing any motes her way. Again, waifu dives being the exception. **So overall, how would you say her USB and LD have worked out for you?** From a completely objective perspective, pretty damn well. She's a core part of my sub-30 Middy team, is a huge source of both single target and aoe damage in the FF6 Neo Torment, and sees use on my realm clearing squad thanks to her ability to reliably hit *every* element (which is great for all those stupid target scores that come up every now and then). She plays amazingly well with imperilers, as they allow her to stack soul gauge and keep unloading with her USB/BSB2 (and OSB if applicable), and synergizes well with any chain that isn't dark or holy. And even holy works pretty well thanks to her 5-star knight access, doubly so if you're using her BSB1 since you'll get an en-holy to further boost your knight damage. I would go so far as to call USB-Celes an ""instant dive,"" and even BSB2-Celes makes a strong argument for a full dive. My only regret is that I have not yet acquired her LMR. One day, my sweet, it will be ours."

Why not try bringing them yourself, you can't win a fight with an entirely DPS team only, especially not with the recent set of Bosses having access to either 1-hit killers or AoE spammers. * Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss tend to have a slightly lower HP, and sometimes, stats. A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3. Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss follows the normal casting time. *** [Solo D220 Helgenish Example Setup - Mastery Clear]()"
122,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Trepies Forever! - A Quistis Primer,40,9g6ryk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/9g6ryk/trepies_forever_a_quistis_primer/,2018-09-16 11:23:50,"#Intro The former SeeD instructor, child prodigy, and best Triple Triad player in Balamb Garden is storming back into the scene with her IC3 legend dive, an unusual Glint, and a potent buff USB ([Shockwave Pulsar next??](URL She lacks specialization in any one area, but offers a utility mage skillset that allows her to function similar to Onion Knight in many teams. In some ways, a fully decked out Quistis might have too much to do(!!), and so this guide is intended to spell out some options and compare her to other similar characters. TL;DR - You can use her like Onion Knight with slightly more defensive SBs. USB is great. LRM is great. Dive is great. Glint is hard to use early in fight, but works like an instant medica on the cheap later. ---- #Capabilities Overview Let's start with a quick refresher on her stats, abilities, dive, and SBs. At lvl 99 with a full dive, her stats are fairly average for a mage, with slightly lower mag and slightly higher mnd. I've included reference numbers for OK and Ace, who are two characters close to her niche: * HP: 6840 - average (OK: 8160, Ace: 7032) * Mag: 271\* - slightly below average (OK: 279, Ace: 295) * Mnd: 181 - above average (OK: 227, Ace: 159) * Spd: 149 - average (OK: 175, Ace: 165) * Def: 144 - average (OK: 165, Ace: 153) * Res: 211 - slightly above average (OK: 158, Ace: 207) When record dived, Quistis can use 6* Black, 4* White, and 4* Support. Her dive offers mostly black mage style buffs and including the typical minor + mod Sleep resist typical to Black Magic users. * BLK - 18% (OK: 15%, Ace: 9%) * WHM - 3% (OK: 9%, Ace: 0%) * Other - 0% (Ace: fire 12%) For a comparison to a more typical mage, Rinoa has 18% BLK and 9% summon, and Terra has 9% BLK, 9% summon, 12% fire. Her Legend Materia are: * LM1 - Reduce damage from BLK 10% * LM2 - Instant Cast 3 + Haste * LRM - 25% dual cast Black Magic abilities Lastly, she has access to 4 utility SBs and 2 damaging SB, offering a potential +60 MAG total. Utility: * USB ""Kingsguard"" - party +30% atk/mag/res 25s, haste, 2k stock * Glint ""Pride of the King"" - instant pro/shell/30% stoneskin * SSB ""Cerberus"" - party haste, fastzap 3 (papalymo SSB minus mag buff) * SSB ""Mighty Guard"" - party haste, shell, hi-regen Damage: * OSB ""Doomtrain"" - m39.6 bio/non with 15% blind/confuse/poison/silence * BSB ""Hail to the Queen"" - m15.04/8 bio/non, en-bio, with typical 4-hit cmd1 and 2-hit aoe bargain cmd2 \*Note: Enlir's spreadsheet shows Quistis at 203 mag + 18 RD + 40 LD = 261 mag. My Quistis has five +10 SBs, no crystal water spent, and 321 mag with everything unequipped = 271 mag base. If someone can account for that 10 point difference I would appreciate it. Anyone with a level 99 non-dived Quistis able to check if she still has 203 base mag? ---- #Roles From a practical standpoint, characters rarely fill only a single role on a team, but for the purpose of comparing with other characters I tried to isolate a few specific areas for discussion. 1. Boostga + off-dps 2. Boostga + off-heal 3. Straight dps with minor utility 4. Bio main dps 5. Non-elemental ## Boostga + off-dps I think this is her strongest role, so I will cover it first. This is the role the Onion Knight plays on many teams, utilizing the appropriate USB and his versatile elemental coverage. It's especially common on chain teams where it's often more valuable to have more attackers than it is to use an entrustbot. Other characters with this role could include Curilla, Minfilia, or Ramza on holy teams, Reks on lightning or ice teams, Tyro (with buffs), or anyone else who has a party buff that they sacrifice a damage RM in order to cast immediately in the fight. Chain holders effectively work this way as well. Quistis has a significant advantage in the role of boost provider in the form of her LM2: IC3 + haste. Instant cast at the beginning of a fight enables faster clears and allows single characters to cover more of the defensive needs of the party. In total, there are only 10 characters with access to an IC LM or LRM that have significant party buffs and access to damaging ability schools. ####IC3 + Haste LM2: 1. Montblanc - SSB MAG/MND haste - BLM6 DNC5 2. Morrow - SSB ATK/MAG protect - CEL6 SPB5 COM4 SUP6 2. Quistis - USB ATK/MAG/RES haste 2k stock - BLM6 WHM4 SUP4 3. Zack - CSB ATK/Crit wind chain - COM6 CEL6 SPB3 SUP3 ####IC1 + Haste LRM: 1. Echo - BSB MAG/RES 40% heal - BLM6 WHM4 DNC5 2. Sazh - USB MAG/DEF/RES haste astra, BSB ATK/MAG self ic2 - MCH5 SH5 (shooter) COM2 SUP6 3. Snow - CSB ice chain 2k stock, BSB ATK/MAG haste - CEL6 KNT5 MNK5 COM2 ####IC2 LRM: 1. Tyro - USB DEF/RES pro/shell haste - YEAH 2. OK - USB ATK/crit haste self EX, USB MAG/MND/RES haste fastzap3, BSB ATK/MAG haste - COM6 CEL6 NIN5 BLK6 WHM6 SUP6 ####IC1 + full ATB LRM: 1. Ramza - CSB ATK holy chain, USB ATK/MAG/DEF IC1, Shout - KNT6 SUP6 COM4 NIN4 BRD3 Only four of these (Tyro, OK, Quistis, Sazh) have access to all of: Haste, Hybrid atk/mag, Multi-element attacks, wrath, and Quistis alone has the IC3 + Haste LM. Quistis and OK are the only characters in this group with dual-cast LM/LRMs. It's worth noting that there are certainly other potent buff + off-dps options who lack instant cast, but ultimately they usually have to compete with Onion Knight and I think Tyro, Sahz, and now Quistis are the best ones to do so for most teams. It's worth noting that wrath is a little obsolete with access to 6* BLM against vulnerable targets, but this is less for for IC3 characters who can effectively replace MM with Ace Striker if necessary. #### Quistis as Boostga+dps Pros / cons Pros: * IC3+H is the strongest of the accelerating LMs * Works well on both physical and magical teams * Access to all damage types (including non/bio) except holy/dark * Dualcast LRM * Decent mage stats Cons: * Buff SBs contribute little offensively besides atk/mag buffs * More limited weapon access than OK * Poor access to holy/dark * No MND buff #### Example build Simple to include in elemental chain teams. Gear for MAG and/or elemental damage. Carry Meltdown or Vortech with a flex slot or backup chain-ga/ja. USB, LRM + LM2. Glint for optional emergency stoneskin buff. (See Kraken, Isgebind below) ##Boostga + off-heal Quistis is not as capable of a backup healer as Onion Knight without access to WHM6, but she does have some advantages as well. Some other characters well-suited to this role include Tyro, Echo, as well as a number of 'real' healers with party buff SBs like Deuce and Sarah (whose USB is the same as Quistis, just trading RES for Shell) that pack high MND and dual-cast white RMs. Pros: * Her USB is pleasantly defensive, with it's 30% RES buff and 2k stock. Recasting the USB provides a nice little medica to the team that is useful even if they're at full health. * Aside from its pro/shell usage, her glint is actually a decent defensive tool. Instant cast 30% 'heal' that is still useful if the team is at full health, and it only costs 1 bar so you can still fit it in between USB casts. * Even without her glint, she has whm4 and can instant cast pro or shell on turn 2. * She may sufficiently improve your defensive capabilities with her USB and/or Glint so she can serve as an off-heal and still carry some black magic. * Can instantly rebuff both pro/shell vs. dispelling enemies. * Fast for a healer. Cons: * USB + wrath-&gt;Glint is a little too slow on hard content, so if you're using Quistis for USB, you may still end up carrying pro/shell. * Mediocre mind for a healer and no WHM5/6 access limits sustained healing. * Stoneskin slightly slows soul gauge progress. #### Example build Fully dived Quistis with her USB whip and decent hat or bracer can get near 300 MND, which is more than enough for Haste and pro/shell if you want to carry BLM. Both her glint Stoneskin and USB 2k stock effects are not mind-dependent, allowing her to fill this role partially while still gearing for damage. If you want to actually have her cast curaja, she also has dagger/staff/rod access, so can be easily geared for mind. Carry either wrath, pro/shell, or 6* black depending on specifics of the fight and whether you're trying to manage an early glint. Realistically, I would expect most fights end up with Quistis and the WHM carrying pro/shell unless some other buff provider is already covering Haste and Quistis can afford to delay her own USB until turn 4 (leading with Glint -&gt; Wrath -&gt; Wrath -&gt; USB). LM1/LM2 if no black magic going on, otherwise perhaps consider LRM instead of LM1. (See Tiamat below) ##Straight dps / minor utility I consider this to be the role Quistis has in common with Ace. Features they both share: * Able to fill a defensive hole with WHM4+ * Instant cast to quickly deploy utility and begin dpsing * Doesn't require an entrust * Sacrifices some damage for additional utility but otherwise shells it out Ace fills this role on my Isgebind team by casting Protect, using Valigarmanda to quickly charge his own soul gauge, and providing a pblink on his BSB entry. He has no dual cast and no en-fire, so doesn't outdamage the other characters, but still can carry a damage RM and is a strong contributor. This is similar to the first role discussed, but without leading with her USB. If Quistis isn't carrying her USB, she's easily able to handle pro/shell, RM wall, pop off the magicite at 10s, and still have ability slots to spare for damage or whatever else you need. There's not always time to use both USB and Glint, but alone it is a solid slot-saver that allows Quistis to still bring more damage to the fight than a typical utility character. Pros: * Can bring pro/shell to fight without using any ability slots. * Contribute elemental damage to most elements. * On gen2 chain teams, spending full SB for a second boostga not necessary. * Can wrath or cast into glint to save MM/DM for someone else. Cons: * May not have anything to DO with accumulated soul gauge (though you can always dump it into OSB if you have it!) * Unable to contribute as much damage to physical teams if they don't have a hybrid buff. * Using IC3 to build gauge by casting BLM6 can often be a waste because no buffs are up at the beginning of the fight. You can use Wrath instead, but then you are spending a slot on it and it's not much faster. The eternal quandary. You can wrath-&gt;glint with a single wrath if you give up damage RM for Ace Striker. #### Example build On a gen2 chain team, Quistis could cast rm wall, wrath, glint, healer casts Hastega, and then Quistis simply moves to casting BLM6. Alternately, Quistis could dump wrath and either manually cast pro or shell, or just start BLM6 spam immediately into Glint. Gear will depend on your goal, but I would expect most setups to be geared for MAG and use one BLM6 ability and one whatever else you need. Appropriate damage RM + LRM + LM2 + Glint. ##Bio main dps This is an old using old tech that gets going a lot faster with IC3 + Haste. One of the main problems with Quistis's BSB-&gt;OSB combo before is that it takes awhile to get going without entrusts. No longer! Nothing really insightful to say here, since this isn't something that we actually NEED anywhere, but Quistis and Edgar are the only two characters with en-bio -&gt; OSB spam, and it's still theoretically on the table for Quistis, especially with someone else to help cover cast time using ACM or some other source of fastzap. Legend sphere bonuses to black magic and the LRM also provide some additional boosts to this setup over its earlier incarnations. Go out there and win that one fight with a poison weak enemy! #### Example Build OSB whip. Chain Biora, wrath. BSB, OSB. LRM, LM2. Trepies Forever RM! ##Non-elemental dps Quistis isn't amazing at non, but she's not bad either. She can dual-cast flare and both her BSB and OSB have a non-elemental component. All her dive buffs affect non-elemental damage just as much as anything else. If, for whatever reason, you're looking for a magic user or a buff-provider on a non-elemental team, you could certainly do worse. #### Example Build Non users suck at WHM, so Quistis is probably covering protect and then carrying flare or something. Maybe leading with USB depending on team. Alternately, she could aim for a wrath-into BSB build like above, buffing herself with cmd2 and then using cmd1 spam. Realistically, this probably isn't going to happen often, since gen2 chain field bonuses make it mostly worthless to use non teams in most cases, but who knows! ---- # What Order to Cast If you're trying to figure out whether you can use both USB and glint, consult the tables below. Calculated times on the first 5 turns assuming 149 speed, ic3 + haste, and 0.2s input delay. ## USB + Glint If you really want to use both of these, your two choices are USB first or Glint first. From a pure efficiency standpoint, saving the glint until your IC3 is used up saves the most time. Assuming Memento Mori RM and casting 6* BLK against a vulnerability: Order | Turn 1 | Turn 2 | Turn 3 |Turn 4 | Turn 5 ---|---|----|----|----|---- USB, Voltech x2, Glint, Voltech | 1.08 | 3.03 | 4.98 | 6.94 | 10.7 Glint, Voltech x2, USB, Voltech | 1.08 | 3.03 | 4.98 | 9.44 | 13.2 If you're trying to use wrath + ace striker you can cast your USB on your 3rd IC and get pro/shell at 10.5. This is the most efficient way to get both up if you want someone else to use MM, but delaying Glint until 10.5s is risky. Alternately, you could cast glint before the USB if someone else covers haste, getting proshell at 3s but delaying your USB all the way to 13s. Order | Turn 1 | Turn 2 | Turn 3 |Turn 4 | Turn 5 ---|---|----|----|----|---- Wrath x2, USB, Wrath, Glint | 1.08 | 3.03 | 4.98 | 8.6 | 10.5 Wrath, Glint, Wrath x2, USB | 1.08 | 3.03 | 4.98 | 9.44 | 13.0 Note: Practically speaking if you bring both USB and Glint into the fight, you lose a nontrivial amount of time selecting the desired choice from the SB menu. I think it's worth it, but it may impact your options for integrating Glint into your startup. In most cases, I brought Glint to use as backup Stoneskin, but did not rely on it for pro/shell. YMMV ---- # Practical Examples I decided to try Quistis out on a variety of teams that might otherwise have used Onion Knight to see how they felt. ##Kraken - Physical Team * Kain (CSB, Cyclone Bolt, Lightning Dive, MM) * Lightning (USB, TQS, Scholar's Boon) * Quistis (USB, Glint, Voltech, Dr mog) * Curilla (USB, Protect, Curaja, Knight Captain RM) * Y'shtola (BSB, Shell, Curada, Gathering Storm) * Fabula Guardian / Hydra Clear time: [23.67s](URL (new personal best!) Quistis casts both her USB and the RM while others pro/shell. Damage is a little lower early in the fight due to Quistis USB's weaker physical buff that OK pUSB, but once Curilla activated around 11s everyone is near cap, including Quistis's Voltech. Had Y'shtola cast Hydra in TG mode, so hp got a bit low. Used glint as a panic button stoneskin near the end of the fight, but didn't really need it, since the ultimate defense is a dead magicite. ##Isgebind - Mage Team * Ace (BSB, Valigarmanda, Protect, Fire RM) * Krile (CSB, Mana's Paean, Chain Fire, MM) * Terra (USB, Wrath, Chain Fire, Scholar's Boon) * Quistis (USB, Meltdown, Dr Mog) * Deuce (BSB, ACM, Curada, Gathering Storm) * Fabula Guardian / Mom Bomb Clear time: [23.74s](URL Mage team, so no damage loss from OK mUSB. The hp stock on Quistis USB means Deuce has no problem leading with ACM and recasting it once later. Between ACM and Fire CSB, lots of fast casts. Ended up slightly slower than with OK, since he carries Entrust in his second slot and can enable a Terra ASB nuke finish a few seconds earlier than this clear. ##Tiamat - Hybrid Team * Quistis (USB, Glint, Voltech, Protect, MM) * Penelo (USB, Curada, Shell, Gathering Storm) * Squall (USB, Snowspell, LS, Ice RM) * Rinoa (CSB, Chain Ice, Dr Mog) * Ayame (BSB, Hailstorm, LS, Sword damage RM) * Fabula Guardian / Wendigo Clear time: [26.83s](URL Took a few runs to figure out the right order. For this build, Quistis casts Wendigo at 10.0s, then uses her next turn to Glint (this is where Penelo starts to get behind on heals). This was my fastest team yet, which meant the damage was coming faster than Penelo's USB charged, so I ended up using my last 2 glint charges to dampen two of the attacks in the Phase 3 enrage, with Penelo's USB blinking another. I can't give Quistis too much credit for this team's success, since it also benefited from LRMs for both Squall and Rinoa that really helped speed things up. ##Ultima Weapon d260 - CM team * Quistis (USB, Glint, Voltech, Wrath, MM) * Rinoa (BUSB, Valigarmanda, Chain Ice, Ice RM) * Squall (USB, SSS, Sword RM) * Selphie (SSB, Curada, Multi Break, Gathering Storm) * Laguna (CSB, Freezing Snipe, Frost Offering, Dr Mog) * Divine Veil Grimoire / Wendigo AKA - I irationally whaled for Quistis USB, so let's kill d260 CM using entirely relics from this banner (except dreamstage). Divine Veil Grimoire means no one has to protect, so Selphie can use breakdown dance and Quistis can just go from USB right into Voltech. My strategy for Pillar of Light was to give Squall a HP trinket and then use Glint to stoneskin him before Pillar. It worked for the first pillar, but Selphie SSB isn't good enough on its own to keep everyone healed up evenly, so I just ate the second pillar and used Rinoa's Brave command to nuke him. ---- # Summary If you're looking for a versatile team buff on a character that can add both damage and defense to physical teams, magical teams, or hybrid teams, you could do a lot worse than Quistis. Her IC3 dive and new SBs make her a fast, slightly more defensive version of Onion Knight. She's also cuter. Her USB is definitely the centerpiece of her new playstyle, but the Glint and LRM enhance her capabilities significantly as well. Lots of fun, would irrationally whale for relics again. But not for awhile. I got everything I wanted in [this pull](URL but there were [a lot](URL that came [before it](URL"

While asleep, the Fat Moogle will gradually recover HP and then transitions to Deep Sleep after few turns, where he will recover more HP. * When awakened from Deep Sleep, the Fat Moogle will immediately use Ultimate Crush on your party, an AOE DEF-piercing physical attack. * On every turn when it is awake, the Fat Moogle will become stronger, eventually gaining access to Ultimate Moogle Attack to deal massive damage and Interrupting your party. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|Tackle|PHY|AOE|Physical|-|super massive damage|-| |All|Crush|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|Ultimate Moogle Attack|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|extreme damage|medium chance to Interrupt| |All|Ultimate Crush|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|piercing damage|Ignores DEF| &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * Fat Moogle only uses physical attacks.

A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3.

While the event is mostly straightforward, our Weekly Conquest Battles bring some skullduggery of their own, we are to face D80/120 Plague and D160/220 Geryon (gasp!). In D80/120, Plague either keeps itself busy buffing or attacking you, with some Doom counters and Slow-ing on the sidelines. Meanwhile, D160/220 Geryon applies various status hell upon your party across the fight, all the while changing elemental weaknesses to keep you on your toes. Either way, Astra will shut down most of these problems, but get ready to restart or frustrated from these 2 should RNG not go on your way. &amp;nbsp; *** [JP Boss Guide](URL by /u/spiralis [Weekly Event Megathread](URL by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Plague (IV)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Plague with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** 100% Physical * **Status Effects:** Doom: 60, Slow * **Elements used:** n/a * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Slow, Reflect, Blind, Sap, Interrupt * **Special Notes** * Casts Condemn on everyone at the start of the fight. * Is capable of buffing itself with Protect, Shell, and Haste.

You may opt not to bring Protectga as Geryon will only use his only ST physical in Phase 1. * Summons are good way to avoid triggering Counter Curse Elegies! Valigarmanda on Phase 1 and 2 will do wonders, while Neo Bahamut on Phase 3 instead, come here Alphinaud USB! * Affliction Break and Astra are your best tools to prevent status ailments from sticking to your party. Having both will greatly reduce the frustrating RNGs that Geryon can induced. * If Geryon still follows the past U++/A+ fight script, Slow resist will be the best accessory options for your party, this is due to the frequency of Counter Curse Elegy in the later phases where Geryon will almost always use Counter Curse Elegy EVERY time. Alternative, Sleep resist is the alternate, and Geryon doesn't have any attacks (exept for Phase 1) that can break Sleep. *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe.

Summon and Ninja magic are the alternatives here as they can ""pierce"" Reflect. * Jumbo Flan is entirely magical. Bring Shellga and stacking magical mitigation for this fight. * Mind Breakdown, while its damage is ineffective, will reduce the amount the Curagas will heal. * Bring Dispel to remove Jumbo Flan's Reflect and Regen if you have the means to deal with the potential overflow heal that Jumbo Flan will doing to itself. * Exdeath with Grand Cross will have a near-infinite amount hones for this match. This is an almost perfect setup if he is spamming Curada and doing party support stuff. * A form of Last Stand is advised to survive the Infernal Ultimas and their potential to dead overflow damage! &amp;nbsp; **Suggested Parties:** * **Wind magical team:** is a popular and effectively party in dealing with Jumbo Flan. You just need to find that Wind Imperil to help increase your team's DPS. Faris (with Imperil Wind SB + dancer/wrath), Fujin (with BSB + OSB), and Alphinaud (with BSB) are the top choices here. Strago BSB and his RES-piercing CMD2 is good alternative too! * **Holy magical team:** is the go-to party if you are going the Dispel route, though this requires either a Hope BSB2 or Selphie BSB1 to do the Dispel-ing here, the latter dealing damage at the same time! Of course, Imperil Holy thru De'Dia is advised if going this way, because the alternative Imperil Holy (Raines's Seraphic Ray is the only other choice) is rather inefficient here. The advantage of this party is the ease of stacking buffs on your party. * **Earth magical team:** is the odd choice here as one needs Red XIII CSB to make things faster. Maria, Emperor, and Rinoa are the main DPS option because we did not get Enna and her En-Coffee. Strago BSB (+ RES-piercing CMD2) and Rinoa BSB1/Earth USB Brave are the alternative options here! * **Dark magical team:** is a strong contender with Exdeath USB doing Grand Cross and do party buffs at the same time. Lots of options on them too from Raines BSB, Seymour/Golbez CSB, take your pick... just don't bring Vayne or you'll have see his CMD-BLK bounce back at you! :( * **Poison magical team:** is one of the masochistic team choices because our only magical option here is Quistis and Kefka only... DeNA sure is rubbing it in our faces that Poison element is long forgotten for player-use. Don't worry they'll get a chance to shine on the next Infernal fight. :( * **Piercing Attack physical team:** is the other masochistic team choices. Monks with Piercing Strikes and Sephiroth BSB1's CMD1 are your only options here. For solo-runners who wish to do this, good luck with this one, I highly doubt you can deal over 1m damage without resorting to RW Cloud USB here, Radiant Shields, or having a good RNG to help with W-casts! Meanwhile, MO Raid parties might stand a chance with this endeavour, though it will require almost precise coordination and planning. *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle. This more apparent and important during Multiplayer but not on Solo. * No one bringing buffs/mitigation/wall/healers? Why not try bringing them yourself, you can't win a fight with an entirely DPS team only, especially not with the recent set of Bosses having access to either 1-hit killers or AoE spammers. * Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss tend to have a slightly lower HP, and sometimes, stats.

Fielding non-elemental PHY/MAG attacks, Jenova BIRTH will attack relentlessly with its ranged lasers, all the while attempting to Sap us in preparation for its Very Weak's phase HP-to-1 attack Ultimate Laser. While it is a bog-standard D160/220 Boss fight, Jenova BIRTH does have a trump in its sleeve by potentially countering all PHY with its 3-target AOE Counter Stops, giving physical parties something to think about. * As an extra gimmick, Jenova BIRTH's SPD stat increases whenever its changes Phases, but she slowly loses elemental resistance as a drawback. Do watch out for its fast turns in latter phases and just ~~beat~~ cast the crap out of it with Dark-flavor magical attacks instead. * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Phase|Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |Normal|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|100%|50%| |Weak|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|150%|50%| |Very Weak|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|150%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Laser|NAT|Single|ranged Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|W Laser|NAT|Back Row AOE|ranged Physical|-|super massive damage|-| |All|Tail Laser|NAT|Front RoW AOE|ranged Physical|-|super massive damage|-| |All|Ultimate Gas|NAT|3-target AOE|Magical|Non|super massive damage|high chance to Sap| |All|Counter Stop|BLK|3-target AOE|-|-|-|Respones to PHY; medium chance to Stop| |Weak|Ultimate W Laser|NAT|3-target AOE, 2-hits RT|ranged Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |Very Weak|Ultimate Laser|NAT|Single|Physical?|-|overflow damage|Affect character's HP is set to 1.

Jenova BIRTH only has a single 3-target AOE magical. Dancers are advised to avoid tripping that Counter Stop. * Because of its HP-to-1 attack in Very Weak phase, it is advisable to bring Astra and/or CT heals to prevent your characters from dying. * Fielding a magical Dark team is advised in tackling Jenova BIRTH to avoid the Counter Stops and to take advantage of its weakness. * On a side note, if you are planning to bring Mark of Darkness to stack Imperil Dark on Jenova BIRTH, make sure it is on a Dark Mage to avoid Counter Stop! *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle. This more apparent and important during Multiplayer but not on Solo. * No one bringing buffs/mitigation/wall/healers? Why not try bringing them yourself, you can't win a fight with an entirely DPS team only, especially not with the recent set of Bosses having access to either 1-hit killers or AoE spammers. * Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss tend to have a slightly lower HP, and sometimes, stats. A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3. Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss follows the normal casting time. *** [Solo D160/220 Jenova BIRTH Example Setup - Mastery Clear]()"
128,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,The Crusader Crew Synergy,0,98w1qr,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/98w1qr/the_crusader_crew_synergy/,2018-08-21 04:19:36,"I've been running a trio lately I've dubbed the Crusader Crew This squad devastates most 3 star magicites for elements that have nothing to do with it, it's pretty nice. As a free to play, it can be very difficult to amass enough relics for suitable teams of all elements. As such, a super team carries through some of the ones I don't have teams for. The 5th slot gets swapped for a few different characters, more details below Warrior of Light (I) (I fully nabbed this boi because the original NES FF is super nostalgic to me, don't judge me &gt;:U) Save the Queen (7 star) 30/30 - Boosts holy damage Warrior of Light's Guise (7 star) 30/30 - Boosts holy damage Hero's Seal Lifesyphon (10 uses) Assault Saber (10 uses), sometimes use Divine Cross if the battle goes on for a long time Shield of Light - Starts holy chain, more holy damage, does 11 hits to start, overheals 2000 on party) Hail of Light - 10 holy attacks (knight damage), gains 30% knight damage boost, Bright Finale in 15 seconds Bright Finale is an Overstrike that deals 35% of all holy damage done during the time Bright Overload - 3 Overstrike Holy abilities, counts as knight damage Shining Saber - Overstrike Holy, deals more damage based on how many hits he's been dealt Light Within - More damage based on how many hits he's been dealt Unfaltering Light - Starts with Last Stand, a massive defense bonus, magic lure, and attack lure Holy Might - Significantly more holy damage Edward (IV) (Nice to see Edward is useful for once) Lamia Harp (only 5 star, RIP) 10/20 Maria's Armguards (6 star) 0/25 (looking for something better, any ideas?) (whatever gives elemental resistance to boss) Wrath Entrust Whisperweed Ballad - Lower Holy Resistance of enemy by 1 full stage, raise attack of all allies a large amount, grant haste and burst to the user Soothing Lullaby- physical holy support damage, lowers offensive capability of enemy, saps self Baneful Nocturne - physical holy support damage, lowers defensive capability of enemy, saps self Rest is irrelevant Princely Preformance - More support damage, no good replacements so whatever Gifted Bard - Increase duration of stat buffs and increase their effects slightly Ace Striker - Y'all know what this does Ramza (FFT) (Entrust slave and holy chain) Kiyomori (6 star) 25/25 Hades Armor (6 star) 10/20 Whatever gives resistance to yadda yadda Lifesyphon Entrust Battle Cry - It's battle cry Flutegrass Memories - Holy chain, large attack buff, large holy buff Seeker of Truth - 10 Holy attacks, lower delay 1 turn True Hero - Starts with a full ATB thing, first attack has no delay Bevajiojelhhlag Spirit - same as Gifted Bard Mako Might - Start with SB Sarah (I) (Main heals usually, sometimes shares healing responsibility) Healing Staff (FFI) (5 star) 20/20 (also gives holy damage buff) Light Robe (5 star) 10 / 20 (also gives holy damage buff) DEFENDO ELEMENTO Ultra Cure Depends, usually Holy or Hastega, sometimes Ode to Victory or Mage's Hymn Age Old Hymn - Heal everyone a good deal, next magic attack to hit each character will miss, raise user's mind and resistance, haste and burst user Inviolate Prayer - Instantly heal a ton of health to someone, give them major regen Simple Plea - Heal everyone a decent bit Rest don't matter Beloved Princess - Double heal chance, becomes great with the burst Gracious Princess - Extra healing Heart of Grace (extra heals) or Mog's Teachings (start with SB) 5th Slot I like to use the 5th character as another DPS that uses the ""wrong"" element for the chain. For instance, on wind magicite dungeons I use Celes with her attacks that do Ice + Holy damage (Invincible Blade) which does solid damage that the enemy is weak to (ice) while also contributing to the chain. When the enemy is weak to both holy and ice, it hits limit often. Recently I pulled a bunch of Angeal stuff, including 2 ""Angeal's Gloves"" which have a thicc break which is holy + wind. Marche I use for straight up holy damage. Works great with his USB for chain numbers or his burst for damage when combined after with guardbringer. Cecil works with his wall and USB if I need a bit of extra tankiness. Arc for Holy + Water and heals Lenna for Heals and her holy burst. The strategy is very simple. For examples sake, Celes is the 5th character. Sarah's turns are ignored for this post because heal spam for the most part. Let's say we're fighting Fenrir for examples sake as well. Keep in mind Fenrir has that dumb dodge thing, thought it occurs at specific times so just figure I have a normal attack on each of those. If necessary I'll let Sarah punch the dumb mutt to get rid of its dodge. On Fenrir, it takes about 43-44 ish seconds to wipe him, and that's with the wrong element. I don't have an ice based team which is why this build blows my mind so much with how effective it is. Celes is using snowspell during this, since she bursts she doesn't need a second ability but I take protect usually. Extra damage for vulnerability for record, both normal legends from legend sphere. Sarah uses hastega here. 1st turn start Ramza with Battle Cry to power up those lifesyphons and give hastega. Get WoL, Ramza, Celes, and Edward to a ton of SB next while healing furiously. Once WoL is 2 turns away from being at max SB, start using back to back Whisperweed on Edward who is already max SB. After the first whisperweed, have Ramza entrust Edward for the 2 bars he lost. WoL uses the second to last lifesyphon he needs. Edward uses the second whisperweed (4 bars left). Ramza uses lifesyphon (3 bars left) WoL uses last lifesyphon (6 bars). Celes just keeps snowspelling. Edward uses 3rd whisperweed (2 bars). Ramza uses flutegrass (1 1/4 bars ish). WoL pops Hail of Light (4 bars). Celes pops Invincible Blade (2 1/2 bars or so). \[19 chain\] Edward entrusts WoL (0 bars) (Wol=6 bars). Ramza uses lifesyphon (2 1/2 bars). WoL uses Shining Saber (4 bars) Celes uses normal burst attack (4 ice + holy attacks) \[24 chain\] Edward uses lifesyphon (1 1/4 bars) Ramza uses Seeker of Truth (1/2 bar) WoL pops Shining Saber again (2 and a bit bars) Celes uses normal burst attack. \[39 chain\] Edward and Ramza both entrust WoL (Just under, or at 4 bars) Celes MUST attack before WoL, this is tricky to time properly(!!!) Uses Invincible Blade again (even though she's still in burst) WoL uses Bright Overload (if done right so far, each hit does 70-80k damage. This should be at the last 1/2 second of the chain and of triple vulnerability, timing was key throughout this whole thing. The chain sits at 50 before WoL's Bright Finale activates, dealing 99,999 damage. Occasionally if timing isn't juuuuust right, there will be 1 more turn of cleanup. However, this should wipe him. This is a major breakthrough for me, especially given my filthy free to play status (well, sort of free to play. I bought 1 thing on sale once). Cheerio!"

For this Weekly Event's Conquest Battle, there will be a great change to the Multiplayer battle scene as FFRK Global welcome our very first -level Conquest Battle fight, this is aside this Week's D80/120 Anguiform+Aspirans and D160/220 Demon. Because difficulty is ramping up, I'll be adding some summarized info in the Overview, something similar to what /u/dperez82 has been using since last month. For those getting bored of our usual Solo/MO Conquest Battles or finding them too easy, FFRK introduces us to our very first monthly -level end-game Conquest Battle, here we are pitted against extremely challenging superboss in Conquest Battle. Unlike, the standard end-game battles, the bosses of each Purgatory are D350 level in difficulty and have stats comparable to a D280 Torment Bosses. For the players, each Purgatory fight will have a Realm Synergy with a specific realm, characters that matches a realm with the Purgatory Boss's realm will gain Realm Synergy for the fight's duration. To commemorate the first event, we are pitted against the Kaiser Dragon, the very same Boss from the Nightmare Dungeons. Scared? Frankly, I am partially scared considering that the actual Kaiser Dragon fight in the FFVI GBA released gave me so much trouble, won in the end with alittle bit of cheating thru ""Soul of Thamasa+Celestriad"" and ""Quick-Ultima"" combos. However, knowing the nature of the people hanging around this sub-reddit, I'm expecting the very same people will continue to break the unbreakables~ Also, Kaiser Dragon will have his own personal and seperate comment section, all just for him below. &amp;nbsp; Shortcut: the Purgatory [Kaiser Dragon]() section &amp;nbsp; *** [JP Boss Guide](URL by /u/spiralis [Weekly Event Megathread]() by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Anguiform and Aspirans (VI)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Anguiform and Aspirans with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Attack Types:** mostly physical, secondary magic * **Status Effects:** Stop (Aspirans) * **Elements used:** Water (Anguiform), Lightning (Aspirans) * **Special Notes** All enemies must be defeated in order to win! * SERPENT TRENCH! *ahem* You are going to fight an Anguiform and 2 Aspirans at the same time for this fight. * These are just souped-up mobs, so they shouldn't give you that much trouble, bringing Fire attacks will make quick work of Aspirans.

A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3. Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss follows the normal casting time. *** [Solo D160/220 Demon Example Setup - Mastery Clear]()"

After that, Deathguise will use Spread Wings on his 3rd turn on Wings Closed state once, returning back to Wings Opened state and repeating then entire pattern in a deadly loop. * In Wings Opened state, Deathguise has access to 3 fixed damage attacks - all of which are auto-hits, because that's how fixed damage has been working ever since it first appeared. While in Wings Closed state, Deathguise attacks us with piercing wind magical attacks, and also attempts to destroy us with 2 back row attacks: ST Death and an AOE piercing wind with Sap.

134,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"My experience with Rem LD (BSB, OSB, USB) aka ""In which I sing the praises of my waifu""",25,90p8cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/90p8cq/my_experience_with_rem_ld_bsb_osb_usb_aka_in/,2018-07-21 23:19:28,"Yup. It's that time again. Blame Monk-ey. His Type-0 threads have always got me hyped for Type-0 events, and while we don't have a Type-0 event coming up soon, I've found myself using my newest waifu quite a bit lately. Since it's about 5 in the AM where I am and I can't sleep, this naturally leads to a new installment in the ""My experience with...."" series. For those interested, the previous installments can be found at these family-friendly locations: [Fujin!](URL [Agrias!](URL [Refia!](URL [Relm!](URL [Ayame!](URL [Zell!](URL [Bartz!](URL Now, on with the show! **Who is this Rem person you speak of, and what does she do?** The long and the short of it is Rem is amazing and adorable and fucking awesome and if you say otherwise I will cut you. In practical terms, this means she's classed as a ""Master of Magic,"" boasting natural 5-star access to white magic, black magic and summoning. This gives her the rather rare ability to reliably cover every element in game. Even poison. DeNa may have forgotten poison, but Rem didn't! Of course, Rem's strength isn't in her amazing elemental coverage, especially since we're talking about her BSB, OSB and USB here. Stat-wise, Rem is built as a white mage, and while she can certainly fulfill this role (she even comes with a w-cast white magic LM2!) she's not at all *designed* to be a healer. Rem is the first - and arguably best - offensive white mage in game, and currently the only character in global to have an offensive white magic-based OSB (I think this is true for JP as well, but I'm not 100% sure). Her LD is an offensive caster-type LD, but focused on MND and holy dmg, with her LM1 providing a small boost to holy and her LM2 giving a full white magic w-cast chance. On paper this looks pretty nice, since she can perform very well as a Curada-based healer thanks to that w-cast. But in practice, you don't bring Rem to heal. You bring Rem to fuck shit up (with purity). This is because every Soul Break Rem has is offensive in nature. Her burst, **Siphon Delta** is 8x aoe holy/dark attacks with en-holy and smart ether 1. Burst commands are a (cmd1) 4-hit holy/dark attack that heals her for a ""moderate amount of HP"" meaning it scales off of MND and thus almost always heals for 9999, and a (cmd2) self-magic-blink 1 that boosts damage of white magic abilities by a small amount for 3 turns. This boost works with both abilities like Holy and with her cmd1. This Soul break is what allows Rem to do the famed ""Yiazmat solo"" that is often spoke of. Her USB **Manalchemy** starts with 10x ST holy/dark attacks that comes with a single turn of **untyped** quickcast. She also enters ""Dominion EX Mode"" which incurs a small DEF/RES reduction as tradeoff for a *large* MND increase. Yes, large, as in ""50% more,"" which I think is the only MND buff in game that boosts it by that much. Assuming a base MND of about 500, you're getting an additional 250 MND just from her EX mode. That's pretty nuts. And it's not even the best part, as her EX mode has a vulnerability-based quickcycle mechanic; hitting a vulnerability will cause her to gain one **untyped** quickcast charge. This is all topped off with en-holy, to really drive home her role as an offensive white mage, and as with most USB modes, it lasts for 15s. Lastly, her OSB **Cleansing Flame** is a fairly typical holy/fire-based OSB that deals more damage when attacking vulnerability. With her two native en-holy's from BSB and USB this is obviously intended as a holy damage OSB. But the extra boost when hitting vulnerability means it can be serviceable as a fire OSB as well, especially if you have a chain to back it up. Now, all of this is relatively standard stuff. Her BSB is basically a healer version of Ashe's BSB and her OSB is nothing new in and of itself. Her USB isn't that different either, as many other characters have some kind of quickcycle mechanic on their USB's (Zach, Luneth and Marche come to mind). What sets her apart is the fact that her USB quickcycle isn't tied to any specific ability school or element. This combines with her amazing skill access to open up some really interesting possibilities (and makes her play *really* well with anyone who can reliably imperil). **Ok, but what does this all mean?** Obviously she's a top-tier holy mage. Probably the strongest out there right now. What sets her apart is how her USB allows her to interact with the rest of the game. First off, even though she's built as a white mage stat-wise, she still has a respectable MAG stat. With her native 5-star black magic access, she can combo her USB quickcycle with black magic spells in a MAG-based party and provide some solid supporting DPS while also providing white mage support in some way, such as with Hastega or Ultra Cure. Her quickcyle means that as long as you're hitting vulnerability, she's getting quickcast for everything she does. And I mean everything, up to and including magicites and RW's! Which brings me to another fun quirk of her USB; the vulnerability-based quickcycle works on **EVERYTHING.** This includes - you guess it - RW's and magicites. That's right; not only can she quickcast an RW or magicite, but if that RW or magicite happens to also hit vulnerability then she gets a quickcast charge for that too! If not for Rem and her USB, I don't think I would have been able to beat Diamond Weapon Fellstar, and it's because of her vuln-based quickcyle mechanic on her USB. The turn compression gained from being able to quickcast all of the things results in way more actions per USB mode than you would expect. And since you're also hitting vulnerability, it also results in Rem gaining quite a bit of gauge when using abilities, allowing her to perpetuate her quickcast state with relative ease. **Ok, that's pretty neat and all, but what if I don't need to worry about having a generalist mage? What if I just need her for the holy damage?** Well, then you can't go wrong my friend. I wasn't joking when I said she is top-tier white mage holy damage. The only barrier to using her effectively for most people will be finding a source of outside MND buff, since she will (barring realm synergy situations) need at least one outside buff. Sometimes Grace is enough, and if you have the hones then the bard 5-star +MND stack song is certainly workable. But for most people, MND buffs will come from soul breaks, and the truth of the matter is there aren't that many SB's that boost MND. Red XIII has an SSB you can get on the AA selection that boosts ATK/MND, and Marche BSB also boosts ATK/MND. Yuna BSB2 and Edward SSB both boost MND/MAG, and Edward SSB comes with Allegro on top of the buffs. OK mUSB is the gold standard, offering a MAG/MND/RES buff that stacks with damn near everything else, and there are a smattering of other soul breaks or skills that boost MND as well (Aerith BSB1 cmd1 comes to mind). But the fact is, however you get it, you're going to need at least one other MND buff in order to get the most out of Rem. Her 50% USB buff goes a long way, but unless you've got Realm synergy running then it won't be enough on it's own. **Having Said That** She's still the best magical holy dps you could ask for, easily eclipsing Hope, Raines, Minwu and Arc while also providing a much wider range of skill/element access than the other 4. It's quite possible to reliably hit dark with her thanks to the Ultima Weapon summon. And because it's a summon, she'll probably come close to capping it with a pair of +dark pieces of gear and your typical suite of mag buffs. **And the final verdict?** If you find yourself lucking into her USB I would say that you absolutely should LD her, no questions asked **UNLESS** you also happen to already be swimming in high-tier offensive holy magical characters that you have already LD'd. Let's be honest though; **you're not. No one is.** There are all of 5 magical holy characters in game, and one of them doesn't even have an en-holy. So just stop making excuses and LD her already! Only a monster would say no to that face (and those thighhighs). Don't be a monster. Now, if all you got was her BSB I would say she's probably still worth it just on account of the fact that she becomes very self-sustaining with her BSB. It kinda restricts her to holy damage (her cmd1 also does dark, but she receives no en-dark effect to really capitalize on it) and you obviously lose out on the versatility her USB brings, but she'll still do very good holy damage by alternating her cmd2 white magic boost with a well-honed Holy. Plus if she gets low, a quick cmd1 will fix her right up. Overall I'd absolutely say to LD her if you get her USB, and even if all you get is her BSB I'd still say 90% of the time she would be worth it - with the caveat about outside MND buffs becoming more important as you'll now need two of them due to the lack of the large EX mode MND buff. So if you can't work out a good setup with two MND buffs for her, then it's probably best to avoid her LD (unless you plan on doing solo Yiazmat shenanagins or something). **A final note on Rem and imperilers** USB Rem loves imperils. My standard setup with her is to run R3 De'Dia and R4 Holy, using De'Dia to build up gauge and proc vulns then unloading Holy when I finally get into USB mode. But the wonder of imperilers - especially top-tier guys like Edward, Laguna and Balthier - is that they can force that USB quickcycle of hers to continuously proc just by doing what they do best. Likewise, any reliable holy imperiler (Agrias BSB, Edward BSB) makes Rem a very happy girl. I can't quite state how amazing the synergy Rem has with a good imperiler. A good imperiler and her USB plus summon/black magic access can turn her into a DPS to rival more traditional black mages."

Also, Siren in Record Dungeon, Siren in Magicite Dungeon, then Siren in Multiplayer Dungeon! &amp;nbsp; Updates: * 7/24/17: MP Megathread is up! *** [JP Boss Guide](URL by /u/spiralis [Weekly Event Megathread](URL by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Karlabos (V)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Karlabos with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * After a very long while, Karlabos from the Torna Canal returns to make its case with DeNA, and finally its given a chance to appear in a stronger form. Fight-wise, Karlabos does very simple things like the earlier boss fights before it, in this case its mostly ST attacks. He only has a physical, gravity attack and a paralyze attack. Nothing worth to mention EXCEPT its Tail Screw, and if it follows the original FFV and Story/Record Dungeon fight mechanics, its Tail Screw will deal 99% HP gravity damage. It can be blocked by Instant KO resist gear though. * Players, new and old, who are able to access and play the latest Record Dungeon's V story should know what to do here - and do even better! * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Slow, Reflect &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|200%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Tail Screw|NAT|Single|-|-|gravity damage|current HP% damage| |All|Tentacle|NAT|Single|-|-|-|Chance to Paralyze| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Siren (V)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Siren with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * Siren (V) from the Ship Graveyard returns to haunt us with her Undead form in this fight. Unlike her Magicite fight, Siren (V) alternately switches in between her Normal form to Undead form every 6 turns, while at the same time switching her attack patterns. * Siren in Normal form has a very HIGH RES (atleast D300 level) and tends to attack with a variety of spells. Meanwhile, Undead Siren has very HIGH DEF (atleast D300 level) and tends to attack with physical attack, but laces them with chance to Poison and Instant KO instead. * Siren has a variety of status ailments in between her forms. Normal Siren counters BLK with Sleep/Silence/Slow and PHYs with self-haste. Undead Siren deals Poison and Instant KO instead. * NOTE: Siren deals more damage to Poison-ed characters, thus, you might want to bring Ultra Cure/Esuna/Astra to keep that away from you. * **Break Resistance:** 50% (both forms) * **Status Vulnerability:** n/a &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Phase|Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |Normal|100%|0%|0%|100%|100%|100%|0%|0%|0%| |Undead|150%|50%|50%|100%|100%|100%|150%|-100%|-100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Normal)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Protect|WHT|Self|-|-|-|Grants Protect; Used as first scripted move| |All|Blizzard|BLK|3-person AOE|Magical|Ice|super massive damage|-| |All|Thunder|BLK|AOE|Magical|Lightning|super massive damage|-| |All|Ultimate Thunder|NAT|AOE back row|Magical|Lightning|piercing damage|Ignores RES| |All|Ultimate Blizzard|NAT|AOE front row|Magical|Ice|piercing damage|Ignores RES| |All|Counter Sleep|BLK|Single|-|-|-|response to BLK; high chance to Sleep| |All|Counter Silence|WHT|Single|-|-|-|response to BLK; high chance to Silence| |All|Counter Slow|WHT|Single|-|-|-|response to BLK; high chance to Slow| |All|Counter Haste|WHT|Self|-|-|-|response to PHY; Grants Haste| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal (Undead)** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|Attack (AOE)|PHY|Single|Physical|-|super massive damage|-| |All|Venomous Clasp|NAT|Single|Physical|-|piercing damage|Ignores DEF; high chance to Poison| |All|Ultimate Venomous Clasp|NAT|Single, 3-hits|Physical|-|piercing damage|low chance to Instant KO| |All|Counter Attack (AOE)|PHY|Single|Physical|-|super massive damage|response to Fire attacks; [1]| * [1]: According to /u/Spirialis 's Boss Info JP guide Siren has this but the official JP wiki says otherwise. For safety, I'll leave it here, in case that JP wiki is wrong. &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * You may want to field a mixed raid party for Siren due to her innate very high DEF (in Undead form) and/or very high RES (in Normal form). * Runic/Grand Cross will be a great help in reducing RNG counters from BLK and damage during Siren's normal form. * Bring both mitigation and stack as high as you can. Normal Siren is entirely magical and Undead Siren is entirely physical. * Bring both Ice and Lightning resist gear to deal with Siren's magical attacks. * If going with an entirely physical party, have a dedicated Banishing Strike/Dispel user to remove Siren's Protect and occasional Counter Haste, mostly to avoid her from increasing her toughness and DPS rate. However, you should be prepared to deal with Undead Siren's high toughness, otherwise bring DEF-piercing attacks or Radiant Shields as a countermeasure for that phase. * Bring magical ninja-s to hit relevant weakness/neutral will help deal against normal Siren and Monks geared with Piercing Strike will do fine against Undead Siren. For those lucky ones or wanting to bring them, Sephiroth's Reunion BSB and Strago's Lore BSB piercing burst commands will be a great help or alternative here, that's Sephiroth's Dispear/cmd1 and Strago's Aquatic Gale/cmd1 respectively. *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle. This more apparent and important during Multiplayer but not on Solo. * No one bringing buffs/mitigation/wall/healers? Why not try bringing them yourself, you can't win a fight with an entirely DPS team only, especially not with the recent set of Bosses having access to either 1-hit killers or AoE spammers. * Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss tend to have a slightly lower HP, and sometimes, stats. A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3. Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss follows the normal casting time. *** [Solo D160/220 Siren Example Setup - Mastery Clear]()"

""A Promise Kept""? I like ""Promises Beyond Time"" better personally. It sounds more epic and poetic. For this Weekly Event, we are treated to an event that was suppose to focus on Braska's adventure, but it turns out he got shoved out of the way to showcase Auron and Jecht's new BURNING!!! specializations... A rather waste when they can try to improve Braska's versatility or utility, but eh I'm not DeNA, so enough of my ramblings... Moving on! For this week's Conquest Battle, we are going to the fight the aptly named guardians: D80/120 Defender X and D160/220 Sanctuary Keeper. Scared? I hope not, knowing the last time we fought Sanctuary Keeper (U++ or A+ I think was the latest previous), he brought some RNG-ish stuff to mess up with our party in one way or another. This time is no different so try to keep on your toes! &amp;nbsp; Updates: * 8/1/18: MP Megathread is up! On a side note, I'll be folding ""ranged attacks"" into the DMG Type category, while ""Auto-hit"" goes to Target/Hits category. I also noticed that the notes section is getting too large or redundant in some cases. Feel free to comment if you like or not - which I can always return it to the prior setup. *** [JP Boss Guide](URL by /u/spiralis [Weekly Event Megathread](URL by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Defender X (X)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Defender X with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * Behold, Defender X, a machine guardian that we fought off at the Calm Lands. Here in FFRK, we might its counterpart who is a completely physical fighter but comes with an intersting gimmick, its vulnerable to Berserk and will become completely non-threatening for its duration. I suppose a tauntilar, a WHT mage with Berserk, and several attacks will turn this defender into scrapheap fast. * In its Berserk-ed state, cause by casting Berserk on it, Defender X will force it to only use Blast Punch every turn. * Do bring Banishing Strike/Dispel to deal with Mighty Guard. * Notes: If this fight follows the previous Weekly events or Story Dungeon, the Berserk-ed Defender X's Blast Punch will just keep on halving your HP until it no longer can and kill that character instead, leading to an easily controlled fight. * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect, Berserk &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Double Attack|PHY|Single, 2-hits RT|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Slowga|WHT|AOE|-|-|-|high chace to cause Slow| |All|Counter Blast Punch|NAT|Single|-|-|gravity damage|50% HP damage| |Weak|Mighty Guard|WHT|Self|-|-|-|Grants Protect and Shell| |Berserk|Blast Punch|NAT|Single|-|-|gravity damage|current HP% damage| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Sanctuary Keeper (X)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Sanctuary Keeper with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |100%|100%|50%|50%|50%|100%|-200%|150%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |Default|Haste|WHT|Self|-|-|-|Grants Haste; ignore Reflect| |Default|Protect|WHT|Self|-|-|-|Grants Protect; ignore Reflect| |Default|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Slip Tail|NAT|Auto-Hit AOE|Physical|-|super massive damage|low chance to Slow| |All|Magical Breath|NAT|Single|Magical|Non|extreme damage|-| |All|Curaga|WHT|Self|Magical/MND|-|-|Restores HP; ignore Reflect| |All|Attack (2)|PHY|AOE front row|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|Attack (3)|PHY|AOE back row|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |V Weak|Regen|WHT|Self|-|-|-|Grants Regen; ignore Reflect| |V Weak|Reflect|WHT|Self|-|-|-|Grants Reflect; ignore Reflect| |V Weak|Ultimate Photon Wing|PHY|Auto-Hit 4-person AOE|ranged Physical|-|piercing damage|ignores DEF and blinks; medium chance to Petrify| |Weak/V Weak|Photon Wing|PHY|AOE|ranged Physical|-|super massive damage|rare chance to Sleep, Silence, Blind, Confuse, and Sap| |Weak/V Weak|Ultimate Magical Breath|NAT|AOE|Magical|Non|piercing damage|Ignore RES| |Weak/V Weak|Counter Curaga|WHT|Self|Magical/MND|-|-|Restores HP; ignore Reflect| &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * Bring stacking mitigation as Sanctuary Keeper will really hit hard regardless if its physical or magical attacks. * Bring Dispel to remove Sanctuary Keeper's occasional buffs - Haste/Protect/Regen/Reflect - which it will apply across the fight if given the chance. * Bring Affliction Break, Ultra Cure, and/or Astra for anti-status ailment coverage.

Aside from its elemental resistance/weakness suite, Vinuskar can still unleash its strong Crown attacks and physical attacks that comes with status ailments attached, and much later: the dread Ultimate Sword Dance. The fight is more or less a rather straightforward fight, you only need enough healing to survive Vinuskar's strong hits, all the while DPS rushing it to avoid the more deadlier moves in its Weak/Very Weak phase. * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |50%|150%|150%|50%|150%|50%|50%|150%|100%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |Default|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|rare chance to Sap| |Default|Crown|NAT|Single|Magical|Holy|extreme damage|low chance to Confuse| |All|Slowga|WHT|AOE back row|-|-|-|high chance to Slow| |All|Lunge|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|super massive damage|-| |All|Ultimate Crown|NAT|3-target AOE|Magical|Holy|extreme damage|high chance to Confuse| |All|Ultimate Fang|NAT|Single, 2-hits RT|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|Attack (2)|PHY|Single|Physical|-|extreme damage|low chance to Blind| |All|Attack (3)|PHY|Single|Physical|-|extreme damage|low chance to Silence| |All|Attack (4)|PHY|Single|Physical|-|extreme damage|low chance to Berserk| |All|Counter Break|BLK|Single|-|-|-|response to BLK; chance to Petrify| |Weak/Very Weak|Ultimate Sword Dance|NAT|Auto-Hit AOE|-|-|5000 fixed damage|locked for 4 turns after use on Weak, 2 turns on Very Weak instead| |Weak/Very Weak|Haste|WHT|Self|-|-|-|Grants Haste; forced action per phase transition| &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * You may want to wear Confuse resist for all your characters to avoid killing each other. Your important back row characters will preferably want to be wearing Mog Amulet (I) for both Confuse/slow resist coverage. * Runic/Grand Cross will have a niche purpose here in blocking Counter Breaks (if in back row, Slowga, but for self only) and this is especially important if you are running a black mage party. * Bring Dispel to remove Vinuskar's Haste once it reaches Weak phase and then very Weak Phase. This is very important in Multiplayer Raid as Vinuskar will probably tear thru your ranks with Ultimate Sword Dance. * A dedicated Tauntilator will keep your free from all of the status ailment-laden Attacks. This leaves you to deal with Confuse, Slow, and/or Petrify with other manners. * Like its previous iterations, HP Stocks/Stoneskins/Last Stands are your best defenses against Ultimate Sword Dance, just make sure to have a CT0 medica or a pre-casted non-CT0 medica to recover from it quickly. * Having an unfornate weakness to Ice/Lightning/Wind/Dark, raid parties should run take advantage of this and wreck Vinuskar with your Ice/Lightning/Wind/Dark gods, Kain/Bartz/TGC/Decil USB are excellent example here. *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle.

For this Fest, we get to fight 3 of them! Returning back from his boundless throne, Nemesis comes up to fight us in 2 Conquest Battle stage, IF we are lucky or unlucky enough to get the same treatment from the JP FFRK Xmas Fest! Meanwhile, the upcoming superboss Zeromus also joins the Conquest Battle once his event proper goes live, thus he gets his own dedicated section below (ctrl+f for ""[mo-zero-eg]"")! The other Conquest Battle is ~~[Holy Night]~~ Dullahan and his Glutturns which is a some sort of minigame, and like MO Nemesis, we might or might not get this very cold fight... Mostly, because we'll have to wait for datamines or annoucement proper, but I'm posting this in advance... Troubles abound when you put Superbosses and seasonal event on the wrong season. To everyone's relief, the D220 Conquest Battle versions of the superboss (and D??? Zeromus EG) should be easier than the standard ones we see in the actual event fight, about in between A+ and A++ difficulty I presume. Last time, roughly 3 months ago, the previous fest MO D220 Ozma fight was a rather easy fight as long as you can survive its attacks and cheese it by coming with the right tools. Same thing here applies, BUT be reminded that aside from the usual A+ difficulty fight, we also get the Boundless version as an MO too! &amp;nbsp; Updates: * 6/14/18: Summer Sun Festival Multiplayer Megathread posted in advance! This is to give people the gift of future sight, time to prepare, or time to worry enough that by the time the actual event comes in... they are ready to fight!

(Boundless) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Nemesis with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * NOTE: As far as this Nemesis entry goes, it is more or less WIP, I'm still looking for the actual scripted actions its going to do. * Nemesis returns and makes a come back with new moves! Like the previous battles against him, he is just as annoying and as scripted as ever (and anyone knows the pattern? I would appreciate it!), enough that he will be handling out death as fast as Kenshiro can! * As far as I can fetch thru the Internet, D220 Ultimate++ (its not A+ according to JP official site) and ??? Nemesis share the same attack pattern, the only difference will be damage intensity and how Ultimate Doomsday works (different went fighting in MO and Solo). * Unlike the previous fight where Last Stand is required to survive, Nemesis makes its a point with his Ultimate Doomsday that you will now be needing Reraise to deal with, especially if you make the fight too long enough for him to cast it again. While I do not known (yet) how long that will take, but if he follows his previous version, it can safe that he'll repeat it again after like 20 turns since the last time (?) he used it. * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** n/a &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |50%^[1]|50%^[1]|50%^[1]|50%^[1]|50%^[1]|50%^[1]|50%^[1]|50%^[1]|50%^[1]| * [1] Nemesis is neutral to all elements in Default/Weak but becomes 50% resistance once it becomes Very Weak. &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Ultima|BLK|AOE|Magical|Non|super massive damage|Also used as a Counter for every 12 attacks received| |Default/Weak|Graviga|BLK|AOE|-|-|gravity damage|current HP% damage| |Default/Weak|Ethereal Cannon|NAT|Single|Magical|Non|extreme damage|Ignores MBlink and can deal overflow damage| |Default/Weak|Ultra Spark|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|piercing damage|ranged attack; Ignores DEF| |Default/Weak|Ultimate Ultima|NAT|3-person AOE|Magical|Non|super massive damage|High chance to Sap| |Default/Very Weak|Ultimate Doomsday|NAT|Special|-|-|-|auto-hit Instant KO; Note [1],[2],[3]| |Very Weak|Apocalyptic Doomsday|NAT|4-person AOE, 2-hits RT|Physical|-|piercing damage|ranged attack; Ignores DEF| |Very Weak|Apocalyptic Ultima|NAT|3-person AOE, 3-hits RT|Magical|Non|large damage|-| |Very Weak|Boundless Meteor|NAT|AOE|-|-|5000 fixed damage|auto-hit; High chance to Sap| |Very Weak|Boundless Doomsday|NAT|AOE|-|-|-|HP-to-1| |Very Weak|Boundless Ethereal Cannon|NAT|3-hit RT|Magical|Non|extreme damage|Ignores MBlink and can deal overflow damage| Extra Notes: * [1]: Ultimate Apocalypse is used as its ""first"" hostile action. * [2]: MO version targets front row character slots of MO-player #1 &amp; MO-player #3, back row character slots of MO-player #2 &amp; MO-player #4 * [3]: Solo version targets character slot #2 and #4 regardless of row position. &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * Aside from Last Stand, Reraise/raise is now a mandatory due to how Ultimate Apocalypse works now, so three cheers for Yuna/Iris/Deuce USBs!

I was recently having trouble deciding because what if your using a magic user who's not using a certain elemental vulnerability. -Sorceror's Vow &amp; Savior of Spira only work for their abilities only, is that correct? -Does witch's cackle or things that say ""black magic damage"" work for black magic &amp; summon abilities, &amp; magic soul breaks? I was told if you can hit the ATK or MAG cap, then all the stat boost RM's are essentially inferior to the ones that have damage boost. It just seems like melee users get all the love with all the different choices they have for damage boosting RM's. Magic casters to my knowledge only have something like witch's cackle for a staff or fate usurper for a thrown weapon, but why isn't there one for a Rod or any other relic they can equip?"

For the first time we are not fighting the entire Warriors of Cosmos for our weekly Conquest Battle, just some of them, but at least its not all of them. Taking the charge of this entire Weekly Event's Conquest Battle, the party of Warrior of Light, Cloud, and, Firion, moves out to fight us! Take up your swords and get ready to *speaks in Ogre Battle script/voice* ""FIGHT IT OUT!!"" On a side note, this Multiplayer Megathread will take a different approach on the Boss writeout once again, I will be separating the heroes' arsenal according to difficulty. This is mostly due to the heroes having some different attack behaviour or list of arsenals on the D80/120 version, while the D160/220 version contain some (or even less) attacks that became an AOE or has higher potency in terms of DPS/status chance, thus requiring separate posts/notes. &amp;nbsp; Updates: * 6/20/18: Earlier by a day than expected! Oh well, mythrils and new stuff, for the SummerFest! The D80/120 battle with the heroes should arrive in less than 12 hours as of the posting. *** [Weekly Event Megathread](URL by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Warrior of Light / Cloud / Firion (Dissidia)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal), 120 (Hard), 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat the Warriors of Cosmos with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** * D160/220 comes at a later date - late Saturday/early Sunday depending on your timezone. * IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to win these fights, you must defeat a total of 3 Warriors of Cosmos, any of combination of the three heroes are valid and fair game! Also, defeating any of the heroes will cause the defeated hero to respawn, at full HP and is if the fight has just started for them. In the end, the choice will fall to either zerg down one of the heroes or go AOE for a faster win, time to pick your poison! * Behold, the unusual Hero consisting party of protagonists of 1, 2, and 7; and, you get to fight all of them at the same time. Fun stuff like last time but different combination! Like the battles before it, many of the attacks here are NAT physical, save for Firion who has a few magical attacks up his sleeves. * Warrior of Light is the ""weakest"" of the pack by way of offense (don't under estimate him though), having half of his arsenal is Holy and AOE, plus he is capable of putting DEF buffs on himself from two of them. A regular application of Armor Break/down will fix his tanking prowess good. * Cloud is the DPS of the party and will aggressive cut you to pieces. He can also put ATK buff on himself thru his ""Limit Break"" and then unleashes more powerful moves to kill you with. Regardless, Power Break/down will help here to lessen his DPS output, this is in consideration that the D160/220 Cloud has a some pretty nasty Ignore DEF Ultimate moves to hit us with! Unlike the other, Cloud is more of DPS-you-to-death, and has only 1 move to Interrupt us. * Firion is the odd guy here but comes with lots of versatilities and annoyance to the table. While most of his attacks specifically targets the front row, Firion's entire arsenal is Interrupt happy, enough to cause your heroes to reset their action should Interrupt procs. * **Break Resistance (all):** 50% * **Status Vulnerability (all):** Reflect &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance (All)** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| &amp;nbsp; [Arsenal: D80/120 version]() [Arsenal: D160/220 version]() &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe.

Well, not really, but Ultimecia does joins us for this weekly event~! For this weekly event, we've got some ice-focused techs with some dark/fire/wind techs split across the two banners, while Ultimecia's populates Banner 1 if you want her tech. Pull here if you purposely skipped Summer Sun Fest's Banner 4 just because you want Laguna Ice Chain-v2 and maybe because you don't need more Water or just plain avoiding Snow CSB. Do note that Ultimecia effective replaces the once-elementally-addled Mateus/Emperor(II) as the primary Dark/Wind villain now that she's here. Anyways, our Weekly Conquest Battle's enemy theme for this week is... Physical Attackers! Iron Giant claims this week's D80/120 arena by threathening us with his swords and Mighty Guard! Meanwhile, Odin (VIII) wears a suit of omni-resist and rides his anatomically-wrong horse Sleipnir (its mythologically and anatomically correct though) to fight us in D160/220 arena, arming himself the usual RNG-fatal Zantetsuken to cleave us along with some auto-hit mechanics and potential insta-kill. To arms, my friends, to arms! &amp;nbsp; Updates: * 7/3/18: MP Megathread is up~! The actual event should come in a few days~ Enjoy your Summer Sun Festivities while you are waiting. :) *** [JP Boss Guide](URL by /u/spiralis [Weekly Event Megathread](URL by /u/dperez82 [Enemy AI Megathread]() by /u/TFMurphy *** **BOSS: Iron Giant (VIII)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 80 (Normal) and 120 (Hard) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Iron Giant with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** The hulking and appropriately-named Iron Giant appears as our D80/120. He is a primarly physical attacker, with some attacks being easily nulled by a tauntilator, and brandishes out some good AOE for good measures. Nothing much to note except Iron Giant uses Mighty Guard when he enters Very Weak.

But unlike the other versions of Odin, this is one doesn't want to kill you out right (but he does have one in sleeves), instead he likes to dish out damage and more damage! Also unlike the others, half of Odin (VIII)'s arsenal are auto-hit attacks, allowing him to ignore your Blinks and hit you no questions asks. Luckily, none of his attacks are ranged, allowing you the comfort of running a back row or mage team. * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single, 2-hits|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|Ultimate Critical|NAT|Single|Physical|-|fixed damage|targets lowest %HP character| |All|Ultimate Cleave|NAT|3-person AOE|Physical|-|extreme damage|Ignores Blinks; Auto-hit; high chance to Sap| |All|Ultimate Zantetsuken|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|extreme damage|Ignores Blinks; Auto-hit; low chance to KO; Scripted to use when countdown reaches 0| |All|Attack (group)|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|super massive damage|-| |All|Cleave|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|extreme damage|Ignores Blinks; Auto-hit| &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * Leave your Shellga at home! Odin is an entirely physical fight. * Last Stand is absolutely needed here to help survive the Ultimate Critical. Though this may run problem with Ultimate Cleave's Sap procs. * Stacking ATK debuffs on parade and protectga will greatly help you. The same could be said by putting your party in the back row for extra protection! * A form of Radiant Shield with 2 healers may be a good idea to function as extra DPS here due to Odin's AOEs and auto-hit attacks. Expect lots of damage and SB generation that will speed up this fight. * While Odin (VIII) is omni-resist, I'm pretty sure it won't stop people from running CSBs to field their strongest elemental parties, we'll probably see lots of people running Laguna CSB along with Squall BSB2/USB2 instead of the usual Zack CSB with Physical Wind 7. This is in consideration that Non-Elemental parties are hard to boost if you have no crit-fixer/helpers. *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe.

Your party? They're behind the gate, just let them move to the higher ground and start shooting at the knights and monks (except Zalmour, he has Archer's Bane, to stop your archers with), thus take advantage of ZOC and your height advantage against them. If they're melee, well, just meet them head on - Agrias spamming Northswain's Strike will do excellent. After the fight, don't forget to un-equip Alma's Healing Staff, Barette, and Red Shoes; they are rather good items and Healing Staff offers free healing...~~ what? Oh wait, correct fight, wrong game!

And if you are wondering, why yes, Aurablast shares the same kanji with THAT Hadouken. ;) * Everyone on the Back Row will be safe from the Monk's Ultimate Shockwave, thus, the Front Row characters should wear Earth resist gear for extra mitigation. Meanwhile, everyone on the Front Row will avoid Knight's Ultimate Throw Stone, but will cause problems for the Back Row should Interrupt procs. * Focus all your DPS on Zalmour alone and ignore everything else! Do note that he has an omni-resist elemental suite, thus, you might want to go physical instead. * Ignore the adds unless you want to fight more and/or stronger enemies. * Forget Shellga and Magick Breakdown/Dances, every attack here is a physical attack, Zalmour won't even bother to attack you (he can't actually) and will keep healing or reviving his adds every time! * Dancers are the best form of mitigation here, and if you can stack them, even better! *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe.

146,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,EX Modes - Edgar-ly awaiting,53,8km5zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/8km5zs/ex_modes_edgarly_awaiting/,2018-05-20 02:04:43,"[{INDEX}](URL *** He's a king. And an engineer. Awfully supportive for royalty. So isn't it nice when he does something supportive in this game? Like if an enemy is vulnerable to Poison, or weak to poison... The Machinist role has shifted ever since their 4\* abilities dominated the status infliction and were the strongest single-hit abilities, to the time when their 5\* abilities became elementally focused and good for chain-building or imperil-inflicting. While your main DPS should be focusing on the former, your supporters are free to do the latter, especially if their own damage isn't great. (So Rikku can take an Offering, or Onion Knight can take a De'Dia, or Exdeath can take a Mark of Darkness.) Edgar's Ultra can focus on either role. As he gets a Machinist Rank Boost, and his EX Mode grants ATK +30% and double cast speed for Machinist abilities, he can do well with high-honed abilities in more than one element, still technically worse than an en-element. As his EX Mode also causes a Follow Up Attack matching Poison/Fire/Lightning damage done with Machinist abilities, with those Follow Up Attacks having a 35% chance of inflicting a 10% imperil of the corresponding element, he can instead focus his efforts on weakening the enemy and letting others hit harder. The value of imperil increases when bosses are less weak to the element: this tactic improves against neutral bosses, or even 5\* Magicites which are only 20% weak to an element. *** # Budget Builds Notable that because of the way the Machinist school developed, there aren't any particularly good budget options in the intended school, so Edgar would have to look in his other ability sets. * **Lifesiphon** Because he doesn't get Wrath. * **Draw Fire/Magic Lure** Tauntable attacks are getting rarer and rarer, but when they do work, these give an alternate way of building SB while aiding in defense. # Ability Builds The EX Mode strongly emphasizes one school; however, it can be noted that Ruby Spark is usable as an SB-building ability before entering the EX Mode, and Gaia's/Divine Cross can serve as a stronger Draw Fire if that's even an option. * **Bio Grenade** The oldest of the 5\* Machinist abilities, and boy does its age show. It's AoE when the hardest of bosses usually don't reward that, not to mention that Edgar's Follow Up Attack is single-target and thus can imperil only one enemy. Being AoE, its multiplier is lower than the single-target skills, at two hits of 1.2 potency. It has a 20% chance to inflict the Poison status, which won't do much damage in speedruns whenever those are emphasized (although Poison used to be a legitimate strategy when you were overpowered). Also, there is no Offering version for the poison element. With how rarely things are weak to this element, there's little reason to use this. * **Burning/Tempest Snipe** These are strong DPS Machinist abilities, having six hits which help with either building chains or circumventing damage caps, and a total multiplier of 3.42. The ice variation isn't ideal for Edgar, but he can use it. * **Flame/Spark Offering** These are weak as damage abilities, having only two hits and a total multiplier of 2.00, but giving another 35% chance of a 10% imperil. At level 99, Edgar's SPD is 135, giving him a hasted ATB charge time of 1.83 seconds. The Machinist abilities have a base cast time of 1.65 seconds. Input delay is around 0.2 seconds. So spamming the Offering abilities has a turn rotation of 3.68 seconds without the EX Mode, or 2.86 seconds with the EX Mode. The EX Mode also gives extra chances for those imperils. In a 15 second period, the average number of imperils seen would be: ||No EX Mode|EX Mode| |:---|:---:|:---:| |Offering|1.43|3.67| |Snipe|0.00|1.84| Or, on average, Edgar can make the enemy about 36.7% weaker to fire or lightning, on average, by spamming the Offerings under the EX Mode. That's significant on neutral or 20% weak enemies. (Note on calculation: this takes the total number of turns as 15 seconds divided by the turn cycle, which obviously gives a fractional number of turns. For a more precise calculation, you'd need to make an assumption about when the EX Mode cycle is reentered, which will be a different number than 15 seconds. Also, the Ultra's entry will not inflict any imperils.) # Soul Break Builds There's one recurring theme among these that makes them less worthwhile using. Not counting the fact that Edgar should primarily be focusing on abilities instead of Soul Break combinations, since he's not generally a hard-hitter. * **Chainsaw (SSB)** The main feature is that this is an imperil poison, and since it's a Soul Break imperil instead of ability imperil, it raises elemental damage by 20% for 25 seconds. This, on average, has a higher imperil rate than using Bio Grenade under the EX Mode, trading it off for Edgar's own damage. * **Armageddon Blast (OSB)** On the flip side, this can be used as a finisher. There's no particular synergy with the Ultra other than the ATK +30%; this Overstrike also happens to be the only AoE one in the game, giving it a slightly weaker multiplier and making it mesh less well with the single-target Follow Up Attack. (There's also a gimmick where the multiplier increases when more status ailments are afflicted on the enemy, and the OSB itself can inflict status ailments.) * **Bio Chainsaw (BSB)** This is his en-poison Burst, which will power up Bio Grenade. Why use the poison element again? This is also themed around status infliction at the cost of weaker damage. Talk about another era. As it stands, it has no place to be used with the EX Mode. * **Trifecta Drill (BSB)** This is his newer Burst, actually matching the other three elements while attempting to make poison semi-relevant, but doing more for fire and lightning, allowing imperils to be inflicted. The chances are weaker than the Offering series, though, and despite the ATK/DEF self-buff, is still underwhelming for damage. It can be used with the EX Mode, but you're better off saving that SB and instead focusing on the Offerings instead of these Burst Commands. *** # Legend Materia Edgar is like the Bartz of Machinists, though with fewer elements. It's even more evident with his Legend Materia. The LM1 increases Machinist damage by 15%. Straightforward way of enhancing his main gimmick. The LM2 gives a 35% doublecast Machinist. The LMR gives a 10% triplecast Machinist. Now, which combination do you use? Remember that extra casts do not trigger Follow Up Attacks or more extra casts, so those types of effects would be additive. Whereas the effects from the LM1 are multiplicative as long as the damage cap isn't hit, and considering that the Machinist Snipes are split over six hits, it's not usually a concern. Looking at combinations, of what happens per turn: |Materia|Damage|No EX Mode|EX Mode||10% Imperils|No EX Mode|EX Mode| |:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:| |LM1+LM2|Offering|3.11|4.45|||0.4725|0.8225| |LM1+LMR|Offering|2.76|4.11|||0.4200|0.7700| |LM2+LMR|Offering|3.10|4.27|||0.5425|0.8925| |LM1+LM2|Snipe|5.31|6.66|||0.1225|0.4725| |LM1+LMR|Snipe|4.72|6.07|||0.0700|0.4200| |LM2+LMR|Snipe|5.30|6.47|||0.1925|0.5425| The conclusion: if your primary focus is the Snipes for Edgar to do damage, use the LM1+LM2, while if your primary focus is the Offerings for Edgar to inflict imperils, use the LM2+LMR. And if you're using Edgar for Bio Grenade, why? *** Machinists are on the rise, with chains (high hit count) and decreased elemental vulnerability (imperil options) becoming more prominent. Edgar's EX Mode provides a compromise between those, and between his elemental flexibility (RIP bio). He might not be the best Machinist out there; it's along the themes of elemental generalist versus elemental specialist. But this does let him pull his weight."

148,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"If all bosses had equalized stats, who would currently be the most difficult or frustrating boss in all of FFRK?",15,8n5hqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/8n5hqy/if_all_bosses_had_equalized_stats_who_would/,2018-05-30 13:48:17,"The question may be a bit confusing so I'll explain it in a bit more detail. This may be a wall of text so unfortunately the TL;DR is the title. Imagine all bosses roughly had the same stats. For example, if we fought Bahamut SIN again but he had the stats of a general 4* Magicite, would you find him to be more or less difficult than other current bosses? Because of this, the AI of the boss is generally the most important, such as which had the most difficult functions to deal with. As a side note, when equalizing stats to fit the newly formed tier, it's important to note which stats the boss excelled in or was weak in. For example, Bahamit SIN, as an Ultimate, was known to have more Total HP to go through than most other Ultimate-level bosses, so if he were on the level of a 4* Magicite then the player would need to chew through more HP than the general 4* Magicite. On the other hand, Parade Float likely wouldn't be too hard as far as each of the individual battles go since it's full of PHY, BLK, and ST abilities that are easy to handle. Plus they'd still have status vulnerabilities, such as Seifer's vulnerability to Sleep. Taking them one after the other might be difficult for the total amount of HP to go through, but survivability wouldn't be as hard since most of those mechanics can be easily dealt with today. Also noting whether or not a boss had any weaknesses or resistances is also important. Since 4* Magicites are generally the toughest bosses, I'm going to pretend only the RWs available in Magicites would be used for these hypothetical battles. I understand if users feel this bit is unnecessary, though. **END OF EXPLANATION** --- Just to give this a good start, I'll give two examples of bosses that I think would still be very difficult if they had buffed stats: #Ultimate Barthandelus [Stats and AI](URL Barthandelus seems like he could be a potentially troublesome boss due to the Ultimate Dispel counters. Ultimate Dispel is rarely seen today since the game is so reliant on buffs, it feels like DeNA has given mercy to its playerbase by removing this effect from most bosses; IIRC I think Despair Sephiroth was the last time we saw this. However unlike Sephiroth, having a 30% chance to counter with AoE Ultimate Dispel is especially cruel. AoE Dispel is already bad. Unscripted AoE Dispels are even worse. Counter AoE Dispels are much worse. Counter AoE Ultimate Dispels at a higher than normal 30% counter rate is very unforgiving. The rest of his arsenal involves 0CT AoE abilities, a bunch of NAT abilities, and being a multi-target fight seems like it could be a very frustrating battle to deal with a 4\* Magicite level, especially with no elemental weaknesses. #Geryon [Stats and AI](URL Another frustrating battle due to Counter Cursed Elegy, a pretty decent chance to counter abilities with an AoE Slow. He also spams other status effects as well, so Astra will only help so much. Until the 5* Hastega ability comes out, I believe those issues alone will be frustrating.

Aside from his 2 non-elemental magical roars, the Bandersnatch is an entirely physical beast with only one thought in its mind when in Weak/Very Weak phase, to continuosly interrupt your characters from taking action against it! Do note that Bandersnatch only starts using its deadlier attacks (and Interrupts) once it reaches its Weak phase.

Moving along, aside from the usual dungeons brought about by the Dawn of a Legend (Reissue), we are also going to recieve WoL's Classic Red sprite! Yay!!

In truth, he is just an underling, and this fits in with his current incarnation as a D80/120 Conquest Battle boss. He only does physical attacks and paralyzing attacks, beyond those, he is a rather easy opponent that can be dealt with little to no problem. * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |200%|0%| |0%| | |200%| | | &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |All|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|Low chance to Paralyze| |All|Gaze|NAT|Single|-|-|-|Low chance to Paralyze| &amp;nbsp; *** **BOSS: Kraken (I)** &amp;nbsp; **Difficulties:** 160 (Ultimate+) and 220 (Apocalypse+) &amp;nbsp; **Mastery Conditions** * Defeat Kraken with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. &amp;nbsp; **Overview** Kraken, the Fiend of Water, graces us for our D160/220 Conquest Battle and brings alittle twist to his usual namesake/successors/bros/relatives. Unlike the usual water-aligned Krakens, the Fiend of Water Kraken (I) himself decides to emulate us players by bringing lightning elemental attacks himself to shock us with instead, compounding the situation is his unique property of absorbing BOTH Water and Lightning attacks. However, fear not, for the FF1 commerative banner has enough Holy tools and/or your Holy Knights and/or Raines can deal good damage against this Fiend of Water. Strangely and on a side note, Kraken's Thundaga are spelled , I'm writing/translating this as Thunder because the alternative is Sanger. * **Break Resistance:** 50% * **Status Vulnerability:** Reflect &amp;nbsp; **Elemental Resistance** |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Poison| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---| |50%| |-100%|50%| |-100%|150%|50%|50%| &amp;nbsp; **Arsenal** |Phase|Attack|Type|Target/Hits|DMG Type|Element|Damage Potency|Effects/Notes| |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:| |Default|Attack|PHY|Single|Physical|-|normal damage|-| |All|Ink|NAT|AOE|Physical|-|super massive damage|Ranged attack; low chance to Blind| |All|Thundera|BLK|AOE|Magical|Lightning|super massive damage|-| |All|Attack (random)|PHY|Single, 2-hits RT|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|Attack (group)|PHY|AOE|Physical|-|extreme damage|-| |All|Thunger|BLK|Single|Magical|Lightning|extreme damage|-| |Weak|Ultimate Ink|NAT|3-person AOE, 2-hits RT|Physical|-|extreme damage|Ranged attack; high chance to Blind| |Weak|Counter Thunger|NAT|AOE|Magical|Lightning|super massive damage|Response to PHY attacks; Targets front row only| |Weak|Counter Thunger|NAT|AOE|Magical|Lightning|super massive damage|Response to BLK attacks; Targets back row only| &amp;nbsp; **Tips:** * Wear Lightning resist gear to deal with most of the damage with Kraken's lightning attacks. * Mixed mitigation is highly suggested because the majority of attacks are either NAT and/or AoE in nature. * Affliction Break/Astra/Ultra Cure will help deal with Kraken's blinds. While the probability is low on the early stages of the fight, plus it could be circumvented by any other means, having your ability-oriented DPS blinded during the latter half of fight will give you some problem. * For this fight, row positioning will help avoid Kraken's Counter Thungers, mainly because they have a row-dependent targetting system. On the other hand, one can go full Summon and blast him with them apart quickly, choices are limited to Ice (Valigarmanda) and Wind (Tiamat) for neutral then Holy (Madeen) for weakness. *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe.

Not for Valvali... I mean, Barbariccia - the Fiend of Wind! She comes in with the 5-star BLK ability ~~Chain Aeroga~~ Tornado to make some breezy on your foes! As the second of Golbez's Four Fiend to officially joins us, Barbariccia is a wind-focused Black Mage, which should give Fujin and Emperor some very good competion (Alphinaud tops them all!) - though an upcoming wind mage will join us a month later! Of course a question to follow up is... DeNA how about Cagnazzo and Scarmiglione? And more importantly when? :O Anyways, starting from this Weekly Conquest Battle, we are receiving a revamp on the D160/220 mote awards - it will follow the format that was just like during the KH collab event! Moving to our Conquest Battle this week, we are going to face two old-timers from our gaming past, but it will be new foes for those still starting out or didn't get to play the original FFIV games. The desert-dwelling insect ~~Pokemon~~ Antlion populates the D80/120 arena and the arm-exploding Baigan takes stage on the D160/220 arena! Crunchy and explosive, explosive and cruncy, Baigan will make us really work hard for our win! &gt;.&gt; On side news, people will be hyping/buying for Banner 1's many lunarian tech, and [MO] Antlion will not be pleased if they test it out on him. Meanwhile, other people will hyping/buying for Banner 2's Barbariccia's wind gears and Palom's lightning techs, the latter which may work against Baigan. Either way, wallets and/or mythril stashes will be opened, I on the other hand will sit it out until the next IV event. &amp;nbsp; Updates: * 6/12/18: MP megathread is up!

As an entirely physical-based insect boss, the Antlion is weak to Ice and absorbs to Water, it will also retaliate against most physical attacks if given the chance.

The arms will respawn if both are dead, however, they will revive after a few turns. The arm will explode for an auto-hit 3-person 9999 fixed damage (make that double if both arms alive) if Baigan is killed then the arms are still alive. It is suggested to kill off the arms first then quickly burn Baigan before the arms revive. * IMPORTANT NOTE 1: Baigan's Right Arm is the one closest to your left screen! It hates your MAGICAL attackers by casting Silencega! * IMPORTANT NOTE 2: Baigan's Left Arm is the one closest to your right screen!

Baigan's Right Arm is the one closest to your left screen! Baigan's Left Arm is the one closest to your right screen! People have trouble identifying which is which in the past events and should be reminded again to not make the same mistakes of the past. * Bring ProShellga and mixed mitigation, Dancers being the most preferred debuffer here, and you might want to lean more on physical because it is only Baigan who attacks with magic. Either way don't skimp out on either mitigation and/or elemental resistance. If undecided, bringing Fire resistance is much prefered, considering Baigan has 2 fire attacks on his arsenal. * Astra will be a good way to prevent status ailments here and/or a party-wide Esuna to cleanse everything at once. Runic/Grand Cross only works on the user as the statuses are AOEs and most magical attacks are AOE/NAT. * A form of Last Stand, Reraise, and/or HP Stocks/Stoneskin are potentially required here if you plan to zerg the body down (and an arm) if you want to survive or need contingencies for the Ultimate Explodes you will be eating. * Bring Dispel/Banishing Strike to remove the AOE Haste and/or Reflects that Baigan regularly casts here. Shelke's Countertek SSB and Paine's Grand Storm BSB are a few examples of the AOE Dispel to help you here, especially if you need them somehow, and I'm pretty sure there's also a shared AOE dispel from a robe (from XIII if memory recalls right). * Because of Ice/Holy weakness and the need to kill the arms fast, a Summoner team using Valigarmanda and Madeens (5-star Holy summon - not the 4-star non-elemental one) will make this fight a non-issue, coordinated summons will make killng the arms fast enough that they'll be dead again just right after respawning. * If not going the AoE-way, kill the appropriate arm that goes against your party, then just burn Baigan down fast enough - just make sure to kill the other arms first before killing Baigan or you'll eat an Ultimate Explode! *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle. This more apparent and important during Multiplayer but not on Solo. * No one bringing buffs/mitigation/wall/healers? Why not try bringing them yourself, you can't win a fight with an entirely DPS team only, especially not with the recent set of Bosses having access to either 1-hit killers or AoE spammers. * Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss tend to have a slightly lower HP, and sometimes, stats. A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3.

Unlike the D80/120 Conquest Battle, the D160/200 Conquest Battle pits us against not on a single one but to triplets instead, the Gigasses!! * If you've dealt with them in the FFII Torments (or the actual FFII game), you will definitely know how to handle these guys, but since they are promoted to Conquest Battles things have changed and improved to the Gigas' advantage. The only thing that stays the same is that you are required to defeat them all in order to win! * For this fight, mind the elements that you are going to bring for this fight, each of the Gigas have an almost-omni-resistance suite for protection. * Unlike the Torments and previous iterations, when a Gigas enters it Weak phase, they will start going all-out by unleashing their deadlier moves (the random hit ones). So, try to becareful with your DPS and try not to burn them out very fast, or they will burn/freeze/shock you fast with random STs instead. * **Status Vulnerability (ALL):** Blind.

Necrophobe Ward, Gigas Armlets, and CoD-fest crystals are one of your best defenses here! * One might want to bring a dedicated Reta-meta to help deal with the Gigases' ST physicals and avoid their Stun-part of their counters too. * Affliction Break and Astra will help guard against status the ailments here, especially in the Gigas' Weak phase, where they have a good selection of status ailments divided amongst themselves. * It has been a long awhile bu the Poison SB tech users can finally show off their poisonous elements even if for a brief moment! Time to make Poison great again!!! They are: Thief (I), Leila, Edgar, Kekfa, Quistis, Marcus, and Thancred! *** **General Multiplayer Boss notes and advice:** * Haste on Boss = fast Party Wipe. If you know a Boss has a form of Haste, bring Dispel/Banishing Strike, otherwise expect a losing battle. This more apparent and important during Multiplayer but not on Solo. * No one bringing buffs/mitigation/wall/healers? Why not try bring them yourself, you can't win a fight with an entirely DPS team only, especially not with the recent set of Bosses having access to either 1-hit killers or AoE spammers. * Solo versions of the Multiplayer Boss tend to have a slightly lower HP, and sometimes, stats. A safe guesstimate on this is that the Solo version of the Boss has roughly 10~20% less HP than the Multiplayer version. * Multiplayer versions of the Multiplayer Boss' actions are always instant cast due to the battle speed being permanently set at Speed 3.

156,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"My experience with Agrias LD (BSB, OSB)",41,82fs98,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/82fs98/my_experience_with_agrias_ld_bsb_osb/,2018-03-07 02:16:15,"Welcome to the next installment in my kinda-sorta-official series of ""My experience with...."" where I share my personal experience, observations, and feelings about the Legend Dives of various characters I've LD'd. Prior to this, I've done Relm, Fujin, Refia and Ayame, and today I'd like to shine a spotlight on that most loyal of battlefield companions, Agrias. **TL;DR: conditional, based on your position in the game. Probably not great for someone who's ""end game"" unless you really lack holy options and have the applicable soul breaks and/or skills to quickly stack and take advantage of her LM2. Very powerful for someone on the cusp of beating the harder event bosses and torments, even without any soul breaks to support her (but obviously even better with BSB etc.).** **My history with her** Agrias, for me, was something of a hidden gem. I got her unique reverse wall back when it first came out, and while it took me a bit to see it's potential, once I realized how it worked, I used the hell out of that soul break. As time went by, my teams changed to deal with the changes the game was going through, and she fell by the wayside in favor of other, ""pure"" breakers. When I lucked into Minfilia and Quina BSB's, those two became my ""go to"" options for when I really wanted to debuff something. Then, one day on a realm DU, I drew Agrias' BSB. Chuffed as nuts to bring her back into my party, I let loose with that thing and holy hell was it nice. That imperil! That aoe damage! Those buffs on her BSB commands! Later on, picking up her OSB was just another brick in the holy wall of **FUCK YOU** that I had started to build with her. After wiping the floor with a number of difficult encounters (I remember a fight using Cloud USB+Agrias BSB spam during a jump start that was as hilarious as it was effective), I was doing an inventory of my motes and RD'd characters and figured what the hell, I've got the motes, I've got her BSB and OSB, and I don't have any other knights dived (or worth diving)....so why the heck not? **But how does she do?** Well, first off, her LM's: LM1 is your standard damage boost that you see so often - holy in this case - which makes good sense and provides a solid, reliable damage increase. Her LM2 is of the ""chance to minor imperil"" variety, again with a focus on holy damage, but tied to the usage of knight abilities. This works well with her BSB in the sense that her commands are classed as knight, and she can easily forego Saint's Cross for Lifesiphon due to being able to use her cmd1 to raise her defense and grant Draw Fire status to herself. This means you can run LS+Guardbringer and have her online in burst mode fairly quickly without any outside input while also gaining the maximum benefit possible from Guardbringer (assuming protect+wall of course). Her LM2 minor imperil also stacks with her BSB imperil, and while the max stacks total are still ""3"" each minor imperil basically counts as a ""half"" of a stack, so it's quite possible to reliably have 3 stacks of holy imperil on a target for most of a fight. In other words, Agrias excels at *making* a target holy weak. As long as they're not holy immune or absorb, she can reliably make them vulnerable to holy for a good chunk of the fight. Of course, this is all based on RNG, because it's just a chance of minor imperil, and therein lies the rub. I use Agrias as my second DPS and RW user during my sub-30 Shadow Dragon kills, and while she is certainly a key player, most of what she does revolves around using Saint's Cross/Guardbringer (Assault Saber now) until she has enough bar to OSB, at which point she OSB's and the fight ends either that turn or the turn after (dependent on how many w-casts Raines has lucked into that fight). In all the many times I've farmed Shadow Dragon sub-30 for MDO's, I don't think there has been a time where I've thought to myself ""man, thank god for her minor imperil."" This is especially stark in comparison to my full husbando LD'd Raines; when Raines gets a w-cast proc, you **feel** it. When Agrias gets a minor imperil proc, then everyone else does, at most, another thousand damage per hit? Over time that adds up, sure, but it's no w-cast. **Which brings me to the bad news** As much as I love Agrias, her LM2 has, at best, some niche use. Now, granted, I'm not at 4-star dark magicite yet, so maybe there's some hidden advantage there I'm not aware of, but at least for 3-star dark, I find more value in her OSB than I do in her LD or BSB. On the one hand, that sucks, because she's a super powerful, well-rounded character who is amazing at *enabling* holy damage. On the other, well, that's just the name of the game. I can see, for example, her USB getting much more mileage out of her LM2, just by the nature of how her USB works. Maybe in that case it becomes more pronounced, but for where I am in the game right now, it's underwhelming more often than not. However, for those who **aren't** pushing the highest tier content currently in game, I would say the story is different. While I was pretty much where I am now when I LD'd Agrias (in terms of my ""power"" in the game) I can absolutely see her value for as an LD for people who are heavy on the holy damage while also lacking in other areas. As I noted earlier, with her BSB and LM2, she excels at forcing holy vulnerability on whoever she damn well pleases. If you're someone with a solid holy team (because that's what you've gone for or maybe just what RNGesus has blessed you with) then I could see her be a realm-and-event clearing workhorse that's on par with Vaan with LD+USB. She obviously doesn't bring the raw damage Vaan brings, but she is one hell of a damage enabler. I'm lucky enough to have Firion's BSB, and the combo of his BSB with Agrias' imperil means you can destroy torment torment 200 and 250 bosses without an issue, as long as they aren't holy immune or absorb. The trash gives Firion plenty of time to iterate up to 8x hits on his cmd1, and Agrias can pool gauge until the boss, where she unloads 3x BSB's for the max imperil and then watches approvingly from the sidelines as Firion tears the boss 8 new assholes, over and over again. So if you're in that sort of a situation, I can absolutely see the value of her full LD. Anything that helps you get to max killing power is a welcomed blessing, and Agrias does that with holy teams like no other (save maybe WoL with his chain). **Final thoughts** I don't regret fully LD'ing Agrias. The problem I have with it is the content that it's most useful on is content I (at the time) was nearly ""finished"" with. So her LD helped, and it helped a lot, but it helped for a relatively short time, especially compared to the work I've gotten out of someone like Raines, Ayame or Cloud. Sure, it gave me a nice boost to help overcome a few bits of content, but truth be told, I would have been able to take that stuff down just fine the next time it came around. So overall, I would say yes, she's a good LD, and certainly worth the motes, **BUT** with a pair of conditions attached. Firstly, is your ""A squad"" very holy-centric, and you find yourself struggling with non-holy-weak monsters? Then Agrias is for you (even without her BSB!). She'll require hones - at least rank 3 of Divine Cross/Guardbringer - but she will drastically increase the damage of your holy squad. Secondly, do you also find yourself struggling with some final event battles (180 and 220 stuff) or torment 200 and 250 fights? If you said yes to both of these conditions and you can support the skill hones for her, then Agrias will likely be a good investment. As a character she's solid at the core, with high hp and defensive stats, good atk, and the ability to use 4-star white magic on top of combat and knight, meaning she can slot proshellga to fill in a gap as needed and then utilize an offensive knight ability for her LM2. Being a full knight, she has access to draw fire, both as a skill and natively via her BSB cmd1 (if you have that) which is amazing for torment trash and, even on 220 bosses, can divert enough damage to help eke out a win. In other words, if you're on the cusp of finishing some key stuff and you fit the above two conditions, then give Agrias a nice long look, maybe buy her a nice dinner and some flowers. She's worth it, and she'll show you. On the other hand, if you're not in that position, then a full LD is something that becomes much harder to justify. Luckily, partial LD's exist, and her LM1 and supporting stat boosts are all solid. You might be in a position where just a bit more damage is what you need to clear something tough (i.e. Shadow Dragon) and in that case, a partial LD for her is certainly an option, especially if you have her OSB or USB. You'll get a solid, reliable boost to her damage and survivability while ignoring the (mockingly horrendous) RNG of her LM2, all while saving on 5-star motes."

You **really** do not want AoE Slowga, so if brining mages, either have them target the Galbadian Soldiers or have your summoners attack the Elite Soldier, which will not trigger the counter. * While AoE may be useful in phase 2 against the Soldiers, keep in mind that once they drop below 50% HP, they gain access to Ultimate Kill, which is an AoE piercing physical attack. If all three have access to it, they can mow your party down pretty quickly, so strong ST supplemented by some AoE is the best strategy. ****** ###02: Iron Will, Iron Fists - Chadarnook (VI) 1 STAM [[Megathread]](URL Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Chadarnook**|403,524|None|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Goddess): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |150%|-|-|-|-|-100%|-|-|- #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Demon &gt; 30% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |150%|50%|-100%|50%|50%|50%|20%|50%|50% #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Demon &lt; 30% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |-|50%|-100%|50%|50%|50%|20%|50%|50% **Target Scores:** 1. Lower Chadarnook's Magic. 2. Use a fire attack on Chadarnook when in demon form. 3. Use a holy attack on Chadarnoook when in Goddess form. **Note(s):** * This fight is a little different than the last time we encountered Chadarnook. It will start in its Goddess form, and will stay in this form for 15 turns unless you hit it with a holy attack (you definitely want to make sure you do so prior to her 3rd turn, as she will cast AoE confuse). In addition, if you try to attack it with any non-holy ability, it will counter with AoE Confuse or AoE Sleep. * After the Goddess is hit with a holy attack, it will change to its Demon Form. The Demon form is 100% immune to all physical attacks until it is hit by a holy or fire magic attack (you only need to do this once!). Chadarnook will stay in Demon form for 3 of its turns before reverting back to its Goddess form. You'll then need to hit it with another holy attack to switch it back to Demon Form. * Chadarnook will go back and forth between the two forms until it hits 30% HP, after which it will stay in Demon form and lose its fire vulnerability for the rest of the fight. * While the boss shouldn't be in Goddess form very long, it will either do a 4 hit ST attack or Thundaja. The Demon Form has potent magic attacks (including a piercing water magic damage), but also hasa 4 hit ST attack and a very strong (344% physical damage) ST attack which carries with it a 30% chance to confuse. Both physical attacks can be tauntilated, removing all physical damage from the fight. * You'll be dealing with water, lightning, and ice damage throughout the fight, though I would prioritize lightning first, then water. The Demon form also has a 20% chance to counter white/black magic with a ST Thundara, and a 15% chance to counter physical attacks with a ST Drain. * Note that at the 30% mark, Chadarnook will use an AoE regular dispel, so be ready to rebuff at the transition! ****** ###03: Pawn Among Kings - Tyrant (XII) 1 STAM [[Megathread]](URL Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Tyrant**|453,195|None|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities: **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| 50%|120%|-100%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%| **Target Scores:** 1.

Keep in mind that after his 10th turn, he does unlock the ability to use Sonic Fang, which deals weak damage but has a 6% chance to instant KO. * His most dangerous attacks are Piercing Graviga (AoE, 303% chance to do 30% **Max** HP) and Ultimate Darka (AoE, 300% piercing magic dark damage), so you'll want instant KO accessories and magic debuffs. * No crazy statues to worry about here, this is a pretty straightforward A+.

They have a full suite of spells (Fire/Ice/Lightning, as well as Holy/Flare), and have two piercing AoE magic attacks (Ultimate Firaga and Ultimate Thundaga). * Note that if you use a ice/lightning/holy/poison attack on the barriers, they will counterattack with an AoE Blind. * Runic still works fairly well in this fight, drawing all of the ST attacks - the only NAT spells are the Ultimate spells (they also have BLK-coded AoE spells as well). * Necrophobe is heavily magic based, but does have a fairly strong ST physical attack to try and keep you honest. Unlike in previous encounters, he will also use attacks against you while the barriers are up. All of his ST spells are also vulnerable to runic. * Once the barriers are defeated, he gains access to Ultimate Blizzaga and Ultimate Sap, as well as additional AoE magic spells. However, with this weakness to all elements, his HP will go down relatively quickly. ****** ###05: Fate Calls, Power Awakens - Rubicante (IV) 1 STAM [[Megathread]](URL Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Rubicante**|420,000|None|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Cloak Open): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| *-100%*|**150%**|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|**150%**|*50%*|*50%*|*50%* #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Cloak Closed): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| *-100%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%* **Target Scores:** 1. Exploit Rubicante's weakness to water attacks when he is weak to them. 2. Lower Rubicante's Magic. 3. Lower Rubicante's Resistance. **Notes:** * Rubicante is very heavily magic-based, it would be in your best interest to equip everyone with fire resist gear (especially since he will use Ultimate Firaga, a resistance piercing move, later in the fight). He does have an AoE physical attack to keep you honest. * Hope you like Ultimate Dispels! Right before Rubicante closes his cloak, he will use Ultimate Inferno, which deals AoE magic fire damage and ultimate dispels your entire party (which includes things such as SG, atk/mag boosts, etc.). Since the attack does damage, if you time your magic blink, you can avoid the Ultimate Dispel. * He will use Ultimate Inferno and Cloak on his 7th turn when above 70% HP (so it is possible to skip this one if you deal enough damage), and on his 6th turn when below 70% HP. He stays cloaks for 3 turns, after which he will emerge. * When Rubicante is cloaked, I would highly recommend avoiding any attacks. He has a 25% chance to counter all attacks with Ultimate Firaja, which deals AoE fire damage and inflicts Imperil Fire on your party. * The key to this fight is planning around the Ultimate Inferno. If you don't have a good source of magic blink, consider giving your boostga/hastega user wrath so he/she can rebuff after the dispel. Note that while cloaked, as long as you don't attack him, he will only use physical attacks or heal himself with curaja, giving you some time to recover. ****** ###06: The Torch Burns On - Red Soul (II) 1 STAM [[Megathread]](URL Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Red Soul - A+**|400,000|None (including Interrupt)|All **Ogre Mages - A+**|99,999|None (including Interrupt)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Red Soul): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |*-100%*|*-100%*|*-100%*|**120%**|*40%*|*40%*|*-100%*|*40%*|*-100%*| #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Ogre Mages): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |**150%**|*30%*|*30%*|*30%*|*30%*|*30%*|*30%*|*30%*|*30%*| **Target Scores:** 1. Lower an enemy's Attack. 2. Lower an enemy's Magic. 3. Lower an enemy's Resistance. **Notes:** * You'll face Red Soul and two Ogre Mages - all need to be defeated to win the battle. Please note that **ALL PHYSICAL ATTACKS HAVE A BLANKET 30% CHANCE TO CAUSE YOUR NEXT PHYSICAL ATTACK TO MISS!** You are better off going with a mage team. * Except for weak ST physical attacks, everything here is magic-based - you can leave PBD and Protectga at home for this fight. * Red Soul uses a variety of fire/ice/lightning/poison magic damage, to include ST and AoE. He does have one piercing magic attack (Fire Breath). * All of the offensive magic that the Ogre Mages use are ice-based - however, they can also use AoE Blind and AoE Sleep. Note that on their 5th turn they will both use Sleep 4 (AoE Sleep, 48% chance), and on their 9th turn, they will use Sleep 16 (123% chance to Sleep). In addition, after their 9th turn all they do is Ultimate Blizzard (Piercing magic attack). * It is absolutely imperative you get the Ogre Mages down before their 9th turn - there are literally no physical attacks that late in the fight, and if you aren't wearing any sleep resist and/or use affliction break, everyone will be slept and game over (not to mention you will get pounded each turn with Ultimate Blizzard). You can rely on Enkidu to cure the first AoE Sleep, just focus fire your ST and AoE accordingly to get them down. For those without Enkidu, you'll want some sleep resist on your characters. * Maria is excellent here, as her command 2 will hit both the Ogre Mages and Red Soul weaknesses, and given the 30% blanket physical miss along with multiple mobs, you'll want to field a mage team with a dancer as your debuff anyway.

Was hoping after Flashing Blade buff he might somewhat be of more value. But after testing today the damage he produce on any none holy vul boss is just pathetic in comparison to others unless holy chain/max vulnerability is present. Guess he is just going to sit on bench with his Ultra/BSB until Dena give him a better ultra or BSB2 (or at least new 4 hit holy samurai abilities ...)

Lightning resist accessories will help a lot here. * Humbaba will also use 1000 Needles regularly (1K fixed damage to the entire party). The issues is he has a 10/15% chance to counter physical, black, and white magic with 1K needles. Multiple 1K needles counters coupled with his AoE magic attacks can present a problem. * Summon attacks of course bypass the counter, so consider them in your lineup to minimize the amount of counters you have to deal with. * **CID MISSION: Complete Mobliz (Ultimate++) in a party of FF VI heroes that must include Locke!** This CM makes no sense to me since Locke wasn't even a participant in this fight, but make sure to include him in your party as he is required! ****** ### Floating Continent (Apocalypse +) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Ultima Weapon**|480,000|None (including Interrupt)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities: **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |**150%**||||||||| **Target Score:** 1.

Lower the Goddess' Magic. 2. Lower the Goddess' Defense. 3. Lower the Goddess' Resistance. **Notes:** * Goddess, except for a throwaway physical attack, is 100% magic based. However, all of her magic attacks are piercing, so don't bother with Shellga or Wall - stick with stacking magic breaks. Her magic spells are mostly lightning-based, though she does have water and non-elemental attacks as well. * Note that the Goddess starts the battle with Haste and Shell, and both are undispellable. Therefore, it is preferred to go with melee characters here. * On her 5th turn, she will use Cloud Heaven, which inflicts a 30s Doom on your entire party - make sure you bring along enough DPS to defeat her in time. * The most annoying aspect of this fight is that at 70% and 50% HP, the Goddess will use Lullaby (AoE, 51% chance to inflict Sleep). Make sure to bring along sleep resist, status blink, or the Enkidu/Unicorn Magicites! * Imperils are quite useful here to circumvent her Omni-resist (except for lightning and holy obviously). ****** ### Devil in the Details (Apocalypse +) **JUMP START** (Copied from the previous [[Megathread]](URL Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Chadarnook**|403,524|None|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Goddess): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |150%|-|-|-|-|-100%|-|-|- #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Demon &gt; 30% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |150%|50%|-100%|50%|50%|50%|20%|50%|50% #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Demon &lt; 30% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |-|50%|-100%|50%|50%|50%|20%|50%|50% **Target Scores:** 1. Lower Chadarnook's Magic. 2. Use a fire attack on Chadarnook when in demon form. 3. Use a holy attack on Chadarnoook when in Goddess form. **Note(s):** * This fight is a little different than the last time we encountered Chadarnook. It will start in its Goddess form, and will stay in this form for 15 turns unless you hit it with a holy attack (you definitely want to make sure you do so prior to her 3rd turn, as she will cast AoE confuse). In addition, if you try to attack it with any non-holy ability, it will counter with AoE Confuse or AoE Sleep. * After the Goddess is hit with a holy attack, it will change to its Demon Form. The Demon form is 100% immune to all physical attacks until it is hit by a holy or fire magic attack (you only need to do this once!). Chadarnook will stay in Demon form for 3 of its turns before reverting back to its Goddess form. You'll then need to hit it with another holy attack to switch it back to Demon Form. * Chadarnook will go back and forth between the two forms until it hits 30% HP, after which it will stay in Demon form and lose its fire vulnerability for the rest of the fight. * While the boss shouldn't be in Goddess form very long, it will either do a 4 hit ST attack or Thundaja. The Demon Form has potent magic attacks (including a piercing water magic damage), but also hasa 4 hit ST attack and a very strong (344% physical damage) ST attack which carries with it a 30% chance to confuse. Both physical attacks can be tauntilated, removing all physical damage from the fight. * You'll be dealing with water, lightning, and ice damage throughout the fight, though I would prioritize lightning first, then water. The Demon form also has a 20% chance to counter white/black magic with a ST Thundara, and a 15% chance to counter physical attacks with a ST Drain. * Note that at the 30% mark, Chadarnook will use an AoE regular dispel, so be ready to rebuff at the transition! ****** ****** ####**[D220 Multiplayer]** ****** ****** Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Guardian**|756,606|None (including Interrupt)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (70% - 100% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |**150%**|*50%*|**150%**|*50%*|*50%*|*-100%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*| #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (40% - 70% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*| #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (&lt; 40% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |*50%*|*50%*|**150%**|*50%*|*50%*|**150%**|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*| **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Guardian with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. 2. Lower Guardian's Attack. 3. Lower Guardian's Magic. **Notes:** * Guardian has a mixed offense with both potent AoE physical and magical attacks, so don't skimp out on either mitigation. * You have a lot of statuses to worry about in this fight: Guardian can use AoE Slow, ST Blind, ST Confuse, 3-target Sap, AoE Interrupt, as well as gravity attacks and HP = 1 moves. Status Blink will be very useful here, and would prioritize confuse/slow for healers/mages and blind for physical characters. * At 70% and 40% HP, Guardian will become invincible and take no damage from any attacks until he is hit by 3 lightning attacks - be mindful of this and don't end up wasting a soul break! * Note his changing vulnerabilities - he is weak to fire/lightning in P1, resists everything in P2, and is weak to lightning/water in P3. Given the mechanics of his Invincible state, I would forego bringing fire/water characters and just go with a full lightning team. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

You really want some stop resist/affliction break/status blink to protect you. * Note he also can use a ST stop (33% chance) throughout the fight. ****** ### Destruction Without Retreat (Ultimate ++) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Esthar Soldier - All Waves**|40,000|Poison|All **Esthar Terminator - Wave 1**|60,000|None|All **Esthar Terminator - Wave 2**|80,000|None|All **Esthar Terminator - Wave 3**|100,000|None|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Esthar Soldier): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| ||||**150%**|||||| #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Esthar Terminator): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| ||||**150%**|||||*0%*| **Target Scores:** 1.

In addition, in waves 2 and 3 they gain the ability to use Chain Gravity (hits two RT characters with 25% current HP damage), and Soul Crush (ST defense ignoring attack). * Other than that, fairly straightforward battle - AoE is king here. * **CID MISSION: Complete Destruction without Retreat (Ultimate++) in a party that must include Laguna and FF VIII heroes only!** Laguna is required for this one, so don't forget to slot him in. No FFVIII dancer means that you can't rely on Multi-Break for the easy quick debuff.

Lower Adel's Resistance. **Notes:** * Adel is mostly magic-based, but she does have access to a fairly strong ST ranged physical attack to keep you honest - I would slot in Protectga at least. * A good portion of her magic attacks are non-elemental, so I would stick to atk/mag accessories for this battle. * Once she reaches 70% HP, she will use Ultima once. After 50% HP, she will use Ultima again, and every 4 turns after that. * Keep in mind that throughout the fight Adel will be draining Rinoa's HP, so you'll want to not only keep her up, but avoid any abilities/SB's that have AoE/random targeting. If Rinoa dies, Adel gains access to Ultimate Ultima (AoE resistance ignoring attack) and Ultima Meteor. * Other than keeping Rinoa alive, there are no other gimmicks/status effects. Just bring those ST abilities and take her out! * **JUMP START NOTES:** The fight is exactly the same except for the medal conditions, so you can let Rinoa die if desired. ****** ### Ruled by Hatred Jump Start from [[As the Sky Falls]](URL Event 1 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Edea**|454,788|None|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities ( &gt; 70% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |*0%*|*0%*|**150%**|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*| #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (40% &lt; x &lt; 70% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |**150%**|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*| #####Elemental Vulnerabilities ( &lt; 40% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |*0%*|**150%**|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*|*0%*| **Target Scores:** 1.

Note that she will always cast the magic that she is currently weak to. Gigas Armlets are great here, since they will provide resistance against all three elements. * You'll have to deal with **two scripted Dispels** in this fight, corresponding to each elemental vulnerability change. They are regular dispels, so your stat buffs/wall will remain intact. Make sure to plan how you will refresh your hastega/shellga/protectga. * Note that she does have an AoE Sleepga with a fairly high success percentage (63%), although the catch is it only affects those in the front row. If brining front-row characters, you'll want to equip sleep resist on them. * Note she also can use Graviga in the fight (303% chance, 40% max HP damage to party). ****** ****** ####**[D220 Multiplayer]** ****** ****** Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Ultima Weapon**|772,535|None (including Interrupt and Reflect)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities : **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| ||||*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%* **Target Scores:** 1.

Ultimate Light Pillar - straight up deals 99,999 damage to one person; you are going to want last stand. 2. Ultimate Gravija - 50% current HP damage to the entire party, 303% chance. 3. Ultimate Ultima Weapon - Deals a flat 3K damage to the entire front row. This can't be mitigated/avoided with magic blink. 4. Ultimate Meteor - Flat 4K damage to the entire party - can't be mitigated in any way. 5. Ultimate Ultima - Sets the entire party's HP to 1. 6. Regen - Gives Ultima Weapon Regen status, which combined with his HP means it will tick for 9999 * Note that Ultima Weapon will start using Ultimate Licht Zoire after he is brought to 80% HP, so you'll want a form of Last Stand fairly early in the fight. * Ultimate Ultima will always be used on his 3rd turn after being brought below 30% HP, and every 5 turns after that. If you save enough SB gauge, you try to zerg him near the end to avoid it. * You'll want a form of dispel to remove his regen, so make sure to slot it in somewhere. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

162,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,That feeling when powercreep / LDs / new relics make you feel OP,0,7aunxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/7aunxz/that_feeling_when_powercreep_lds_new_relics_make/,2017-11-05 12:09:11,"*tl;dr: Just boasting / feeling accomplished. Nothing to see here.* When the FFX torment D300 first came around, farming it was a risky and drawn out process - whittling Geo down with full charge until I managed to get him low enough to finish off with Tidus' BSB and Cloud USB RW... Came back to it today post-FF30th and post-magicite and made a new party involving LDed Bartz with USB and water BSB. Long story short, I stacked ...6? attack buffs (VoF, Lucky Girl, Burst mode, BSB CMD1, Cloud USB RW, Bartz USB), was enWatered and had 1 water boost relic, and 2 crit chance buffs (not even sure if they stack)... Geo got hit with Full Break, Armour Breakdown, a large Def &amp; Res break and a small Atk &amp; Def break to soften him up. Geo goes down so fast I'm having trouble figuring out how much damage I can do. Bartz BSB CMD2 (4x water spellblade) was hitting for ~15k per hit *pre-vulnerability*. Engulfing Twinstrike was hitting for ~55k per hit when vulnerable. It dual-casted, but he died before I got to see how much damage the followup attacks did. Feels good."

I am going after Earth since wind is basically most of my OSBs, the problem is I don't have wind magic. I have a fully dived Zidane with BSB1 &amp; 2 &amp; OSB, Zack chain &amp; BSB, Bartz OSB &amp; USB. Zidane is putting out about 25k-30k with OSB when Golem's shield is up even with chain, 1x vulnerability, multiple Mug's Blood, BSB cmds &amp; empower. -___- I feel like I am doing something wrong...how does one generate enough damage to drop the shield? When I took Zidane, Zack, &amp; Cloud it would take the 9 hits from Zidane's BSB, AND about 4 from Cloud's Climhazz to drop, and it would be back up about 3 turns later. I think whereas Bismarck did so much damage the quicker the better, but this one is a bit more manageable the aoe is the real killer. So was thinking instead of trying to power through with OSBs maybe just keep activating high hit BSBs &amp; see the numbers in the chain go up?? Any advice &amp; input helps, thanks for your time!"

However, all of her magic attacks are piercing, so don't bother with Shellga or Wall - stick with stacking magic breaks. Her magic spells are mostly lightning-based, though she does have water and non-elemental attacks as well. * Note that the Goddess starts the battle with Haste and Shell, and both are undispellable. Therefore, it is preferred to go with melee characters here. * On her 5th turn, she will use Cloud Heaven, which inflicts a 30s Doom on your entire party - make sure you bring along enough DPS to defeat her in time. * The most annoying aspect of this fight is that at 70% and 50% HP, the Goddess will use Lullaby (AoE, 51% chance to inflict Sleep). Make sure to bring along sleep resist, status blink, or the Enkidu Magicite! * Imperils are quite useful here to circumvent her Omni-resist (except for lightning and holy obviously). ****** ### Wisdom of the Goddess (Apocalypse +) **JUMP START** Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Goddess**|507,830|None (including Interrupt)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities: **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |*70%*|*70%*|*-100%*|*70%*|*70%*|*70%*|*-100%*|*70%*|*70%* **Target Scores:** 1.

Lower Chadarnook's Magic. 2. Use a fire attack on Chadarnook when in demon form. 3. Use a holy attack on Chadarnoook when in Goddess form. **Note(s):** * This fight is a little different than the last time we encountered Chadarnook. It will start in its Goddess form, and will stay in this form for 15 turns unless you hit it with a holy attack (you definitely want to make sure you do so prior to her 3rd turn, as she will cast AoE confuse). In addition, if you try to attack it with any non-holy ability, it will counter with AoE Confuse or AoE Sleep. * After the Goddess is hit with a holy attack, it will change to its Demon Form. The Demon form is 100% immune to all physical attacks until it is hit by a holy or fire magic attack (you only need to do this once!). Chadarnook will stay in Demon form for 3 of its turns before reverting back to its Goddess form. You'll then need to hit it with another holy attack to switch it back to Demon Form. * Chadarnook will go back and forth between the two forms until it hits 30% HP, after which it will stay in Demon form and lose its fire vulnerability for the rest of the fight. * While the boss shouldn't be in Goddess form very long, it will either do a 4 hit ST attack or Thundaja. The Demon Form has potent magic attacks (including a piercing water magic damage), but also hasa 4 hit ST attack and a very strong (344% physical damage) ST attack which carries with it a 30% chance to confuse. Both physical attacks can be tauntilated, removing all physical damage from the fight. * You'll be dealing with water, lightning, and ice damage throughout the fight, though I would prioritize lightning first, then water. The Demon form also has a 20% chance to counter white/black magic with a ST Thundara, and a 15% chance to counter physical attacks with a ST Drain. * Note that at the 30% mark, Chadarnook will use an AoE regular dispel, so be ready to rebuff at the transition! * **Jump Start Notes:** Same notes as above apply - remember everyone starts at 0 ATB bar, so try to have your holy attack user go first to make sure you avoid the Turn 3 Temptation. ****** ****** ####**[D220 Multiplayer]** ****** ****** Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Air Force - Main Body**|581,393|None (including Interrupt)|All **Air Force - Missile Bay**|???|None (including Interrupt)|All **Air Force - Laser Gun**|???|None (including Interrupt)|All **Bit**|???|None (including Interrupt)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Air Force - All Parts): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |||**150%**|*0%*|*0%*|**150%**|||*0%*| #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Bit): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |*-100%*|*-100%*|*-100%*|*-100%*|*-100%*|*-100%*|*-100%*|*-100%*|*-100%*| **Target Scores:** 1.

Lower an enemy's Magic. **Notes:** * The first will start with the Air Force, which consists of his three parts: the Main Body, the Missile Bay, and the Laser Gun. Only the main body needs to be defeated to end the battle. * As a note, I didn't do this battle in JP, so the notes are based on how the Air Force fight traditionally works. Appreciate any corrections in the comments. * If you destroy the Missile Bay before you destroy the laser Gun, Air Force will spawn a Bit. The Bit absorbs all elemental damage, and draws all ST WHT/BLK magic to it. After a countdown, the main body will use Wave Cannon, which reduces the entire party to 1 HP. * If you are going to destroy the missile bay and laser gun, just make sure you defeat the Laser Gun first. * The Main body has both AoE physical and a ST magic attack. The Missile Pod will either choose to use a gravity attack (ST or 3-target), or Ultimate Launcher, which hits 5 people for heavy physical damage with a chance to interrupt, and the Laser Gun will use mostly AoE physical and magic attacks. * Instant KO resist accessories are fairly useful here, as the Missile Bay has a couple gravity attacks, and the Air Force has a chance to counter all attacks with a ST gravity attack. * The Main Body doesn't have a lot of HP, so zerging is certainly an option, but the Missile Bay and Laser Gun will be dealing hefty damage to you while you do this. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

165,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,[30th Anniversary] Crystal Tower &amp; Omega Weapon Megathread,51,71kosp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/71kosp/30th_anniversary_crystal_tower_omega_weapon/,2017-09-22 03:23:35,"The long awaited 30th Anniversary arrives to Global! This megathread will cover two dungeons: The Crystal Tower and the Battle against Omega Weapon. For the crystal tower, the way it works is there will be 5 battles at first (each is associated with 3 to 4 FF games, and characters from those games will receive synergy - core characters will receive synergy for all fights). Note that if you use a character in one of those battles, he/she is unable to participate in the other four. After you defeat all five battles, a 6th battle against Chaos will unlock. Note that you will only be able to use the 25 characters in the first 5 battles against Chaos. Initially only the classic version will be available, later on an elite version will be added, where the first 5 battles are in the D140 range, and Chaos is a 220 boss. For Omega Weapon, there are SP and MP versions of the fight, and his mechanics are different than the last two times we faced him. Read below to find out! **Event starts: 24 September** **Event ends: 12 October** ****** #The Crystal Tower - Chaos Descends (Stats are for elite versions) ****** #####01: 1st Flight - Fallen Magus Xande (FF I / FF II / FF III) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Xande**|??|??|All **Target Score:** 1. Lower Xande's Magic. **Notes:** * Except for a token physical attack, everything here is magic-based - prepare accordingly. * Note that he has a chance to cast Protect and Haste on himself, so you may want to slot in a form of dispel. * Xande will act twice per turn, so make sure to keep your HP topped off! * Celes/Exdeath work well here, daring in all the ST spells and keeps them safe from all the AoE spells. ****** #####02: 2nd Flight - Ultima Weapon (FF IV / FF V / FF VI) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Ultima Weapon**|??|None|All **Target Score:** 1. Defeat Ultima Weapon without being KO'ed. **Notes:** * Ultima Weapon is mostly magic-based - he does have one fairly strong ST physical attack, but can be taunted so isn't a big concern. You'll want max magic mitigation/debuffs. * Note that once he enters his weak phase, he will use AoE more often and gain access to a ST magic attack capable of paralyzing one of your party members (bring along Ultra Cure!). ****** #####03: 3rd Flight - Tonberry King (FF VII / FF VIII / FF IX) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Tonberry King**|??|None|All **Target Score:** 1. Lower Tonberry King's Attack. **Notes:** * Don't worry - this boss isn't based off the MP battle we had a couple months ago. Tonberry King is 100% physical, so you can leave Shellga/MBD at home. * Tonberry King will either use one of his ST attacks, or Junk (AoE physical attack). Very straightforward fight. ****** #####04: 4th Flight - Hashmal (FF X / FF XI / FF XII / FFT) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Hashmal**|??|None|All **Target Score:** 1. Lower Hashmal's Magic. **Notes:** * Hashmal starts the fight with Protect active, and will use haste on his first turn. In addition, he will refresh both at 50% - you'll definitely want to slot in a form of dispel. * Hashmal has mixed attacks here (to include both AoE physical/magic). All of his magic attacks are earth-based, but keep in mind his Quakeja is AoE and has a chance to inflict slow. ****** #####05: 5th Flight - Alexander (FF XIII / FF XIV / FF XV / FF T-0) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Alexander**|??|None|All **Target Score:** 1. Lower Alexander's Attack. **Notes:** * Alexander is 100% physical - leave Shellga/MBD at home. * Alexander has a mix of ST and AoE attacks. After he is brought below 50% HP, he will activate Lofty Challenge, which gives him a chance on every turn to act twice. * Other than that, nothing else to this fight - regular tank and spank. ****** #####06: Chaos Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Chaos**|??|None|All **Target Score:** None **Notes:** * Chaos is mostly magic-based, although he does have one AoE physical attack (Trample) to keep you honest. * As always with Chaos, the only wrinkle here is his scripted Stop attack - make sure to bring Affliction Break/Accessories/Status Blink to help you get through it! * Chaos does not have his typical Omni-resist here, so feel free to use which elements work best for you! ****** ###Speed Battle - Treasure Race ****** #####Omega Weapon - Extreme (Single Player) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Omega Weapon**|500,000|Stop (Phase 3 only)|All **Target Score:** 1. Defeat Omega Weapon with at least 2 or more heroes not KO'ed. **Notes:** * His AI is very scripted. Refer to /u/CareerSMN 's [[comment]](URL for the AI. * Stats are as follows: ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| 1316|7500|1172|10,000|100/100/650|575/600/650| * Omega Weapon has a very strong mixed arsenal, with damaging AoE physical and magic moves. In addition, he has a few gravity-based attacks, a fixed 9,999 damage ST move, and a fixed 3,000 damage AoE move. The only status you have to worry about here are poison and paralysis, so you may want to slot in Ultra Cure. * Note that Omega Weapon is neutral to all elements in this fight. * Omega Weapon is split into three distinct phases. He will enter Phase 2 at 70% HP and Phase 3 at 50% HP. * Phase 1 is the tamest - the only thing to worry about here is the heavy damage. Note that he will use his AoE physical + paralysis move on Turn 9, so make sure you push him into Phase 2 before that. * For Phase 2, the only major change is that on Turn 1 and every 7 turns, he will lock-on someone and he will either use Ultimate Mustard Bomb (ST Piercing Physical) or Ultimate Rocket Punch (fixed 9999 damage). Last Stand will go a long way to keeping you protected. The rest of his attacks are similar to Phase 1. * In Phase 3, he becomes vulnerable to Stop (although his mind jumps to 650, so you'll definitely want healers with high Mind if going that route). He will use Ultimate Rainbow Wind on his first turn (102% chance to AoE poison), and then on Turn 6, he will use Ultimate Encircle, which has a 303% chance to deal 200% maximum HP damage to your entire party. Thus, you either want to keep him stop locked for the last 50% and/or go crazy with DPS and defeat him before his 6th turn. ****** #####Omega Weapon - Extreme (Multiplayer) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Omega Weapon**|908,745|Stop (Phase 2 only)|All **Target Score:** 1. Defeat Omega Weapon with at least 5 or more heroes not KO'ed. 2. Defeat Omega Weapon before he uses Atomic Ray. 3. Defeat Omega Weapon before he uses Berserk End. #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Phase 1 ONLY): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*| #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Phase 2 ONLY): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |||||||||| #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Phase 3 ONLY): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |**150%**|**150%**|**150%**|**150%**|**150%**|**150%**|**150%**|**150%**|**150%**| **Notes:** * Stats are as follows: Phase|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD| :--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| 1|1514|7072|1280|10,332|508|400 2|3028|6100|2560|8856|508|450 3|3028|6100|2560|8856|508|425 * Omega Weapon is split into three distinct phases - he will transition to Phase 2 at 60%, and Phase 3 at 35%. #####Phase 1 * Omega Weapon will always start the fight with AoE poison - make sure you bring along Memento of Prayer or a SB with regen, because you most absolutely need a source of Last Stand here. Note that on Turns 2 and 3 he will not act, giving you plenty of time to set up buffs for your party. * He has mixed attacks, so bring along Proshellga and Wall for sure to survive. In addition, he will use a ST 200% max HP overflow attack throughout the phase. Magic blink does block it, but you want Last Stand for sure to keep you up. Note that he always follows up the ST gravity attack with back-to-back AoE's, so you want a healer with a instant cast ST BSB command to bring that person back up immediately after Last Stand procs. * Since his ATK/MAG here isn't crazy, definitely use this time to build up your SB bar - you are going to need it in the other Phases. #####Phase 2 * At 60%, he will transition to Phase 2. He also becomes vulnerable to Stop, which you will most definitely want to exploit. His 3028 ATK/2560 MAG will absolutely tear you apart, he has access to a fixed 5K AoE attack, and since he also can counter your attacks here, if he isn't stopped you will be picked off quickly. * You'll want 2 characters here whose sole mission is to spam Stop. It is absolutely vital to keep him stopped here while you DPS him down to 35%. * Note that on his 10th turn he will use Atomic Ray, which will cause you to lose a medal condition (and most likely wipe). #####Phase 3 * Omega loses his stop vulnerability and becomes weak to all elements here. * This phase is actually fairly straightforward. Omega Weapon will do nothing each turn - instead, he starts at 5 and counts down - once he reaches 0, he uses Berserk End, which deals a flat 60,000 damage to the entire party (and you will fail the 3rd medal condition). * Defeat him before he wipes you out. * **CID MISSION: Complete Omega Multiplayer 3 times.** ****** #####Other links: * [[Relic Guide]](URL by /u/SandSlice * [[30th Anniversary Megathread]](URL by /u/roandres If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

166,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Question - Double Cast Element &amp; Multi-Element Abilities,5,739zfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/739zfg/question_double_cast_element_multielement/,2017-09-30 05:06:15,"I was curious, as I understand most multi-element abilities will damage with the original element or the element that does the most damage (due to relic boosts, en-element, resistance, and/or vulnerabilities). My question is... if I have a legend materia that may double cast water abilities and I'm using a water/wind ability against wind vulnerability, can that ability still double cast even though it's damaging as wind?"

Most common debuffer was a Support 5, except at FFVII, FFXI and FFXII. *Pattern*: Torment realm has at least one character which can exploit its boss vulnerability (except FFV and FFXI with mixed vulnerabilities, but still exploitable though). That's makes Torments fairly easier. All my chosen damage dealers follows this pattern. Cloud USB has not been used as RW.

168,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,CT BSB Selection Pull Poll: Beatrix vs Fujin vs TGcid,0,75iewx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/75iewx/ct_bsb_selection_pull_poll_beatrix_vs_fujin_vs/,2017-10-11 03:58:26,"So I already have the BSB for Sarah, Kain, Aerith, Yuna, Larsa, and Y'shtola and although I really like Minwu's Burst I already have lots of them for healers which hurts Vanille's prospects as well as I already got Alphi's SSB+BSB to handle Reflect Damage when I need it. So... That leaves the three BSBs I listed in the title as being the best picks. I have both Beatrix's SSBs and the others have their SSB+OSB. I have 2 Imperils for Wind &amp; Lightning but not any for Holy, but I never make real use of any Imperils aside from off a Magicite or sometimes (very rarely) via a RW since I have soo many EnElementals I usually just go with those to take advantage of natural Vulnerability if I do anything. That makes choosing Beatrix's BSB seem a bit foolhardy, plus I've got a couple of other Sentinels as well. I do like the idea of having a MND sword that also has +Holy, but I already have plenty of weapons with MND and even more +Holy swords&amp;sticks so it isn't necessary. Fujin's BSB has the same entry BDown as my Marach does so it's not like I need her's for mage teams but I must say that the Relic is really really attractive since the few +Wind weapons I have only have it with RS and I love ranged &amp; hybrid weapons. But again, I do have her SSB + OSB and she can spam Wrath... Yet Orlandeau has the same thing going for him too when using LS, just without the EnElement part but that's not a big issue really to me between being able to get it for Holy or Lightning from a RW if I really needed it or else by critically hitting. Either way or for either element he will be able to equip 2 relics that boost this damage and still reach (or breach) ATK Softcap in any realm without very much effort which isn't something I can say will be true for Fujin if I chose her relic since it takes a lot more effort to hit the MAG softcap in general but is even harder to do without a RS stick equipped. Also getting Orlandeau's BSB would allow him to be self sufficient via Burst Mode buffs so I won't need to run Dervish/DB on him or else include someone to buff him, and will truly add Dark element functionally to his Holy and Lightning exceptionalism which will become even more badass when he gets DRK5 access added, which I also have double relics I can run on him. So given this situation rather than any of them in a vaccum what would you do? Simply place your votes by posting a name, and if you care to explain or expound on how you feel please add it but as a separate paragraph spaced underneath a name by itself as I will be counting up their total votes. Thanks guys. ... or girls."
169,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,EX Modes - Zidane stealing hearts,41,7696a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/7696a7/ex_modes_zidane_stealing_hearts/,2017-10-14 12:15:37,"[{INDEX}](URL *** A teenage thief with a simian tail is asked to kidnap a princess and subsequently falls in love with her as she asks for his protection. Sounds like your everyday fairy tale, right? Zidane gets to steal other things in Record Keeper, but ironically, he's not stealing any stats on his EX Mode. (Curse you, Vaan!) Instead, he does ten random-target hits with Imperil Wind, and follows up any *damaging* Thief ability with a single-target Wind/Non-Elemental attack that has a 35% chance to add minor Imperil Wind. In case you're wondering, regular Imperil adds 20% to elemental vulnerability, and minor Imperil adds 10% instead; Imperils can be stacked up to 60%, and the maximum vulnerability attainable is 200%, or double damage. *** # Budget Builds * **Lifesiphon** Standard SB-building ability. Zidane does have some potential Soul Break combos as well, so this can help set those up. * **Draw Fire** ""Protect girls!"" And Quina. While he's not a top-tier tank, especially in IX with two other Knights, he can use this to divert annoying physical attacks and build SB this way instead. * **Steal Power** It's a good self-buffing skill when not using Shout or an equivalent; the debuff isn't too potent, but useful against DEF-ignoring attacks. It won't activate the Follow Up, though. * **Steal Defense** Also a non-damaging Thief ability, and its main purpose is an Armor Break(down) substitute, enhancing physical damage. * **Steal HP** It's fairly poor as a damage ability, but it's a budget option. * **Wind Slash** On the other hand, this is a somewhat better 2\* ability, but it's Celerity not Thief. Still, it can take advantage of the Imperil. # Ability Builds Thief abilities are of course preferred, although some aren't good. (Mug Time, for instance, is rarely useful, since most enemies are immune to debuffs and the party should always be hasted anyways.) * **Dash &amp; Slash** This is the prime ability for being Wind elemental and Thief, hitting both components of the Ultra. While limited to two hits, it will be buffed to a four-hit ability in the Great Abilities Update (Global name not yet translated). As a damage ability, it can be paired with an SB-building ability like Lifesiphon or a self-buff ability like Mug Bloodlust. * **Thief's Revenge** This one's also good as a damage ability; while not hitting any element, it comes with a self-heal and is one of the only five-hit abilities available. Since it won't hit a wind weakness, it won't generate SB as fast as Dash &amp; Slash. * **Mug Bloodlust** As a debuff, it's fairly weak, with a 20% ATK/DEF steal - Steal Power is a better ability for enhancing and mitigating physical damage (unless already using Shout), at least until the abilities update when Mug Bloodlust actually becomes competitive. It's also a Thief ability, so it works well with the EX Mode. Just beware that ATK/DEF is a somewhat common buff ID. The buff will not stack with Reks's BSB, for instance, and the debuff will overwrite stronger debuffs like Auron's SSB or Lion's BSB (but also will overwrite weaker Burst Commands like on Sazh's BSB or Setzer's BSB). If the physical mitigation is important, other options are better to use. The primary purpose of this is for stacking and for compressing needed abilities into limited slots. # Soul Break Builds A lot of Zidane's Soul Breaks take a single-tracked mindset - just look at Zidane's Uniques and other early ones for similarities. That actually makes it easier to combo some of these, though whether it's desirable to combo these is debatable. * **Stellar Circle 5 (BSB)** Imperils stack, so this work with the Ultra. The problems are that the Burst Commands are single-hit and have no element, limiting their own damage potential (even with buffing Zidane), and that a lot of this utility can be replicated with abilities. So you might not want to waste a second SB bar for this. * **Storm Impulse (SSB)** Simple: as an En-Wind, it will power up the Ultra, the Follow Up Attacks, and Dash &amp; Slash. * **Solution 9 (BSB)** This is an indirect upgrade to the two above (just as the Burst is an indirect upgrade to the first Super, which itself is an upgrade to the Uniques). It enters with an En-Wind. Command 1 gives a stacking ATK steal - with a different buff ID from Steal Power, so it plays nice with Shout teams. Command 2 bestows the ATK buff from Command 1 to the party. All these abilities are Wind elemental and Thief, so if Zidane can spare two SB bars for this, he'll be turned into a wind utility machine. Just bear in mind that the Burst Commands are only two-hit, so you'd be doing this primarily for the ATK buff and imperil but not damage. * **Meteo Twister (OSB)** Just bring Beatrix, Freya, Garnet, and Eiko to the party. Not Kuja. It's close to a standard OSB either way, and will benefit from the imperil, although Overstrikes tend to pair better with en-elements or as finishers to chains. *** # Legend Materia Zidane's Legend Materia synergize well with the EX Mode. The first simply increases Wind damage by 10%, useful for augmenting on top of the Imperil. The second is a risk, caused when Zidane is below 20% HP, making him enter Trance Mode like in IX, which restores his HP, raises stats by 15%, and makes all Thief abilities instant. The tricky part is either waiting for the boss to attack enough to trigger it for you (which is unreliable, and could lead to a short KO afterwards if the boss was already doing that much damage), or else trigger it by self-attacking, which requires calculation beforehand to get it to just the right point. A common tactic is to use a piercing ability, so the damage depends only on the caster's offense stats and not the target's defense stats - the thing to remember for all the mathcrafters out there is that abilities targeting your party, even if also cast by a party member, use the enemy damage formula, not the player damage formula. The relic one gives a 35% chance to give one turn of quick cast after using a Thief ability. It's redundant with the LM2 (so you should generally use LM1+LM2 or LM1+LMR), but it's safer to use, and lasts throughout the battle instead of a single 25-second duration that can activate only once - this may be important if a Trance is mistimed, or in a really long battle like Torment Dungeons. If you can wait a while, Zidane will get a second relic one, which gives a 25% chance to doublecast Wind abilities. This won't give any extra chances for Follow Up Attacks and minor Imperils, but it will increase his damage by more than the LM1 on average. *** Regardless of how you use this, Zidane's Ultra can be a valuable addition to a wind team while still allowing him to deal decent damage on his own, given how he can stack up others' damage."

The featured reward are the special 5* motes for the speciality skillsets (what we received in the Five Dooms events), along with orbs and crystals. For this Torment dungeon, we'll be getting Bard motes! Here are some general notes about Torment Dungeons: * Torment dungeons cost 60 stamina. However, should you flee the battle or die, all stamina will be refunded. * No continuing allowed! If you wipe, you have to leave the dungeon and cannot use a mythril to revive. * The trash is not to be trifled with - they all have seriously high HP and do major damage - don't be afraid to use your mitigation and Soul Breaks to make it easier! * Torment dungeons will return on a rotating schedule, so if you can't complete it, just wait until next time and hopefully you'll have some new gear to help you out! **Event format:** 1.

Defeat Shadow Dragon before he uses Black Fang. 2. Lower Golbez's Magic. 3. Exploit Golbez's weakness to holy attacks. **Note(s) / Strategy:** * You'll definitely want Ultra Cure for this trash. One of the mobs can use a ST paralyze, the Gold Dragon can counter your attacks with a ST paralyze, and the Ahriman will use confuse and berserk; in addition, you'll face both physical and magic attacks, so you'll want proshellga up from the start. All trash is vulnerable to slow and berserk if you choose to go that route. * Golbez is mostly magic-based, and will use fire/ice/lightning/dark attacks; he does have a standard AoE physical attack to keep you honest. There are no water attacks here, so Gigas Armlet will provide a wide variety of coverage (do note his only piercing attack is Ultimate Drain, which is magic based and he will start using when below 70% HP). * As far as Golbez' weaknesses go, Golbez will be weak to one of fire/ice/lightning, and will change either when you hit him with that element, or when he takes 3 turns, whichever comes first. He is neutral to the two elements he isn't weak to. After 70% HP, he drops the whole elemental wall change and just takes neutral damage from those three elements. * Shadow Dragon is all physical, and will use either a ST or AoE physical attack on each of its turns. You only have 10 of his turns to defeat Shadow Dragon before he uses Black Fang (and after the 10th turn, he will use Shadow Fang on every 3rd turn). Black Fang is an auto-hit Instant KO attack, so it cannot be mitigated against - your only options are Reraise or Galuf Invincibility (although you need to defeat him before the 10th turn for medal conditions). Shadow Dragon is fairly fast in both fights (600), so you want to use the trash to build up your SB gauge so you can hit Shadow Dragon hard right away. * **CID MISSION:** **Complete The Dark Mage (200 DU level) with a party of only FF IV heroes!** P. Cecil and Ceodore are great choices for holy DPS, and unless you have one of Cid's SB's for break purposes, you are going to bring along Edward. Form the rest of your team accordingly. ****** ####**[Jump Start]** ****** ### The Dark Mage (FF IV) 60 STAM - 300 Difficulty (1 round total) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Golbez**|608,675|None (including Interrupt)|All **Shadow Dragon**|314,380|None (including Interrupt)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Golbez, &gt; 70% HP): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |**120%**^(See Notes)|**120%**^(See Notes)|**120%**^(See Notes)|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*||*50%*|*50%* #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Golbez, &lt; 70% HP &amp; Shadow Dragon): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| ||||*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|**120%**|*50%*|*50%* **Target Scores:** 1.

Golbez is now only weak to holy when below 70% HP, and both Shadow Dragon and Golbez (when he is weak to holy) only take 20% additional damage. * Shadow Dragon is the same here mechanically - you still have only 10 turns to defeat him before he uses Black Fang. * Golbez's arsenal is mostly the same except now he has access to Cold Air (AoE Paralyze, 33%). It does not do any damage, so it cannot be blinked. Above 70% HP, he will use it on his 6th turn in a specific elemental vulnerability form (which does mean he has to be in a specific weakness at least twice before he can use it, since he will stay at max 3 turns in a form if you don't exploit the weakness). After 70% HP, he will use it on his 10th turn and every 5 turns after that. Paralyze can really ruin a run, so bring along some way to mitigate (healer w/ paralyze resist and Ultra Cure, status blink, affliction breaks, etc.). * Other than the Cold Air addition, everything else is pretty much the same. * **CID MISSION:** **Complete The Dark Mage (300 DU level) with 1/2/3 FF IV heroes!** ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP! ****** ###Other links: * [[JP Zurai Guide]](URL - by /u/Zurai001 * [[Enemy Stats &amp; AI]] TBD by /u/TFMurphy"

In addition, once they are below 40% HP, they can cast Mighty Guard (Protect/Shell). * Overall, a fairly easy fight - given their limited HP pools, would be best to zerg one down as soon as possible, which will make the rest of the fight much more manageable. ****** ### Ancient Beasts (Ultimate ++) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Archaeosaur**|212,278|Slow|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities: **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |*50%*|**150%**|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%*|*50%* **Target Scores:** 1.

If you are planning on bringing front row physical characters, make sure to give them petrify resistance (don't forget that being petrified removes all your buffs, so even if you bring along Ultra Cure, that person is ripe to be one shot if you don't rebuff in time). * The Archaeosuar's do have a piercing physical attack, but only ST. * Note that they do have a 30% chance to counter black magic with a ST physical (which can be taunted if desired). * **CID MISSION: Complete Ancient Beasts (Ultimate++) in a party of FF VIII heroes only!** Going with no front row characters may be difficult here (especially if you have Squall's later relics), so make sure to give them petrify resistance.

Gigas Armlets are great here, since they will provide resistance against all three elements. * You'll have to deal with **two scripted Dispels** in this fight, corresponding to each elemental vulnerability change. They are regular dispels, so your stat buffs/wall will remain intact. Make sure to plan how you will refresh your hastega/shellga/protectga. * Note that she does have an AoE Sleepga with a fairly high success percentage (63%), although the catch is it only affects those in the front row. If brining front-row characters, you'll want to equip sleep resist on them. * Note she also can use Graviga in the fight (303% chance, 40% max HP damage to party). * **Jump Start Notes:** This time your party will start at 50% ATB. As is typical with the A+ Jump Start, they are significantly easier than the regular A+ battle. Don't forget about her two scripted dispels! ****** ****** ####**[D220 Multiplayer]** ****** ****** Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Tonberry King**|924,833|None (including Interrupt)|All **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Tonberry King with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. 2. Lower Tonberry King's Resistance. 3. Lower Tonberry King's Defense. **Notes:** * This is a 100% physical fight, so no need for Shellga/MBD. Honestly, even stacking multiple layers of break isn't too valuable here, mostly due to Tonberry King's It's Sharp! Attack. As he gets weaker it starts doing overflow damage, as well as carry a 93% chance of Instant KO. Note that It's Sharp! will target the character with the highest % HP. * After the first few turns, Tonberry King has a pretty scripted set of attacks. He will use Junk every 5 turns, and in between he either will use It's Sharp (80%/90%/100% depending on the phase) or nothing (20%/10%/0%). * Further compounding things is his Junk attack, which has a 48% chance to Sap, lowering the value of Last Stand unless you bring along Affliction Break, Sap Resist accessories, and a source of regen. * Physical blink here is the best mitigation, since it prevents all of his attacks and buys you more time. * Honestly, this is a DPS race. Bring along the right balance of healing/mitigation/buffing, and take him out as quickly as possible before you get overwhelmed. * Yuna's USB is very valuable here, and can absolutely turn the battle around. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

173,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,[Final Fantasy 6 Full Throttle] boss guide,22,6rs98c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/6rs98c/final_fantasy_6_full_throttle_boss_guide/,2017-08-06 01:11:53,"Because Full Throttle fights recur every time an event of that realm comes around, and because we're starting to see Full Throttle fights which differ substantially from their A+ versions, I'm going to separate out Full Throttle fights from the standard event boss guide. This means that there will be a single resource (per realm) to refer to for every event-based Full Throttle boss. The bosses will be listed with the most recent first, next most recent next, etc; this is the same order they are displayed in game, to minimize confusion. --- ###**Boss:** + Ultima Weapon Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Default|220|620,000|1200|4320|1260|6600| |600 Weak| | | | |1320|6720| |630 Very Weak| | |1320| |1440|6840| |650 **Medal Conditions:** Win with at least 3 characters alive. **Status Vulnerabilities:** None! **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental, Mind **Moveset:** * (Default only) Attack (PHY: ST 110% physical) * (Default only) Flame (NAT: ST 490% magical fire) * (Default only) Flare (BLK: ST 410% magical non-element) * (Weak/V Weak only) Mind Blast (NAT: ST 490% magical non-element, 78% chance to Paralyze) * (Weak/V Weak only) Flarestar (NAT: AOE 486% piercing^0.57 magical non-element, ignores Magic Blink) * (Weak/V Weak only) Fira (BLK: ST 490% magical fire) * (Weak/V Weak only) Bio (BLK: ST 490% magical bio, 78% chance to Poison) * (Weak/V Weak only) Graviga (BLK: ST 303% chance to 50% current HP gravity) * (Weak/V Weak only) Quake (NAT: AOE 390% magical earth) * (Weak/V Weak only) Tornado (NAT: ST 410% magical wind) * (Weak/V Weak only) Meteor (NAT: AOE 438% magical non-element) * (Weak/V Weak only) Full Power (NAT: AOE 300% physical) **Notes and Strategies:** In Default phase (>70% HP), Ultima Weapon uses Attack on its 1st and 2nd turns. In Weak phase (70%-40% HP), Ultima Weapon uses Flarestar on its 1st turn, Bio on its 2nd turn, and Gravity on its 4th turn and every 7th turn thereafter; it always follows Tornado with Quake and uses Full Power every 4th turn at the most infrequent after first using it. In Very Weak phase (<40% HP), Ultima Weapon uses Full Power on its 1st turn, Gravity on its 2nd turn and every 7th turn thereafter; it always follows Tornado with Quake and uses Full Power every 4th turn at the most infrequent after first using it. The Full Throttle version of Ultima Weapon gets a huge stat boost and completely loses its vulnerability to fire damage. All its attacks are the same, but they'll all hit harder due to Ultima Weapon having higher stats across the board. Its damage is *almost* entirely magical, but it has Full Power as a strong AOE physical option so you can't completely neglect physical mitigation. Watch out for the scripted Flarestar at 70% HP; you can't blink it and it's a very strong piercing attack. --- ###**Boss:** + Goddess Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Default|220|507,830|1117|4423|1149|6653|608|600 Weak| | |1146| |1178| | |625 Very Weak| | |1168| |1200| | |650 **Medal Conditions:** Reduce Goddess's magic.

Goddess uses Lullaby on her 1st turn in Weak phase and again in Very Weak phase. She uses Quasar a minimum of once every 4 turns across phases once she uses it the first time, and she uses Cloudy Heaven on her 5th global turn. Goddess begins the battle under permanent (un-Dispellable) Haste and Shell status, which are not reflected in the above numbers. With the exception of her token physical attack, all of Goddess's attacks are piercing magic damage, so load up on your magic debuffs and leave your Protectga, Shellga, and Wall at home. She puts the entire party under a 30 second Doom timer on her 5th turn, so you're under a pretty tight time limit here. Thankfully, she only reduces non-thunder/holy damage dealt to her by 30%, so you can still get good mileage out of Attach Element and Imperil SBs despite her omniresist. You'll probably want to bring Sleep resistance and/or Affliction Break to make Lullaby suck less. The Magicite Enkidu also offers an instant AOE heal and Esuna, which is extremely valuable when your healer with Ultra Cure gets Slept and everyone else is in BSB mode. --- ###**Boss:** + Chadarnook Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Goddess|220|403,524|986|4525|963|7602|608|550 Demon, Default| | |1054|4523|1013|7678|567| Demon, Weak| | |1092|4690|1052|7853| |600 Demon, Very Weak| | |1330|4858|1291|7992| |650 **Medal Conditions:** Reduce + Chadarnook's magic.

It will switch to Demon form immediately upon being damaged by any holy attack, or after 15 turns spent in Goddess form. In Goddess form, Chadarnook always counters every attack which does not deal holy damage with either Lullaby or Temptation. In Demon form, Chadarnook will transform back to Goddess form after its 3rd turn. Demon form is completely immune to physical attacks (they will miss) until it is damaged by fire magic. Chadarnook will no longer switch to Goddess form and will immediately switch out of Goddess form to Demon form once reduced to 30% or fewer HP. * In Goddess form, Chadarnook uses Temptation on its 3rd turn, Lullaby on its 4th turn, Dispel on its 5th turn, Temptation on its 8th turn, Lullaby on its 9th turn, and Dispel on its 10th turn. * In Demon form, Default phase, Chadarnook always follows Flash Rain and Thundaga with Hard Hit. * In Demon form, Weak phase, Chadarnook always follows  Flash Rain,  Poltergeist, and Thundaga with Hard Hit. * In Demon form, Very Weak phase, Chadarnook uses Dispel on its 1st turn, Hard Hit on its 2nd turn, and  Flash Rain on its 3rd turn. It always follows  Flash Rain with Hard Hit and  Poltergeist and Thundaga with Blizzaga. "
174,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,[JS Torment Guide] Building a Cloud USB team,36,6trsvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/6trsvl/js_torment_guide_building_a_cloud_usb_team/,2017-08-15 13:51:10,"There have been a number of posts asking about how to properly set up teams for the D300 JS torments, with most focusing on Cloud USB teams. There are plenty of resources out there on how to construct mage teams, elemental teams, etc., so I wanted to put down some thoughts on this one very specific use case, which is particularly useful for people that eventually want to farm the D300s. This is much more oriented towards near end-game players who haven't quite figured out how to build their teams for JS, or who don't quite know what types of things to pull for, etc. Given the subject matter, it obviously assumes a certain level of SB ownership, so is not intended for everyone. Lastly, I'm sure there are others who have spent as much if not more time thinking about this, so by all means let me know if you have any suggestions on how this could be modified. ###Basic principles Clouds USB provides the user with three benefits, all of which are only useful for physical users: 1. +30% physical damage 2. 100% crit rate 3. Each individual hit can break the damage cap The first two are worth mentioning, only insofar as people frequently seem to say that Im not capping right now, so Cloud USB wont do much for me. Clouds USB provides a significant boost to damage by itself, so dont focus on that too much. Also, as /u/Spirialis and /u/investtherestpls have pointed out, it's worth noting that while item 1 and 3 are both part of EX: Soldier mode, item 2 is distinct and will last for 25s. So even if EX mode runs out, you still have 10s remaining to inflict boosted damage using whatever else you have with strong damage potential. The third item is obviously where the magic comes in. The main thing to note is that since theres no more damage cap, **the only thing we really care about is boosting the overall multiplier on damage.** Except in certain cases (e.g. OSBs, which you should avoid), the number of hits is effectively inconsequential. Also of critical importance is that Clouds EX mode only lasts 15 seconds. So a key element in any strategy is squeezing in as much damage as possible within that time frame. Given that this is a JS party where everyone starts with three SB bars, youll want to fill that time almost exclusively with SB uses to the extent possible. Where you cant, you should again be using whatever abilities will provide the highest damage multiple in the shortest time frame, as opposed to the most number of hits or anything similar. The corollary to this point is that BSBs are really only useful for their entries; their commands in most cases should be ignored. BSB commands generally have low multipliers, and while great for creating sustained damage over a longer period of time, are mostly crap if your goal is to destroy a D300 boss in <15 seconds. If you absolutely need to use something while under Cloud USB that isnt an SB, use a 5-6 star ability with a really high multiple and a very short cast time (e.g. Dervish, Quickhit). ###Party set-up Because of the above, the goal of any JS team is to amp up the damage of our prospective Cloud USB user. As a consequence, you almost always want to use an enElement team, preferably aligned with the bosss native weakness. Here are the key components: 1. **Cloud USB user**  Should have an enElement SB with the highest possible multiple, fitted to the number of targets. For a number of elements (specifically, Holy, Dark, Fire, Water), this may actually be an SSB instead of a USB or BSB. Another alternative would be to use one low-multiple SB for the enElement, then switch to another with a higher multiple. So long as this team member can hit the ATK softcap after boosts, he/she should be loaded up with as much +element gear as possible. RM should also be +damage, preferably one that will have a multiplicative boost rather than an additive one. As /u/krissco has noted, RM damage boosts will always be multiplicative with gear boosts, so the main factor here is to ensure that the RM isn't boosting an element or school that is also being boosted by any Record Dives, in which case the bonus would be additive. 2. **Boostga/Crit damage up**  Fairly obvious reasons. First is to get your Cloud USB user over the ATK soft cap, the second to pair with the 100% crit rate fixer. The best options here are Ramza (with Shout + Chant) and Zack (CSB), although Ramza has a bit of an edge outside of Wind parties, due to having haste and stoneskin. There is something of a trade-off in that Zack can get both the boostga and the critga up in one turn vs. two for Ramza, but given that your Cloud USB user needs to use the first round for the RW anyway, it tends to not be a huge distinction. Also, Zack does have a hastega SB which you could potentially use, but it may be less valuable depending on how many people in your party are using Bursts. For an RM, you may want to use either a haste-provider or TGM to ensure that these bursts go off first in your launch sequence. 3. **Imperil**  Self-explanatory. Depending on the situation, this may also be the user of your other Cloud USB charge, so having a higher multiple here will also be helpful. If you dont have this, you can likely swap in another enElement user if you have one of those. This character should also be outfitted with a +damage RM. 4. **Debuffs**  The goal of the debuffer here is to lower DEF, not ATK or MAG. Users with DEF/RES, ATK/DEF or MAG/DEF breaks will be optimal, e.g. Vaan, Lion, OK SSB, etc. being fantastic options. Pentabreak users are fine but slightly less preferable, as Pentabreak's %DEF reduction is only 30%. Youll want these characters to also bring Armor Breakdown and Full Break. From an RM perspective, another +damage RM, although of the three damage dealers, this one is by far the least important (particularly if youre using a dancer for AoE battles). 5. **Healer**  Somewhat less consequential, but youll want someone who can keep everyone alive for somewhere between 2.5  4 rounds. Relms USB is incredibly desirable due to her party instacast effect, but Yshtola (Wall + Asylum) or most instacast USB users will typically be enough to let you squeak by. To the extent you find that you need mitigation to stay alive, TGM is a great RM to use to ensure that you can get everything up quickly. Otherwise, doesnt really matter, you can probably go with a +healing RM if haste/TGM are going to your Booster. 6. **RW**: Cloud USB. Note that its not vitally critical that you have an element team that lines up with the bosss native weakness, as long as youre avoiding their resistances. Properly boosted, the Cloud USB user should be able to do in the neighborhood of 250k-350k per SB use, even without hitting a native weakness, and much more with it. Not all of these pieces are absolutely essential. If your Cloud USB user is strong (and *fast*) enough, you dont need a debuffer. If you have someone that can provide last stand, then you dont necessarily need a healer. The key thing is to make sure that your Cloud USB user is well positioned to do as much damage as is needed (i.e. the goal is to kill the boss as quickly as possible, not to have the most ridiculous total damage number in a round) to get you through the battle. If your user is not strong enough, then you may need to buy more time so that he/she can amp up using things like Dark Bargain or Hailstorm before hitting the USB, and the rest of your team can layer in more imperils/buffs/debuffs. ##Single target vs AoE vs Random This should be obvious, but its critical to adjust your party for single target vs. multi-target bosses. This means that youll typically need to field a different team for bosses like Belias or Gigas than you would for something like Bahamut, e.g. bring dancers and AoE SBs for multi-target bosses. Obviously, AoE SBs come with a stiff penalty on their entry multiples. Usually, this is mitigated by the fact that the bosses will have less HP (e.g. the Piglets, the Gigases). But in cases where this is not the case (e.g. Belias, Gi Nattak), you will need to mix your SB load-out so that you can do enough damage to wipe the primary boss, and possible the secondary adds. For instance, in the very recent case of Belias, it is incredibly helpful to bring one AoE SB to kill the secondaries (e.g. Beatrixs Knight Protector), and another ST SB to bring down Belias himself (e.g. Agriass Holy Knight Charge). A final note on random target SBs, which are completely fine in single target settings. I would avoid these if you are trying to do AoE damage with them, as they will do significantly less damage across multiple targets than a standard AoE SB would, even though their multiplier is nominally higher. If you are only really using them to get Imperil multiple targets, then its probably fine, but there are likely better ways for you to do this if you can get them. ###Sequencing The exact sequencing for the battle will depend on your loadout and will also depend greatly on which SBs you have. But in general, you will want to do something similar to the below: 1. Shout, Wall, DEF debuff, Cloud USB, enElement SB 2. Chant, Pro/Shellga, DEF debuff, Imperil, Cloud USB 3. [Whatever], Other part of Pro/Shellga, DEF debuff, Imperil, elemental SB 4. [Whatever], heal if needed, Imperil, elemental SB There are obviously thousands of variations on the above, depending on what buffs you have, whether you decided to have your imperil-er use the USB before your primary Cloud user does, if you need to throw in a Dark bargain before using Cloud's USB because you couldn't get enough ATK, etc. The sequencing for instacast parties will also be very different. But in general, if you can get the first big post-Cloud USB SB blast off after Shout/Chant/2-3 stacks of Imperil/2-3 stacks of DEF debuffing, then you should be good, or at least pretty close to getting there. There's a temptation to wait until you have 3 stacks of Imperil up before using Cloud USB. I'm sure there's a way to do it correctly, but be very cognizant about the fact that if you do this, you run the risk of having the initial Shout, Chant, and DEF debuffs start coming off in the middle of your Cloud USB run, which would be suboptimal. Note that the turn order is actually pretty important. If your Cloud USB user is first in your line-up, then their first blast will be significantly less powerful than if they go last, as they wont have the benefit of all the buffing/debuffing. Because of this, and also since the JS battles all start everyone at equal ATB, its generally helpful to actually have your partied ordered in the sequence that you would want to use their commands, with the first being at the top, and the Cloud USB user at the bottom. You can also put a haste RM on the person at the top of your stack to ensure they go first. Just make sure your settings in the Config menu are set to follow the sequence from top to bottom, and *wait* until the next person in sequence has full ATB when you hit your command. This is especially important when considering instacast parties, which well discuss in the next section. ###Instacast parties Unless youre /u/robaisolken, instacast parties are generally preferable if you have the right tools. ~~The main reason is that they will generally allow your Cloud USB user to squeeze in more SBs/ability uses while under EX: Soldier mode than they otherwise would. Even under haste, most Cloud USB users will only be able to squeeze in two SB uses, unless you want to get very intense about trying to eliminate input lag. This means that the third SB will need to be done prior to using Clouds USB, so that you can take advantage of the enElement right away. In an instacast party, youll be able to squeeze in a third SB under EX mode quite easily, which will massively increase the amount of damage that youll be doing (and reduce the amount of damage that you take overall).~~ Modest amendment: Given that most SBs clock in at 2.5s of cast time (although they *can* clock in at 3.0s), it should actually be fairly reasonable to input three SBs under EX mode. Assuming your Cloud USB user is under haste and not using TGC's BSB without TGM, or any of the old SBs with longer cast times, then each round should take roughly 4.5s even after incorporating .166s of input lag at Speed 1, which should be enough for most people to squeeze three uses in. So the main benefit from instacast really comes from ramping up your DPS (and consequently decreasing the amount of damage you'd need to mitigate in a battle). Its also nice to be able to get through the battles slightly faster if youre in mega-farming mode, although some consideration should be taken for the practical trade-off between how long you have to wait for an animation to go off vs. how long you're waiting for the ATB timer to tick up. Minor point, but be careful about how quickly you hit the buttons when using an instacast party. Sometimes you can actually hit them too quickly for the input lag and screw up your turn order, which can be really annoying. Key sources of party instacast are Relm's USB, Raijin's SSB, Ramza's USB, and Tellah's SSB. Relm's USB is particularly notable given that it's also instant on entry and significantly helps with survivability, given the stoneskin effect. Per /u/jadesphere, use of the Raw power RM is very effective for having her start up immediately, although a haste RM can also do the trick. ### Planning ahead As of now, there are fifteen Torments that have been released in JP so far. Going through Zurais guide, there are a few things to note. First, ten of those fifteen Torments have multiple targets, although in a handful of cases you can ignore those other targets and focus on the primary boss. This means that in at least half, if not more, of the Torments that you run into, youll need to be prepared to either use AoE SBs, or at the least AoE debuffs if youre not strong enough to straight zerg the primary boss down (although this guide primarily focuses on zerging). With respect to elemental coverage, below is a table showing the number of Torments where the boss(es) are vulnerable, neutral, or resistant to a particular element. This should loosely provide a sense for the primary elements that youll want to organize around (although check /u/Zurai001's guides for more detail). Note that since some bosses change their vulns or have other targets with different vulnerabilities, Ive taken some liberties with the classifications (i.e. if the boss picks up a vulnerability at 70% HP but isnt vulnerable at the beginning, Ive counted them as having that vulnerability): |Fire|Ice|Lightning|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio| :--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| **Vulnerability**|2|2|2|1|1|1|3|0|0| **Neutral**|8|9|9|5|8|6|8|9|7| **Resist**|5|4|4|9|6|8|4|6|8| A few take-aways: * Generally speaking, the element youll most want to optimize is Holy. It has one of the fewest number of Torments that resist it, and the most vulnerabilities. It also has very good SB coverage, across both single target and multi-target, including imperils. Remember, for Cloud USB/JS purposes, the standard definition of which soul breaks are best actually get turned on their head a bit. For instance, one of the best Holy single target SBs in the game is actually Agriass Holy Knight Charge, which has a full .57x multiple improvement over all of the USBs that are coming out. The best AoE SB to this day remains Pecils BSB, even though many people think its garbage. The best source of Imperil? Leo, if there are two or less targets. * Fire and Lightning are also really good options. Fire has good applicability across realms, and also has a ton of very good SB options. Lightning has slightly better applicability, but is a bit more limited when it comes to relic choices. * Although Wind has a larger number of bosses with resistance, but is generally pretty great. Why? Zacks CSB, if you have it. This adds a whole other level of damage to teams that are already meant to generate a ridiculous level of damage. Wind also has a very large number of associated SBs, and most people will have come by some of these. * Earth, Water, and Bio are generally not worth the investment. Lots of resistances, and they also tend to have crap options (setting aside all the people going crazy for Edge the Water God). * Despite being one of the best elements from a realm coverage perspective, there are very, very few characters with relics that slot in well for an Ice team for Cloud USB purposes. Unfortunately, for Seeker/Dark Dragon, an Ice-based SB will be *very* helpful, given that Dark Dragon only takes 20% damage from every other element. So unless you have some solid NE coverage, may be worth whaling for Axis Blade (caveat: Orb types here are Wind and White, so this is only important if you dont think you can get the clear), although Mystic Flurry will do in a pinch. ###Closing remarks Hopefully people found this helpful. If enough people are interested, then Ill consider posting a follow-up(s) with more specifics on characters/relics for each elemental party. It will be a little simple, because you basically just care about the multiple, AoE vs. Single target, and enElement/Imperil. EDIT: Thanks to everyone for their comments below, which I've done my best to incorporate. Also, a big note of thanks to /u/GoodOleJK, who I've leaned on very heavily in testing things out and also putting this together."

The attacks to watch out for are Diabolic Whistle (AoE, 15% chance to Poison/Confuse/Slow/Blind/Doom) and Ultimate Saintly Beam (High magic holy damage with 30% chance to petrify). Affliction Break/Status Blink will be helpful here! * Note that as he gets weaker he has a 15%/20%/30% chance to counter fire/lightning/holy damage with Ultimate Acid Rain - you'll want to consider building up your SB gauge and then using them in the latter half to minimize counters. ****** ### Magic and Sorrow (Ultimate ++) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Magic Master**|350,410|None (including Interrupt)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities: **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |See Notes|See Notes|See Notes|0%|0%|See Notes|See Notes|0%|See Notes **Target Scores:** 1.

For every 5 damaging attacks, he will change in a set pattern (Fire --&gt; Water --&gt; Poison --&gt; Holy). When weak to water, he absorbs lightning, when weak to poison, he absorbs holy, and when weak to holy, absorbs poison; he nulls all other elements. * Everything here is 100% magic except for a token ST physical attack. He also has access to Ultimate Ultima, which pierces resistance. * Note he will cast a ST silence throughout the battle (36% chance to land), so make sure to equip silence resist and bring along Ultra Cure for your mages. * **CID MISSION: Complete Magic and Sorrow (Ultimate++) in a party with only FF VI heroes!** There are quite a few characters who can exploit all elements for this fight.

Lower Chadarnook's Magic. 2. Use a fire attack on Chadarnook when in demon form. 3. Use a holy attacks on Chadarnoook when in Goddess form. **Note(s):** * This fight is a little different than the last time we encountered Chadarnook. It will start in its Goddess form, and will stay in this form for 15 turns unless you hit it with a holy attack (you definitely want to make sure you do so prior to her 3rd turn, as she will cast AoE confuse). In addition, if you try to attack it with any non-holy ability, it will counter with AoE Confuse or AoE Sleep. * After the Goddess is hit with a holy attack, it will change to its Demon Form. The Demon form is 100% immune to all physical attacks until it is hit by a fire magic attack. Chadarnook will stay in Demon form for 3 of its turns before reverting back to its Goddess form. You'll then need to hit it with another holy attack to switch it back to Demon Form. * Chadarnook will go back and forth between the two forms until it hits 30% HP, after which it will stay in Demon form and lose its fire vulnerability for the rest of the fight. * While the boss shouldn't be in Goddess form very long, it will either do a 4 hit ST attack or Thundaja. The Demon Form has potent magic attacks (including a piercing water magic damage), but also hasa 4 hit ST attack and a very strong (344% physical damage) ST attack which carries with it a 30% chance to confuse. Both physical attacks can be tauntilated, removing all physical damage from the fight. * You'll be dealing with water, lightning, and ice damage throughout the fight, though I would prioritize lightning first, then water. The Demon form also has a 20% chance to counter white/black magic with a ST Thundara, and a 15% chance to counter physical attacks with a ST Drain. * Note that at the 30% mark, Chadarnook will use an AoE regular dispel, so be ready to rebuff at the transistion! * **Jump Start Notes:** Same notes as above apply - remember everyone starts at 0 ATB bar, so try to have your holy attack user go first to make sure you avoid the Turn 3 Temptation. ****** ****** ####**[D220 Multiplayer]** ****** ****** Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Fiend**|924,833|None (including Interrupt)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities: **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |50%|-100%|50%|50%|50%|50%|120%|50%|-100% **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Fiend with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. 2. Lower Fiend's Attack. 3. Lower Fiend's Magic. **Notes:** * Unless you are using soul breaks or summons, **THE HOLY VULNERABILITY IS A TRAP!** Fiend will counter holy damage with Ultimate Fiendish Rage, which deals ST heavy physical damage and **Ultimate Dispels** that target - it also completely ignores physical blink. DeNA is such an expert troll ;) * Note you will have to deal with Ultimate Fiendish Rage as part of the regular fight, so you'll want to avoid any additional dispels. Honestly, as a raid leader, I would kick out any people bringing abilities like Saint Cross, Guardbringer, etc. * For those with holy physical BSB/OSB, you'll want to spend most of the battle using lifesiphon to build up SB bar, and then utilize only the SB to avoid the counter. * Fiend has a mixed offense, so bring both types of mitigation. All of his magic is ice-based, so you may want to consider ice-resist for your characters. Note he does also have access to Northern Cross (AoE Stop), so you may want to slot Affliction Break in your MP team. * Note that he can use Force Field, which will null one random element - if Holy is chosen, then that will mess up any abilities that don't have a non-elemental option to fall back on. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

[Raid Stats](URL can be found in a comment below the thread. &amp;nbsp; There's a slight change to one of the ways I've presented things from this event onwards: from now on, if an enemy is vulnerable to Interrupt, I will specifically list it in the Vulnerabilities. If the enemy is immune to Interrupt, I will still list it as a Special Immunity, so there shouldn't be any confusion there. I feel that with the MP Raids, we're getting enough Interrupt Immune enemies every week that it's better to be clear about this rather than rely on focusing on it as being solely a vulnerability or an immunity. &amp;nbsp; *** ### Wing Raptor **Stage** | **Lv** | **HP** | **ATK** | **DEF** | **MAG** | **RES** | **MND** | **SPD** | **ACC** | **EVA** :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Classic | 2 | 1480 | 18 | 3 | 21 | 6 | 15 | 294 | 150 | 100 Elite | 45 | 27999 | 120 | 78 | 136 | 154 | 140 | 294 | 150 | 100 **Immune:** Petrify, Doom, Death, Mini, Toad, Slownumb *(****Vuln:*** *Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Confuse, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sleep, Berserk, Sap, Interrupt)* After Wing Raptor's 3rd turn in Normal Form, it will shift immediately to Counter Form.

On Gogo's first four turns in Mimic Form, he will use the following four abilities in a random order: * Firaga (BLK: 410% Fire Magic Dmg) * Holy (WHT: 570% Holy Magic Dmg - Targets character with highest HP%) * Flare (BLK: 570% NonElem Magic Dmg - Targets character with highest HP%) * Meteor (BLK: AoE - 246% NonElem Magic Dmg) Gogo will become enraged if he is not mimicked properly. To mimic Gogo, you must cast the player version of the ability that Gogo has last used. Taking any different action (including Defend or calling a Roaming Warrior) will result in a failure, as will taking any action before Gogo's 1st turn, taking no action before Gogo's next turn, or casting the required mimic ability more than once. Gogo will not react to the periodic healing/damage from Regen or Sap, but will not tolerate the casting of spells that inflict those statuses. Any ability you use to mimic must finish casting before Gogo finishes casting his next action. *(Note: Due to Gogo's SPD, this gives you ~3.594 seconds to finish responding to his current action.)* On Gogo's fifth turn in Mimic Form, he will use &lt;End Mimicry&gt; (NAT: Null Action - Self only). If Gogo is still not enraged after casting this, he will shift permanently to Happy Form for the remainder of the battle. If Gogo becomes enraged, he will shift immediately to Rage - Normal Form, use &lt;Full Recovery&gt; (WHT: Null Action - Uncounterable, Self only) as an instant action, and fully recover his HP. From this point on, Gogo will act like a standard enemy with HP%-based forms. *(Note: While &lt;Full Recovery&gt; can be reflected, it has no inherent effect and Gogo will still restore his HP.)* Once enraged Gogo has been brought under 71% HP, he will shift permanently to Rage - Weak Form. Once enraged Gogo has been brought under 41% HP, he will shift permanently to Rage - Very Weak Form. If Gogo is in the middle of casting an ability when he shifts to a new form, he will abort the cast and begin in the new form with a full ATB; otherwise, his ATB is left unchanged. While in Rage - Very Weak Form, Gogo will take an extra turn as an instant action after each regular turn. **Happy Pattern:** * **Forced:** Critical &lt;AoE&gt; (PHY: AoE - 206% Phys Dmg) *[Used on 3rd turn after last use]* * **Forced:** Meteor (BLK: AoE - 246% NonElem Magic Dmg) *[Used on 4th turn after last use]* * 10% &lt;Attack&gt; (PHY: 110% Phys Dmg) * 15% Critical (PHY: 188% Phys Dmg) * 20% Critical &lt;AoE&gt; (PHY: AoE - 206% Phys Dmg) * 20% Flare (BLK: 570% NonElem Magic Dmg - Targets character with highest HP%) * 15% Holy (WHT: 570% Holy Magic Dmg - Targets character with highest HP%) * 20% Meteor (BLK: AoE - 246% NonElem Magic Dmg) **Rage - Normal Pattern:** * **Forced:** Critical (PHY: 188% Phys Dmg) *[Used on 2nd turn after last use]* * **Forced:** Haste (WHT: Auto-hit Haste - Uncounterable, Self only) *[Used on Local Turn 1 and on next turn after Maelstrom]* * 20% Critical (PHY: 188% Phys Dmg) * 15% Critical &lt;AoE&gt; (PHY: AoE - 206% Phys Dmg) *[Locked for 1 turn after last use]* * 20% Frost Blast (NAT: AoE - 246% Ice Magic Dmg, 18% chance of Sap) *[Unlocks on 3rd ATB, Locked for 4 turns after last use]* * 20% Meteor (BLK: AoE - 246% NonElem Magic Dmg) *[Unlocks on 3rd ATB, Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 20% Icestorm (NAT: AoE - 294% Ice Magic Dmg) *[Unlocks on 3rd ATB, Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 5% Maelstrom (BLK: AoE - 39% chance of 99% CurHP Dmg, resisted via Death) *[Unlocks on 5th ATB, Locked for 4 turns after last use]* **Rage - Weak Pattern:** * **Forced:** Critical (PHY: 188% Phys Dmg) *[Used on 2nd turn after last use]* * **Forced:** Haste (WHT: Auto-hit Haste - Uncounterable, Self only) *[Used on Local Turn 1 and on next turn after Maelstrom]* * **Forced:** Aqua Breath (NAT: AoE - 246% Water Magic Dmg) *[Used on 3rd turn after last use]* * 15.8% *(15/95)* Critical (PHY: 188% Phys Dmg) * 10.5% *(10/95)* Critical &lt;AoE&gt; (PHY: AoE - 206% Phys Dmg) *[Locked for 1 turn after last use]* * 5.3% *(5/95)* Aqua Breath (NAT: AoE - 246% Water Magic Dmg) * 21.1% *(20/95)* Frost Blast (NAT: AoE - 246% Ice Magic Dmg, 18% chance of Sap) *[Locked for 4 turns after last use]* * 21.1% *(20/95)* Meteor (BLK: AoE - 294% NonElem Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 15.8% *(15/95)* Icestorm (NAT: AoE - 294% Ice Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 10.5% *(10/95)* Maelstrom (BLK: AoE - 39% chance of 99% CurHP Dmg, resisted via Death) *[Locked for 4 turns after last use]* **Rage - Very Weak Pattern:** * **Forced:** Critical (PHY: 188% Phys Dmg) *[Used on 3rd turn after last use]* * **Forced:** Haste (WHT: Auto-hit Haste - Uncounterable, Self only) *[Used on Local Turn 1 and on next turn after Maelstrom]* * **Forced:** Aqua Breath (NAT: AoE - 246% Water Magic Dmg) *[Used on 3rd turn after last use]* * 15% Critical (PHY: 188% Phys Dmg) * 15% Critical &lt;AoE&gt; (PHY: AoE - 206% Phys Dmg) *[Locked for 1 turn after last use]* * 20% Aqua Breath (NAT: AoE - 246% Water Magic Dmg) * 15% Frost Blast (NAT: AoE - 246% Ice Magic Dmg, 18% chance of Sap) *[Locked for 4 turns after last use]* * 10% Icestorm (NAT: AoE - 294% Ice Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 15% Meteor (BLK: AoE - 342% NonElem Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 10% Maelstrom (BLK: AoE - 39% chance of 99% CurHP Dmg, resisted via Death) *[Locked for 4 turns after last use]* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; *** ## Stairway to Hell (Apocalypse +) *** ### Twintania (Apocalypse +) **Stage** | **Lv** | **HP** | **ATK** | **DEF** | **MAG** | **RES** | **MND** | **SPD** | **ACC** | **EVA** :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Normal | 220 | 422914 | 976 | 5273 | 1008 | 8136 | 400 | 550 | 200 | 62 Weak | 220 | 422914 | **1006** | **5558** | **1040** | **8596** | 400 | **600** | 200 | 62 Very Weak | 220 | 422914 | **1048** | **5843** | **1071** | **9057** | 400 | **650** | 200 | 62 Gigaflare | 220 | 422914 | **1006** | **5558** | **1092** | **8166** | 400 | **600** | 200 | 62 U Gigaflare | 220 | 422914 | **1048** | **5843** | **1124** | **8604** | 400 | **650** | 200 | 62 **Weak:** Water (50% Weak), Holy (50% Weak) **Immune:** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Confuse, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sleep, Petrify, Doom, Death, Berserk, Slownumb, Sap, Interrupt *(****Vuln:*** *---)* *(****Sp.Imm:*** *Interrupt)* **Break Resist:** ATK, DEF, MAG, RES, SPD 0% *(Normal)*/15% *(Weak)*/30% *(Very Weak)* chance of countering PHY-type abilities with Tidal Wave (NAT: AoE - 342% Water Magic Dmg) 0% *(Normal)*/15% *(Weak)*/30% *(Very Weak)* chance of countering BLK/WHT-type abilities with Megaflare (NAT: AoE - 342% NonElem Magic Dmg) &amp;nbsp; Once Twintania has been brought under 76% HP, it will shift permanently to Weak Form. Once Twintania has been brought under 46% HP, it will shift permanently to Very Weak Form. Twintania will also permanently lose its Water and Holy weaknesses at this stage. If Twintania is in the middle of casting an ability when it shifts to a new form, it will abort the cast and begin in the new form with a full ATB; otherwise, its ATB is left unchanged. After Twintania's 4th turn and then every 5th turn after, Twintania will shift to Gigaflare Form (if in Normal or Weak Form) or U Gigaflare Form (if in Very Weak Form). Twintania will then use Gigaflare (NAT: AoE - 240% NonElem Magic Dmg, Ignores Res, Uses MAG\^0.55) *(if in Gigaflare Form)* or Ultimate Gigaflare (NAT: AoE - 350% NonElem Magic Dmg, Ignores Res &amp; Blinks, Uses MAG\^0.55) *(if in U Gigaflare Form)* on the next turn, before shifting back to Normal/Weak/Very Weak Form. This 5-turn count is not reset when Twintania shifts to a new HP%-based Form. While in Gigaflare or U Gigaflare Form, Twintania will not counter attacks and cannot shift to any other form until after it finishes casting Gigaflare or Ultimate Gigaflare. That means that any shift to a new HP%-based Form that would occur during a Gigaflare turn will be delayed until after it has finished casting Gigaflare. *(Note: Prior to the June Update, Twintania's HP% shifts were under 71% and 41% HP, and Gigaflare was used every 8 turns.)* **Normal Pattern:** * **Forced:** &lt;Attack&gt; (PHY: 266% Phys Dmg) *[Used on 3rd turn after last use]* * 10% &lt;Weak Attack&gt; (PHY: 110% Phys Dmg) * 30% &lt;Attack&gt; (PHY: 266% Phys Dmg) *[Unlocks on 3rd ATB]* * 20% &lt;AoE Attack&gt; (PHY: AoE - 253% Phys Dmg) *[Unlocks on 3rd ATB, Locked for 1 turn after last use]* * 10% Wind Slash (NAT: AoE - 294% Wind Magic Dmg) *[Unlocks on 3rd ATB, Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 5% Atomic Rays (NAT: AoE - 294% Fire Magic Dmg) *[Unlocks on 5th ATB, Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 15% Icestorm (NAT: AoE - 342% Ice Magic Dmg) *[Unlocks on 5th ATB, Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 10% Mind Blast (NAT: AoE - 200% NonElem Magic Dmg, 15% chance each of Paralyze/Sap) *[Unlocks on 5th ATB, Locked for 4 turns after last use]* **Weak Pattern:** * **Forced:** &lt;Attack&gt; (PHY: 266% Phys Dmg) *[Used on 3rd turn after last use]* * 30% &lt;Attack&gt; (PHY: 266% Phys Dmg) * 20% &lt;AoE Attack&gt; (PHY: AoE - 253% Phys Dmg) *[Locked for 1 turn after last use]* * 15% Wind Slash (NAT: AoE - 294% Wind Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 10% Atomic Rays (NAT: AoE - 294% Fire Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 15% Icestorm (NAT: AoE - 390% Ice Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 10% Mind Blast (NAT: AoE - 200% NonElem Magic Dmg, 15% chance each of Paralyze/Sap) *[Locked for 4 turns after last use]* **Very Weak Pattern:** * 40% &lt;Attack&gt; (PHY: AoE - 253% Phys Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 15% Wind Slash (NAT: AoE - 294% Wind Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 15% Atomic Rays (NAT: AoE - 294% Fire Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 15% Icestorm (NAT: AoE - 390% Ice Magic Dmg) *[Locked for 2 turns after last use]* * 15% Mind Blast (NAT: AoE - 200% NonElem Magic Dmg, 15% chance each of Paralyze/Sap) *[Locked for 4 turns after last use]* &amp;nbsp;"

Overview: * Omniscient doesn't have any elemental resistances, and he is weak to Fire-elemental attacks. * Note that he begins the battle with Regen. * All damage in this battle is magic. Omniscient mainly uses Ultimate: Flare/Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga - all of which are NAT and deals heavy Non-elemental/Fire/Ice/Lightning magic damage respectively. Other than that, he also has Slow and Graviga which deals 75% of max HP damage. Note that Ultimate: Firaga is single-target, Ultimate: Blizzaga and Thundaga are AoE, and all three generally applies Sap to your party. * In his weaker phases, he has a counter Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga, and a standard Flare ability - same as above, but they are all BLK type. * Hitting him with a physical attack causes him to use Rewind, which heals him to full and removes all debuffs. * He has one status vulnerability: Berserk. If you Berserk him... * ...he will use a single-target piercing Overflow 99999 damage physical attack that bypasses Physical Blink. Tips: * Pure mage meta for this. Stack as many magic buffs as you can, then go to town with Fire-elemental magics and Soul Breaks. Vivi, Krile and Terra are all great choices here. * Just don't Berserk him. Please. * Use dances to debuff Omniscient. * ~~Indomitable Blade/~~Grand Cross to the rescue once again. Deals with Slow, and his weak phase counters. ~~Remember that Soul Breaks generally don't trigger counters, and you can gear Celes to be a mage with 4\* Black Magic and Rod access if needed.~~ Looks like Rewind triggers off physical DAMAGE, so Indomitable Blade won't work. There's always Runic I guess, though it doesn't deal with Slow. * Bring Dispel instead of Banishing Strike to remove his opening Regen."

Win without being KOd. **Notes:** * There are no bosses in this stage, but Bandersnatch has a chance of spawning. If they do, you'll fight two at the same time. ****** ### Alexandria Castle (+) 40 STAM (20/20) **Target Score Summary**: Attack/Magic/Defense Round 1|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Zorn**|107,797|Slow/Blind|All **Thorn**|107,797|Slow/Blind|All **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Zorn &amp; Thorn without being KO'ed. 2. Lower Zorn's Magic. 3. Lower Thorn's Magic. **Note(s):** * Zorn and Thorn will spend their turns trying to empower the other. If they successfully empower one of them and you allow them to cast a spell without damaging them, they will use either Meteor or Flare. * Honestly, you should literally take 0 damage here as long as you hit them to disable their empowerment. * You only need to defeat one to end the battle. Round 2|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Beatrix**|129,356|Slow|All **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Beatrix without being KO'ed. 2. Lower Beatrix's Attack. 3. Lower Beatrix's Defense. **Note(s):** * Everything here is 100% physical based. If you take too long, Beatrix will use Climhazzard, which will reduce your entire team to 1 HP. ****** ### Big Green Snake (++) 20 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Ralvuimago**|183,530|Slow/Blind|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities (Ailettes): **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |-|200%|-|-100%|-|-|-|-|-| **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Ralvuimago without being KO'ed. 2. Exploit Ralvuimago's weakness to ice attacks. 3. Lower Ralvuimago's Attack. **Note(s):** * Ralvuimago uses physical and magic attacks. Anytime you hit him with a physical attack, he will enter his defense mode - if you attack him with a physical attack while defending, he will use an AoE earth magic attack against you. * Due to the counters, better to use magic, or better yet, Ice OSB RW x2 will wipe him out. ******* ### Beautiful Hunter (+++) 40 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Lani**|195,181|Slow/Blind|All **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Lani without being KO'ed. 2. Afflict Lani with Blind. 3. Lower Lani's Magic. **Note(s):** * Lani has a mixed offense, although all her AoE attacks are magic-based, and blind should keep you relatively safe from her physical attacks. * Very straightforward fight, should present no issues. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ### Awful Presence (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Atomos**|211,474|None|All **Target Scores:** 1. Lower Atomos' Magic. 2. Lower Atomos' Defense. 3. Lower Atomos' Resistance. **Note(s):** * Except for a weak token physical attack, everything here is either magic or gravity-based, so prepare you rmitigation accordingly. Note that his Gravity-199 attack deals piercing magic damage, so make sure to stack multiple debuffs. * You'll have to deal with Gravity and Graviga, which deal 20% and 40% max HP to the entire party respectively, so definitely consider KO resist accessories. He also has access to AoE Slowga (216% chance), so Affliction Break/slow-resist accessories on critical members may be warranted. ****** ### Iafa Tree (Ultimate ++) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Zombie Dragon**|350,560|Slow|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities: **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| 150%|-|-|-|-|-|150%|50%|- **Target Scores:** 1. Lower Zombie Dragon's Magic. 2. Exploit Zombie Dragon's weakness to fire attacks. 3. Exploit Zombie Dragon's weakness to holy attacks. **Note(s):** * A large portion of Zombie Dragon's abilities are magic-based, but he does have an AoE physical attack to keep you honest (similar to Gogo U++ in the FF V event). Note his piercing attack (Ultimate Zombie Breath) is magic based. * A good portion of his magic attacks are lightning-based, so equipping lightning resist accessories will help cut down on the incoming damage. * Other than that, another straightforward battle where the boss has access to a few AoE attacks. You know what to do. * **CID MISSION: Complete the Iafa Tree (Ultimate++) in a party with only FF IX heroes!** Quite a few of the characters here can exploit the fire and holy weaknesses for major damage. As stated above, do prioritize magic mitigation but don't neglect physical completely. ****** ### Ancient Ark (Apocalypse +) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Ark**|446,000|None|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities: **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |50%|50%|50%|0%|120%|50%|50%|50%|50%| **Target Scores:** 1. Lower Ark's Attack. 2. Lower Ark's Defense. 3. Exploit Ark's weakness to wind attacks. **Note(s):** * Don't worry, this version of Ark will not use the HP = 1 attack like in previous encounters. However, his arsenal has been upgrades to include potent AoE magic attacks, and a lot of his physical attacks are ranged, so be mindful of your back-row characters. * He has very strong AoE physical and magic attacks, but definitely prioritize physical attacks, as they are more prevalent. He does have one piercing magic attack (Ultimate Photon), but it is ST (will still do heavy damage). * He does have an ability to confuse your party, but luckily he has other AoE physical attacks which will likely knock you out of it. * I don't know, this FF IX event is pretty straightforward. Not really much else to say, and honestly, after Proud Clad, this is quite a drop in difficulty. Just load up your wind team and go to town. * **Jump Start Notes:** Honestly, only 446K HP and everyone has 3 SB gauges? Assuming you have some wind SB, Ark will be dead before you know it. ****** ****** ####**[D220 Multiplayer]** ****** ****** Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Soul Cage**|??|None (including Interrupt &amp; Reflect)|All #####Elemental Vulnerabilities: **Fire**|**Ice**|**Lightning**|**Earth**|**Wind**|**Water**|**Holy**|**Dark**|**Poison**| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |120%/50%/-100% (See Notes)|50%|50%|50%|50%|50%|150%|0%|50%| **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Soul Cage with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. 2. Lower Soul Cage's Attack. 3. Lower Soul Cage's Magic. **Notes:** * Regarding the fire vulnerability, when in his regular state, Soulcage will take 150% damage from fire-based attacks; however once he is hit with a fire attack, he will enter ""On Fire"" mode and take 50% damage from fire attacks. If he is hit by a fire attack when in his mode, he will enter ""On Fire - Strong"" mode and absorb fire attacks completely. * To revert Soul Cage back to his regular form, you'll need to deal either ice or water damage (one hit is enough regardless of which On Fire mode he is in). * You **DO NOT** want Soul Cage to be in his ""On Fire - Strong"" mode, as he gains access to Ultimate Firaga, which deals **overflow** damage to the entire party, not to mention his other attacks in this mode hit extremely hard. Note that whenever he is any ""On Fire"" state, he has access to Ultimate Flame Blades, which deals AoE physical fire damage and inflicts your party with imperil fire. * Soul Cage has very strong physical and magic AoE, so don't skimp on either mitigation for this fight. Note that all of his magic attacks and some of his physical are fire-based - highly recommend you bring fire resistance on all your characters. * Note that on Soul Cage's every 8th turn he will cast Fira on himself, and once he is in his weak phase, he counters physical attacks with a self Counter Fira. For this reason, it is best to rely on your mages and dancers in order to minimize the fire counters and taking a Ultimate Firaga to the face. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

The main objective is to complete each **Mote Dungeon** with a **4-member party** consisting of **0~1 max of characters from each of the following realms: II, III, VIII, X, XIII**. - Mastery is not required, you'll see why. - Challenge ends when this current round of mote dungeons ends, which is May 16. ______ **Additional General Restrictions** - No OSB RWs. - No BSB(?) RWs. (Willing to remove this if a lot of people think this is too much). - No Sentinel's Grimoire/Thyrus RWs. - No RWs that exploit the bosses elemental **and/or** status vulnerability at all. Either through entry or BSB command. - No abilities or native SBs that exploit the bosses elemental vulnerability at all. - The above two rules do not apply to any Imperils you may use. You are free to RW/natively use any permitted Imperil-type SBs and exploit those weaknesses so long as it is not the boss's native weakness. (Except Dahaka, no imperils for him). - No Onion Knight :P. _______ **Boss-specific Additional Restrictions**: - Vs. Dahaka: For damaging abilities/SBs, use only NE. No SBs with element + NE. He's easy enough anyways. - Vs. Magus Sisters: No Sleep. - Vs. Red Soul &amp; Ogre Mages: No Sleep. - Vs. Ifrit (Cid's Mission only): No Fire Resist accessories/equipment. ____________ **Difficulties** - **Cid's Mission:** Complete each of the mote dungeons with 4 characters. You can have 1 character max per realm (II, III, VIII, X, and XIII only), and obviously, 1 realm will not be represented. **You can change your party &amp; characters for each mote dungeon, but they must always have one of each of the previously mentioned realms represented**. - **Dr. Mog's Challenge:** Complete each of the mote dungeons with 4 characters. You can have 1 character max per realm (II, III, VIII, X, and XIII only), and obviously, 1 realm will not be represented. **You cannot change your party's characters.**. *Yes you can and probably should change your abilities/SBs/RMs/etc.* - **Shadowsmith's Challenge:** Complete each of the mote dungeons with 4 characters. You can have 1 character max per realm (II, III, VIII, X, and XIII only), and obviously, 1 realm will not be represented. **However**, you are **not allowed** to bring any of the following characters: **Maria (II), Onion Knight (III), Fujin (VIII), Yuna (X), or Cid Raines (XIII).** **You cannot change your party's characters.**. *Yes you can and probably should change your abilities/SBs/RMs/etc.* **Bonus:** Complete Shadowsmith's challenge with only 3 characters...or even less. I'm sure one of you will get it done. __________ **Submission** - **Submission Rules**: Post your attempts with an imgur album which shows your party set-up *for each* mote dungeon, **for each** mote boss dying, and **each** medals screen. Your party set-up should show the Camp screen so we can see your hones. Please bold above or next to your album whether you're doing Cid's Mission, Dr. Mog's Challenge, or Shadowsmith's Challenge. - I encourage you to not use H&amp;R, but again, not really any way to prove it. If you do use it, just be honest please. - Even if you can't beat all 5 mote dungeons, it might be fun to see how far you can get, right? - No prizes for this one. Maybe. I can always change my mind, right? *I do have some unused flairs lying around after all...* ___________ [Previous Community Challenge: Torment Rush (Part 1)](URL **Winners** Dr. Mog's Challenge: Valomire, Jurinis, Lucas-714, littlefiredragon, Kevun1, DoctorLugae, killeak, sleepslacksnooze, Chare11, soloblade, Sunogui, taandum, LuminKnight, JPTheorem, ngkps01, OldManAesop, Spiffmanicus, DangerousCalled.

Defeat Spectral Keeper without being KOd. **Notes:** * Not that the fight will last long enough, but Spectral Keeper will target one of your party members with Glyph Mine, which starts a 20 second timer. If you aren't defending when the mine reaches zero, you will instantly be KO'ed. ****** #####10: Deepest Yevon Dome 58 STAM (19/19/20) Boss|HP|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Yunalesca**|140,000|Holy|None|All **Target Score:** 1. Defeat Yunalesca without being KOd. **Notes:** * For those who haven't faced Yunalesca bfore, you do not want to cure the Sap she will inflict on your party with Hellbiter. The sap acts as a proxy for how the fight originally worked in FF X with Zombie status. Once you enter Phase 3, if you are not sapped, you will be promptly KO'ed by Megadeath. ****** ### Spira's Prayer Song + 40 STAM (20/20) **Target Score Summary**: Resistance **Can lose a max of 5 medals to master** Round 1|HP|Weak|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Sinspawn Genais**|40,000|Fire|Water|Silence/Slow|All **Core**|60,000|None|None|None|All **Target Scores:** 1.

Once he is lowered to a certain % HP, he will enter his shell - he will counter melee attacks with counter cure. Due to his low HP you shouldn't have much issue with the medal condition, but something to keep in mind. * After you defeat Genais, the Core will become targetable. Round 2|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Sin**|130,000|None|All **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Sin without being KO'ed. 2. Lower Sin's Resistance. **Note(s):** * Sin cannot be targeted by melee attacks initially until he is dropped to ~80%. Don't forget to bring ranged attacks or else you will be stuck. * You have a hard stop of 20 turns here before he uses Giga-Graviton, which will OHKO your entire party. ****** ### Eternal Calm ++ 20 STAM Boss|HP|Weak|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Null|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Seymour Omnis**|180,000|See Notes|See Notes|None|Power/Magic|Armor/Mental/Mind| **Target Scores:** 1. Exploit Seymour Omnis' weakness to ice attacks when he is weak to them. 2. Lower Seymour's Defense. 3. Defeat Seymour Omnis before he uses Ultima for the 5th time. **Note(s):** * Seymour will switch his weaknesses between FF X's primary elements (fire/ice/water/lightning). When he is weak to an element, he will absorb the opposite one (fire/ice and water/lightning). * Note that the elemental spells that Seymour casts will always match the element he is currently absorbing. * Runic/Carbuncle will negate all of his attacks except Dispel/Ultima. * Note he nulls Power/Magic breaks! ******* ### Big Back +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--| **BFA**|210,000|None|All **Target Scores:** 1. Lower BFA's Attack. 2. Lower BFA's Magic. 3. Lower BFA's Defense. **Note(s):** * Except for his Jecht Beam attack (which can also petrify a party member), everything here is physical based. Note that his True Jecht Shot, which he will use when in his weak phase and in Overdrive status, ignores defense, so you'll want to stack as many attack breaks as possible. * Note that his Cleave attack also has a % chance to slow. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ### Monster Lurking in the Sand (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Resist|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Sand Worm**|250,000|Ice/Water|Fire|Poison|All **Target Scores:** 1. Lower the Sand Worm's Magic. 2. Exploit the Sand Worm's weakness to ice attacks. 3. Exploit the Sand Worm's weakness to water attacks. **Note(s):** * Sand Worm has a mixed offense and will use AoE physical and magic attacks, so definitely bring both types of mitigation. * Sand Worm will use Swallow on his 2nd turn, incapacitating one of your party members until he Regurgitates them 5 turns later, where they will be damaged and inflicted with Slow (303% chance). * Note that the Swallowed character is immune to all attacks, and if they are the lowest % HP they will attract your heals and waste your healer's turn, so keep that in mind. ****** ### Emotions Wandering in the Forest (Ultimate ++) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Spherimorph**|390,000|Fire/Ice/Lightning/Water^(See Notes)|None|All **Target Scores:** 1. Use a lightning attack on Spherimorph. 2. Use a water attack on Spherimorph. 3. Use a fire attack on Spherimorph. **Note(s):** * Spherimorph has a mixed offense (will use both AoE physical and magic attacks) although you should bring more magic mitigation if you need to make a choice. * Spherimorph will change his weakness between fire/ice/lightning/water - unlike in previous encounters, he will still take regular damage from all other elements. He does have a 20% chance to counter black/white magic with a weak AoE magic attack, while physical attacks have a 20% chance to counter with a medium ST magic attack. * Spherimorph will always use spells opposite his weakness (e.g. if he is using fire attacks, he is currently weak to ice). He will change his vulnerability after it is exploited twice. * This version does not have the Gravity-based Press - instead, it will do 450% piercing non-elemental damage to your entire party. * **CID MISSION: Complete Emotions Wandering in the Forest (Ultimate++) in a party with only FF X heroes!** FF X has 4 magic users capable of targeting all 4 elements (Yuna, Lulu, Braska, Seymour), and the physical characters can target a couple of them as well. You'll want to balance having all four elements at your disposal, as well as your usual suite of mitigations and buffs, as well as Wakka/Rikku for debuffing. ****** ### Aeon Battle (Apocalypse +) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Valefor**|134,831|None|None|None|All **Ifrit**|184,911|Ice^1|Fire|None|All **Ixion**|281,219|Water^1|Lightning|None|All Note 1: Slight weakness (50% additional damage) **Target Scores:** 1. Lower Valefor's Magic. 2. Exploit Ifrit's weakness to ice attacks. 3. Exploit Ixion's weakness to water attacks. **Note(s):** * For those who have been on autopilot for the last few U++, Apocalypse + (at least for this and the upcoming FF IV event), are pretty difficult and they will do hefty amount of damage to your party. You'll face each Aeon individually, and as soon as you defeat one, the next will spawn. * Valefor likes to slow your party. She has a ST attack which carries with it a 102% chance to slow (this one can be tauntilated), and once she is dropped below 50%, she will use his Ultimate Sonic Wings, which is AoE with a 102% chance to slow. You'll either want Slow Resist Accessories and/or Affliction Break, or simply just wait to cast your Hastega until she is below 50% and uses the ability. * Valefor uses mixed attacks, to include AoE magic/physical attacks, so both suites of mitigation are recommended. * On Ifrit's first turn after spawning, he will use his Ultimate Hellfire attack (AoE piercing fire magic damage), so make sure you aren't in critical HP when you defeat Valefor. Ifrit does use mixed attacks, but all of his AoE's are magic-based. * Ifrit does use his Ultimate Hellfire attack every 5 turns, so try to defeat him as quickly as possible. * The worst of the three, Ixion, spawns after Ifrit is defeated. Ixion will use his Ultimate Aero Spark attack on his first turn, which deals ranged physical damage, regular dispels your entire party, and has a 33% chance to Stop. He will use it again when he enters his very weak phase at 40% HP, and will use it every 7 turns from the last time he used it. To make matters worse, he'll also use his ST Aero Spark, which also carries with it a dispel. * You need to keep your buffs up as much as possible here - if you let Wall expire and get hit with an Ultimate Aero Spark with no protect, you'll be taking close to 5K damage to everyone, which has a very high chance of wiping your party. Ixion will also use AoE magic attacks, as well as his Ultimate Thor's Hammer, which deals piercing magic lightning damage. * Ixion's mind is 150, for those trying to calculate how long stop will last. * Ixion is a beast - keep as many SB gauges reserved as possible and try to end the fight quickly before you get overwhelmed with the dispels and damage. * As far as accessories, while you may want to equip slow resist, lightning resist would probably be best to help mitigate Ixion's attacks. ****** ****** ####**[D220 Multiplayer]** ****** ****** Boss|HP|Weak|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Yunalesca**|907,928|Water^1|Holy|None (including Interrupt)|All Note 1: Slight weakness (50% additional damage) **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Yunalesca with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed. 2. Lower Yunalesca's Attack. 3. Lower Yunalesca's Defense. **Note(s):** * ~~**DISCLAIMER:** This fight was broken in JP. Typically, Yunalesca's Megadeath is supposed to only work on party members without Sap; however, it was targeting anyone, regardless of whether you had Sap. Luckily, it is ST, and **both** physical and magic blink will prevent it from hitting. In addition, it appeared that Yshtola's Stoneskin will also keep you alive, as long as you have over 100% max HP shared between your current HP and the remaining HP of Stoneskin (e.g. Your 10K HP character has 8K HP left and a 3K Stoneskin bubble, he/she would survive with 1K HP remaining). Due to megadeath not respecting Sap, feel free to bring soul breaks with regen.~~ Update - Yunalesca's Ultimate Megadeath when she enters Phase 2 is not affected by Sap and you need a form of blink (magic or physical will work), or Stoneskin &gt; 100% HP to survive it. The Megadeaths in Phase 3 **ARE** affected by Sap, so do not use any regen or else you'll remove Sap and the character will be KO'ed in Phase 3. * Yunalesca is split into three distinct phases. In Phase 1, she'll use ST attacks and counter your attacks with Sleep/Silence/Blind, so you'll want Ultra Cure/Esuna. Note her ST physical attack does remove Protect/Shell/Haste, and she has a chance to use it throughout the fight, so don't forget to rebuff. * Upon entering Phase 2 (80% HP), she'll use Osmose on her first turn, followed by three ST Megadeaths. Try to have your blinks/Stoneskin up before this to maximize your success. * Her other attacks in Phase 2 are a 3-target Holy (bringing Hyper Breaks and Mind Breakdown will be beneficial here) and Hellbiter (AoE piercing physical attack). * Upon entering Phase 3 (50% HP), she gains the ability to use Megadeath as part of her normal moveset, and also adds Mind Blast, which is her only magic attack with deals AoE non-elemental damage along with a chance to confuse. * Compounding all the issues with dispelling, statues, and Megadeath, Yunalesca is **EXTREMELY FAST** and all of her attacks are instant. To be honest, this is a chore of a fight. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

186,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"Celes ""Solos"" Mote Ahriman!",26,6b2n0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/6b2n0n/celes_solos_mote_ahriman/,2017-05-14 16:45:21,"Updated Video: URL Update: Celes now masters it! She brings Power Break instead of Drain Strike, which is just enough for the mastery. Her Tornado Strike has also been upgraded to Snowspell Strike! (Equipments, stats, and abilities are shown on the video) Apologies for no sound; I record this when there are a lot of people in house; I don't know if DURecorder has the option to mute the audio. First of all, I want to give thanks to /u/Teyah for his Celes solo runs; you had inspired me to use Celes more and do solo runs with her! I think I learned a lot fron your videos! Also shoutout to /u/Krissco for showing me about Mote Ahriman's vulnerability to Blind and Poison in his naked solo Galuf run, as well as using the 2 entrust users for filling the SB bar! My strategy: First of all, I gear Celes to balance between Attack and Defense. Specifically, I used Ingus' combined 6* shield to provide her some attack boost, as well as a very high defense. RW is Wakka's Auroch Reels to inflict Blind and Poison. (I originally used Tyro's Keeper's Tome for the RW, but failed miserably.) Then, I used Krissco's strat of using two Entrust users (I used Tyro and Fran) to quickly fill Celes' SB bar. Tyro then petrify Fran and then himself. I then H&amp;R a bit to fill the SB bar a bit more. The battle execution is simple, yet needs a bit of luck. Turn 1 is used for summoning RW to inflict Blind and Poison, so that Celes will be safer from Ahriman's physicals. On Celes' next turn, use Indomitable Blade. I then use Tornado Strike 3 times before using Indomitable Blade again. Repeat the pattern 3 Tornado Strikes and IB until Ahriman goes down. Make sure to squeeze another Auroch Reels to reapply blind after the second IB, though. I made the mistake of not reapplying the blind at the middle of the fight, but luckily Celes survives. Things that can go wrong: * Ahriman uses the magic spell before Celes finishes casting her first Indomitable Blade. (Very Likely) * Ahriman hits Celes with too many physical attacks while blinded. * Ahriman petrifies Celes, especially before Ahriman is blinded (I equip her with the +35 attack accessory, since Ahriman will miss the physicals often after blinded anyway) * (Very unlikely; haven't happened to me before) Ahriman uses too many physicals, causing Celes to run out of Tornado Strikes. Looking back, I should replace Drain Strike with Blindga, as I never used the former at all in the video. This should free the RW slot for things like Luneth's BSB, which should enable her to defeat Ahriman faster."

I also recommend bringing a full mage team if you can, and if you have a Mind buff bring that too. If you try to mash a physical A-Team into this without consideration for Freezing Dust, you *will* lose as Valigarmanda chain-Stops you. Astra *does not work* against his AOE Freezing Dust, nor does Affliction Break or resistance accessories. Lowering Vali's mind and raising yours is the best option you have.

You can wear Instant KO resistance for Gravity if you want, but the big thing to emphasize defensively is stacking Magic Breaks to de-fang Shimmering Rain and Nova. --- &amp;nbsp; ###**Boss:**  Ultima Weapon Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Default|220| | | | | | | Weak| | | | | | | | Very Weak| | | | | | | | **Medal Conditions:** Reduce  Ultima Weapon's magic.

Aside from the immunity to water instead of weakness, and needing to be a bit more conscious of your DPS to prevent  Shadow Flare, this is basically just the same fight as Omega Weapon. --- &amp;nbsp; ###**Boss:**  Leviathan Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Default|220| | | | | | | Weak| | | | | | | | Very Weak| | | | | | | | **Medal Conditions:** Exploit  Leviathan's weakness to thunder attacks.

Levi here actually has a mixed offense so you can't cheat too much. If you can manage to sneak a Reflect in on him before his first turn, you can snag his Protect and Haste; otherwise, just bring Dispel or Banishing Strike. You definitely want to bring one or the other, because Haste is extremely relevant in this fight; Leviathan's attacks are instant cast (as is the case with almost every boss which attacks twice per turn), so Haste is a true turn doubler for him."
189,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"Elemental OSB Machines - who to pull for, and why",27,625y66,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/625y66/elemental_osb_machines_who_to_pull_for_and_why/,2017-03-29 22:06:09,"DISCLAIMER: any character with an en-element + OSB combo is viable and potentially OP. If you have an OSB and an en-element SB/SSB/BSB/USB comes up, consider pulling if the rest of the banner isn't too shabby. This post is meant to (among other things) highlight the characters with an additional cherry on top: an OSB relic with a non-RS element boost. &amp;nbsp; With the advent of Magicite dungeons in JP, elemental meta seems to be back in a big way. Suppose you wanted to bring a character for the sole purpose of massive elemental OSB hits. What would be the prerequisites? They are, in my view, as follows :- 1. The character should have an en-element SB/SSB/BSB. 2. The OSB relic should have an elemental boost without RS. 3. The character should have access to wrath or lifesiphon (but this is less of an issue if you have an entrust bot). 4. (Optional) You should have armor that grants the appropriate elemental boost. &amp;nbsp; With these in mind, I have created a list of the characters which fulfil points 1 and 2. Note that I do not play JP and I do not know if any of these characters are unviable as elemental OSB machines for any reason. Big shoutout to /u/Enlir for his spreadsheet. All mistakes remain mine, and please let me know if you spot any! &amp;nbsp; | Character | +Element | OSB Type | SB Type | Wrath/Lifesiphon? |-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------| |Vivi|Fire|Mag|BSB|Neither |Luneth|Wind|Phys|BSB|Lifesiphon/Wrath^1 |Tidus|Water|Phys|BSB|Lifesiphon |Quistis|Poison|Mag|BSB|Wrath |Kuja|Dark|Mag|SB/SSB|Neither |Vayne|Dark|Phys/Mag^2|BSB|Lifesiphon |Warrior of Light|Holy|Phys|BSB|Lifesiphon |Pcecil|Holy|Phys|BSB|Lifesiphon |Beatrix|Holy|Phys|SSB|Lifesiphon |Agrias|Holy|Phys|SSB|Lifesiphon &amp;nbsp; Note 1: Luneth can only wrath if dived. Note 2: You're likely to be using the physical version if you're using lifesiphon. &amp;nbsp; --- &amp;nbsp; Some conclusions: 1. If you're gunning for any elemental OSB machine and not for any particular element, you may not want to go all in for Anniversary Banner 2 - Tidus is not a special snowflake, as far as elemental OSB machines go, but he *is* the only water OSB machine. 2. For that matter, we only have 1 elemental OSB machine for fire, water, wind and poison. We have 2 dark OSB machines, and a whopping **4** holy OSB machines. TGC does not count as he does not have any en-element SB/SSB/BSB. 3. If you have an OSB but not the corresponding en-element SB/SSB/BSB, you can RW the en-element (except in Magicite dungeons). There are some characters whose OSB relic have an elemental boost, but who do not have an en-element SB/SSB/BSB: ~~Minfilia,~~^(edited: she has an en-holy BSB but no OSB) TGC (why does he keep popping up?) and Raines. You can en-element their OSBs the same way. As a bonus, each of them can use wrath/lifesiphon. 4. I make no comment on how the DPS of an elemental OSB machine compares to other methods of DPS (Raines pewpew, TGC OSB spam, imperil stacking meta, etc). 5. If you're not a whale, and want to pull for an OSB to create an elemental OSB machine, my suggestion is to consider first which characters you have an en-element SB/SSB/BSB for, then consider whether you're prepared to pull on the banners which feature the corresponding OSB. For example, I was originally considering pulling on Anniversary Banner 2 for Tidus' OSB to pair with his BSB. After creating this list, I realised that I have 3 other characters - Luneth, Quistis and Pcecil - with en-element BSBs. I will have other chances to create an elemental OSB machine and can save my mythril for now. &amp;nbsp; Edit: took out Lightning; mixed up her OSB and USB. That being said, if you draw both her OSB and USB, you could equip her with the USB relic (which has the elemental boost) and use her as Lightning, the lightning OSB machine^(don't hurt me, please). Edit: took out Locke; his OSB has holy boost, but his SSB has en-fire. Awkward! Edit: /u/juniglee and /u/SkyfireX have pointed out that just an OSB + en-element SB/SSB/BSB may enough to almost cap damage on some current Magicite dungeons (with vulnerability), but that the next Magicite dungeons should be harder. I completely agree that getting a character to tick off points 1 and 2 may be unnecessary for vulnerable bosses. As I commented below, the main motivation behind this post was to provide an alternative point of view for those with Tidus' BSB, who may otherwise feel compelled to go all-in for Anniversary Banner 2! Edit: added disclaimer at the top."

He is also vulnerable to sleep if going the mage route. ****** ### Challenge from the Shadow ++ 20 STAM Boss|HP|Weak|Resist|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Tantarian - Hiding**|110,000|Holy|Dark|Slow/Blind|All **Tantarian - Revealed**|110,000|Holy/Fire|Dark|Slow/Blind|All **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Tantarian without being KO'ed. 2. Lower Tantarian's Attack. 3. Lower Tantarian's Defense. **Note(s):** * Probably the easiest ++ fight in history. You need to deal between 6K - 36K damage to get him to reveal himself, after which his only ability is to use AoE Poison to inflict the status (does no damage). When in hidden form, he can use physical attacks. * Get him to reveal himself, use Orlandeu OSB, game over. Note he stays revealed for 3 turns, so time your attack correctly. ******* ### A Bizarre Kind of Dragon +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Weak|Resist|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Worm Hydra**|204,985|Ice|Fire|None (including Interrupt)|All **Target Scores:** 1.

Lower the Mysterious Masked Man's Attack. 2. Lower the Mysterious Masked Man's Defense. 3. Lower the Mysterious Masked Man's Resistance. **Note(s):** * The fight always begins with the Masked Man using Protect and Shell on his first two turns. In addition, he has a 15% chance to counter all attacks with Haste. Note he has a special immunity to reflect, so you'll have to dispel it the old fashioned way. * Note he has mixed offenses here, to include AoE physical and magical attacks, so you'll want to bring a balanced mitigation suite. He will always follow up his dangerous AoE's with weak ST physical attacks, giving you a breather. * This isn't a very difficult boss and pretty straightforward, just get your party setup and bring him down. ****** ### ???

Lower a Mistodon's Defense. 3. Exploit a Mistodon's weakness to fire attacks. **Note(s):** * You'll fight a total of six (6) Mistodons here across 4 waves (1-2-1-2). You'll deal with AoE magic and physical attacks, though I would do a slight preference towards magic here. * Note that their Headbutt ability can inflict Silence, and they also have access to an AoE magic attack which can inflict Sleep, so definitely bring Silence Resist on your healer along with Ultra Cure. * **CID MISSION: Complete ??? (Ultimate+) in a party with only FF IX heroes!** Vivi and Amarant are good choices here to exploit that fire vulnerability - remember you'll want to slot in Shellga and Protectga, so bringing along 2 of Garnet/Beatrix/Eiko/Kuja would be a good choice as well. AoE attacks are also very useful for Waves 2 and 4, so I would devote some slots to those to help end those waves quicker to ensure you don't get overwhelmed. ****** ### Chaos That Wears the Wind (Ultimate++) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Tiamat**|391,454|Ice|Wind|None|All **Target Scores:** 1. Lower Tiamat's Magic. 2. Lower Tiamat's Attack. 3. Lower Tiamat's Defense. **Note(s):** * Mixed attacks here, so don't neglect either mitigation. Note that he does have access to an AoE physical attack which ignores defense, so stacking attack breaks will go a long way towards reducing damage. * Note that he does have access to Silence Claw (ST damage with 24% chance to Silence), so either bring Silence resist accessories/Ultra Cure and/or a tauntilator to negate the attack completely. * Note that his Magic and Power Absorb abilities will inflict breaks on your character (-40% atk or mag for 25 seconds), while increasing his attack/magic by 50%. Make sure to hit him with the appropriate break after the attack to remove his buff right away! * When he is on low HP, he has a higher % chance to spam his defense ignoring move, so be sure to save soul breaks for this phase to end the fight quickly. ****** ****** ####**[D200 Multiplayer]** ****** ****** ### Kuja (Apocalypse) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Kuja**|~750,000|None (including Interrupt)|All **Target Scores:** 1. Defeat Kuja with at least 4 party members alive. 2. Lower Kuja's Attack. 3. Lower Kuja's Magic. **Note(s):** * Kuja has both AoE physical and magic attacks here, but obviously his more dangerous attacks are magic-based; prepare accordingly. * His first 3 attacks will always be his ST physical attack, giving you time to setup your mitigation and buffs. * He will use Graijva at a certain %HP (60% curHP damage). In addition, when he enters Trance he will use Ultima on his 2nd turn (reduce everyone's HP to 1) (roughly around ~50% HP), and when in his weak mode in Trance, will use Flare Star (resistance-ignoring magic attack). * For the Ultima, you need to queue up a medica so it lands after the Ultima due to MP latency. Note that when he goes into Trance mode, he'll do an AoE lightning attack followed by Ultima, so try to have a healer on standy and cast the SB after the lightning attack. * Kuja does use a fair amount of lightning magic, and since he only uses Graijva once throughout the fight, lightning resistance accessories are the way to go to minimize damage throughout the fight. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

Additionally, between exploding fist, meteor crush, and fires within, which skill is overall most useful on a team with a ramza support and a healer without a bsb? I have been far luckier on my monk pulls than my healer pulls. Edit: So third part of the question then. I've got locke and his OSB, so if I go with Refia, what is a good way to add fire vulnerability?"

Most of this is wishful thinking of course, as I don't own all the items for every team. However, I've been building each like this: EnElement BSB (DPS) EnElement BSB (DPS) Imperil BSB (DPS/Support) Support (Support/Healer) Healer (Healer/Support) I've had a few questions come up. 1. Is the Imperiler necessary if the enemy is already vulnerable to that element? Would three EnBursters be more efficient at that point? 2. SB gauge builds faster with elemental vulnerability. Does the Imperil stack with that to fill the gauge even quicker if vulnerable by nature? 3. How much will this/has this changed things with Imperils stacking? I'd imagine if you're focusing on only one element, my current strategy of 2 and 1 would still be optimal, unless three Enelements are better than two. NOTE: I've done a little searching on this, so I know that EnElement does more DPS than Imperil. But I'm not sure if throwing an Imperiler in there would overall be better than three Enelements. By my logic it would, but I'm just assuming so. Also, I really appreciate all the useful information in this sub and the informal community that helps with these kinds of things, so thank you in advance for those who can contribute! To show my thanks, I'll come back to this in a day or two and give some sweet sweet Gold to any comments that really help or open up dialogue and/or critical thinking on the subject.

Prior to pulling Alph's BSB, I had the following: * Luneth 99; BSB + Sky High R1 + Lifesiphon * Vaan 99; BSB + Theif's Revenge R3 + Powerchain R3 * Zidane 99; BSB + Mug Bloodlust R2 + Lifesiphon * Ramza 99; Shout/Tailwind + Fullbreak R6 + Lifesiphon * Insert healer... probably Eiko when she's grown up... /salt I have most of that team dove with all 3* and some 4*. Now with Alph, I'm not too sure who to drop... or if I should. I think he'd kick ass there, but Vaan is providing some good debuffing and Ramza is providing good buffing. I also have Alph's SSB... but HAHAHAHAHA to keeping the SSB and BSB up - the vulnerability will help add more, but don't think it's enough. Thoughts? Do I just skip the healer??? Given he's not 99 yet, maybe he doesn't play a role - I do have him dove with all 3*. Also, could I get clarification on how the ability restore function works (i.e. which ability does it restore)? ---- Edit: Formating"
195,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,WanderingNewbie's Guide: Nightmare Dungeon: Valigarmanda,24,5qvwl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/5qvwl4/wanderingnewbies_guide_nightmare_dungeon/,2017-01-30 07:27:51,"Summons Nightmare 2 has rolled around and with it a Nightmare boss with a pretty tricky gimmick, but I think I've found a work around. I'll drop this as a heads up right now so I don't have to mention it on each boss, each boss requires being hit by a Summon so don't forget them. As always if the guide is too long videos are at the bottom. &amp;nbsp; *** # **130 Difficulty Valefor** [Party Setup](URL and [Stats](URL Valefor is pretty split between Physical and Magic attacks. On top of this Sonic Wings has a very high chance to Slow. Luckily all of Valefors Physical attacks, including Sonic Wings, are Physical typing and ST so they can all be Taunted and Retaliated. By doing this you only have to worry about Valefors Magic attacks. Lower her Magic and bring Shellga then all you need to worry about is beating her down. &amp;nbsp; *** # **140 Difficulty Alexander** [Party Setup](URL and [Stats](URL So I'm not going to say you need to use any specific weird strategy for this fight, but I will start by saying that all of Alexanders attacks are Physical typing. Then I'm going to slide these five copies of Retaliate towards you and wink. That said, Alexander is entirely Physical so you can take care of him with Power Breakdown, Full Break and Protectga. If you go the full Retaliate strategy then don't forget to lower Alexanders ATK and to bring a Summon on Tyro or else you'll miss conditions. If you do go Reta, bring a Shout RW that way you maximize your damage. &amp;nbsp; *** # **150 Difficulty Mateus** [Party Setup](URL and [Stats](URL Mateus is a fairly simple boss to prepare for, Shellga/Protectga, Magic Breakdown Dance and Multi Break will deal with the spells coming your way. Power Breakdown for Mateus himself is also not a bad idea since he can throw out a number of pretty mean physical hits. A form of Dispel is also a good idea to bring since Mateus starts with Protect up and will cast Reflect turn one and every now and again over the course of the fight. Once that is squared away you'll need to stack as much Lightning damage as you can to burst the boss down. Ice accessories are also a good idea because they will help resist the number of spells being thrown your way over the course of the fight. Just be wary if you are bringing Single Target BLK spells because you don't want to hit a reflect at a bad time. &amp;nbsp; *** # **160 Difficulty Belias, the Gigas** [Party Setup](URL and [Stats](URL Belias and his flunkies have some pretty rude tricks up their sleeves. First of all in his first phase, Belias can throw out a ton of Status Effects while also having a couple rough AoEs. Once gotten low he drops the Status Effects and throws out his AoEs way more. The Daemons also come with some strong Magic attacks but the worse is Karma, which deals a Percentile damage based on the missing percent of health the Daemons have. The best way to deal with this quickly is to have some massive AoE going out to kill the Daemons fast while also taking advantage of their vulnerability to Slow. Also don't bring Holy AoEs the Daemons are immune to them. Once the Daemons are down the fight is a bit more manageable but still be wary of Belias' AoE attacks, Earth Resist can help you take less damage from Titan. &amp;nbsp; *** # **Nightmare Valigarmanda** [Party Setup](URL and [Stats](URL **Soul Breaks Used** **- Divine Guardian** &amp;nbsp; **Fight Overview** **#1** Vali has 27360 DEF and 29012 RES but Summons deal 3X damage **#2** Vali will summon an Orb and count down from 5 to Nightmare Tri-Disaster **#3** The Orb has 28512 DEF and 20048 RES **#4** Phase 1 is a complete DPS race, you need to kill the Orb in 5 turns **#5** Phase 2 Vali resummons the Orb, restarts the count and summons 2 barriers **#6** Barriers spawn random colors of, Blue, Yellow or Red and rotate very quickly **#7** The barriers will dispel if, Blue is hit with Fire, Yellow is hit with Water, Red is hit with Ice **#8** Once the barriers are gone, Jars will spawn and if killed you will get an Ether **#9** This pattern happens Four times after which Phase 3 starts **#10** Phase 3 is a DPS race again but the Orb has a 3 Turn cool down &amp;nbsp; **Setup** So the big thing to note about this fight is that you need to maximize your summon damage. Bring any 5*s you have honed high enough and all the 4*s you have honed. You'll also need to make sure to bring at least one Ice, Fire, and Water summon to make sure that you can destroy the barriers. The barrier gimmick is designed to allow you to keep going with the hones you have. The big part of the fight is how you go about the barrier gimmick. Also make sure that you bring Shellga, Heals and some way to boost RES or a good Medica. I found myself taking way too much damage over the course of the battle to only survive on Shellga. Gigas Armlets can help a ton as well. I also recommend bringing Mana Paeon if you don't have a flat Faithga. &amp;nbsp; **The Proper Gimmick** When the fight was first released in the Japanese version ~~user SolitaireD created this table~~ SolitaireD helped figure out the gimmick but it was actually /u/SkyfireX who made the Table [in order to keep track of the barriers](URL So the gimmick here is to figure out what pattern you have and fire off the proper element as indicated. If you spawn 2 of the same type of Urn then you'll get a double Ether which owns. The timing can be a little rough though so it might take a few tries. This strategy is good if you don't have ton of hones because the double refresh will really help you there. &amp;nbsp; **All at once** If you don't feel like putting up with the timing a strategy that works really well and the one that I used is to fire off all 3 elements at once, as close together as you can manage. This will cause them all to hit at once and hit the barriers no matter what. The trouble with this strategy is that you'll need to make sure that you're last caster can finish off the orb and then wait for your 3 elemental users to be ready to cast again. This works pretty well if you have the damage to keep up with the orb. &amp;nbsp; **Ignore the Mechanic** If you have enough protection and Faithgas without need for a RW to give more you can RW Alphinauds Burst. You can then just use CMD1 to focus down Vali while your other casters take care of the Orb. You'll need to remember to try and hit the Yellow barrier to spawn a Yellow Urn for conditions or have confidence that you'll take no damage and get full medals that way. This strategy is a bit more specific since you'll need like Wall and Sheepsong to pull it off. That said this does let you ignore the barrier mechanic which some might want to. &amp;nbsp; *** # **Conclusion** Once major frustration I had with this Nightmare is that if we had gotten the Bard 6 ability we could quick cast our team and actually be able to do the All At Once strategy and kill the orb before the boss can attack. This would result in it never dealing any actual damage until the final phase. But since we don't have it then we have to resort to side strategies but I think it works out in the end. I hope this guide can help at least a little bit, best of luck to the lot of you. &amp;nbsp; [Full Stream](URL &amp;nbsp; [Just Fights](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare Valigarmanda](URL &amp;nbsp; *** #**Past Guides** &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Ultima](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Crushdown](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Reraise](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Neo Bahamut](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Quadruple Foul](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Northern Cross](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Meltdown](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Curada](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Affliction Break](URL &amp;nbsp; [Nightmare: Dervish](URL &amp;nbsp; Give me any suggestions for how to improve the videos and the Guide, and if you want to catch the stream live follow me at URL"

Let's say you've gotta fight a boss with a mastery requirement that requires you to hit them with two separate elements. The boss has equal vulnerability to both elements. You use an OSB that is both of these elements on the boss. Which one applies and which mastery is fulfilled? Example: Orlandaeu's Lightning/Holy OSB. Boss is weak to both and have to hit them Lightning and with Holy for mastery."

My only utility soul break is Shout, and I don't have a native wall. I was thinking the banner might be worth a pull for a chance for a sentinels grimoire, and the only possible duplicate from it would be Plat sword. I feel the wind damage up from Oath veil would compliment using Alphinaud to boost his damage since I lack access to boosting his magic, and I could spam his BSB due to constantly hitting wind vulnerability quickly due to command 1 removing cast time from his next action. It would probably be much more DPS than using Luneth. I have 50 mythril and zero faith I'd get anything useful from any current banners, and my only plan would be maybe saving for FFT or FF8, but my luck is awful and I still don't have any OSB lol. Not to mention I love Alphinaud and FFXIV so it'd be cool to be able to use him (that casting animation is awesome!) Thoughts? "

He'll also attack twice per turn once he enters his weak phase. ****** ###Strongest of Summons + 40 STAM (20/20) **Target Score Summary**: Lightning/Lower Magic **Can lose a max of 5 medals to master** Round 1|HP|Weak|Null|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Leviathan**|119,123|Lightning|Fire/Earth|Water|Silence/Slow/Blind|All **Target Scores:** 1.

Exploit Leviathan's weakness to lightning attacks. **Note(s):** * Leviathan will use both physical and magical attacks, but definitely lean towards magic as all his AoE's are magic-based. * Note he has a chance to counter physical attacks with a ST paralyze attack and black/white magic with an AoE water attack.

Defeat Famed Mimic Gogo without being KO'ed. 2. Lower Gogo's Attack. 3. Lower Gogo's Magic. **Note(s):** * **DO NOT ATTACK GOGO FOR THE BEGINNING PART OF THIS FIGHT!** Once Gogo congratulates you on mimicking him doing nothing, then you are free to attack. If you attack too many times before this trigger, he will enter his angry phase and allowing him to use his stronger attacks and getting a stat buff. Self-buffing is ok and won't trigger any counters. * Gogo uses a mixed offense, but his magic abilities (especially Meteor) are more dangerous than his physical attacks. Other than that, this is a fairly straightforward fight. ******* ###Eidolon of Bal Castle +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Odin**|197,678|Holy|Silence/Slow|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Odin without being KO'ed. 2. Defeat Odin before he takes ten turns. 3. Lower Odin's Defense. **Note(s):** * On his 10th turn, Odin will use Zantetsuken - you'll need to defeat him before this. If DPS is an issue, can always Slow him. * Fight is fairly straightforward, Odin only uses physical attacks so leave Shellga/MBD at home. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ###The Twelve Sealed Weapons (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Shield Dragon**|183,450|None|None|Poison|All **Exdeath's Soul**|180,527|Holy|Earth|None|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Lower the Shield Dragon's Defense. 2. Lower Exdeath's Soul's Magic. 3. Exploit Exdeath's Soul's weakness to holy attacks. **Note(s):** * Shield Dragon has undispellable reflect status, and has a 20% chance to counter physical attacks with a ST physical attack which has a chance to confuse - you can tauntilate the counter if desired. Shield Dragon has mixed attacks, which a slight preference to physical. * Exdeath's Soul has a preference to magic attacks, but does have an AoE physical attack to keep you honest as well. You'll want mixed mitigation for both. * Up to you to decide who to take out first. Exdeath's Soul is definitely the more dangerous of the pair, and Shield Dragon only uses physical attacks until he enters his weak phase, so he is easier to control. ****** ###Looming Warrior of Light(Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Resist|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Bartz**|308,836| **Target Score(s):** 1. Remove Bartz's Haste. 2. Lower Bartz's Attack. 3. Lower Bartz's Defense. **Note(s):** * This is basically a repeat of the last time we fought Bartz as a U+, but easier since his Kick access is locked at the beginning, so no more double kick shenanigans. Instead of Kick, he'll do two AoE Gravity attacks (40% current HP), followed by two single target attacks, so you may want to equip some KO resist accessories. All other mechanics are mostly the same - copied and pasted strats from our previous mega thread below. * Bartz has a 20% chance to counter physical attacks with Double Cut and a 20% chance to counter magic attacks with Missile (303% chance to deal 20% curHP damage to the entire party) once he is below 70% HP. * Once Bartz reaches 70% HP, he will use his SSB Trueblade of Legend, which is a random 5-hit attack and will increase his defense by 50%. You really should plan to bring Armor Break/Breakdown to remove the buff. * Once Bartz reaches 40% HP, he will use his BSB Four Radiances, which is a random 6-hit attack and will give him haste and increase his atk/def/mag/res by 50%. You should be ready with a Full Break as soon as he casts it to remove his increased stats before you get overwhelmed. * You may want to use Gigas Armlet/Necrophobe Ward on your weaker characters, as that will help with Bartz Fire/Ice/Lightning Spellblade attacks (he does not use any water attacks). * At the end of the day, Bartz is a physical powerhouse; any stacking debuffs you have access to will help immensely in this fight. * **CID MISSION: Complete Looming Warrior of Light(Ultimate+) in a party with only FF V heroes!** If you lack a strong medica, native KO resist accessories are the way to go to reduce the damage at the beginning. Other than that, just be sure you have Faris ready with Full Break at the 40%HP transition, and give one of your melee fighters an armor break/down. ****** ###Battle for the Dawn (Ultimate++) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Exdeath - Wind**|73,184|Wind|Poison|None|All **Exdeath - Water**|84,751|Water|Poison|None|All **Exdeath - Fire**|96,308|Fire|Poison|None|All **Exdeath - Earth**|123,274|Earth|Poison|None|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Lower Exdeath's Defense. 2. Lower Exdeath's Magic. 3. Exploit Exdeath's weakness to wind attacks when he is weak to it. **Note(s):** * This time you'll fight Exdeath four times. As you defeat each of his phases, he'll immediately respawn. Note he has an elemental vulnerability in each of the phases. * Exdeath uses both physical and magic attacks, so be prepared for both (but lean towards magic mitigation). Exdeath also likes to use lots of gravity attacks, so be ready with KO resist accessories. * Physical parties are at a severe disadvantage here - Exdeath has a ~10% chance to counter all physical attacks with an AoE dispel. Time to bring out your mage teams and exploit all those vulnerabilities! You'll also want a Dancer for your support as opposed to a traditional one to avoid triggering the counter. * Note that Exdeath will use Sword Dance (4 hit physical attack) when entering his Fire phase and Maelstorm (60% current HP damage) when entering earth phase, so plan your healing accordingly. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

Anyway, I recently got Fang's Highwind (XIII) SSB and Faris' Serpent's Gale SSB. Highwind does Fire and Wind damage, and Serpent's Gale gives Imperil Wind. I used Serpent's Gale and followed with Highwind, but I noticed it didn't indicate I was hitting a vulnerability. Is it still defaulting to fire damage? Seems it should be using Wind since the Imperil status is up. Thanks in advance."
205,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Some 6* Crystal + Mote Math,26,54uj2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/54uj2p/some_6_crystal_mote_math/,2016-09-28 13:39:25,"Hi. I don't make spreadsheets so this is going to be sloppy. Bare with me. Keep in mind that I'm only giving you current mote &amp; crystal numbers. No consideration for future event rewards is made here. These are my notes while I was writing in notepad how I would plan out my skill honing. **Important**: Following this method means that you will **not** shatter all possible copies of any skill. So if you ever change your mind about a skill, you **will** be able to make at least 1 copy (and how often do you bring multiple copies of the same skill?). Likewise, you'll be able to give several people 6* access. For the 40 mote skills, I shatter 1 copy, leaving 25 motes and 6 characters eligible to learn them. I shatter 3 Monk skills, and 3 Knight skills. Leaving 35 each and more than enough to do whatever you want. I'm making a 4th Aegis Strike and keeping it, because I feel like it. So 20 motes left. 8 6* potential Knights in total. I create 2 Demonsblood and shatter 1. Only 4 6* potential Samurais...out of like 6 or 7 in the game even in JP. **Disclaimer**: I'm **keeping** Snowspell Strike R2, Demonsblood R2, Aegis Strike R1, Stitch-in-Time R1, and aiming for Meltdown R2 and eventually Valigarmanda R2. Parentheses assumes I create the second copy of Demonsblood and shatter it. (Which it seems like I'm going to). *This chart assumes you've obtained every crystal so far, or at least the non-reoccuring crystals, a.k.a. non-nightmares*. **This chart assumes you've already created R1 Meltdown. If you haven't, add 10/6/6 Black/Fire/Earth crystals**. Orb | Base | Addition | Total ---------|----------|----------|---------- N-Ele | 15 | +0(5) | 15(20) Fire | 8 | +18 | 26 Ice | 4 | +17(20) | 21(24) Lightning | 5 | +17 | 22 Earth | 3 | +21 | 24 Holy | 6 | +15 | 21 Dark | 6 | +6(9) | 12(15) Power | 22 | X | X White | 10 | X | X Black | 4 | X | X Summon | 10 | X | X **Shatter List**: - Monk: Lifebanex3. 35 motes remaining. - Knight: Aegis Strikex3. 35 motes remaining. (Personally keeping a 4th copy @ R1, 20 motes remaining / 8 6* capable knights total). - Ninja: Stitch-in-Timex1. 25 motes remaining. (Personally keeping the 2nd copy @ R1, which is actually sufficient for the MAG buff considering the fast cast-speed of ninja skills, 10 motes remaining / 4 6* capable ninjas total). - Dragoon: Sky Highx1. 25 motes remaining. - Thief: Mug Bloodlustx1. 25 motes remaining. - Samurai: Demonsbloodx1. 25 motes remaining. (Persnally keeping the 2nd copy and honing it to R2, 10 motes remaining / 4 6* capable samurais total). - Machinist: Penalty Strikex1. 25 motes remaining. Honestly you don't take Machinists for damage. And I can't think of many bosses that matter with more than 1 status vulnerability. If it wasn't for gnawing OCD I'd actually shatter both copies. **Keep List**: - Snowspell R2: -20 Power, 12 Ice, 12, Wind. Can be done. **Why?**: Strongest spellblade by far. We're probably not getting a Chain-ST Aero Strike since Tornado Strike exists. Whether Chain Blizzara Strike will be craftable one day (remember ~~Waterga~~ Aeroga Strike still doesn't exist for whatever reason), we don't know, but even still this is the same thing as crafting both Meltdown and Chain Firaga. Indomitable Blade Celes + Snowspell = have fun. En-Ice Ayame or Squall is also good. - Demonsblood R2: -20 N.Ele, 12 Ice, 12 Dark. Can be done. I'm waiting until Ayame release since I want Gilgamesh, Orlandeau, &amp; Ayame to unlock Samurai 6* and this will leave room for 1 more learner. (I try to always leave a spare). **Why?**: 4 uses of this gives you 60 second Retaliate which is enough for any full-length fight. Even further. Retaliate also serves a use in JP's recent Nightmare fights (not the same as Globals), where the trash mobs are on serious steroids. 4 uses of Retaliate probably won't be sufficient, but it'll get a lot done when you consider that you're doing good AoE damage probably once per wave. Pairs extremely well with a R3 (or even R4) Gaia Cross which I plan on going for. You taunt physical attacks and either take very little damage thanks to Gaia Cross' DEF buff (NAT attacks), or retaliate. Gilgamesh &amp; Orlandeau-specific I believe. Two good characters that I like. - Valigarmanda R2: -30 Summon, 18 Ice, 18 Lightning. Summon &amp; Ice (will be at 0 after Snowspell and Demonsblood) are equally problematic. Need 20 &amp; 18 more. Remember Valigarmanda R1 has to **be crafted**. No free copy. Apparently even in JP, this can't be R2'd (because of Summon Crystals) without farming them off of certain U bosses. Rate for 1 crystal is like 5-8 mythril of refreshes so...yeah. Gotta use Runic or Alphinaud to really enjoy this. **Why?**: It's freaking powerful that's why. Pair it with a Grand Cross RW...or get lucky and get Alphinaud's ether-command BSB, and this becomes deadly. - Meltdown R2: -20 Black, 12 Fire, 12 Earth. Black is problematic. (I'm already at R1 so the cost is ignored). **Why?**: Same as Valigarmanda. If you have Exdeath's Grand Cross SB, or just want to RW 1, *or* have one of the many En-Fire SBs, this is magnificent damage when weakness is exploited. **Closing Statement**: Again, this is just some crystal/mote numbers and my reasoning. Not a guide saying ""hone these or be locked out of future content"". I'm having fun with my 6* abilities, but I'm not making stupid decisions either. Most veterans have enough SBs or hones that they really don't even need to bother with this to clear anything. They're probably steamrolling all current content anyways. "
206,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"[Mathcraft] Ultimate Mathcraft Part 4: Generic SSB, BSB and OSBs",20,54zaqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/54zaqj/mathcraft_ultimate_mathcraft_part_4_generic_ssb/,2016-09-29 09:23:57,"Now let's talk about the hype stuff: SSB, BSB (normal, envelope, imperil), and OSBs. ---------------- *Physical VS Magical* Physical SBs have a much higher damage potency than skills. The ability to use Lifesiphon means physical characters can enter burst mode much faster than mages without sacrificing too much damage, and one usually choose Damage+ RM for damage or Ace Striker for burst or more SBs. On the other hand, physical characters usually have an ATK higher than soft cap, so the +20% stat for burst mode is of less use. Magical SBs are the other way around. They're only 1.5x potency compared to 5\* skills, but the +20% MAG increases damage vastly. However, the only way to enter burst mode quickly is to use Mako Might, sacrificing a more powerful Devotion RM. ---------------- *Envelope and Imperil* The most notable characteristic for BSBs are envelope and imperil of elements. Whatever element there is, 1.5/1.8x damage is quite a bonus to any SB. Imperil only provides 1.2x, but adds 50% SB gain for elemental attacks. However, envelope and imperil BSBs tend to take a penalty to their value potency in both entry and commands. If the boss is resistant to said element, non-E option would be selected but at a lower potency. Let's compare Cloud and Tifa's BSB: - Cloud BSB: Entry 800 ST, ST command 280. - Tifa BSB: Entry 664 earth (1195.2 w/en-earth) + en-earth, ST command 216 earth/none (-&gt;324 w/en-earth). Hope's BSB is another example. It grants en-holy, and the burst command of holy element is of a lower potency to the one of earth element. ---------------- *OSB* The value of an OSB weapon is actually twofold: the stat of a 6\* weapon, and the OSB itself. With synergy, it has ~90 more attack than synergy 5\* and usually have an elemental boost. Without synergy, it can usually replace a synergy 5\* in terms of stats. Thus, the evaluation would be twofold also. One part is the evaluation of OSB itself, and that is done assuming the same ATK value as other SBs. The other part is the evaluation of 90 more ATK and elemental boost. ---------------- *Skills* For elemental SBs, the best skill would be the 5\* matching the SB's associated element. Physical characters may or may not have that, but magical characters usually have that except for some very rare case. In this evaluation, I assume physical characters have Lifesiphon only, and magical characters have the chain-spell associated with the element. ---------------- *Benchmark SB* This part doesn't consider character-specific SBs and SB/skill composition. For example, dark mages' BSB may be more potent since they can use memento mori on top of Onion Knight's buff. Specific SBs like Maria BSB or Orlandeau OSB are substantially better than their same-level counterparts. This part also ignore any special effect, defensive qualities or AOE/Multi-part bosses. For example, Galuf BSB takes a penalty in potency but get additional healing in commands. Similarly, boss is assumed to have no vulnerability. If boss is vulnerable to fire, then fire elements would definitely win, but usually you still need to fit some other elements to the team. Benchmark SB are usually selected from actual SBs, although in some cases there is no exact SB and I have to do some mix-and-match. For example, there is no imperil physical SB with ST command without other effects, so I picked one ST entry's potency with another ST command's potency. ---------------- *Team buff* I'm assuming +50% ATK buff for physical characters (Shout), or +30% MAG buff to magical characters (OK, Sheepsong). ---------------- *SB gain* I'm assuming 12 SB per second from boss, which means 50% AOE/ST rate and 2.5s turn for boss. In the end you would see some ""negative SB"", which simply means it's unlikely (but possible) to get so many SB casts. ---------------- *Result* For the 45s damage list, see here: URL - SSB item of both type deals ~180k per 45s. - For physical SBs, OSBs deal 60k more damage than SSBs. Normal BSB isn't much of an improvement. Envelope is lower than OSBs, but it can catch OSB with a mere r2 of 5\* ability. Imperil-type even with a r2 5\* ability would still be 20000 short to OSB-level, but giving teammates a +20% damage buff can easily get you an extra 20000. - Assuming you already have a base team of SSBs, normal physical BSBs are almost useless, and benchmark Envelope/Imperil BSB + r2 5\* gives you ~60000 damage, with bonus damage for r3 5\* . Benchmark OSB gives you ~60000 damage, plus ~60000 when you have realm synergy (90 ATK + elemental boost). - For magical BSBs, we get a similar result, with a slight higher value for regular BSBs. OSB deals 235k, and Envelope BSB deals 246k (remember: it assumes r3 5\*). Imperil deals around 21.3k but again, you need a team. - In the magical case, normal BSB would be a boost to SSB (30k more). Imperil, envelope and OSB can get you ~50000-60000 damage bonus. However, in this case OSB stat stick gives a much higher value due to the higher MAG cap. - Remember that many BSB commands have some other effect, and those would make those BSBs much powerful than standard. At this moment I would consider envelope/imperil BSB and OSBs of borderline quality: anything lower than that have to at least have some useful quality for me to pull for, at least for non-newbies who can reliably hone 5\*s.

If the answer is yes, you should not worry. The Powerchain + Full Charge combo is one of the strongest on FFRK and it should be strongly considered for Cid Missions. Even though it would be ideal to have both abilities at R3, you could make it work at R2 by managing your attacks and saving at least a couple of uses for the boss' final moments. --------------------- ****Stun Machine**** - Northern Cross - Dismissal Interrupt is the most common vulnerability you can take advantage of. In fact, 65 out of the 82 following Ultimate bosses are vulnerable to it. These two abilities not only provide Zack with a great DPS but great utility. 30% and 25% chance of restarting the enemy's ATB bar while dealing decent damage. You could swap Dismissal with the classic Lifesiphon (if you got any of his SBs), but this setup works perfectly if you do not have any and your Powerchain+Full Charge combo is not honed enough. --------------------- ****Soul Break Thingy**** - Powerchain - Lifesiphon If your damage directly relies on your Soul Breaks, this is the best setup. In fact, Zidane is part of my A team with this setup (and his BSSB, of course). It is quite simple: equip Zack with Ace Striker or Battleforged, use Lifesiphon twice, Powerchain once, and the SB you got. Repeat until the boss is dead. Even though the Powerchain+Full Charge combo has a greater DPS (since you do not need to charge your SB gauge to use Full Charge), you will be dealing more damage throughout the fight. --------------------- ****Next Year's Strong and Independent Speedster**** - Omega Drive - Lifesiphon or Northern Cross/Dismissal. Omega Drive or Full Charge? Which one should 5* Combat users use? Let's do some math. A level 80 Zack with 711 attack (190 base, 474 geared, 711 under Shout) uses Omega Drive against a 1700 DEF boss (after using Full Break) in a FFVII realm. It would deal 15540 damage (3885 per hit). Full Charge would deal 14544 damage (3636 per hit). In terms of damage, Omega Drive is a little bit stronger (over the soft cap), but it isn't that much of a difference. What it does makes a difference is the casting time: 1.65 seconds vs Full Charge's 3.30 seconds. So, is it worth? Right now, it isn't. However, in a year or year and a half (when 6* abilities get easier to hone), it is a great alternative to Full Charge, since it does not depend on Powerchain to have a great dps. The second ability could be whatever you fancy the most: Lifesiphon if you got one of his SBs, or Northern Cross/Dismissal for the Stun chance. --------------------- ****Doing anything for Cloud (again)**** - Support ability. - Damage choice. Thanks to his Support 3 access, Zack is able to exploit a huge number of vulnerabilities: Confuse (Cry), Paralyze (Intimidate, Paralyzing Shot), Silence (Silence Buster), Blind (Dark Buster) Poison (Venom Buster), Sleep (Sleep Buster), Stop (Shadowbind) and, of course, Interrupt/Stun. Even though he will not keep the boss status-locked with just one cast (leaving Blind and Poison aside), he will not need more than 3 uses to do so with Confuse, Sleep and Slow. He will need 3+ for Paralyze and Silence, and Stop should only be used if meant to fill medal conditions. It is a shame that future FFVII Ultimate fights have no exploitable vulnerabilities other than Interrupt. However, there are some Ultimates from other realms where Poison, Blind and Slow can be taken advantage of. If you want to take Zack to other realms, keep this in mind. --------------------- **Notes on specific abilities**. * **Crushdown**. Even though this is the most powerful AOE ability Zack can use, I do not see myself using it. Probably, because it shares orbs with great abilities that I plan on using. Leaving Power Crystals aside, it shares Fire Crystals with Omega Drive, Mug Bloodlust and Meltdown, and Earth Crystals with Meltdown and Curada. Also, there are not that many multi-target U+/+ fights where this ability could be game-changing, so yeah. * **Quick Hit**. It can provide you with a great DPS, but I think that the Powerchain + Full Charge combo is a way better investment. If you got a R3+ Quick Hit, feel free to pair it up with any of the abilities mentioned above (Lifesiphon if you got any SB, Dismissal/Northern Cross if you want to Stun, Omega Drive/Full Charge for brute force...) * **Dervish [JP]**. It doesn't look bad on paper, but why would you use it when you got Northern Cross? In my opinion, the 0.40 extra potency (if Hasted) is not worth the loss of a 30% Stun (and Stop) chance. Also, it shares Power and Wind crystals with great abilities like Mug Bloodlust, Snowspell Strike and, of course, Northern Cross. ---------------------------- **FFVII SYNERGY** When speaking about Cid Missions, Zack's role is quite simple: quick damage + stun. But, if you pulled any of his relics, how well does he synergize with his fellow FF7 buddies? Let's talk about Apocalypse and Meteor Shots (~~sorry, Helicopter Thingy~~). **Apocalypse - Homemade Shout** Apocalypse will make its reappearance tomorrow. It deals four ranged attacks (1.50 each) and grants Haste to all allies. To most physical teams, Haste is provided by the overknown Shout. However, you might need to RW Wall if the boss' damage is too high. If that is the case, you can make your homemade Shout combining Apocalypse with a Boostga. Options: * **Tifa's Burning Arrow**. It raises the team's ATK by 35% during 25 seconds. It is not as powerful as Shout, but you could get over the softcap anyways, since most players' FFVII synergy is absurd. * **Aerith's Planet Protector**. It raises the team's ATK by 50% during 25 seconds. Homemade Shout. * **Red XIII's Protector's Roar**. It raises the team's ATK, DEF and MND by 30% during 25 seconds. Coming in the same banner as Apocalypse, you might get both. If you do, you should known that this boostga stacks with either Tifa's or Aerith's, and not only provides you with ATK, buf DEF and MND. * **Red XIII's Starry Canyon [JP]**. It raises the team's ATK and MAG by 30% during 25 seconds and grants High Regen. Red's Burst will come to Global in ~April. **Meteor Shots - Wind Massacre [JP]** Zack's BSSB will come to Global in ~January. It deals eight random Wind and Earth ranged attacks (0.96 each), causes Imperil Wind 20% for 25 seconds and grants Haste and Burst Mode to the user. Attack deals four Wind or NE single attacks (0.47 each) while Defend deals two Wind or NE group attacks (0.60 each). Even though it is not the first FFVII Imperil Wind (Cid's Dragon was), Cid should be using other SBs if given the chance. So, how can Cid and Cloud take advantage from Zack's Meteor Shots? * **Cloud**, as we speak, has two Soul Breaks that attach him with Wind: Climhazzard, available in the first banner (Cloud's Guise), and Cloud Motorcycle, his newest BSSB (Ultima Blade, coming to Global in ~April). To top that, he has Finishing Touch, his new Wind OSB. * Leaving Dragon aside, **Cid** is getting a new SSB: Big Brawl. It deals TWELVE Wind random attacks (0.65 each) and grants No Air Time 3 to the user, which synergizes really well with Sky High. Big Brawl's relic, the Cid Goggles, provide Wind attacks with an extra 20% damage (amazing relic to use with any of these 3 characters). And, in ~6 months, he will be getting his new BSSB: Dragon Dive. In terms of damage, it isn't much of a difference versus Big Brawl (8 vs 7.80), but it attaches Cid with the Wind element. However, the commands are great, since they deal an extra hit if exploiting weakness (thing that will happen if you use Zack's Meteor Shots). * **Final Combo**: Zack imperils the boss, Cloud and Cid use their BSSB to attach themselves with Wind. Zack uses his BSSB commands, Cloud charges Finishing Touch, Cid uses his BSSB commands. Insane damage output. -------------------------------------------------- Aaaaaaaaaaaand, that's it! - Did you find this useful? If so, which character would you be interested to read about next? I thought of making one each time a new event drops. Characters I have thought about: Amarant, Ricard/Josef/Guy, Balthier, Jecht, Noel, Edge, Luneth/Onion Knight, Ayame/Curilla, Laguna, Shadow, Reno. - Do you see any mistakes or have a different take on a setup? Tell me! Thank you for reading :)"

Exploit a Red Dragon's weakness to ice attacks. **Note(s):** * AoE (especially Tornado Strike) work wonders here, and note that they have multiple vulnerabilities to exploit. * You can also just bring a Cloud OSB RW and use one cast on each to 1 shot it if the RW is sufficiently geared. ******* ###??? +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Weak|Resist|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Meltigemini**|201,712|Fire/Holy|Dark|Blind|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Meltigemini without being KO'ed. 2. Exploit Meltigemini's weakness to holy attacks. 3. Reduce Meltigemini's Magic. **Note(s):** * Note that he has both AoE physical and magic attacks, so bring both types of mitigations (Blind also works for the physical attacks). He also has two common weaknesses, just blow him up. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ###??? (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Resist|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Taharka**|257,895|Fire/Wind|Ice|Earth|None|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Exploit Taharka's weakness to fire attacks. 2. Exploit Taharka's weakness to wind attacks. 3. Reduce Taharka's Magic. **Note(s):** * While in his regular phase, Taharka will only use magic ice attacks. Randomly he will switch to his Curled mode, which will increase his defense and his moves will only be physical based. * Definitely bring both types of mitigation, as when he is in his curled phase he has access to Chop Cut, which ignores defense (and hurts quite a bit). ****** ###For All Life (Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Kraken**|277,241|Water|None|All **Left Tentacle**|75,747|Water|None|All **Right Tentacle**|75,747|Water|None|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce Kraken's Magic. 2. Defeat Kraken before he uses Ink 5 times. 3. Win before Kraken uses Ultimate Waterga. **Note(s):** * The fight starts with Kraken and his left and right tentacle. You cannot kill both tentacles or else Kraken will immediately enter his solo phase, which unlocks his Ultimate Waterga attack, additional counters, and most likely costing you mastery. * It is recommended to kill his Left Tentacle, as it is the only one capable of using the Ink attack, which not only linked to a medal criteria, but supremely annoying if your support 5* character is inflicted with it. * You will be hit here with both physical and magical AoE attacks, so don't skimp on either mitigation. Draw Fire/Magic Lure will work great here for the ST attacks. If using Magic Lure, would give that character a water resistance accessory to really cut down the damage your party takes. ****** ###A Promise of Friendship (Ultimate++) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Resist|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Zorn**|84,751|None|None|None|All **Thorn**|84,751|None|None|None|All **Meltigemini**|164,092|Fire/Holy|Dark|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Zorn and Thorn before they use Twincast Meteor 4 times. 2. Exploit Meltigemini's weakness to fire attacks. 3. Reduce Meltigemini's Magic. **Note(s):** * For those who were drawn into a lull by how relatively easy Diamond Weapon was for the U++, this fight is significantly harder, mostly due to how hard Meltigenimi hits with his AoE Bio attack. * The fight begins with just Zorn and Thorn. Every 5 turns they will use Twincast Meteor, giving you plenty of time to take them out before failing the medal condition. Overall, they are not too difficult, just be sure to bring max magic mitigation (their only physical attack is a token ST attack). Ideally you will go all out and defeat them before getting hit with Twincast Meteor. * Once Zorn and Thorn are defeated, Meltigenimi will spawn. He is very fast (650 SPD), and hits like a truck. Meltigenimi will always start with using Poison Powder (AoE Poison), followed by a resistance-ignoring Meteor attack. After that, you will most likely be hit with an AoE Bio attack, which without Wall will most likely hit you in the ~2500-3000 range with typical mitigation. Meltigenimi will use a ST physical attack as a 35% counter, but it ignores defense anyway, so leave Protectga at home. * **CID MISSION: Complete A Promise of Friendship (Ultimate++) in a party with only FF IX heroes!** This is a fairly difficult CM since you most likely won't be able to bring a Wall. Similar to U+ Bartz, a medica of some kind is pretty much required to keep up with all the AoE damage. Quina is required as your only support 5* character. If you happen to have a native FF9 hastega, Celes BSB is great here, allowing for a mixed team (Chain Firaga, Alexander, Saint Cross are all great abilities here) and gives the user en-holy with a holy BSB command. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

210,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,WanderingNewbie's Guide: Friendship Ribbon Bonus Battles,11,584tfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/584tfm/wanderingnewbies_guide_friendship_ribbon_bonus/,2016-10-19 03:43:34,"Were entering into a new time of Bonus Fights, as such Ill be cutting down on the length of U+ write ups, well as much as I can. As always if the Guide is too long for you videos are at the bottom. &amp;nbsp; *** # **Release and Catch+** [Party Setup](URL The Boss Rush this time around involves Ark and Valia Pira. Ark thankfully is a much easier version since it doesnt have the Mass Confuse attack. Do note that it still has Photon which will knock people down to 1 HP. Valia keeps its usual gimmick of being weaker the more FF9 characters you have. If you cant bring too many I suggest at least 2 because that gives you the simplest move set. Ark is Physical and Valia is Magic, so youll need Protectga, Shellga and Magic/Power Breaks and youll be able to deal with their damage. Also both bosses are weak to Wind and Slow but if you plan to use slow on Valia you should also bring a Dispel to deal with its reflect. &amp;nbsp; *** # **Taken Away++** [Party Setup](URL The Red Dragons biggest threat is that there are two of them. A majority of their attacks are Physical but they have one AoE Magic attack. Bring the usual protections to deal with their damage, such as Protectga and Shellga while also alternating breaks on them. Both are weak to Ice and Wind so utilize some good AoE attacks like Tornado Strike and Shiva. If you still finding them to be a bit of an issue theyre Vulnerable to a number of status effects like Paralyze, Slow, Stop, and Sleep. &amp;nbsp; *** # **A Final Thank You+++** [Party Setup] (URL Meltigemini is a pretty straight forward boss. Theyll start the beginning of the fight by Sapping your whole party. After that theyll use a mix of Magic and Physical single target and AoE attacks. Bringing Protectga, Shellga, and Power/Magic Breaks should be able to cover your defenses. Meltigemini has a massive weakness to Holy and Fire as well as a Vulnerability to being Blinded to reduce their Physical threat even more. Just dont count on using any Dark attacks as they resist those. NOTE, ignore the Slowga on Eiko, that was a bad party transition not saving abilities right, you should bring Shellga. &amp;nbsp; *** # **Friends in Need (Ultimate)** [Party Setup] (URL and the [Stats](URL **Soul Breaks Used** **- Lunatic High** &amp;nbsp; **Fight Overview** **#1** Taharka has 1418 Def and 2436 Res in Normal Form and 2500 Def and 2136 Res when Flattened **#2** Taharka uses only Ice Magic in Normal Form, and only Physical Attacks in Flattened **#3** Taharka is weak to Fire and Wind, Resists Ice, and Immune to Earth &amp;nbsp; **Setup** Taharka is a welcoming breath of relief after last weeks Zolom. Due to being split damage Protectga, Shellga, Magic and Power breaks are needed to lessen your incoming damage. You can also utilize Ice Resist accessories to lessen the Normal forms damage even more. Youll want to take advantage of its elemental weaknesses in order to speed up the fight. Aerora Firaga and Tornado Strike, Meltdown and Chain Firaga are all perfect for this. If you have a native Hastaga bringing a Maria Song RW will let you use a Hybrid party and utilize the Burst commands for even more damage. &amp;nbsp; **Execution** Taharka is not an overly complex boss as far as execution goes. Just get your buffs and debuffs going and then unload your strongest attacks to tear the boss apart. The only wrinkle is if you bring Physical DPS and the boss Flattens. Mages can do pretty good damage in Normal form but Melee will lose a bit of DPS in Flattened form most of the time, unless theyre hitting weakness. I honestly found the Flattened form to be more dangerous damage wise form the boss, since you can reduce Ice damage if you have the accessories for it. &amp;nbsp; *** # **Monster in the Deep (Ultimate+)** [Party Setup](URL and the [Stats](URL **Soul Breaks Used** **- Trabia's Light** &amp;nbsp; **Fight Overview** **#1** Kraken has 1200 Def and 1977 Res, both him and the Tentacles **#2** If both Tentacles are killed Kraken will transfer to its much rougher Solo phase **#3** After 8 turns the Left Tentacle will start using Ink and Blinding party members **#4** Kraken and the Tentacles use a lot of Single Target Water and Physical attacks &amp;nbsp; **Setup** Krakens damage can be dampened in a number of ways. Aside from Protectga, Shellga, and Magic/Power Breakdown, Kraken is extremely vulnerable to Draw Fire and Magic Lure. Slap a Water Resist Accessory on your Magic Lure user and youll take almost no damage from Water and Water Cannon. Placing a Drain move on your Draw Fire user also synergies really well. Should be stated that if you have Protectga and Draw Fire you really dont need Power Break, just keep the main body Magic and Full Broken. Last note is Ultimate Freeze which is a percentile HP attack, best use some Death Resist accessories to deal with that attack. For offense you can really bring whatever since Kraken has no elemental weakness, just make sure you have the damage to go the distance. &amp;nbsp; **Execution** Much like the Taharka, Kraken is pretty simple once you have your defenses and debuffs up. That said its not completely without threat. If you are not prepared for it Ultimate Freeze can really mess up your party. Also you are on a bit of a time limit with either beating Kraken before the Left Tentacle uses Ink or beating the Left Tentacle before then. The latter is a bit rougher because it requires you to bring more damage to the fight to deal with the Tentacle. Whichever strategy you choose to execute just keep the pressure up on Kraken keep your Taunters healed up and ready to tank. *** # **A Promise of Friendship (Ultimate++)** [Party Setup](URL and the [Stats](URL **Soul Breaks Used** **- Trabia's Light** **- Lunatic High** &amp;nbsp; **Fight Overview** **#1** Zorn and Thorn have 1699 Def and 2288 Res, Meltigemini has 3056 Def and 3848 Res **#2** Zorn and Thorn use a simple pattern of forced Phys attacks and Ice and Fire magic, until their 5th and every 5 turns after where they cast Meteor **#3** Zorn and Thorn cannot cast Meteor if one of them is dead **#4** Once both Zorn and Thorn are dead they will transform into Meltigemini **#5** Meltigemini will change phases at 50% and gain Atk and Mag **#6** Each of Meltigeminis phases starts with an Auto-Hit status move followed by Ultimate Meteor, which will be reused every 3rd turn **#7** Meltigemini after theyre forced attacks will follow up with strong single target and AoE Magic **#8** Meltigemini also has a Piercing Physical Counter to any and all damage **#9** Meltigemini is weak to Fire and Holy, Zorn and Thorn have no weaknesses &amp;nbsp; **Setup** The fight here is actually two DPS checks in one. You need to plan to take down both Zorn and Thorn, at least one of them, ASAP and then also be capable to eliminate Meltigemini as fast as possible because they are absolutely relentless. That said you do also need some proper protection. Zorn and Thorn do have physical attacks but they might be possible to ignore, so you can forgo bringing Protectga. Shellga, Magic Breakdown and Full Break are a must though. If you can work two healers into your party that will actually help a ton as well, though a Medica can make up for that if you have a good one. Should also note that Magic Lure can really help out in this fight, Zorn and Thorn have a 70% chance of using single target spells and Meltigemini has about 30ish% for single target. Knowing where those spells will land can really help. &amp;nbsp; Whether you go Physical or Magic theres one thing for sure you need DPS wise, Multi hit Holy and Fire attacks. These are outrageously important for Phase 2/3 of the fight. For Phase 1 youll either need some very strong single target or some extremely good AoE. Full Charge and Thiefs Revenge can work for the former and Meteor and Bahamut for the latter. I wouldnt recommend moves like Saints Cross and Alexander for Phase 1, not because theyre bad, but because theyre better served in Meltigemini for that DPS race. Should also be noted that a properly buffed Mage using a Vivi BSB RW can tear apart Meltigemini with relative ease. &amp;nbsp; **Execution** First up Zorn and Thorn, youll want to get your defenses up ASAP, Shellga and Protectga if youre using it and any breaks you have, as well as Magic Lure if you brought it. Once thats squared away, Tag both Zorn and Thorn with Full Break, to lessen both the physical attacks they have and to boost the DPS of your AoEs while also lessening their magic damage. If you do not have a R2 Full Break, Magic Breakdown is fine. Focus on taking them out ASAP or taking out one of them as fast as possible if youre not using AoE, once one is down try to recoup before heading into the Meltigemini phase. &amp;nbsp; Once fighting Meltigemini youre now in a race against the clock. They will give you one free turn before destroying your face and you need to use this to pump 85k worth of damage into them ASAP. This will transition them to Weak phase and cause another forced Status attack, giving you another turn to breath. You will almost always eat an Ultimate Meteor so if you have Medicas start using it as soon as you are hit with the Status move. If you dont think that youll beat the first standard Bio turn then make SURE you Medica or spot heal your weakest members, and then pray you get single target Bio. Once in Phase 3 go all out, its a race to the finish and Meltigemini is wearing jet boots, so forgo healing your healer at this point make sure your DPS have HP and pray you can outlast them. &amp;nbsp; **Cid Missions** This one is particularly rough. If you dont have a native Hastaga its going to be hard with a standard strategy. Youll probably have to abuse the Caster using Vivi BSB RW. /u/Xarukas has a pretty good setup [over here](URL but it does require a Synergy Mage weapon to fully pull off. &amp;nbsp; *** #**Conclusion** Man we have not had a DPS check like the Ultimate++ in a long time. It was extremely rough and I hope were not looking at the new norm. That all said, it was still at the very least a fast fight and going that all out for once was pretty fun. Best of luck to the lot of you because youre going to need it for this one. &amp;nbsp; [Full Stream](URL &amp;nbsp; [Just Fights](URL &amp;nbsp; [Ultimate Taharka](URL &amp;nbsp; [Ultimate+ Kraken](URL &amp;nbsp; [Ultimate++ Meltigemini](URL &amp;nbsp; Give me any suggestions for how to improve the videos and the Guide, and if you want to catch the stream live follow me at URL "
211,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"[Diving Deep] #8 - FF1: Unintentionally left ""blank"" edition!",22,51xyuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/51xyuq/diving_deep_8_ff1_unintentionally_left_blank/,2016-09-10 01:27:53,"*[Diving Deep](URL is a series of posts exploring the Record Spheres system and its impact on the several characters of FFRK.* Every saga has a beginning; for Final Fantasy, it is the first game, in which four anonymous heroes saved the world from a stable time loop. As a certain fighting game pointed out sagely: ""Transcending history and the world, a tale of souls and swords, eternally retold..."" For FF1, one form of the retelling is Mobius, which features reimaginings of the goings-on of FF1, yet leaning on recurring themes and common elements. This is my story, a tale of the Record Dives of MOST of FFRK's playable FF1 and Mobius characters. Most, because Wol, the intentionally anonymous protagonist of Mobius, has not been graced with a Dive yet. AT LEAST NOT UNTIL RUFUS EVENT. ---- **The Warrior of Light** Triple broken: Yes (first wave) RD access: Feature-initial Native 5-star jobs: Knight Skill pool: 5\* Combat, Knight; 4\* White; 2\* Celerity Skill upgrades: Thief 3; Ninja 3 Stats by Lv | HP | ATK | DEF | MAG | RES | MND | SPD :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Lv 80 | 6439 | 163 | 165 | 97 | 113 | 91 | 109 Lv 99 | 7930 | 200 | 197 | 123 | 142 | 112 | 118 RD mod | 855 | 27 | 18 | - | 2 | - | - Sphere cost | Vit | Spi | Wis | Dex | Brv | Spheres :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|- 3\* | 75 | - | 30 | 45 | 75 | Warrior, Monk, Thief 4\* | 90 | 15 | 15 | 45 | 60 | Master, Ninja, ""Knight"" (Paladin) Passives: Knight +6% WoL has a dive that attempts to reference all of the physical jobs in FF1: Fighter, Knight, Thief, Ninja, Monk, and Master. The result, sadly, is a bit awkward; you're unlikely to try to use him as a ninja, and Thief 3 is almost useless (though Steal HP gives him a marginal argument for taunt-drain.) The stat line is a bit less than exciting, though he does enjoy one of the higher HP dives. Also, Warrior of Light's dive has a rare property in that none of the 4-star spheres has more than one requisite, meaning you can get at that Knight damage boost relatively quickly. ----- **Sarah** Triple broken: Yes (second wave) RD access: EX Gold Fes (final cleanup) Native 5-star jobs: Bard Skill pool: 5\* White, Bard Skill upgrades: None Stats by Lv | HP | ATK | DEF | MAG | RES | MND | SPD :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Lv 80 | 4279 | 101 | 83 | 121 | 142 | 179 | 123 Lv 99 | 5270 | 124 | 105 | 149 | 169 | 213 | 135 RD mod | 510 | - | - | - | 21 | 29 | - Sphere cost | Vit | Spi | Wis | Dex | Brv | Spheres :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|- 3\* | 15 | 110 | 40 | 60 | - | Bard, White, Dancer 4\* | - | 95 | 85 | 45 | - | Geomancer, Devout, Illusionist Passives: WHT +12%; Silence resist. Her Allegro Sphere gives an additional WHT +3%. Sarah has virtually the same RD as a certain other pink-haired princess (Lenna,) just with more HP instead of the sleep resist. In addition, she can get even more healing power out of the S.Lv 3 of her Allegro con Moto sphere if you want. As for Allegro, it's actually less interesting to her than to the other full bards (Edward, Kefka, and Cait Sith) if you use her as a healer-White. As an ATTACKER-White, even though she doesn't get any WHT damage bumps, she will use Allegro much as Kefka will: one high-honed attack spell plus Allegro R1. (Her SBs don't really support this playstyle; other than the HotE clone which is obviously for physical teams, her stuff is healing and more healing.) ---- **Garland** Triple broken: Yes (third wave) RD access: Dissidia Cosmos Native 5-star jobs: (Darkness) Skill pool: 5\* Combat, Darkness; 3\* Knight Skill upgrades: None Stats by Lv | HP | ATK | DEF | MAG | RES | MND | SPD :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Lv 80 | 6069 | 173 | 130 | 124 | 116 | 88 | 108 Lv 99 | 7253 | 212 | 155 | 157 | 142 | 111 | 116 RD mod | 830 | 33 | 14 | 1 | - | - | - Sphere cost | Vit | Spi | Wis | Dex | Brv | Spheres :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|- 3\* | 90 | 30 | 30 | - | 75 | Knight, Red, Warrior 4\* | 94 | - | 30 | 71 | 30 | Warmage, Dark Knight, Gladiator Passives: Knight +6%; Darkness +6%; sleep and blind resists. Knight damage with the Knight 3 skillset means... Shield Bash and Mental Bash. Yay. Darkness damage, plus that random one point of MAG and the right mage melee weapon, could turn Garland into a true dark-zoning future god of destruction! Also, you have to take the Darkness damage if you want the blind resist. ...umm, yeah. Garland kinda got the short end of the ever-changing gem here. ---- **Echo** Triple broken: Yes (fifth wave) RD access: EX Gold Fes (final cleanup) Native 5-star jobs: (Dance) Skill pool: 5\* Black, Dance; 4\* White Skill upgrades: None Stats by Lv | HP | ATK | DEF | MAG | RES | MND | SPD :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Lv 80 | 4117 | 75 | 86 | 183 | 162 | 150 | 140 Lv 99 | 5070 | 93 | 109 | 218 | 199 | 184 | 153 RD mod | 455 | - | - | 30 | 6 | 19 | - Sphere cost | Vit | Spi | Wis | Dex | Brv | Spheres :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|- 3\* | 15 | 105 | 75 | 30 | - | Black, White, Dancer 4\* | - | 105 | 105 | 15 | - | Magus, Devout, Time Mage Passives: BLK+9%; WHT+9% Someone forgot to tell Echo that Sarah is FF1's designated White Mage. Not that Echo would care, of course; she just wants to force me to say that she gets a standard hybrid mage package. ---- **Super Monk** Triple broken: No RD access: Beginning of the Legend Native 5-star jobs: Monk Skill pool: 5\* Combat, Monk Skill upgrades: None Stats by Lv | HP | ATK | DEF | MAG | RES | MND | SPD :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Lv 80 | 5570 | 177 | 104 | 95 | 98 | 118 | 173 Lv 99 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - RD mod | 560 | 40 | 10 | - | 3 | - | - Sphere cost | Vit | Spi | Wis | Dex | Brv | Spheres :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|- 3\* | 75 | - | - | 45 | 105 | Monk, Warrior, Ranger 4\* | 135 | - | - | 30 | 60 | Master Monk, Gladiator, Berserker Passives: Monk +12% Having one of the best baseline ATK scores and Zell's speed, this evolved form of Monk unfortunately finds himself with the same defensive problem as Jecht and Refia, but without their ranged options. As usually happens with these Record Dives, the stat loadout enhances his one strength without doing very much to offset his vulnerability. But hey, that's what his SSB is for, right? As for the question of Lifebane... he can't help himself in the ATK-buffing department as well as the better Monks, which blunts his inherent advantage; and Lifebane NEEDS five hits to even think about competing with Omega Drive. ---- **Matoya** Triple broken: No RD access: Beginning of the Legend Native 5-star jobs: None Skill pool: 5\* Black, White Skill upgrades: None Stats by Lv | HP | ATK | DEF | MAG | RES | MND | SPD :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Lv 80 | 4150 | 85 | 85 | 182 | 150 | 173 | 123 Lv 99 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - RD mod | 340 | - | - | 24 | 9 | 22 | - Sphere cost | Vit | Spi | Wis | Dex | Brv | Spheres :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|- 3\* | 15 | 105 | 105 | - | - | Black, Red, White 4\* | 15 | 105 | 105 | - | - | Magus, Devout, Sage Passives: BLK +9%, WHT +9%; Silence resist This is, again, a standard hybrid package; what's strange, however, is just how *weak* it looks at first glance. The HP dive is one of the worst (though FF7's resident doge, of all characters, wins the race to the bottom there); and she doesn't even muster 30 MAG as most Black Mages do. However, unlike most other white/other hybrids, she has a balanced RD between MAG and MND; Cait Sith and Yuna also have this property. This will improve her ability in either role, or both at the same time for that matter. ---- **Wol** Triple broken: Fourth wave RD access: The Rufus Event Native 5-star jobs: (Shooter) Skill pool: 5\* Shooter; 4\* Celerity, Support, Samurai, Thief; 3\* Dragoon, Combat Skill upgrades: Dragoon -&gt; 4; Thief -&gt; 5 Stats by Lv | HP | ATK | DEF | MAG | RES | MND | SPD :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Lv 80 | 5594 | 164 | 115 | 98 | 121 | 110 | 167 Lv 99 | 6889 | 202 | 141 | 120 | 149 | 135 | 179 RD mod | 725 | 33 | 10 | - | 2 | - | - Sphere cost | Vit | Spi | Wis | Dex | Brv | Spheres :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|- 3\* | 60 | - | 30 | 60 | 75 | Warrior, Ranger, Thief 4\* | 75 | - | 15 | 90 | 45 | Dragoon, Cannoneer, Ninja Passives: Shooter +3%; Thief +3% So this is what we waited this side of forever to get. Thief 5 makes a decent case provided you care to triple break him, as like Vaan he's not fast enough to five-hit TR at just 80. Dragoon 4 offers... well, nothing that Thief 5 doesn't, come to think of it. Otherwise, this is about as interesting as Wol himself. "

Now, that wave of abilities has come and gone, and power creep demands that future abilities must come and be desirable enough to make us want to spend more mythril to hone them. I'm here to find out if that demand has been realized, and how to best prepare for it before the all-important Orb Fest hits us. &amp;nbsp; ###Ability Release Schedule Ability | School | Event :--|:--:|:--: Chain Blizzaga | Black Magic | Paine(FFX) Meteor Crash | Monk | Paine(FFX) Angelsong | Bard | Gold Fes^A Chain Firaga | Black Magic | Eiko(FFIX) Chain Stonaga | Black Magic | Guy(FFII) Chain Thundaga | Black Magic | Larsa(FFXII) Sapphire Shot | Shooter | Tidus(FFX) Lightning Dive | Dragoon | Kain(FFIV) Titan | Summoning | Kain(FFIV) Second Wind Cannon | Monk | Onion Knight(FFIII) Gaia Cross | Knight | Onion Knight(FFIII) Ultima Weapon | Summoning | OSB Fest Chain Bioga | Black Magic | Squall(VIII) A: Gold Fes was a very large event in JP and it stands to reason that Global will also see it in some capacity. However, I note it because some elements of the event were tied to the 2016 Brass de Bravo album release. This adds a little ambiguity to the timing and the possibility of changes. Also note that though I chose to end the list with Chain Bioga, there is a new ability being released two events after it. I chose the Squall event as the cut off mostly arbitrarily. I felt the need to cut off somewhere, as they do not seem to be stopping the release of 5* abilities from that Paine event onward. By request, I can turn this post into an updated list, or release a new one once another cut off point presents itself. &amp;nbsp; ###The Orb Cost Chart Ability | BLK | WHT | PWR | SUM | NON | FIR | ICE | LIT | EAR | WND | HLY | DRK :--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--: Chain Blizzaga | 10 | | | | 6 | | 6 | | | | | Meteor Crash | | | 10 | | | 6 | | | 6 | | | Angelsong | | 6 | | | | | | | 6 | | 10 | Chain Firaga | 10 | | | | 6 | 6 | | | | | | Chain Stonaga | 10 | | | | | | | | 6 | | | 6 Chain Thundaga | 10 | | | | | | | 6 | | 6 | | Sapphire Shot | | | | | | | 10 | 6 | | | 6 | Lightning Dive | | | | | | | 6 | 10 | | 6 | | Titan | | | | 10 | | 6 | | | 6 | | | Second Wind Cannon | | 6 | | | | 10 | | | 6 | | | Gaia Cross | | | | | | | 6 | | 6 | | 10 | Ultima Weapon | | | | 10 | 6 | | | | | | | 6 Chain Bioga | 10 | | | | | | | | 6 | | | 6 This chart at least tells us where the primaries are located, but we need to know the damage and to do that we need to add up everything that we plan on honing. I don't have the math to prove to you which is better than any other, but I can infer a hell of a lot and make my own choices and then relay to you the reasons why. Perhaps you will agree, and perhaps you will not. &amp;nbsp; ###My Personal Targets Ability/Hone | BLK | WHT | PWR | SUM | NON | FIR | ICE | LIT | EAR | WND | HLY | DRK :--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--: Lightning Dive R3 | | | | | | | 36 | 60 | | 36 | | Second Wind Cannon R3 | | 36 | | | | 60 | | | 36 | | | Gaia Cross R3 | | | | | | | 36 | | 36 | | 60 | **Totals** | | **36** | | | | **60** | **72** | **60** | **72** | **36** | **60** | Ooph, that's only 4 abilities and we're already looking at a steep Ice orb total and the Lightning/Holy aren't much better. But is this even all I really want to make? No, but the other abilities are highly dependent on how much relic draws go from here on out, as the Attach/Imperil statuses as well as relic elemental properties and boss vulnerabilities will weigh in heavily on the honing decisions. &amp;nbsp; ###Conditional List Ability/Hone | BLK | WHT | PWR | SUM | NON | FIR | ICE | LIT | EAR | WND | HLY | DRK :--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--: Sapphire Shot R3 | | | | | | | 60 | 36 | | | 36 | Chain Blizzaga R3 | 60 | | | | 36 | | 36 | | | | | Chain Firaga R3 | 60 | | | | 36 | 36 | | | | | | Chain Thundaga R3 | 60 | | | | | | | 36 | | 36 | | Ultima Weapon R3 | | | | 60 | 36 | | | | | | | 36 Chain Bioga R3 | 60 | | | | | | | | 36 | | | 36 **Totals** | **240** | | | **60** | **108** | **36** | **96** | **72** | **36** | **36** | **36** | **72** **Totals w/Above** | **240** | **36** | | **60** | **108** | **96** | **168** | **132** | **108** | **72** | **96** | **72** I can tell you right off the bat: that ain't happening. I don't stamina refresh with anything but stamina shards, and even if I did it'd take a king's ransom of mythril to hit those numbers. Luckily, the chances of me needing all of that at R3 is slim. Let's talk about all of it. + **Sapphire Shot(Water Element, Two single ranged attacks (1,65 each), 1,85 multiplier when equipping a ranged weapon):** There just isn't a whole lot of good sources of Water damage in the ability pool, and this happens to be a really good one. I also plan on pulling heavily on the Eiko 1 banner which has Quina's +20% Water Damage hat for a portable buff. Great water damage still makes me believe I'll be honing this even without that great relic. + **Lightning Dive(Lightning Element, Four single ranged attacks (1,13 each), air time (3,50 sec.)):** Dragoon Jump is a *great* ability. It does so much damage it runs into cap problems since it's only two hits. Lightning Dive removes that problem by hitting 4 times, and can take advantage of Attach/Imperil lightning statuses and +20% Lightning Damage relics, many of which show up on highly desirable banners I plan on pulling on(Kain 1, Larsa 1). Despite having a lower overall multiplier(4.52 vs. 4.70), Lightning Dive will generally end up doing more damage due to its element. + **Second Wind Cannon(Fire Element, Two single ranged attacks (1,50 each), restores HP to the user for 30% of his maximum HP):** It's finally Monk time. The damage on this ability comes in below 5* abilities in our current era, but the utility of the heal can't be denied, and the elemental property allows for boosting. I plan on pulling on Squall 1 for a chance at Zell's +20% Fire Damage fist weapon, which will pair up nicely with an FF10 Red Armlet(available guaranteed from Tyro's Selection Vol. 2 if we get it). *You must be noticing the trend so far. Taking advantage of elemental relics is near and dear to me.* + **Gaia Cross(Earth Element, Two single attacks (1,60 each), grants Draw Fire to the user for 25 seconds):** Earth damage is hard to buff up, but that's fine. This is an earth element spellblade for Knights. It is also a high damage ability that will replace Draw Fire on many Knights, freeing up slots to make better use of their wide variety of great utility abilities without sacrificing a turn of damage. This is a guaranteed hone for me. + **Chain Black Magic(Respective Element, Two single attacks (5,90 each)):** These undeniably useful abilities will have to be created on a strictly must-have basis due to the wide variety of mage BSBs with similar commands, Attach/Imperil relics, and synergy. I want most of these, but the otherworldly cost will make me think long and hard before honing. Luckily, like many people, I have a mad stash of Major Black Orbs from farming the Tuesdaily for so long. + **Ultima Weapon(Dark Element, Two group attacks (7,40 each), minimum damage 2500):** Currently my most likely target as my first 5* summon, but the decision to hone will heavily depend on relic pulls. The most important being Sephiroth's Gloves(Angeal 2, +20% Dark Damage Bracer) which won't come until well after we actually get the summon, so the decision to hone will be put off for quite a while. Keep in mind that Tiamat(Wind 5*) is in the batch of super recent JP abilities that I didn't list. What summon you hone should be directly linked to your team and your relic pulls, so you're able to increase its damage output over the generic Non-Elemental Bahamut. + **The Ability Dump:** **Angelsong** is extremely niche and something I wouldn't use enough to justify the hone. **Meteor Crash** is earth damage, making it hard to buff. Would only use it to hit vulnerability in the extremely rare chance that my Knight couldn't do it instead. **Titan** is earth damage. I'm going to pull on Kain 1, which gives me a shot at Rydia's Attach Earth BSB, but of course I'd just use her earth summon commands with it instead. &amp;nbsp; ***** Catch my stream at URL for bonus battles and relic draws.

214,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Orthoros (sp?) questions,9,4xner3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4xner3/orthoros_sp_questions/,2016-08-14 18:43:21,"Some questions about the Summon, Orthoros. Is it any good against Ultimates? I'm wanting a party that can solidly defeat most of the 120 difficulty fights each event so I can reliably get MC 2 lodes. What should one hone it to, if you do suggest it? The one Record Materia that sometimes triggers a Summon ability going twice, would that then give 16 attacks? How reliable would that setup be? The RM that does +20% summoning damage, is that per attack, or just on one attack? I'd potentially be using this on Rydia, who is one of the 3 characters I have that has an SSB or BSB (Fran w/Traitor's Bow and Jecht w/Sin's Fang the other two, yet I have not unlocked Jecht!), so it would probably be paired alongside some black magic (likely the vulnerability of the boss, course), but I was wondering really what the damage potential against Diff 120 (single) bosses and if it is worth crafting. Course, any other info you may have on the summon would help too! "

We finally reach the last of the major school nightmare dungeons! Starting with the next nightmare, we will cycle back through all major six schools. In addition, the 6* ability crystal granted from this fight is the first 6* skill to consider crafting! Ability details are below: Just as a reminder, here are some general notes about Nightmare Dungeons: * There are 4 boss battles of increasing difficulty, each with different realm synergy depending on which realm the boss is from. * The first 4 battles can be completed in any order. Once they are completed, the nightmare boss battle will be unlocked. For this specific battle, if any character has 5* Celerity, they will be granted Nightmare Shift synergy, which gives them the stat synergy bonus, as well as synergy for all their equipment! Therefore, it is advisable to use as many 5* Celerity characters as possible. * The Nightmare dungeon will be open for roughly 2 weeks, after which it will be closed until the next Nightmare dungeon. Whenever the Nightmare dungeon is open you can do any of the available dungeons (to include previous ones) so no need to feel pressured to complete it on the first go-around since it will return. * Nigthmare dungeon rewards include the 6* ability record required to craft it, as well as Major Orbs, Crystals, Hero Soul's, empty MC1/MC2 lodes, and a 6* accessory. * Once the nightmare battle is completed, all characters capable of 5* in the specific school will automatically achieve 6* status, regardless of whether they participated in the battle or not. In addition, future characters which have 5* in that specific school will be automatically upgraded to 6*. **ETA: 23 August** **Event ends: ~2 September** **Event format: 4 boss battles + Nightmare Battle** ****** #####Rewards Highlights * **Hall of Rites**: Soul of a Hero x1, MC1 Lode x1, MC2 Lode x1 * **Accessories:** Ice (?)

Defeat the Gargoyles without being KO'd. 2. Afflict a Gargoyle with Stop. 3. Afflict a Gargoyle with Slow. **Note(s):** * The fight starts with two (2) Gargoyles. Note that both must be killed pretty close to each other, as if one dies the other will use Stone Heart to revive it. In addition, if you take too long to kill either, one of them will cast Fusion to sacrifice itself and fully heal the other, after which the fully healed one will resurrect the other. * Take advantage of their Stop and Slow vulnerabilities to limit the amount of turns they get (and also buy more time to prevent their rezzing antics) - Stop Rumba works wonders here. Alternatively you can put them both to sleep and nuke them with a mage team. * They only use physical attacks, and tauntilate will prevent all of them except their AoE attack. ****** #####02: Cerberus (VIII) 30 STAM - Difficulty 120 Boss|HP|Absorb|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Cerberus**|201,712|Lightning|Wind|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Cerberus without being KO'd. 2. Remove Cerberus' Triple effect. 3. Afflict Cerberus with Stun. **Note(s):** * Cerberus' abilities are almost all magical except for a token physical attack, so pack heavy magic mitigation. * When Cerberus lifts its tail it will enter Triple mode, be sure to bring banishing strike/dispel to remove it. * Cerberus has access to silence/berserk/blind, so you may find esuna useful. * Note that dismissal and/or a SB that inflicts interrupt is required for the 3rd medal condition. ****** #####03: The Four Saints (VII) 40 STAM - 130 Difficulty Boss|HP|Weak|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Staniv**|81,324|None|None|Poison/Slow/Sap|All| **Shake**|69,953|None|None|Poison/Slow/Sap|All| **Chekhov**|63,101|None|None|Poison/Slow/Sap|All| **Gorkii**|81,324|Wind|Earth|Poison/Slow/Sap|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat the Four Saints without being KO'd. 2. Afflict Gorkii with Slow. 3. Afflict Shake with Slow. **Note(s):** * Staniv is the guy with the ball &amp; chain, Shake is the small penguin, Chekhov is the skinny &amp; long monster, and Gorkii is the gargoyle. * All of the damage here is physical or gravity and mostly all can be tauntilated except for Staniv's AoE attack and Chekhov's paralyze attack, so they should be your first two targets. * AoE is definitely the way to go here and will end this fight very quickly. * Note that you need to inflict slow on two different bosses - anyone with an Auto-hit slow SB should definitely bring that character. ****** #####04: Mandragoras (XII) 50 STAM - 140 Difficulty Boss|HP|Weak|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Mandragora Prince**|78,498|Fire|Slow/Blind|All| **Alraune King**|78,498|Wind|Stop|All| **Onion Queen**|78,498|Earth|Silence/Confuse|All| **Topstalk**|78,498|Water|Blind/Sap|All| **Pumpkin Star**|78,498|Ice|Slow/Sleep|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat the Mandragoras without being KOd. 2. Afflict the Mandragora Prince with Slow. 3. Afflict the Alraune King with Stop. **Note(s):** * The Prince is light purple, the King is blue/dark purple, the Queen is yellow/brown, Topstalk has a tomato for a head, and the Pumpkin star has a (surprise!) pumpkin for a head. In addition, they all start the battle with Haste. * All of their damaging attacks are physical, and quite a few can be tauntilated. However, this fight can be very annoying just due to the amount of status effects they have (to include AoE Sleep, Poison, Slow, Blind, and Silence). * The Prince, King, and Queen can use Pollen (AoE Sleep/Poison/Slow), while Topstalk and the Pumpkin can use either AoE Blind or Silence, so prioritize accordingly. * Since their HP is low, best method is to bring out the heavy hitting AoE's and take them out as quickly as possible. Don't forget about the medal conditions. ****** ****** ####**[NIGHTMARE BATTLE - CELERITY]** ****** ****** ###Tonberry King 1 STAM - ??? Difficulty Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Tonberry - Phase 1**|65,898|Paralyze/Slow/Stop/Stun|**NULL**| **Tonberries - Phase 2**|65,898|Slow/Stop/Stun|**NULL**| **Tonberry King - Phase 3**|161,228|Stun|**NULL**| **Target Score(s):** 1. Afflict a Tonberry with Slow. 2. Afflict a Tonberry with Stun. 3. Afflict a Tonberry with Stop. **Note(s) / Strategy:** * This fight is split into three distinct phases, which will be covered in detail below. * Note that the medal conditions only apply to the Tonberries in Phase 1 &amp; 2 and not to the Tonberry King, so make sure you land all three earlier in the fight. * All mobs in this fight only have physical abilities, so leave Shellga at home. However, all abilities ignore retaliate and draw fire so don't bother bringing those abilities. In addition, all the attacks that the small Tonberries have ignore defense, but don't neglect Protectga since the Tonberry King has an AoE ranged move that Protectga will help with. * Tonberry &amp; Tonberry King have almost ~10K resistance, so stick to physical attacks here. #####Phase 1 * This phase is fairly straightforward. A single Tonberry is spawned and with every turn he will take one step towards you and use Knife, which deals more damage the closer he gets to you. If he gets to your party before you kill him he will use Stabbing Frenzy (4 hit physical defense-ignoring attack). Unlike other nightmare fights, this does not mean instant death and you can recover from it. * Note that all mobs in this fight have only 5 mind, so stop will last a long time. He can also be paralyzed, but none of the other tonberries in the other phases can, so not worth bringing intimidate for that single purpose. * After you kill the lone Tonberry Phase 2 will start. #####Phase 2 * Upon the start of Phase 2 a 3x3 grid will appear where each row will have a red, white, and blue circle, and three Tonberries will spawn, each at the leftmost circle of each row. Each color corresponds to a different status: Color|Status| :--:|:--:| Red|Stop| White|Slow| Blue|Stun| * Here is an [[image]](URL of how Phase 2 starts. * When a Tonberry is standing on a circle, the hit rate of successfully landing a status vulnerability is doubled. * You should plan to have a Halting Rumba cast to go off right at the beginning of stage 2 since all three spawn on a red circle, making it a 100% chance to land. * The first wave should be very straightforward, and can actually be killed if kept permanently stopped without moving. * After they spawn, if all three Tonberries ever line up, they will cast Nightmare Chef's Knife, which cannot be mitigated in any way (not instant-death, but will cause serious problems). **DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN.** * After all three are killed, a new 3x3 grid is generated (Top Row is White-Blue-Red, Middle Row is Empty-White-Empty, and Bottom Row is Empty-White-Blue) and the Tonberries don't all start at the left (Top one spawns on Blue circle, while the middle and bottom one spawn in between the left-most empty circle and the white circle. * Here is an [[image]](URL of how the 2nd wave is spawned. * Even though you are not guaranteed to inflict stop, definitely would queue up a Halting Rumba since it still has a 70% chance to land. You need to be absolutely sure that the three Tonberries do not line up at any point or else you will be hit with Nightmare Chef's Knife. * ~~Be very cautious of who kills which Tonberry. **DO NOT ALLOW ONE PERSON TO KILL A MAJORITY OF THEM.** You will find out why in Phase 3.~~ ~~Apparently it is based on whether you inflict the proper status or not - see [[here]](URL h/t /u/SkyFireX~~. Thanks to /u/TFMurphy, you want to minimize the amount of steps Tonberries take in Phase 1 and 2, as the more steps they take, the stronger Ome of King Tonberry'a attacks will be (see phase 3). * After you kill the 2nd wave of Tonberries, Phase 3 will start. #####Phase 3 * Phase 3 starts with Tonberry King spawning. This portion of the fight is more or less a DPS fight to bring him down before you are overwhelmed. He only has two attacks - 60% chance to use ""It's Sharp!"" and a 40% chance to use Junk, which is a ranged AoE physical attack). The formula for damage for It's Sharp is 1111 + 1111*(n/5), where n is the total number of steps Tonberries took in Phase 1 &amp; 2. * Other than the It's Sharp! gimmick, just use whatever abilities/soul breaks you have left and take him out. Note that he is vulnerable to interrupt.

Defeat Galvanth the Dominator without being KOd. **Note(s):** * Galvanth at certain %HP will summon 1 imp, and then at a lower % HP, will summon 2 imps. He becomes immune to all damage when the imps are alive. However, you can 1shot him with an RW, so it is a non-issue. ****** #####05: Copperbell Mines (31 STAM: 10/10/11) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--| **Gyges the Great**|~19,700|Poison/Silence| **Stone Servant**|???|All **except** Confuse/Berserk| **Target Score(s):** 1.

Defeat Lady Amandine without being KOd. **Note(s):** * As Lady Amandine is damaged, she will summon more and more adds. In addition, she has access to Dark Mist, which deals dark magic damage and has a chance to stun all targets. * Note that Lady Amandine will do a chant before using her elemental spells, and the targeted character will be marked with crosshairs. If the character who she is targeting is defending when she is casting the spell, the spell will be nulled and you will not take any damage. * Servitor's Latern has a strong AoE magic attack, so it may be useful to keep it magic broken. * The 2nd add to appear, Lady's Candle, are bombs that self-destruct, which will cause some serious hurt depending on their HP. ****** ###Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak + 40 STAM (20/20) **Target Score Summary**: Slow **Can lose a max of 5 medals to master** Round 1|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Coeurl O' Nine Tails**|~79,100|Slow|All| **Warden's Whips**|???|Slow/Sleep|None| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Coeurl O'Nine Tails without being KOd. 2. Afflict Coeurl O'Nine Tails with slow. **Note(s):** * Same as the previous fight but with higher stats. Just apply slow and focus Coeurl down quickly. * Tauntilate works ok, but the boss and adds have access to AoE physical attacks, so bring proper physical mitigation. Round 2|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Graffias**|~84,000|Slow|All| **Comesmite**|???|Slow/Sleep|None| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Graffias without being KOd. 2. Afflict Graffias with slow. **Note(s):** * Just slow Graffias and focus fire him. Like before, tauntilate completely negates all attacks except for his AoE Realmshaker, so just be sure to apply physical mitigation/breaks. ****** ###Haukke Manor ++ 20 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Lady Amandine**|~140,800|Slow|All| **Servitor's Latern**|???|Slow|All| **Lady's Candle**|???|Slow|All| **Manor Sentry**|???|Slow|All| **Manor Maidservant**|???|Slow|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Lady Amandine without being KOd. 2. Reduce Lady Amandine's magic. 3. Afflict Lady Amandine with slow. **Note(s):** * Same fight as before, make sure to exploit Lady Amandine's vulnerability to slow early to minimize her damage. * If the Lady's Candles (two of them spawn) self-destruct at full HP, you can say goodbye to 1-2 people, so may be useful to bring some AoE to bring their HP down unless you can burn Lady Amandine down very quickly. * Don't forget that defending when someone is targeted to be hit by Lady Amandine's spell will cause it to fail. ******* ###The Navel +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Titan**|~194,000|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Titan without being KOd. 2. Reduce Titan's magic. 3. Destroy Titan's Core/Heart within 5 turns. **Note(s):** * While Titan does have access to some single target physical attacks, most of his dangerous attacks are magic-based, so bring proper mitigation (and earth resistance if you have it). * Titan will transition to Phase 2 at around 66%, and Phase 3 around 33%. For the purposes of the 3rd medal condition, you need to complete Phase 2 within 5 turns, and the timer will start when he uses Geocrush, causing Titan's Heart to become visible. * Make sure to bring a hastega to ensure you get through the phase in time. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ###Lord of the Inferno (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Ifrit**|~205,000|None|All| **Infernal Nail**|~20,000|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce Ifrit's magic. 2. Reduce Ifrit's defense. 3. Defeat Infernal Nail within 3 turns of its appearance. **Note(s):** * Ifrit will summon the Infernal Nail at ~50% HP. Note that you only have 3 turns to kill the nail - if you do not, Ifrit's Hellfire attack will become much stronger, you will lose the medal criteria, and for the rest of the battle Ifrit's attacks will be stronger. * Ifrit has mixed attacks (though favors magic ones), so bring proper mitigation. He also has an AoE attack with a chance to stun. ****** ###The Navel (Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Titan**|~258,800|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce Titan's defense. 2. Reduce Titan's magic. 3. Destroy Titan's Core/Heart within 5 turns. **Note(s):** * The exact same fight as the +++ except with higher stats. Just be sure to bring a boostga/hastega to ensure you meet the criteria to complete Phase 2 in 5 turns. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!"

Starting with this event, certain characters will begin receiving Record Sphere access; I have added a new section to highlight those, I welcome any feedback. **ETA: 5 July** **Event ends: 15 July** **Event format: Classic/Elite** **All enemies in this event vulnerable to interrupt effects except the U+.** ****** #####Rewards Highlights * **Characters:** Cloud, Aeris, Cait Sith, Cid, Sephiroth * **MC1:** Cloud, Aeris, Cait Sith, Cid, Sephiroth * **MC2:** Barret, Cait Sith, Cid * **HoR:** 1x Hero Soul, 1x MC1 Lode, 1x MC2 Lode * **Abilities:** None * **Wardrobe Records:** Shirtless Sephiroth **Greater**|P|W|B|S|NE|F|I|L|E|Wi|H|D| :--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| \#|10|-|10|-|-|10|-|10|-|-|-|-| **Major**|**P**|**W**|**B**|**S**|**NE**|**F**|**I**|**L**|**E**|**Wi**|**H**|**D**| \#|-|-|4|8|4|-|-|-|-|3|-|7| **Crystal**|**P**|**W**|**B**|**S**|**NE**|**F**|**I**|**L**|**E**|**Wi**|**H**|**D**| \#|-|-|-|1|-|-|-|-|-|-|1|-| ****** ###Record Sphere Additions **Cloud** Record Sphere|S.Lv 1|S.Lv 2|S.Lv 3|S.Lv 4|S.Lv 5| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| Red Mage|+1ATK|+1DEF|+1RES|+60HP|+2ATK| Warrior|+1ATK|+70HP|+1DEF|+1ATK|+2ATK| Knight|+1DEF|+1ATK|+100HP|+1DEF|+2DEF| Spellblade (Red Mage/Warrior)|+3ATK|+170HP|+5ATK|+6% Spellblade Ability Damage|**Use 5* Spellblade Abilities**| Samurai (Warrior)|+3ATK|+4ATK|+170HP|+6ATK|Minor Paralyze Resist| Paladin (Knight)|+3DEF|+3ATK|+5ATK|+250HP|**Use 3* Knight Abilities**| * **Total Stats:** +820 HP, +37 ATK, +9 DEF, +1 RES * **Total Passive:** +6% Spellblade Ability Damage, Use of 5* Spellblade and 3* Knight Abilities, Minor Paralyze Resist * **Total Motes Needed:** 3* Vit|3* Wis|3* Spi|3* Dex|3* Brv|4* Vit|4* Wis|4* Spi|4* Dex|4* Brv|Total| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| 90|30|30|0|75|75|30|15|60|45|**450** **Sephiroth** Record Sphere|S.Lv 1|S.Lv 2|S.Lv 3|S.Lv 4|S.Lv 5| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| Warrior|+1ATK|+70HP|+1DEF|+1ATK|+2ATK| Knight|+1DEF|+1ATK|+100HP|+1DEF|+2DEF| Red Mage|+1ATK|+1DEF|+1RES|+60HP|+2ATK| Samurai (Warrior)|+3ATK|+170HP|+5ATK|+6ATK|+6% Samurai Ability Damage| Dark Knight (Warrior/Knight)|+2ATK|+2ATK|+220HP|+5ATK|+6DEF| Warmage (Knight/Red Mage)|+3ATK|+180HP|+6ATK|+6% Darkness Ability Damage|Minor Blind Resist| * **Total Stats:** +800 HP, +40 ATK, +12 DEF, +1 RES * **Total Passive:** +6% Samurai Ability Damage, +6% Darkness Ability Damage, Minor Blind Resist * **Total Motes Needed:** 3* Vit|3* Wis|3* Spi|3* Dex|3* Brv|4* Vit|4* Wis|4* Spi|4* Dex|4* Brv|Total| :--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| 90|30|30|0|75|90|30|0|90|15|**450** ****** ###STATS BELOW ARE FOR ELITE DIFFICULTY ****** #####01: Shinra Building (36 STAM: 12/12/12) **NO BOSS** ****** #####02: Shinra Cargo Ship (40 STAM: 13/13/14) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--| **Jenova BIRTH**|~71,800|Slow| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Jenova BIRTH without being KOd. **Note(s):** * Jenova BIRTH acts twice per turn. * All of Jenova BIRTH's attacks are physical except for her single target gas attack. Note that she is vulnerable to slow. ****** #####03: Shinra Mansion (46 STAM: 15/15/16) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--| **Lost Number**|~101,900|Poison/Paralyze/Slow/Stop/Blind/Sleep/Sap| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Lost Number without being KOd. **Note(s):** * When Lost Number reaches 50% HP, it will change to either its magical or physical type depending on the type of attack that brought it below 50%HP. Its physical side will exclusively use physical attacks, but has higher DEF, while the converse is true for its magic side. * Lost Number is vulnerable to both Paralyze &amp; Sleep - pick which one you prefer and lock him out completely. ****** #####04: Forgotten Capital (52 STAM: 17/17/18) Boss|HP|Weak|Absorb|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Jenova LIFE**|???|Earth|Water|Poison/Stop/Sleep| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Jenova LIFE without being KOd. **Note(s):** * Jenova LIFE will act twice per turn. * Jenova LIFE's only physical attack can be draw fired, but she has access to both ST and AoE magic attack, so bring proper mitigation. * Mage parties can sleep her and have a field day, but note that she does cast Reflect, so bringing a way to dispel will be useful. ****** #####05: Whirlwind Maze (58 STAM: 19/19/20) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--| **Jenova DEATH**|158,206|Poison/Stop/Sleep| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Jenova DEATH without being KOd. **Note(s):** * Jenova DEATH acts twice per turn (notice a pattern yet?). * Like Jenova LIFE, Jenova Death's physical attack can be draw fired, but she does have an AoE fire attack (Tropic Wind). In addition, she can also silence your party members. * As before, sleep + mage party trivializes this fight. ****** ###Midgar Highway + 40 STAM (20/20) **Target Score Summary**: Reduce ATK **Can lose a max of 5 medals to master** Round 1|HP|Weak|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Yazoo**|133,729|None|Poison/Silence/Slow|All| **Shadow Creeper**|33,729|Fire|Poison/Silence/Slow|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Yazoo without being KOd. 2. Reduce Yazoo's attack. **Note(s):** * While Tauntilate will nullify all of the shadow creepers attacks and Yazoo's basic attack, his other two physical attacks ignore retaliate, and he has an AoE physical attack as well, so pack proper physical mitigation (no magic attacks in this fight). * Note that all mobs are vulnerable to slow. Round 2|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Loz**|133,729|Poison/Slow|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Loz without being KOd. 2. Reduce Loz's attack. **Note(s):** * Loz's more dangerous attacks are magic based, and he can inflict paralyze. He also has an AoE magic attack. * Loz has a random chance after his turn to enter ""Fast"" mode, increasing his speed. ****** ###Shinra Building ++ 20 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Kadaj**|211,867|Poison/Slow|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Kadaj without being KOd. 2. Reduce Kadaj's attack. 3. Afflict Kadaj with slow. **Note(s):** * Kadaj has access to both single target physical and magic attacks, and has an AoE physical attack. Pack proper mitigation. * Pretty straightforward fight, just be sure to exploit his slow vulnerability early on to reduce damage. ******* ###Shinra Building +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Reunion Sephiroth**|225,181|Slow|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Sephiroth without being KO'ed. 2. Reduce Sephiroth's attack. 3. Afflict Sephiroth with slow. **Note(s):** * All of Sephiroth's abilities are 100% physical based, so structure your party accordingly. * When Sephiroth reaches ~67% HP, he will enter Weak mode and use Building Drop as an interrupt (AoE physical move); may be useful to have a medica ready to go to recover. * While Tauntilate will only work on his basic attacks (most of his attacks ignore retaliate), it will cause his counter to physical attacks (Scintilla) to miss - while you won't deal any damage to him, it will prevent him from hasting himself, which will be one less thing to worry about. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ###Shinra Building (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Reno**|117,800|Thunder|Poison|All| **Rude**|137,631|Fire|Poison|All| **Elena**|107,969|Ice|Poison|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce Reno's magic. 2. Reduce Rude's defense. 3. Reduce Elena's attack. **Note(s):** * Unlike previous fights with the Turks, **you must kill all three to win the fight.** * Elena will always start the fight with explosion as an interrupt that will deal ~2K damage to the party, so no H&amp;R tactics here. * Once you get mitigation up, the fight is fairly straightforward. Multi-Break is a great skill to bring and will fulfill all medal conditions in one shot. * Since Elena has a confuse attack (Temptation: 63% chance to confuse one target), it is advised to take her out first. * **CID MISSION: Complete the Shinra Building (Ultimate) dungeon with a party of FF VII heroes!** Probably best to bring Cait Sith (Dance 5)/Yuffie (Dance 4) as your debuffers to get mitigation out quickly, and then take out Elena first while using as many AoE abilities as possible. If you don't have Aeris' medica, bringing the candle rod or another shared medica will be useful to heal up from the initial damage. ****** ###Forgotten Capital (Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Sephiroth**|286,464|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce Sephiroth's attack. 2. Reduce Sephiroth's magic. 3. Reduce Sephiroth's defense. **Note(s):** * This fight is an upgraded version of the +++, and Sephiroth has learned some new tricks. * Once he reaches his Very Weak Phase, he will start using Meteor, so don't neglect your magic mitigation. * He still has his Scintilla counter (Deal damage and self-haste, but this time it is against all attacks). Tauntilate will still prevent the haste - however, his speed starts off at 600, and goes up to 650 later in the fight, so even preventing it is of questionable value and not worth the loss of DPS since most of his attacks ignore retaliate and the counter doesn't deal that much damage. * His Flashing Blade attack ignores defense, so make sure to stack as many debuffs on him as possible. * **CID MISSION: Complete the Forgotten Capital (Ultimate+) dungeon with a party of FF VII heroes!** Even if you wanted to, Tauntilate isn't an option here since there is no way to upgrade Cloud to Knight 3* via Record Sphere so soon. Bring either Red 13 or Barret for your support role, and build your party (physical or magic-based) based on the gear you have. Don't forget to utilize your shared medicas to heal through the damage! ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

In addition, coinciding with this event we will start getting monthly Mote dungeons to earn 4* motes! The first one is FF8-realm based against the very first boss in the game (Ifrit), but as I am sure most members of the sub know, he is extremely dangerous and powerful. The good news is that similar to nightmare dungeons, mote dungeons return every month, so eventually you will get enough relics/abilities to be able to defeat him.

Defeat Mobile Type 8 without being KOd. **Note(s):** * Tauntilate will stop all his physical attacks, just need to worry about killing Mobile Type 8 before he uses Corona and Megiddo Flame. * Just bring lightning abilities and blow him up. ****** #####04: Knight's Tenacity (55 STAM: 18/18/19) Boss|HP|Weak|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Seifer**|123,556|Bio|None|Power/Armor| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Seifer without being KOd. **Note(s):** * Seifer is vulnerable to sleep like in previous encounters - bring both magic and physical mitigation, as he has AoE attacks for both. * Summoning Odin against him will result in a nice surprise ;) ****** #####05: Sorceress' Awakening (58 STAM: 19/19/20) Boss|HP|Weak|Null|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Adel**|158,206|Wind|Holy|None| **Rinoa**|50,864|None|None|None| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Adel without being KOd. **Note(s):** * If at any point Rinoa dies during this fight, Adel will immediately shift to her Strong State and cast Ultima non-stop. In addition, Adel will cast Drain on Rinoa to restore her HP and damage Rinoa. * Avoid AoE abilities/SB's for this fight and just target Adel. All of her dangerous attacks are magic-based (she has a couple of physical abilities), so pack proper mitigation. * Don't forget to heal Rinoa throughout the fight if required. ~~You can also cast Reflect on Rinoa and she will be immune to drain and unable to die unless you kill her.~~ The Drain Adel uses is NAT, so reflect won't work. ****** ###Secrets of Centra Ruins+ 40 STAM (20/20) **Target Score Summary**: Reduce ATK **Can lose a max of 5 medals to master** Round 1|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Tonberry King**|~98,400|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Tonberry King without being KOd. 2. Reduce Tonberry King's attack. **Note(s):** * All of King Tonberry's dangerous attacks ignore draw fire/retaliate. All of his attacks are physical, so just bring Full Break + Power Breakdown + Protectga for mitigation, and burn him down the old fashioned way. Round 2|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Odin**|~102,800|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Odin without being KOd. 2. Reduce Odin's attack. **Note(s):** * Similar strategy to Tonberry King, Odin is 100% physical, just mitigate and burn him down. * On Odin's 10th turn, he will use Zantetsuken. ****** ###Cerberus ++ 20 STAM Boss|HP|Absorb|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Cerberus**|175,625|Lightning|Wind|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Cerberus without being KOd. 2. Reduce Cerberus' magic. 3. Reduce Cerberus' resistance. **Note(s):** * Except for a token physical attack all of Cerberus' attacks are magic-based, so bring maximum magic mitigation. * Dispel or banishing strike is recommended for when Cerberus casts Triple (he will raise his tail when the buff activates). When he has this buff, he will attack 3 times per turn. * Other than that, note that he absorbs lightning and nulls wind, so be careful when choosing abilities and soul breaks. ******* ###Vision to Sleep in Stagnation +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Ultima Weapon**|201,712|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Ultima Weapon without being KO'ed. 2. Reduce Ultima Weapon's magic. 3. Reduce Ultima Weapon's attack. **Note(s):** * Ultima weapon has both magical and physical attacks, though his more dangerous ones are magic-based, so prepare accordingly. Ultima Weapon does hit pretty hard for a +++, so don't come unprepared. * No weaknesses to exploit, so just burn him down with abilities/soul breaks. * After a certain number of turns, he will use Light Pillar, which will hit someone for 9999 damage. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ###Adrift for Eternity (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Propagator**|67,379|Ice|Slow/Blind|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Afflict one of the Propagator's with slow. 2. Afflict one of the Propagator's with blind. 3. Exploit Propagator's weakness to ice attacks. **Note(s):** * The fight begins with two (2) Propagators. As soon as one Propagator dies, another will spawn immediately. You must kill a total of five (5) Propagators to win the fight. * While the Propagator's do have access to physical and magic attacks, their magic attacks are the greater concern. They have access to both single target and AoE thunder attacks, so bring proper mitigation (to include lightning resistance accessories!). * Propagators have a small chance (10%) to cast blind, so make sure you either have a way to cure it, bring abilities with 100% hit rate, or hope that it doesn't land (their blind has a 36% chance success rate). * Note that although each individual one doesn't have a lot of HP, you'll need to do ~337,000 worth of damage throughout the fight. * **CID MISSION: Complete the Adrift for Eternity (Ultimate) dungeon with a party of FF VIII heroes!** No dancer in FF VIII (Selphie needs a buff...) means you'll need to individually debuff them with Irvine. Keeping him on standby and using magic breakdown as soon as a Propagator spawn will help to make sure you don't get gibbed by an unmitigated thunder attack; Seifer is also a good choice to magic lure the single target lightning attacks. Since it is a pretty long battle, probably best to make a physical or magical team and bring the proper RW (Shout or Hastemarch). ****** ###Lord of the Guardians (Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Null|Resist|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Bahamut**|319,157|Lightning/Earth/Wind|Poison|Slow/Blind|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Afflict Bahamut with Slow. 2. Reduce Bahamut's magic. 3. Reduce Bahamut's resistance. **Note(s):** * Bahamut is **really fast** - he has 650 speed the entire fight. Definitely exploit that slow vulnerability for medal conditions, but it will only reduce his wait time from 1/6s to 1/3s, so it is of questionable value to keep it up. (h/t /u/Scytherman96) * Bahamut does like to cast Stop a lot, but his mind is pretty low (50-100 depending on the phase), so it won't last extremely long, even on your physical characters. * Except for a token physical attack, all of Bahamut's attacks are magic-based, so bring full magic mitigation. His most dangerous attacks are Tornado (AoE magic wind attack), and megaflare (ignores RES), so bring Full Break and Magic Breakdown at a minimum. * Magic Lure is a good choice, as that will redirect all stops and his single target thunder attack, giving you some additional breathing room. * **CID MISSION: Complete the Lord of the Guardians (Ultimate+) dungeon with a party of FF VIII heroes!** Again, Irvine is mandatory here to use FB + MBD in order to survive megaflare. Form the rest of your team based on what relics you have, and bring the proper Boostga. Remember that Megaflare ignores RES, so Wall will only help with Tornado/Thundaga. As with the Ultimate, Seifer and Magic Lure will help here as well. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!

In addition, as opposed to previous events, there is only 1 banner for this event. /u/Sandslice will have the details as always. **ETA: 30 May** **Event ends: 9 June** **Event format: Classic &amp; Elite** **All enemies in this event vulnerable to interrupt effects.** ****** #####Rewards Highlights * **Characters:** Aeris, Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, Cait Sith * **MC1:** Aeris, Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, Cloud, Cait Sith * **MC2:** Yuffie * **HoR:** Hero Soul x1, MC1 x1, MC2 x1 * **Abilities:** None * **Accessories:** Blonde Wig (+10 ATK &amp; Sleep Resist), Cat's Bell (500HP + 15 Mind) **Greater**|P|W|B|S|NE|F|I|L|E|Wi|H|D| :--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| \#|-|10|-|-|-|5|5|-|-|10|10|5| **Major**|**P**|**W**|**B**|**S**|**NE**|**F**|**I**|**L**|**E**|**Wi**|**H**|**D**| \#|3|7|-|-|-|-|-|3|-|-|6|6| **Crystal**|**P**|**W**|**B**|**S**|**NE**|**F**|**I**|**L**|**E**|**Wi**|**H**|**D**| \#|-|-|1|-|1|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| ****** ****** Below stats are for **ELITE** difficulty. ****** ****** #####01: Church in the Slums (34 STAM: 11/11/12) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Hell House**|~43,100|Poison/Slow/Blind/Sleep/Sap| **Target Score(s):** 1.

Defeat The Four Saints without being KO'ed. 2. Afflict any one of them with Slow. **Note(s):** * Gorkii is the flying gargoyle-looking mob, Shake is the small animal, Chekov is the skinny one with 4 arms, and Staniv wields a ball and chain. * Staniv hits very hard, and Chekov can wreck havoc on your party with Glare, so you should focus on them first. * Quetzalcoatl is great here since they are all vulnerable to paralyze, as well as AoE. * Don't forget to slow one for the medal condition! Round 2|HP|Status Vuln. :--|:--:|:--| **Godo**|118,655|Poison/Slow/Sap| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Godo without being KO'ed. 2. Afflict Godo with Slow. **Note(s):** * Godo will change his face after every turn. 1) Red is the most dangerous, with access to both Beast Sword and Trine (both of which are AoE). 2) Gold has access to sleep, and will counter attacks with Cura. 3) White has access to Gravija, Biora, and Drain, but all are single target. * Red is the most dangerous color here, so be sure to get proper mitigation up quickly. ****** ###Abandoned Town ++ 20 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Rude**|~125,900|Poison/Slow/Blind|All| **MP**|~40,800|Poison/Silence/Paralyze/Confuse/Slow/Stop/Blind/Sleep|None| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Rude without being KOd. 2. Reduce Rude's defense. 3. Afflict Rude with Slow. **Note(s):** * The fight begins with Rude and two (2) MP's. It is recommended to take the MP's out with AoE and/or keep them controlled with paralyze/sleep. The MP's have access to a blind/sleep move which can be annoying. * Rude can be blinded, but most of his damage is magic-based, so bring proper mitigation. ******* ###Cetra's Memory +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Resist|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Demon's Gate**|201,712|Earth|Poison|Slow/Sap|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Demon's Gate without being KO'ed. 2. Reduce Demon's Gate's attack. 3. Defeat Demon's Gate before it uses Petrif-eye. **Note(s):** * At 75%, 50%, and 25%, Demon's Gate will cast Crush, which will deal heavy physical damage to the party. Make sure that your party is relatively healed before bringing him below the HP threshold. * After a certain number of turns *(need AI datamining)* Demon's Gate will be able to use Petrif-eye. Don't forget to exploit his vulnerability to slow. * While most of Demon's Gate's moves are physical, Cave-in is magical, so don't neglect magic mitigation. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ###Deep Sea Distress (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Carry Armor - Body**|206,316|Lightning^(see notes)|Poison|None|All| **Carry Armor - Arms**|82,256|None|Poison|None|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Carry Armor's body last. 2. Reduce Carry Armor body's magic. 3. Exploit the body's weakness to lightning attacks. **Note(s):** * There is a lot of magic damage from the Carry Armor's body Lapis Laser, which is its only move. You need to mitigate it immediately, though while inflicting it with a breakdown, you will most likely trigger the arms' catch ability, and with his hefty HP it will take a bit to release the trapped party member. * The only physical attacks here are single target from the arms. * Balance doing AoE attacks versus single target, depending on if your party can handle 2 people being incapacitated. * Once the arms are defeated, the body will become weak to lightning attacks - exploit this to end the fight quickly. ****** ###Battle Arena (Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Ying**|80,297|Interrupt|All| **Yang**|80,297|Interrupt|All| **Maximum Kimaira**|108,828|Interrupt|All| **Proud Clod**|150,329|Interrupt|All| **Jamar Armor**|64,014|Interrupt|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce one of the Ying/Yang's magic. 2. Reduce Maximum Kimaira's attack. 3. Reduce Proud Clod's attack. **Note(s):** * The fight starts with both Ying and Yang. Once they are defeated, Maximum Kimaria will immediately spawn, and after he is killed, Proud Clod and Jamar Armor will immediately spawn. * This is a pretty long fight that will test how well you have your abilities honed. All 3 bouts have access to both physical and magical attacks, so don't skimp out on any mitigation. #####Ying &amp; Yang * They both have access to AoE physical and magic attacks, so be sure to get mitigation up quickly. * Besides that, not much else to them, try to get them down as quickly as possible. #####Maximum Kimaira * While Maximum Kimaria has access to an AoE physical attack, his magical Freeze attack can OHKO a character if your mitigation is down. Try to have your support user ready to use magic BD as soon as Ying &amp; Yang are defeated. #####Proud Clod/Jamar Armor * While most of Proud Clod's moveset is physical, his Beam Cannon is magical, so keep that in mind. * Jamar Armor will cast reflect on your characters - once he is defeated, he will dispel the reflect. However, unlike previous times, Proud Clod does **not** become vulnerable to lightning after Jamar Armor is defeated. However, Prod Clod's def/res are higher when Jamar Armor is still alive, so you'll have to decide whether to kill the Jamar Armor first or ignore it and try to burst down Proud Clod. * Utilize whatever abilities/Soul Breaks you have left to bring them down! ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!"

221,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Newbie Retaliate Team Guide,34,4na6ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4na6ur/newbie_retaliate_team_guide/,2016-06-09 20:23:13,"Retaliate Teams have low gear/ability requirements and use the same gear/abilities a more powerful and difficult to make Shout Team does. This makes Retaliate ideal for a new player starting to look at difficulty 90+ and Bonus Battles. Nobody is talking about Retaliate anymore since most older/expert players have moved onto Shout teams now, so I decide to make this guide to help a few guys I know who have joined the game recently and are struggling to clear events. A Retaliate team uses: &gt;Samurai &gt;White Mage #1 &gt;White Mage #2 &gt;Support &gt;Flexible Slot You can choose any one from the lists below to start with but understand that eventually you'll have EVERY good character leveled up so you have the choice for different bosses with different tactics. **Samurai** The Samurai uses Retaliate once every other turn, this blocks all physical attacks on the Samurai and gives it a counter attack. You give the Samurai your best gear and buffs then hit it with your own weak units to turn every attack into a powerful one, even a White Mage's staff hit is going to bounce off your Samurai for massive damage. *Samurai Toookit:* &gt;Cloud: Retaliate/Tempo Flurry - Slows the boss, a common status vulnerability and target score. &gt;Cloud: Retaliate/Any Spellblade - Deals usually 9999 damage and hits a target score. &gt;Cloud: Retaliate/Any AoE Combat - Deals high damage to all enemies. &gt;Gilgamesh: Retaliate/Draw Fire - Makes most enemy physical attacks hit Gilgamesh, blocking the attack and causing a counter attack. Some bosses hit many times and this counters them. &gt;Gilgamesh: Retaliate/Mirror of Equity - Gives a 30% attack boost though Gilgamesh's SB can cast a smaller boost. Gilgamesh can also equip any melee weapon, raising the probability that you have synergy gear for him. &gt;Gilgamesh: Retaliate/Any AoE Samurai/Dragoon/Combat - Deals high damage to all enemies. &gt;Tyro: Retaliate/Any of the above - Tyro can equip any weapon, specifically ranged weapons allowing the use of Retaliate and the above strategies against flying enemies. Use full Attack gear and Dragoon's Determination (Richard RM1) for +20% Attack to start off with. Look out for threads discussing the Attack cap through. With synergy or a good soul break you may also use: Sephiroth/Cyan/Auron/Basch. Check their ability/gear choices to see which of the above ability/gear combos they can use. **White Mage #1** Your main healer, almost every boss requires a healer and all require at least one of Protect or Shell. *White Mage Healer Toolkit:* &gt;Lenna: Curaja/Shellga - Buff Shell then spam heals. You'll start off using Curaga until you can craft Curaja, make Curaja last since Shellga/Protega are more important. Lenna's SB casts Regen on everyone. &gt;Aerith: Kirin/Carbuncle - Carbuncle can be used on a very few specific bosses to reflect all of their magic attacks, however this stops you from healing yourself so Kirin casts Regen through Reflect to help. Usually you want to gear fully for Mind but it doesn't have a huge effect on heals so you can go for Defense or Resistance instead. Double Hit (Josef RM2) turns attack into a weaker double attack, bounce it off your Samurai for big damage on turns you don't need to heal or buff. With synergy you can use literally any magic focused White Mage here, I just listed the two with better SBs. **White Mage #2** You very often need to cast Protect and Shell in the same battle, you'll need a second White Mage to do this but you want one with other abilities they can bring to the fight since you never need two healers. *White Mage Support Toolkit:* &gt;Cecil (Paladin): Double Cut/Protega - Buff Protect then bounce two attacks a turn off your Samurai. Put Cecil on the back row and gear for Defense/Resistance. &gt;Aerith: Dispel/Protega - If the boss uses Haste or Protect you'll need to use Dispel to get rid of it. &gt;Agrias: Any Spellblade/Protega - Not bouncing attacks off your Samurai defeats the whole point of the Retaliate team but if you have elemental target scores then this is one way to meet them, especially if you have a second good weapon. &gt;Hope: Any spell/Protega - Again using magic damage is defeating the point of a Retaliate team, however you can meet elemental or status target scores this way too, carry a good AoE if you have good gear for a Black Mage or even use Diaga for holy damage if you have good gear for two White Mages. Auto Haste RMs (Locke/Balthier/Paladin Cecil)can be good here if you don't have a Hastega SB. With synergy or a good soul break several characters share these roles. Selphie/Beatrix/Warrior of Light can all attack twice and Vanille/Tellah/Fusoya/ExDeath/Kuja can use Black Magic. **Support** This character breaks the enemy's defense so the Samurai does more damage, often it'll be directly attacking itself to do this so a second set of good gear helps but isn't needed. *Support Toolkit:* &gt;Ramza: Full Break/Armor Breakdown - Cast Full Break then Armor Breakdown then bounce an attack off your Samurai, then repeat. If you have the hones and gear you can just cast Armor Breakdown twice. There may be a short window where Full Break wears off if you cast it every 3rd turn. You can use Boost if you don't have Full Break yet. Supports generally suck until you get one of their SB items, then become much better than characters who just do damage. These items can be game changing and do things like give you a third stacking break ability or cast Protega/Shellga without needing a second White Mage or Hastega (double speed) or Boostga (double damage) or Wall (half damage taken). Use whoever you have one of these items for. Use an Auto Haste RM then an SB Gauge RM (Tyro/Eiko) once you get a good SB to use so you can cast it on Turn 1. **Flexible Slot** Use this to meet any target scores the boss may have or a second support. &gt;Vaan: Armor Breakdown/Tempo Flurry - Split Full Break and Armor Breakdown between the two supports and have the second ability bounce two attacks off your Samurai. &gt;Vaan: Power Breakdown/Magic Breakdown - If the boss has no extra target scores to meet, use this to reduce it's damage. You may want to mix skills up with the first support so you can use Power/Magic Breakdown in the same turn. &gt;Vaan: Magic Breakdown/Boost - If you don't have Mirror of Equity then make sure that you bring Boost for a 15% Attack boost. Use Power Breakdown depending on what the boss is doing to you. You can use Power/Magic/Armor Break on your supports if you don't have breakdowns yet. &gt;Laguna: Tempo Flurry/Any status shot - Hit the enemy with a status it's vulnerable to with Machinist abilities, then bounce two attacks off the Samurai. You can also use the weaker Support status abilities or Double Cut. You can use anything else mentioned above for a specific boss strategy, a specific character for a target score. Many Supports and Machinists use ranged weapons so I've listed the ones who use the more common Swords, use any you like especially if they have a SB Weapon. **Roaming Warrior** Friend only Tyro with Sentinel Grimore or Y'Shtola with Thyrus (the Wall effect). This reduces all damage to you by half, the key to beating tough bosses is stacking Wall/Protect/Shell/Breakdowns/Full Break. You may want to friend one or two Luneth with Advance too, this gives a massive damage boost and sometimes you can try to kill a boss before it kills you since you'll have no Wall if you don't have your own, it's rare that it works but sometimes you can take something down you normally wouldn't be able to with luck. Do relic pulls until you get an AoE Heal SB for your White Mage, this will hopefully get you some good gear for your Samurai too. Then save all Mithril for Ramza's Platinum Sword (Shout gives double damage and speed) when it reappears, or a Wall then change your RWs to Ramza's Shout. Your ultimate aim is to have: &gt;AoE Heal (Most White Mage weapons) &gt;Wall (Thyrus or Sentinel Grimore) &gt;Hastega (several sources with Platinum Sword being the best) &gt;Boostga (Platinum Sword) With good enough gear you'll then start to move into Shout teams where each character can match or outdamage your Retaliate team Samurai. Finally what does it all look like when put together? Here is a sample team built for maximum damage, target scores and specific strategies will cause you to drop Tempo Flurry/Double Cut for other abilities and therefore damage potential to ensure that you survive the fight.

Exploit Lower Left Tentacle's weakness to fire attacks. **Note(s):** * All the tentacles are susceptible to slow and paralyze, so if you have access to abilities or SB that AoE slow/paralyze, they will prove useful here. * They do not have a lot of HP, so AoE is the way to go, especially non-elemental. Don't forget to exploit the weaknesses for the medal conditions. * If you utilize tauntilate and Carbuncle, the boss will be unable to do any damage to you. * **CID MISSION:** Complete the Figaro in Danger++ dungeon with Edgar and Sabin in a party of four (4) FFVI characters. Not much to say here as the fight is pretty easy, just be sure to bring someone who can meet the medal conditions. ******* ###Determined to Fight +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Weak|Absorb|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Storm Dragon**|202,533|Lightning|Wind|Earth|Blind/Sap|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Storm Dragon without being KOd. 2. Exploit Storm Dragon's weakness to lightning attacks. 3. Reduce Storm Dragon's magic. **Note(s):** * While most of Storm Dragon's attacks are either magic or gravity based, his wing saber is a single-target and very strong physical attack. Recommend bringing a way to blind and/or utilize draw fire. * Pack heavy magic mitigation, Storm Dragon has access to lots of AoE magic attacks. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ###Dream Warriors (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Curlax**|110,970|Ice/Water|Fire|Blind|All| **Laragorn**|65,308|Fire|Ice/Wind|Blind/KO|All| **Moebius**|92,970|None|Lightning|Blind|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Exploit Curlax's weakness to ice attacks. 2. Exploit Laragorn's weakness to fire attacks. 3. Reduce Moebius's magic. **Note(s):** * Curlax is at the top and is red, Laragorn is at the bottom left and is blue, and Moebius is at the bottom right and is yellow. * Note that all three of the dream stooges have access to Arise (revive and restore 100% HP), so you need to kill them all within a set time to avoid them rezzing one another *(need AI datamining to determine exact number of turns)*. * While AoE is certainly useful in this fight, note that Laragorn and Moebius have less HP than Curlax, so you'll need to balance it with enough single target attacks to kill them all around the same time. * Laragorn is vulnerable to instant KO if that is something you want to exploit and may be useful if going the single-target route. * Their offense is entirely magical, so Break Fever and Heathen Frolic Sarabande would be quite useful dance skills to take. * Note that their strong attack, Delta Attack, can only be used when all three are alive and ignores your RES. ****** ###Brotherhood (Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Vargas**|216,721|Poison|Poison/Blind|All| **Ipooh**|71,773|Fire/Poison|Poison/Silence|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce Vargas's attack. 2. Exploit Vargas's weakness to poison attacks. 3. Exploit Ipooh's weakness to fire attacks. **Note(s):** * The fight begins with Vargas and two (2) Ipooh's, though Vargas cannot be targeted until both iPoohs are defeated. * Both Vargas and Ipooh's attacks are entirely physical, so pack proper mitigation. However, note that Vargas has access to defense ignoring attacks and will use them more often as he gets weaker, so FB + PBD is highly recommended. Most of Vargas' moves ignore Draw Fire and Retaliate. * Interestingly, Vargas is susceptible to blind, though he will normally cure it with Eye Drops on his next turn - can be useful to stall a few turns if you bring a Machinist with Blind Shell. * Bring Fire attacks and get the Ipooh down immediately, as Vargas can hurt initially since you can't inflict him with any breakdowns until the adds are down. * Once Vargas enters weak mode (%HP TBD), he will cast a 30 second Doom on the party. * Overall, not too bad a fight, especially considering we had Caius last week. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!"

The hardest content in the game will frequently urge you to push your ATK higher than your equipment/synergy allows if you want to deal serious damage. Those attempting Cid's Missions may find some value in these. Ability Name|Requirements|Physical Multiplier|Additional Info ---|---|---|---| Boost|1\* Support|N/A|ATK +25% to target Punishing Palm|4\* Monk|2.1x|single target, ATK +30% to user Mirror of Equity|4\* Samurai|2.2x|single target, ATK +30% and sap status to user Steal Power|4\* Thief|N/A|single target, ATK -40% to target and ATK +50% to user Dark Bargain|4\* Darkness|2.2x|single target, ATK +30% and DEF -30% to user * Rallying Etude (3\* Bard; ATK +15% to party) is an alternative way to increase party members' ATK; Garnet's default SB does the same thing * don't use Boost, Punishing Palm, or Mirror of Equity when a stronger party ATK boost is available; the lower ATK boost from these will OVERWRITE your better ATK boost * these ATK boosts (except Dark Bargain) will not stack with other effects that only boost ATK such as Shout, Burning Arrow, or Planet Protector * Punishing Palm, Mirror of Equity, and Steal Power's boost will stack with most other effects that modify a different subset of stats like Hand of the Emperor (ATK and DEF +30%) * pair with a highly honed damage ability for maximum effect, especially one with multiple hits (i.e. Tempo Flurry or Double Cut) because it has the potential to break 9999 damage * when using the the self-boost damage abilities that deal damage, hone them to R3+ if you're pairing it with an ability with a lower hone (i.e. a R2 5\* physical burst ability) * Steal Power can replace Power Breakdown (same debuff effect) for mitigation if not using Shout * Dark Bargain stacks with most, if not all, other ATK increase effects * Boost is the least expensive ability on this list and is the most accessible, but it lacks the dual function of the others (targeted buff vs. buff + other effect) and makes one character use up a lot of turns buffing * using a self-boost from the above list can make it easier to fit a physical damage character into a team of mages, since the equipped physical character can boost their own damage ## MAG Increase Buffs &gt; Most of these are supplementary abilities you can use if you are lacking a SB, native or RW, that provides a self or party MAG increase (aka Faithga). The RES of Ultimate bosses (or higher) is high enough that your spells won't do high damage without a MAG increase. Those attempting Cid's Missions may find some value in these. Ability Name|Requirements|Magical Multiplier|Additional Info ---|---|---|---| Faith|3\* White Magic|N/A|MAG +20% to target Mana's Paean|3\* Bard|N/A|MAG +15% to party Memento Mori|4\* Darkness|8x|inflicts Doom status (HP = 0 when 45s timer expires) to user and increases user's MAG by 30%, single target, dark element * most SB MAG increase buffs are about 20% and don't stack with these; Lulu's Focus SB stacks with all of these * don't use Faith or Mana's Paean when a stronger party MAG boost is available; their lower MAG boosts will OVERWRITE your better MAG boost * the hone level of Memento Mori depends on the spell you're using in the other slot; higher hones if using a low hone high tier spell like Dark Zone, so you have damage to use before Doom timer wears off * Memento Mori makes it easier to fit a mage into a physical team, since the equipped mage can boost their own damage; other slot is a damage spell * Faith and Mana's Paean are not that expensive to create, but they are easily overshadowed once you get your hands on a party MAG increase SB, either native or RW * NOTE: the MAG buff from Memento Mori lasts longer than the Doom timer ## Damage Increase Debuffs &gt; After slotting in your mitigation and damage abilities, you may find yourself lacking space for these. On occasion, these make great filler abilities. Overall, unless a target condition requires these specific effects, consider these a luxurious investment. NOTE: When you see RESIST after using these on a boss, it means the debuff effect is halved.

Unless you're dealing really high damage hitting through protect/shell or able to endure the onslaught of a hasted boss, removing those buffs will make your life much easier. Ability Name|Requirements|Physical Multiplier|Additional Info ---|---|---|---| Banishing Strike|4\* Knight|2x|removes buffs from target, holy element Dispel|3\* White Magic|N/A|removes buffs from target * if boss resists/nulls/absorbs holy or has a nasty counter to physical damage, use dispel instead * use banishing strike if there is a holy weakness or if it is safe to use for damage * Banishing Strike should be honed high (R3+), especially if using for damage * Dispel should be honed based on how often you think you will be casting it; R2+ is usually a safe amount ## ATB Gauge Control Ability Name|Requirements|Multiplier|Additional Info ---|---|---|---| Haste|3\* White Magic|N/A|grant target Haste Slowga|4\* White Magic|N/A|80% chance to cause Slow to target Tempo Flurry|3\* Celerity|1.8x (Physical)|2 hits, single target, effectively 36% chance to cause Slow Stop|3\* Black Magic|N/A|single target, 70% chance to cause Stop Halting Rumba|4\* Dancer|N/A|AoE, 70% chance to cause Stop Intimidate|3\* Support|N/A|single target, 50% chance to cause Paralyze Dismissal|4\* Celerity|2.05x|single target, 25% chance to cause Stun (reset ATB gauge) * if you are lacking a native SB or RW that allows you to give the party haste (aka Hastega), some fights give you enough breathing room to have a single character spam haste on your team as an alternative * Slow (slows down target's ATB gauge) is a frequent boss vulnerability and target score; essentially gives you more turns, especially when affected by Haste * Slowga is typically better for mage teams, while Tempo Flurry's lower proc chance is offset by its damage potential * Tempo Flurry can potentially break the damage cap with its double hits; use ATK boosts for maximum effect * the Stop and Paralyze status pause the turn timer for the affected target * to Stop-lock a boss vulnerable to it, hone two copies of Stop to R4 and have each caster alternate * paralyze is a somewhat frequent status vulnerability; may not need to bring mitigation if you can keep it up 100% * Dismissal's stun effect typically best against targets afflicted with slow and/or targets with slow ATB gauges * Dismissal works best in multiples (R3+) if capitalizing on stun (not really a reliable strategy) ## Restriction Debuffs &gt; Blind, Sleep, and Silence tend to be a boss vulnerability and/or target score fairly often. There's several ways to apply them, so consider honing the most accessible and/or optimal ones for your team. Use high proc chance abilities where the debuff is extremely urgent that it interacts with the targets' mechanics or if you are pressed for time during the fight Ability Name|Requirements|Multiplier|Additional Info ---|---|---|---| Blindga|3\* Black Magic|N/A|single target, 60% chance to cause Blind Dark Buster|3\* Support|1.7x (Physical)|single target, 30% chance to cause Blind Blind Shell|4\* Machinist|1.9x (Physical)|single target, 60% chance to cause Blind, 2.4x instead if target already has Blind, ranged Sleep|1\* Black Magic|N/A|single target, 30% chance to cause Sleep Sleep Buster|3\* Support|1.7x (Physical)|single target30% chance to cause Sleep Phantasm|4\* Ninja|39x|ignores RES, 50% chance to cause Sleep Lullaby|2\* Bard|N/A|AoE, 20% chance to cause Sleep Silencega|3\* White Magic|N/A|60% chance to cause Silence Silence Buster|3\* Support|1.7x (Physical)|30% chance to cause Silence Silence Shell|4\* Machinist|1.9x (Physical)|60% chance to cause Silence, 2.4x instead if target already has Silence, ranged * the spell versions of these debuffs are typically better for mage-focused teams * the support versions of these debuffs are the most accessible for physical damage dealers * the machinist versions of these debuffs are typically the most powerful for these debuffs, but restricted to a few characters * The Sleep debuff is generally best used with a mage team so that the target won't wake up * Blind can sometimes allow you to forego physical damage mitigation, since the target will have a hard time hitting you * MND increases the effectiveness of these debuffs; more information [here](URL ## Damage Over Time Debuffs &gt; Poison and Sap are the only two statuses currently in the game that can damage an enemy over time with a percentage of its HP per tick. These are especially useful for vulnerable bosses with large HP pools. NOTE: Sap has been a very rare vulnerability lately, so don't invest too heavily into abilities designed for it, if at all.

While we have had some in the few past events, this will be our first one at the Ultimate or higher level. In general, the requirements stipulate a party comprised of only characters from that realm, and sometimes specific characters. Our first Cid mission will be the most restrictive, as it requires 3 specific people for the U+ (Tidus, Yuna, Auron), leaving only 2 other slots.

Defeat Cactuar without being KOd. **Note(s):** * **CID MISSION:** Complete Sanubia Desert with Jecht **by himself.** Ideal strategy is to give Jecht the Loner/Solitude RM, bring Kick and Chakra as abilities, and a Squall BSB as a RW. Kick will handle the enemies prior to the boss, Chakra provides a self-healing option, and Squall BSB allows use of the Fire Renzokuken ability for maximum damage. ****** #####10: Palace of Saint Bevelle (58 STAM: 19/19/20) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Bahamut**|~174,000|None| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Bahamut without being KOd. **Note(s):** * **CID MISSION:** Complete Palace of Saint Bevelle with a party consisting of **only** Auron, Jecht, and Braska. Draw Fire and Retaliate on Auron will help to mitigate some physical damage, but Bahamut has access to both physical and magic attacks (though megaflare is the bigger concern). JP players had it easy with Tyro BSB as an RW for the magic blink and protect/shell, we do not have that luxury. You can balance it by bringing Quistis as an RW and having Braska carrying Protectga, or of course go YOLO with Shout. ****** ###Cavern of the Stolen Fayth+ 40 STAM (20/20) **Target Score Summary**: Ice/Reduce ATK **Can lose a max of 5 medals to master** Round 1|HP|Weak|Resist|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **Nidhogg**|~102,500|Ice|Fire|Confuse/Stop| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Nidhogg without being KO'ed. 2. Exploit Nidhogg's weakness to ice attacks. **Note(s):** * Nidhogg only has two moves - a single target physical attack which can inflict slow, and fire breath. Bring magic mitigation and exploit his ice vulnerability for a quick win. Round 2|HP|Status Vuln.| :--|:--:|:--| **Yojimbo**|~116,300|None| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Yojimbo without being KO'ed. 2. Reduce Yojimbo's attack. **Note(s):** * Pretty straight forward fight, tauntiliate will help but he does have access to an AoE physical damage move. Just frontload physical mitigation and burn him down. * His pet Daigoro will attack you but you are not able to target him. ****** ###Remiem Temple ++ 20 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Sandy**|~69,700|Poison/Confuse/Slow/Sleep|All| **Cindy**|~69,700|Poison/Confuse/Slow/Sleep|All| **Mindy**|~69,700|Poison/Confuse/Slow/Sleep|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat the Magus Sisters without being KO'ed. 2. Afflicts any of the Magus Sisters with poison. 3. Defeat the Magus Sisters before they use Delta Attack for the third time. **Note(s):** * Pretty straight forward fight - if you use Tauntilate and Carbuncle, the only way they can damage you is with their Delta Attack. Take out Cindy first as she can raise the others, and then just nuke down the rest. * Due to their relatively low HP, AoE is the way to go. * Mages have it easy here - just sleep and nuke. * Bio Grenade is a great ability to bring, since it has a very high chance of inflicting poison on at least one of them for each use. ******* ###Baaj Temple +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Anima**|~179,500|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Anima without being KOd. 2. Reduce Anima's attack. 3. Reduce Anima's magic. **Note(s):** * Bring mixed mitigation, as her Pain attack is magic-based while Oblivion is physical based. * She does have access to dispel, though it is only single target. * Overall, a pretty easy fight with relatively low HP with the +++, shouldn't have too many issues. ****** ****** ####**[BONUS BATTLES]** ****** ****** ###Yevon's Dome (Ultimate) (60 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Absorb|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Yunalesca - Phase 1**|243,833|None|Holy|Silence/Stun|All **Yunalesca - Phase 2**|243,833|None|Holy|Stun|All **Yunalesca - Phase 3**|243,833|Water|Holy|Stun|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce Yunalesca's magic. 2. Exploit Yunalesca's weakness to water attacks. 3. Do not use holy attacks against Yunalesca. **Note(s):** * Yunalesca will enter Phase 2 at ~80% HP and Phase 3 at ~50% HP. HP is shared between all phases. * You will want to use silence as close as possible to the end of Phase 1 so that you can maximize its use in Phase 2, saving you damage from holy. Note that she can no longer be inflicted with silence after you enter Phase 2. * Upon entering Phase 2 and Phase 3, Yunalesca will cast Hellbiter, which will sap your entire party. The mechanics are as follows: if sapped, you can be targeted by holy, but megadeath, which she will cast in P3, will miss. Conversely, when not sapped, holy will miss, but megadeath has a 100% chance of inflicting death, and cannot be mitigated by accessories. * Since Yunalesca does not start casting Mega Death until P3, if you have a regen medica and/or spell, you can use it in Phase 2 to help with damage since holy will miss. The Hellbiter she uses in this fight will bypass retaliate, so you don't have to worry about retaliate timing if you are going that route. * Make sure to bring water attacks for phase 3. * Yunalesca is very fast, starting at 500 Speed in phase 1, 550 in phase 2, and 600 in phase 3. In addition, once phase 3 starts she gains access to AoE Holy, which can wreck your party if she decides to chain cast it. Be sure to use holy-resist accessories (Global Master Race with Yuna Valentine's Day Relic!). * Don't forget that Holy is mind-based, so magic breakdown will not help with holy. Stack your resistance as much as possible. ****** ###Sin's Interior (Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--| **BFA**|303,234|Holy|Stun|All **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce BFA's attack. 2. Reduce BFA's magic. 3. Exploit BFA's weakness to holy attacks. **Note(s):** * BFA has access to both physical and magical attacks, so bring proper mitigation (though his AoE moves are physical in nature, so keep that in mind). * When BFA reaches certain thresholds, he will enter Overdrive status, and on the next turn he will use either Jecht Finger (in Phase 1) or True Jecht Shot (in Phase 2), both of which ignore defense. Jecht finger isn't a huge concern, but True Jecht Shot can be very painful depending on how much you have him debuffed. * His AoE cleave move does have a chance to slow, which can be very annoying for the Cid mission. * Other than that, the boss fight is fairly straightforward. BFA is also very fast, reaching speeds of 650 when in Phase 2. * Surprisingly, no Pagodas in this fight, which were quite annoying in FFX proper. * **CID MISSION:** Complete with a party of FFX characters that must include Tidus, Yuna, and Auron. The requirements really don't leave you much space - either bring Wakka/Rikku (or both) as a debuffer, or another damage dealer (Braska/Khimari/Jecht/Lulu).

You have 25 turns before he uses Light Pillar, which will do 9999 damage to one person and cause you to lose 3 medals (and most likely mastery). * Since you have a hard stop, hastega and boostga are almost mandatory, especially since Ultima Weapon himself is very fast. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!"
227,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Consorting with Sky Pirates Bonus Battles Guide and Stream - Average Synergy,1,4h237t,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4h237t/consorting_with_sky_pirates_bonus_battles_guide/,2016-04-30 09:19:55,"Another set of FF12 bonus fights are here, which I love because weapon synergy for 12 is so plentiful from the Relic Draws. As always if the Guide is too long for you videos are at the bottom. &amp;nbsp; **EX** [Party Setup](URL The Boss rush for this event is the Dragons Tiamat and Elder Wyrm, and really only the Elder Wyrm is a threat. Tiamat boasts a mostly physical move-set with one or two Magic based moves; Magic and Power Breakdown are enough to take care of that. Dont forget some Earth damage though for the condition. The Elder Wyrm on the other hand has a good split between Magic and Physical moves as well as a number of ways to induce status effects. His adds will also throw out some Physical attacks, Protect the Wyrm, or Counter any magic damage with Shelling the Wyrm. The Wyrm also has a small chance of casting Spore Fall in its Weak Phase but its about a 3% chance, so dont worry. If you want to deal with the Wyrm's status spells you can cast Silence on it, just remember to hit it with Wind damage for the condition. &amp;nbsp; **EX+** [Party Setup](URL Vinuskar has an almost completely Physical based move-set, and what is Magic based is Holy damage, so Magic Breakdown isnt going to help at all in this fight. The scariest thing that Vinuskar has really is the 5% chance to Petrify someone as well as the Slow that it has. Shellga and Power Breakdown should be enough to cover the damage that Ill throw at you. To add insult to injury you can, and should because its a condition, inflict Vinuskar with Blind. Just dont forget Armor Breakdown for the other condition too. &amp;nbsp; **EX++** [Party Setup](URL Mateus is a rougher +++ then the last few weve had, they come with three adds that while they have low health can do some big damage fast. AoEs are really good here and if you have a Quetzalcoatl it reigns supreme here, all the targets are weak to lightning and the Azers are vulnerable to Paralyze. The frustrating thing is that one of the conditions to the fight is inflicting Sleep on one of the Azers, which can create some issues. Once you have succeeded in clearing the adds and getting your conditions Mateus is pretty simple, just make sure you have a Shellga or Magic Breakdown or both on them and their late fight Chain Magick shouldnt pose that much of a problem. &amp;nbsp; **Ultimate** [Party Setup](URL and the [Stats](URL **Soul Breaks Used** **- Regeneration (Shared)** This boss is kind of rude, not as murdery as Rufus was last week but way more tanky. &amp;nbsp; **Fight Overview** **#1** Judge Bergan starts out about 50/50 Physical Magic but by the end of the fight will be entirely Magic **#2** Judge Bergan also starts with Protect and Shell, and his Judge minions recast those if they are removed/wear-off **#3** Bergan is extremely fast at 500 speed and 600 while in his last 30% **#4** The Judge Minions are 50/50 Magic Physical but take more damage than Bergan **#5** Judge Bergan can be Blinded and Slowed, while the Judge Minions can be Blinded and Confused **#6** Lastly Bergan is pretty tanky, 1200ish Res and 800ish Def &amp;nbsp; **Setup** Firstly, because there are so many targets I highly recommend bringing Multi-Break. Its extremely useful and can make the early parts of the fight way smoother as well as let you get some extra damage in. Some AoE is really needed, I would bring whatever 4* or higher summon you have honed the highest. Even though it wont hit super hard, prolly 5k each use, thatll be 20k damage total. Magic Breakdown and Shellga are also really good abilities to bring for the later phases. As far as the conditions go youre going to need Confuse Shell and Blind Shell. It might be rough but I had a R4 Blind Shell and a R2 Confuse Shell and I still ran out of uses by the end of the fight, think of it as an investment, though I dont think Confuse Shell will come up much. Youre definitely going to need a Dispel move of some sort, Banishing Strike is really good for this and by now you probably have that honed high enough. Fill in the rest of your slots with your best damage because itll be a long fight. If you have it a Regen Break can be really good here for keeping up with the damage incoming, as always I recommend taking Lenna if you dont have a natural one. &amp;nbsp; **Execution** Your first turn should be Dispelling Bergan, getting Shell up , using your Multi-Break, starting work with your AoE, and trying to Blind Bergan or Confuse the Judges. Second turn is a good time to use SG/SS2 and get your Regen up. Once those are all up you can start work on the clearing out the Judges while you keep Magic Breakdown on Bergan. Once the Judges are down, you can focus on Bergan and hope you have the damage to take him out. Be careful of his Very Weak Phase once hes below 30%, hell start Chain Casting and that can take people out fast, save your Soul Breaks for then. &amp;nbsp; **Ultimate+** [Party Setup](URL and the [Stats](URL Cid's a bit simpler then Hojo was last week thanks to his vulnerability. **Soul Breaks Used** **- Only Defaults** &amp;nbsp; **Fight Overview** **#1** Big thing is Dr. Cid is weak to Holy, this is huge because he has 1300Def and 2000Res **#2** Dr. Cid comes with two Rooks that will buff, heal and attack you party with Physical and Magic attacks **#3** There is only one magic attack, Drain, but it can hit for 4k unmitigated and Dr. Cid has an attack that ignores Def, S-15 Cyclotrone **#4** Dr. Cid will only change phases if you kill his Rooks at one Rook down he gains S-27 Tokamak, the only AoE in the fight **#5** When both rooks go down Dr. Cid will Haste himself and has a 40% chance to use his AoE &amp;nbsp; **Setup** Power Breakdown and a Full Break are definitely needed, its the only way to make Cyclotrone hit less hard. Protectga is also really good to bring for all the other attacks this fight throws at you. Once you have those the rest of the team is built on what you have access to. If you have any Soul Breaks that can inflict a Dual Break that involves Attack, like Agrias Cleansing Blade, taking out the Rooks is an option for you. Once theyre down you just need to make sure you keep Breaks and Breakdowns on Cid to keep his AoE from hitting that hard. An AoE would be good for taking down the Rooks, Alexander I good for this because it also does good damage to Cid. If you dont have any good Soul Breaks for inflicting any Dual Attack Breaks on Cid, then the Leave the Rooks Up strategy is good for you. You can use the Multi-Break you might have made for the Ultimate and take that into here as well, Penelo is good for this slot because she can do that and take Diaga on the other slot. With Multi-Break up Drain will only deal about 2.7k damage, making that a bit easier to deal with. Once you have those set up just stack up with all the Holy abilities you have, Banishing Strike for sure to get rid of all the buffs Cid will get over the course of the fight. Whichever strategy you do go with Shout is a really good RW to bring since it lets you keep up with the boss and gets a good bit of extra damage out. &amp;nbsp; **Execution** For the Rooks left up strategy, turn one should be getting Shout, Protectga, Power Breakdown on Cid and Multi-Break off. From there you just need to get as much damage done to Cid as fast as possible, making sure to top off people as theyre hit by Cyclotrone and Drain. Its honestly a pretty simple fight in that respect. If you are killing the Rook, youll want LifeSiphon and Ace Striker on your Break User to make sure you constantly have a source of debuffing for Cid. Try to rush down the Rooks so you dont have to worry about them that much. &amp;nbsp; **Conclusion** I honestly found Dr. Cid to be WAY easier then Hojo was. My Basch was hitting for 20k each Saints use while Ramza and Penelo were also hitting max damage each time they hit a weakness as well. As I stated before the roughest part of this fight is early on while you have no defenses up because the enemies can just dog-pile on once character. Once you have the pacing down I found it very easy to keep up with the incoming damage. I cant really comment on the Kill the Rooks strategy because it was never an option for me, though it should be pretty simple too if you have a good Dual Break. &amp;nbsp; [Full Stream](URL &amp;nbsp; [Just Fights](URL &amp;nbsp; [Ultimate Judge Bergan](URL &amp;nbsp; [Ultimate+ Dr. Cid](URL &amp;nbsp; Give me any suggestions for how to improve the videos and the Guide, and if you want to catch the stream live follow me at URL "
228,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Expanding Your Options: Endgame Ability Creation and Honing,161,4hbewc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4hbewc/expanding_your_options_endgame_ability_creation/,2016-05-02 06:42:16,"# SUMMARY PAGE *** **Guide Navigation** * [Pt. 2: Primary Categories](URL Mitigation, Healing, Damage * [Pt. 3: Utility Categories](URL Status Effects and Miscellaneous *** # About this guide * This guide assumes you are familiar with [retaliate strategies](URL and are looking to expand your ability options for other strategies. * Most ability information comes from [Enlir's Database](URL for side-by-side comparison. * The information here is a compilation of my personal endgame experiences with these abilities and the general consensus that I observed from the community discussion/feedback. I hope that it will be a useful resource to help players transition into endgame (Weekly Event and Main Realm Story Dungeons of difficulty ~100 and above). * This guide only includes abilities that will provide some direction for general party building options when transitioning into endgame, so it won't delve too much into abilities that are relative to gear/character situation. The goal is to showcase some of the best ability options to transition into endgame and not explain every single ability in the game. * This guide only includes abilities up to the Braska Event. Some other abilities will be added once enough discussion has taken place. * 6\* abilities are excluded for now, since their honing resources are scarce, making it not have as much impact as the basics. # Updates (Updated as of June 13, 2016) * made changes based on community feedback * guide successfully divided and linked *** # Creation/Honing Suggestion Summary If you want a quick breakdown on my honing suggestions, check the tier tables below. If you want more details on the choices, check out the appropriate guide parts with the navigation links above or below this guide. ## General Tips * A lot of your damage will come from abilities, so try to have your damage abilities, of the highest tier you can afford, honed to R3+. It is typically better to have a highly honed weaker ability that you can reliably use than run out of abilities quickly because a higher tier ability has barely any hones. * Break down higher tier orbs if it can provide the resources to help you hone many necessary abilities (NOTE: 100x 3\* Orbs = 10x 4\* Orbs = 1x 5\* Orb). The resources needed to barely hone that shiny 5\* ability could be enough to make several honed 3\* or 4\* abilities. Work your way up from the highest tier you can afford to hone to R3+ before moving up to the next tier of abilities, so you have a foundation of options. * If your DPS is decent, a standard fight lasts about 10 or more turns, so equipping your characters with high damage/healing ability uses is ideal. The combined total of potential uses of your abilities should be about 10 or more. You should not reach a point where, for several turns, your character can only use Attack or have little contribution to DPS or party sustain. * When high honing several equally important abilities (i.e. elemental abilities), R3 is usually a decent pausing point if you want to get your other abilities to R3 before pursuing R4. The resources from R3 to R4 is usually equivalent to the cost of honing an ability from R1 to R3. * If you have Soul Breaks that do the exact same thing as an ability listed here, you may not need to make the ability. For example, Lunatic High provides Protectga, which can potentially save you an ability slot. It depends on whether or not the SB channeling time will negatively impact your battle performance. ## Tier Category Tables The following tables are just a general guideline to show you the big picture, showing you what kinds of options can be helpful. Not everyone runs the same team, so there are abilities that are generally applicable to any team, and there are abilities that are limited to a specific kind of team (i.e. magic vs. physical) or encounter (single target vs. multiple targets). The recommended ranks are only for when you choose to invest in that particular ability/category. I won't list every ability on these tables, so if you want more details on any ability/category, please check the category sections further down the guide. Some abilities/categories below contain one or more of the following superscripts: * 1 = suggestion for first priority creation/honing * 2 = frequent application for mastery target score, elemental weakness, or debuff vulnerability * 3 = rare application for mastery target score, elemental weakness, or debuff vulnerability * P = conditional suggestion; see [Pt. 2 Primary Categories](URL for more information * U = conditional suggestion; see [Pt. 3 Utility Categories](URL for more information &amp;nbsp; ## Creating A Foundation: Basic 3\* Abilities 3\* orbs are more plentiful as you delve deeper into harder content, so these abilities will probably be easier to hone while you work your way up to higher tier abilities. Healing and mitigation are essential to help you survive tougher fights. Pick your damage and utility abilities based on your needs. Begin investing in the next tier once you feel like your frequently used 3\* abilities last enough for an extended battle. Ability Name | Recommended Rank | Application | -------|--------------------------|---------------------| Power Break^(1), Magic Break^1 | R3+ | Mitigation: single target ATK/MAG reduction debuff Curaga^(1), Renewing Cure | R3+ | Healing: single target 3\* Elemental Black Magic^(2) | R3+ |Black Magic Elemental Damage: single target 3\* Elemental Spellblades/Jumps^2 |R3+|Physical Elemental Damage: single target Shiva^(2), Ifrit^(2), Ramuh^(2)|R3+|Summoning Magic Damage: AoE or single target burst Tempo Flurry^2 | R3+ | Utility: damage + slow Dispel^3 | R2+ | Utility: enemy buff removal &amp;nbsp; ## Upgrading Your Arsenal: Basic 4\* Abilities Once you get more 4\* orbs, you can finally have access to the strongest mitigation abilities available. Breakdowns are direct upgrades to breaks if you have a 4\* Support character to use them. Damage and utility options are a lot more diverse and powerful at this level. Read the details in the sections below to help you with your decisions beyond the generally useful abilities. Focus on the next tier once you have enough high hones for your frequently used 4\* abilities. Ability Name | Recommended Rank | Application | -------|--------------------------|---------------------| Power Breakdown^(P), Magic Breakdown^1 | R3+ | Mitigation: stronger single target ATK/MAG reduction debuff Exhausting Polka^(P), Heathen Frolic Sarabande^(P) | R2 | Mitigation: strong AoE ATK/MAG reduction debuff Protectga^(1), Shellga^1 | R1-R2 | Party Buffs: DEF/RES increase Curaja | R3+ | Healing: highest potency Diaga^2 | R3+ | White Magic Elemental Damage: weakness or neutral 4\* Elemental Spellblades^(P)|R3+|Physical Elemental Damage: single target 4\* Single Target Elemental Black Magic^(2) | R3+ | Black Magic Elemental Damage: weakness or neutral Quake^(3)|R2|Black Magic Elemental Damage: AoE Ruinga | R3+ |Black Magic Non-Elemental Damage: AoE 4\* Damage Summons^(P)|R3+|Elemental and Non-Elemental Magical Damage: AoE Bladeblitz^(P) and 4\* Samurai AoE^(P)|R2+|Physical Damage: AoE Lifesiphon | R3+ | Utility: SB gauge boost for burst damage or utility SBs Banishing Strike^(2, 3) | R2+ | Utility: Holy damage + enemy buff removal &amp;nbsp; ## Investing In A Specialization: Basic 5\* Abilities 5\* orbs are a bit scarce at the moment, so choose carefully. I suggest starting with Full Break for general purpose and because you're most likely running a 5\* Support on your team at this point. For more details on each individual ability, check the detailed sections further down. Ability Name| Recommended Rank | Application | -------|--------------------------|---------------------| Full Break^1, Multi Break^(P) | R2 | Mitigation: ATK/MAG/DEF/RES reduction debuff Flare | R3+ | Black Magic Non-Elemental Damage: highest potency Meteor| R2 | Black Magic Non-Elemental Damage: AoE Bahamut | R3+ | Summoning Non-Elemental Damage: AoE Flashing Blade, Sky Grinder, Doppelblade | R2+ | Multi-Hit Physical Damage: AoE (2 hits) Single Target Physical Burst Ability^(P) | R2+ | Physical Burst Damage: Physical burst SB substitution or burst complement Dark Zone | R3+ | Mage Dark Burst Damage: single target (2 hits) &amp;nbsp; ## Utility: Supplementary Abilities If you are aiming for mastery target scores or fight advantages, I recommend at least having a *blind*, *poison*, *silence*, *sleep*, and *paralyze* ability. Choose one of the abilities in those categories or more if you want more options.

229,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,How to build: Seifer,39,4i67hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4i67hu/how_to_build_seifer/,2016-05-07 03:43:13,"""**How to build**"": [Yuffie](URL [Seifer](URL [Rikku](URL [Basch](URL ------------------------------------- Seifer has always been kind of a weird character to me. He wants to be tanky, but there are others better than him at doing that; he wants to be offensive while being tanky, but there are others better than him at doing that; he wants to provide utility while providing tankiness and power, but gets outclassed by other Knights, like Edgar. But, what if you got one of his relics? Then, you must know that stats are not the only thing important. Eventually, you will be hitting soft caps, so not being the most offensive or the tankiest will not matter at some point. I must say, I love his coat. Not only does ranged AOE damage, but buffs the party's RES by 50% for 25 seconds, which works really well with Shellga or SBs like Boon or Mighty Guard VIII. So, if you got any of his relics, take a look! ----------------------------------------- **DISCLAIMER**: - Info gathered from [Enlir's Spreadsheet](URL (ability descriptions), [ElNinoFr](URL (japanese data), [MisterP's PDF Compilation](URL (elite bosses' vulnerabilities and weaknesses). - Some abilities are discarded for not being useful enough, or for being outclassed by easy-honable abilities. ------------------------------------------- **SEIFER's ABILITY LIST** **Knight 5** - **Draw Fire**: Grants Draw Fire for 25 seconds. - **Magic Lure**: Grants Magic Lure for 25 seconds. - **Minus Strike**: Damages for 2 * (user's maximum HP - user's current HP). - **Armor Strike**: Damage scales with 30% ATK and 70% DEF; 2.80 damage multiplier. - **Banishing Strike**: Removes positive effects; 2.00 damage multiplier. - **Saint Cross**: Two single attacks (1,70 each), removes negative effects to the user, grants Low Regen to the user; 3.40 damage multiplier. - **Aegis Strike** (not released yet): Two group attacks (1,72 each), damage scales with 30% ATK and 70% DEF; 3.44 damage multiplier. - Discarded abilities: Guard, Bracing Bash, Memento of Protection, Shield Bash. **Combat 5** - **Double Cut**: Two single attacks (0,90 each); 1.80 damage multiplier. - **Power/Magic/Armor/Mental Break**: ATK/MAG/DEF/RES -30% for 15 seconds; 1.70 damage multiplier. - **Launch**: 2.00 damage multiplier. - **Bladeblitz**: Hits all targets; 1.5 damage multiplier. - **Wicked Shockwave** (not released): Dark-enhanced AOE attack; 1.6 damage multiplier. - **Pound**: 100% hit rate; 2.30 damage multiplier. - **Bonecrusher**: Damages the user for 25% max HP; 2.80 damage multiplier. - **Lifesiphon**: 100% hit rate, greatly increases the SB bar; 1.8 damage multiplier. - **Barrage**: Four random attacks (0,70 each); 2.80 damage multiplier. - **Full Charge** (not released): Four single attacks (1,17 each); 4.68 damage multiplier. - **Crushdown**: Two group attacks (1,60 each), causes Instant KO (99%); 3.20 damage multiplier. - Discarded abilities: Blade Bash, Body Slam, Charge, Cripple. **Darkness 5** (both abilities coming with the next event) - **Dark Bargain**: ATK +30%, DEF -30% for 20 seconds; 2.2 damage multiplier; Dark-enhanced. - **Sanguine Cross**: Two single attacks (1,90 each), damages the user for 25% max HP; 3.8 damage multiplier; Dark-enhanced. - Discarded abilities: Memento Mori, Dark Zone (because he is not a mage). **Support 3** - **Boost**: ATK +25% for 25 seconds. - **Cry**: Causes Confuse (30%). - **Intimidate**: Causes Paralyze (50%). - **Silence Buster**: Causes Silence (30%). - **Dark Buster**: Causes Blind (30%). - **Venom Buster**: Causes Poison (30%). - **Sleep Buster**: Causes Sleep (30%). - Discarded abilities: Salve, Revive, Sleep Attack, Silence Attack, Venom Attack, Dark Attack. **Black Magic 2** - **Sleep**: Causes Sleep (30%). - Discarded abilities: Fire, Fira, Blizzard, Blizzara, Thunder, Thundara, Water, Watera, Bio, Poison, Confuse, Snowball Flurry, Lightning, Ruin. ----------------------------------------------- **ABILITY SETUPS** ****Knight under cover**** - Saint Cross - Dark Bargain or Banishing Strike/Minus Strike/Armor Strike/Pound/Lifesiphon Saint Cross being the best Knight ability is no news, but pairing it with anything that is not another Saint Cross can be tricky sometimes. Choosing between Banishing Strike/Minus Strike/Armor Strike/Pound/Lifesiphon depends on a lot of things: gear, soul breaks, ally buffs... Let's dive in! * **Dark Bargain**: as I said before, this ability grants you +30% ATK by lowering your DEF by 30%, while doing Dark damage with a 2.2 damage multiplier. It also stacks with Shout and Basch's Apocalypse Shield/Leon's Hand of the Emperor, this meaning that you will be doing 2x 9999 hits with Saint Cross almost for sure. This ability works pretty well when you do not have great gear for a certain realm, since all the attack boosts stacking will put you over the soft cap really fast. However, if you have great synergy, you might not need that ATK boost. In that case, another DPS ability would be better. * **Banishing Strike**: if the enemy annoyingly buffs itself with stats like Regen, Protect, Shell, or is weak to Holy. * **Minus Strike**: a few days ago, /u/CareerSMN [started a new thread about Minus Strike](URL a ability that I saw no use for (you would need to be really low for it to deal 9999, which is what we are looking for). However, with all these MC3 coming in 5-6 months and all the HP accesories available, it does not seem like a crazy idea anymore. It will not be an ability that you will be always using, as Saint Cross can be, but it has a niche against high-DEF bosses, since the damage dealt does not depend on the enemy's DEF, but your HP. If you are equipped with Agrias' Knight RM (30% damage up when using Knight abilities), you would need to lose 3845 HP to hit for 9999, which seems totally crazy now, but it is not that crazy in Japan, where tanks can get to 8k-10k depending on gear and synergy. Again, it is not the best ability (obviously), and I will probably never use it, but it has a niche. * **Armor Strike** or **Pound**: normally, Pound would be a better choice. However, if you got an armor with synergy, it might be better to use Armor Strike, depending on your stats. You can get an idea by checking [MisterP's FFRK](URL Compilation's [comparison out](URL * **Lifesiphon**: if you got one of his relics and you are not using any kind of SB-boosting RM, Lifesiphon is a good option. You would need 2-3 uses of Bloodfest to last the whole battle, while you could use as many as you want when speaking about Demon Slice. -------------------------------------------------- ****Ultimecia has gone too far**** - Sanguine Cross - Dark Bargain/Minus Strike Being totally honest, Sanguine Cross is not an ability that I will use. Why? You might ask. Even though the damage is nice (2x 1.90), you lose 25% of your MAX HP. This meaning that 4 casts kill you (if you do not heal yourself, obviously). Also, the damage difference vs Saint Cross is not that huge, since Saint Cross (which grants you low regen and removes all your debuffs) deals 2x 1.70, without losing any HP. If you want to use it, Dark Bargain will help you getting to 2x 9999, which is always nice. It is also worth mentioning that Minus Strike works really well with it, since two uses of Sanguine Cross (and Agrias' Knight RM) will let Minus Strike hit for nearly 9999. Again: to me, it is not the best option, but it can work if you got poor synergy or no access to big buffs like Shout. -------------------------------------------------- ****This guy knows some tricks**** - Sleep Buster/Venom Buster/Dark Buster/Silence Buster/Intimidate/Cry - Situational There will be some situations where you will need to bring a vulnerability-exploiter ability and, luckily, Seifer has access to Support 3 and Black Magic 2. I did not discard Sleep (Black Magic) because there might be some fights where you would rather use Sleep so the boss does not wake up while reapplying. If that's not the case, the Support versions are just better. It is also worth mentioning that the damage on the busters is not that bad (1.7, as the Combat breaks vs 1.8 Lifesiphon vs 2.0 Banishing Strike). The other ability totally depends on your team setup. It can be a damaging ability, as the ones mentioned in the first setup; a Combat break, if you are not bringing Full Break; Dark Bargain to boost your damage while applying the Busters; the classic Saint Cross... Putting it into practice: ELITES. * Elite Bosses vulnerable to **Poison**: Lake Dohr (FFIII), Phoenix Cave (FFVI), Narshe 1 (FFVI), Yeti's Cave (FFVI), Ancient Castle (FFVI), Whirlwind Maze (FFVII), Shinra No. 26 (FFVII), Ipsen's Castle (FFIX), Mt. Gagazet 2 (FFX), Mt. Gagazet Cavern (FFX), Fifth Ark 2 (FFXIII). * Elite Bosses vulnerable to **Confuse**: Death Valley (FFV), Cultists' Tower 1 (FFVI), Narshe 1 (FFVI). * Elite Bosses vulnerable to **Silence**: Narshe 1 (FFVI), Balamb (FFVIII), Galbadia Garden 2 (FFVIII), Ipsen's Castle (FFIX), Mt. Gagazet 2 (FFX), Tomb of Raithwall 1 (FFXII). * Elite Bosses vulnerable to **Blind**: Istory Falls (FFV), Mobliz, Part 2 (FFVI), Kefka's Tower Part 1 (FFVI), Stilshrine of Miriam (FFXII). * Elite Bosses vulnerable to **Paralyze**: Guardian Tree (FFV), Kefka's Tower, Part 2 (FFVI), Shinra No 26 (FFVII). * Elite Bosses vulnerable to **Sleep**: Death Valley (FFV), Guardian Tree (FFV), Island Shrine (FFV), Cultist's Tower 1 (FFVI), Yeti's Cave (FFVI), Opera House 2 (FFVI), Ipsen's Castle (FFIX), Shrines of Ipsen (FFIX). Putting it into practice: ULTIMATES. * Ultimate Bosses vulnerable to **Poison**: Twin Stars of Mysidia's Ultimate + battle (Cagnazzo), Two Faces of the Same Coin's Ultimate + battle (Vargas and Ipoohs), Return of the Hero's Ultimate battle (all of the Turks are vulnerable to Poison). * Ultimate Bosses vulnerable to **Blind**: Twin Stars of Mysidia's Ultimate + battle (Cagnazzo), Two Faces of the Same Coin's Ultimate + battle (Vargas). -------------------------------------------------- ****Taunting Squall**** - Draw Fire/Magic Lure - Situational - RM: Lionheart/Planet Guardian I have been using Draw Fire A LOT lately against bosses that only have single-target physical attacks. Not only saves you from bringing Protectga, but can build your SB bar greatly if you pair it up with a Record Materia like Squall's Lionheart. If you were lucky enough to get one of Seifer's relics, you got yourself a handy setup that helps you use those SBs without any Lifesiphon. The other ability can be whatever, as said in the previous setup (break, Banishing Strike, any of the damaging abilities, Dark Bargain, Saint Cross...). It is also nice the combo of Magic Lure + Red XIII's Planet Guardian RM, even though I have used it less than the other one. Still, it is useful against bosses like FFV's Omniscient, as I said on the [Basch's How to build](URL -------------------------------------------------- Aaaaaaaaaaaand, that's it! - Did you find this useful? If so, which character would you be interested to read about next? - Do you see any mistakes or have a different take on a setup? Tell me! Thank you for reading!"
230,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Mastering Omega with decent equipment and only Medica II SB,5,4iapy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4iapy4/mastering_omega_with_decent_equipment_and_only/,2016-05-08 02:53:05,"This is speaking from my 3 months old JP account. Having pulled 4 elemental BSB (Zidane, Garland, Rinoa and Beatrix) that are absorbed by Omega, I had to go bare this time and rely on stop-lock tactics. What I'm going to share in this post is a rough estimate on how your hones should be if you were to tackle this with only **Medica II** used. ---- ###Medal conditions &gt; * Reduce Omega's ATK * Exploit vulnerability to Stop * Exploit weakness to Lightning ---- ###[Party](URL &gt; RW was shout. As you can see, I have very decent equipment and so were my [stats](URL Although I had Bartz' SSB, Delita's SSB and Steiner's SSB, they were not used at all because the damage per second traded was too much. Power break was brought to meet the 1st medal condition --- ###Damage Dealt &gt; Character | Skill | Damage (Shout) | Damage (Shout) with AB :---|:---|:--:|:--:|:--:| Delita | Thundara Strike | 8800 | 9200 Bartz | Thundara Strike | 8200 | 8600 Bartz | Thundaga Strike | 9200 | 9999 Steiner | Thundara Strike | 7800 | 8200 Steiner | Power Break | 3800 | 4200 --- ###Abilities Used &gt; In this fight with my team, all of Delita's and Steiner's skills were used. Bartz had one Thundaga Strike left, Relm had 3 Stops left and Y'shtola has 3 Armor Breakdowns left. So overall, I used 32 Thundara Strikes, 5 Thundaga Strikes, 21 Stops, 4 Power Breaks and 3 Armor Breakdowns (and yes, I ran out of Shout at the end so Thundaga strike was hitting at 6k damage which finished him off) ---- ###Fight progress &gt; In the first round, it is imperative that shout and medica II are casted as soon as possible. Relm has to start casting before or during Flash or else she won't be able to stop Omega in time before the reflect comes up. After that, it's just stop-chaining and spell-casting. RW should have at least 200+ MND so the 2nd cast can be slightly delayed in order to completely utilise all skills. --- ###[Kill Shot](URL and [Medals](URL --- ###Final Thoughts &gt; * This fight is bullshit if you don't have appropriate SBs. If you're getting elemental SB's, you're going to have a hard time. * Honed 4 x R4 Thundara Strikes, 1 R3 Thundaga Strike, 1 R3 Armor Breakdown and 3 x R3 Stops just for this lovely fight. * Pray to RNGesus if you're going for the Stop tactic. Otherwise, treat this as an Ifrit battle (as he sure has the stats to prove it) * Curse 2 hours of S/L ---- ###Tips &gt;* If you're going for the stop tactic and not wanting to bring a dispel/banishing strike, it's important that you stop him before he casts reflect and bring him down to 70% fast. This is because, the AI is hardcoded to only activate reflect in the normal phase. If brought to the weak phase ASAP, the reflect will be skipped (unless you trigger its counter-reflect) &gt;* MND should be at least 400. Even then, at 30% and below, you're only stopping him for only 3 seconds at 400 MND which is almost less than one turn of your character. Note that his MND increases as his HP decreases so increase the rate at which your character uses Stop at that point. &gt;* If you're going to face him head on, Fire resist accessories and Death resist accessories will save lives. Blind-resist accessories also help a lot should you want to forgo esuna or do not have Medica II."
231,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Help with Soaring Nightmare +++,1,4iq6jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4iq6jx/help_with_soaring_nightmare/,2016-05-11 02:57:32,"Hey All, I've only been playing for a couple of months or so. I think I've been able to get one of the 120 difficulty dungeons so far but not all of them. I tried Soaring Nightmare and I really just felt like I didn't have the damage. I don't have any SSB or BSB aside from Cardinal for Rinoa. I do have Baasch shield so I've been going for a physical team and leaving Rinoa on the bench, especially for this fight where he doesn't have vulnerability to spells she can cast. My only synergy weapon was that same Cardinal which doesn't do much on a physical team so I decided to do an 11 pull. While I didn't get much to help, I did get Irvine's gun which I think will probably help quite a bit. I think I have a plan but I want to run my team/relics/hones by you all and see what you guys think. The only MC2 that I'm using so far are Cloud and Tyro. I've got a few others but haven't leveled the characters yet due to lack of relics for them. Everyone at 50 has their MC1 but not their MC2. Characters: Cloud 70 Tyro 65/80 Ramza 65 Yuna 64 Gilgamesh 63 Celes 63 Kefka 62 Baasch 58 Penelo 58 Agrias 57 Rydia 56 Rinoa 52 White Mage 51 Wakka 50 Irvine 50 Ashe 50 Black Mage 50 Everyone else is below 50 Relics: Ice Whip (rydia) Buster Sword (Cloud) Demonsbane (Ashe) Rune Blade (Celes) Glaive (fang, don't have him currently) Grand Glove (tifa, don't have her either) Ice Rod Morning Star (strago, I have 2 but haven't combined yet) White Staff (yay medica??) Wing Edge (locke, don't have him) Cardinal (Rinoa SSB) Ulyses (irvine) Platinum Shield (baasch) Seifer's Coat (don't have him) Kefka's Cloak (I have 3 of these but they're some of my better armor so I haven't combined them as I regularly use 2-3 of them for equipment) Grand Armor (ramza) I have almost no v111 synergy weapons aside from Ulyses and Cardinal, even 3 or 4* things. Hones of note: *ga spells mostly at R3. I haven't started on *ja spells as I've been more physical focused using Baasch shield for buff and shout when I can spare mitigation from RW. Shellga/Protectga R2 3x Double Cut R3, often my main dps abilities Ruinga/Quake R2 Curaga R4 Aerora/Fira/Blizzara strike R3 Armor Break R3 Mental Break R3 Magic/Power Breakdown R3 Armor Breakdown R1 Tempo Flurry R3 Lifesiphon R3 Retaliate R5 Draw Fire R4 Multi Break R1 Banishing Strike R2 I'm really lacking on RMs as well. I've got Mako Might and I've just broken Tyro's level cap so I'm hoping to get Mog's Teachings pretty soon. Here's my plan: Penelo shellga/curaga Regenerate SB, Light of the Fayth RM Cloud tempo flurry/Aerora strike, bracker sb, soldier strike RM Ramza life siphon/magic breakdown, tailwind sb, whatever RM is least crappy Irvine Armor Break/power breakdown, canister shot sb, mako might Baasch banishing strike, double cut, apocalypse shield sb, dr mog's teachings I am thinking I'll need SG as my rw for mitigation but maybe with lifesiphon fueling tailwind from Ramza I can go with shout? What do you guys think? Would you build things differently? Think I can do it? Also, will egging this team up to level caps make enough difference to be worth it? I can probably do it or get close, but I'll be out of eggs at that time. Thanks!!!"

In addition, he has some debilitating statues (AoE Blind/Silence/Confuse), and both physical and magical attacks. * Mage parties have it the easiest here - sleep and nuke him to death. ****** ###Castle Saronia++ 20 STAM Boss|HP|Weak|Null|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Garuda**|187,031|Wind|Earth|Poison/Slow/Sap|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Garuda without being KOd. 2. Exploit Garuda's weakness to wind attacks. 3. Reduce Garuda's magic. **Note(s):** * Garuda acts twice per turn, and only has two abilities to choose from - a single target attack, and an AoE thunder move - therefore, except a lot of AoE damage. * His single target physical attack is also very potent, so both mitigations are recommended. * Get your mitigation up as quickly as possible, and consider exploiting Slow. * Those with Luneth SSB will tear right through Garuda. ******* ###Saronia Catacombs +++ 40 STAM Boss|HP|Weak|Resist|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Odin**|214,699|None|None|None|All| **Target Score(s):** 1.

Exploit Leviathan's weakness to lightning attacks. 2. Reduce Leviathan's magic. **Note(s):** * Leviathan acts twice per turn, and likes to buff himself with protect and haste, so be sure to bring a form of dispel. * Leviathan has mixed physical and magical attacks, and can use Tsunami throughout the entire fight this time. However, he no longer will petrify you like in the story dungeons. * Note that there are only 2 target scores, so you can only lose a max of 2 medals to master. ****** ###Bahamut's Lair (Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Weak|Resist|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--| **Bahamut**|355,321|Wind|**ALL EXCEPT** Lightning (and Wind)|Interrupt|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce Bahamut's defense. 2. Exploit Bahamut's weakness to wind attacks. 3. Defeat Bahamut before he uses Megaflare three times. **Note(s):** * Bahamut enters weak phase around ~60% HP and very weak phase around ~30% HP. Between each phase transition, he will cast Megaflare followed by another random attack. In addition, once he enters weak phase, he will act twice per turn. * While he does use Megaflare and Flare, he also has very potent AoE physical attacks (one of which is long range), so be sure to pack strong physical mitigation as well. * Since the Megaflares are scripted, you can reduce damage by defending, or if you are lucky enough to have a magic blink SSB, time the cast accordingly. * We'll need to wait for AI datamining, but most likely the 3rd megaflare is unlocked after a certain number of turns (similar to previous Ultimate bosses), so shouldn't be a concern. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!"

Reduce Steiner's defense. **Note(s):** * ~~Steiner's offense is completely physical~~ Steiner is mostly all physical except for Climhazzard when he enters weak mode, so pack proper mitigation. Be forewarned that his Shock attack does ignore DEF, so make sure to apply Full Break + Power Breakdown at a minimum. * Steiner's RES is lower than his DEF, so mage meta may be the best route here (as well as access to more dark spells). * Steiner does have access to power and armor break, so it may be useful to bring a tauntilator to negate those attacks. ****** ###Sweet Oblivion (Ultimate+) (1 STAM) Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist| :--|:--:|:--|:--| **Kuja**|352,073|Interrupt|All| **Target Score(s):** 1. Reduce Kuja's magic. 2. Reduce Kuja's resistance. **Note(s):** * Note that since you only have 2 target scores, only a maximum of 2 medals can be lost to still master. Since a lot of Kuja's abilities are thunder-based, lightning resistance accessories will help preserve your damage medals. * Most of Kuja's arsenal is magic-based, though he does have some physical attacks in trance form, so don't neglect it completely. * Kuja has some scripted abilities: 1. Upon reaching &lt; 70% HP, his next attack with be Gravija (60% of current HP). 2. Once Kuja reaches 50% HP, he will enter Trance Mode, cast 1,000,000 Volts (AoE lightning), and from then on act twice per turn. 3. Once Kuja reaches ~25%-30%, he will enter his Very weak mode and cast 10,000,000 Volts * Kuja will inflict **a lot** of damage on your party, so as much mitigation and AoE healing you can bring to the fight is advised. In addition, he is fairly fast, and once he attacks twice per turn, can really put the hurt to your party. * It may be useful to use Lureflect to redirect all his single target lightning abilities back at him for additional damage and mitigation. * For those with Celes and Runic and/or Indonesian Blade, she would be a great character to bring, as it provides more mitigation, not to mention Celes' high innate RES will help her better mitigate damage. ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit the guide at URL If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here and I'll do my best to address them ASAP!"

240,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,FFRK Character Review - Relm,43,4ffcoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4ffcoj/ffrk_character_review_relm/,2016-04-19 11:58:36,"#**Relm - The Pictomancer** #**Stats, Equipment &amp; Abilities** Relm is a caster who is specialized in White Magic, but can also use Summons and Black Magic. The following are her important stats at **level 80** (!!) compared to other similar characters. |Character| HP | DEF| MAG | RES|MND| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:| |*Relm*|*4222*|*83*|*160*|*154*|*174*| |Yuna|4750|91|**169**|152|169| |Mog|**5547**|**123**|132|146|168| |Aerith|4222|83|168|142|**175**| |Eiko|4169|79|165|**163**|172| **Equipment:** Dagger, Rod, Staff, Whip | Hat, Robe, Bracer **Abilities:** White Magic 5, Summoning 4, Black Magic 3 **Soulbreaks:** *Control* - High chance to Confuse one target. (100% chance of Confuse) | *Ink Blast (SB)* - Deal four non-elemental summon magic attacks to all targets, with a high chance to Blind them. (2.37x magic damage per attack, 100% chance of Blind) | *Portrait of Lakshmi (SSB: +10MND)* - Restore a large amount of HP to all allies and grant them major Regen. (85 potency, Grants High Regen) &amp;nbsp; #**Comparing:** ##**PROS** * 5 White, 4 Summons and 3 Black Magic gives Relm access to quite a few different spells! * White Mages are essential in almost all medium-high difficulty content. You need them in mage teams, physical teams, tank teams, celebrity teams, EVERY KIND OF TEAM. Relm has 5 White Magic giving her access to every current and future White Magic spell and is what youre mainly going to be using Relm for. * 4 Summons lets Relm use almost every Summon, with the exceptions of 5 Bahamut and Odin and 6 Neo-Bahamut, though you probably wouldnt be equipping those spells on Relm even if she could use them! She still can use the 3 elemental Summons which definitely come in handy, Valefor/Maduin for dat damage, and Carbuncle or Kirin for utility. * Relm also has 3 Black Magic though you most likely wont be using it for damage. It can be extremely useful for bosses vulnerable to Stop however as the duration of Stop extends based on the users MND! If anyone remembers fighting Omega a couple months ago, they should remember how useful Aerith/Yshtola/Selphie became as they were the best characters to take advantage of Omegas status vulnerability to Stop. Relm also has the potential to be a great character for any future bosses with vulnerabilities to Stop. * She has standard mage weapons and armor, giving her the basic White Mage/Caster necessities. She also has access to Whips, which wont be useful if youre playing her as a White Mage as there arent any Whips that raise MND, but can come in handy if youre using her as an offensive Summoner. * Her default SB isnt the best as so many bosses are immune to Confuse, but Im putting it as a PRO because its currently the best way of inflicting Confuse on a boss. We do get a 4 Machinist skill in the future, Confuse Shell (60% chance of Confuse), which would probably be a bit more useful as it does damage, but Relms default is still the only 100% chance of Confuse skill in the game. *(Porom also has a 100% Confuse default SB!)* * Has an MC2 and two unique SB weapons, including a SSB, in the global version, and a third unique weapon in the JPN version. &amp;nbsp; ##**CONS** * I could honestly describe Relm in one word -- squishy. Her defensive stats are some of the worst in the game so thank god she was given a MC2 right off the bat. * Not a lot of realms have multiple White Mages but FFVI does! This can be a problem for Relm as Mog is actually one of the strongest White Mages in the entire game and his defensive stats make him much better than Relm in and out of the VI realm. *Fun Fact:* Mog has ~400 more HP at level 65 than Relm does at level 80! And if you scroll up to the chart above, he has over 1200 more HP than her at level 80! He is still stuck at at level 65 though and will be for another 5~ months so Relm could possibly have an advantage over him until then. * There are already several White Mages, White Mage Summoners, White Mages with 3-4 Black Magic and Summoners, all of which with better overall stats than Relm. Her crappy defensive stats are the biggest problem but they didnt even give her a really high MND like Minwu, Lenna or Porom, or a high MAG like Garnet or Yuna to make her a glass cannon or anything. * It would have been nice for Relm to have Light Armor just to make her a bit sturdier. I personally dont usually equip Light Armor on casters in most dungeons as Hats are usually enough, however for tough +++ or Ultimate battles I find both the high DEF and RES of Light Armor very useful on your squishy characters. &amp;nbsp; #**Conclusion:** Relm is your typical lil White Mage. Her defensive stats arent the absolute worst in the game (RIP VIVI), but they are very far from the best which is a hard problem to overlook. Unlike other squishy characters like Vivi or Eiko (both honestly need HP buffs badly) she doesnt even bring anything unique or special whereas Vivi has one of the highest MAG stats, and a great default SB, and Eiko also has an excellent default SB. Relm does have a decent set of abilities but so many other White Mages can do the exact same things but have much better base stats and equipment. 3/5 White Mage &gt;Pretty good MND and RES and her MC2 makes her one of the few White Mages we currently have at level 80. Compared to other White Mages, her HP and DEF are still pretty crappy, but they arent the worst which gives Relm an decent rating. 2.5/5 Summoner/Caster &gt;Relm does have Summoning 4 and Black Magic 3 which means you could play her as an offensive caster, though its definitely not her best role. Her stats really look terrible compared to the stronger Summoners and Black Mages and I dont see many reasons to use her over casters like Terra, Terra or even Terra. The supportive Summons, Stop, and maybe some other status effect spells are the only Summon or BLM spells I can see being useful on Relm. 2.5/5 Overall &gt;It was honestly hard deciding on this overall rating. White Mages are by far the most essential class in FFRK and every single one of them are viable characters, however Relm just doesnt bring anything special and is from a realm that already has one of the best White Mages in the game, which makes her not even useful in FFVI dungeons! Im always open to discussion so if anyone disagrees on my rating please leave a comment as I did have high hopes for Relm and was actually surprised to realize she how mediocre she was. 4.5/5 Overall W/ Relic &gt;AoE Curaga with Heavy Regen. AoE. Curaga. Heavy Regen. If you pulled Relms SSB, level this lil bi!ch to level 80 and use her every time you need a Medica, which is basically every tough dungeon. As many of us should know by now, Medica could very well be the most important part of FFRKs Holy Trinity (Medica + Hastega + Wall), because moving speedy really doesnt matter if youre dead. While Selphie and Minwu also have excellent Medicas, Relms Heavy Regen seems a bit more valuable than Selphies Magic Barrier or Minwus instant cast, though really all three are excellent SSBs that you should be glad to have. The only thing that keeps it back from being 5/5 is that youre still going to have to deal with Relms weak HP and DEF which is always going to be an issue in high difficulty content. I have octo-phobia *(fear of Octopus)* so Im staying away from that Ink Blast SB though. :( *(0)(0) * [Other Character Reviews](URL "
241,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,How to build: Yuffie,118,4fjb5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4fjb5l/how_to_build_yuffie/,2016-04-20 05:30:34,"""**How to build**"": [Yuffie](URL [Seifer](URL [Rikku](URL [Basch](URL ----------------------------------------- Hey there! As I pulled Yuffie's Wutai Headband in the festival's phase 5, I have been thinking about how could I build her so it is efficient for my different team setups. Since I do not even have Yuffie yet (left the game for a few months), I knew nothing about her skillset and damn... she is versatile. The main goal of this topic is to think about some different setups that would make Yuffie a staple on a regular team. As I am not perfect, I am posting this here so you can correct me if I am wrong or suggest me if I left a good setup behind. But, before that happens, let's see which abilities is she able to use. ----------------------------------------- **DISCLAIMER**: - Info gathered from [Enlir's Spreadsheet](URL (ability descriptions), [MisterP's PDF Compilation](URL (bosses' weaknesses), [FFRK Central](URL (for weaknesses of bosses belonging to the last DU, not included in the PDF compilation yet). - Some abilities are discarded for not being useful enough (Shuriken, Dagger Toss, Aim), or for being outclassed by easy-honable abilities (Fire, Thunder, Blizzard...). - The newest 6* abilities are not included in here because I do not have a solid opinion about them just yet. I will update as soon as I do. - There might be some situations where bringing Yuffie would not be the best choice. However, I am aiming to look for Yuffie's full potential, so I am going to avoid those kinds of situations (for example, Intimidate -Support 3- has a 50% chance of paralyzing the enemy, whereas Paralyzing Shot -Celerity 4- has a 25%, but Yuffie can't use the first one, and we want to use her). ------------------------------------------- **YUFFIE's ABILITY LIST** **Thief 5** - **Steal Defense**: DEF -40% for 20 seconds, DEF +50% to the user for 20 seconds. - **Steal Power**: ATK -40% for 20 seconds, ATK +50% to the user for 20 seconds. - **Steal Time**: Causes Slow (50%), if successful grants Haste to the user. - **Mug Time**: Causes Slow (100%), if successful grants Haste to the user; 2.5 damage multiplier. - **Thief's Revenge**: 1/2/3/4/5 single attacks (0,70 each) at 140/150/160/170 SPD, heals the user for 30% of the damage dealt; 3.5 damage multiplier. - Discarded abilities: Steal HP. **Ninja 5** - **Flurry of Petals**: Six random ranged attacks (0,37 each); 2.2 damage multiplier. - **Swift Bolt**: AOE Lightning Magical attack that ignores RES; 0,83 s cast; 21 damage multiplier. - **Water Veil**: AOE Water Magical attack that ignores RES; 0,83 s cast; 21 damage multiplier. - **Fire Veil**: AOE Fire Magical attack that ignores RES; 0,83 s cast; 21 damage multiplier. - **Whirlwind** (released in ~2 months): AOE Wind Magical attack that ignores RES; 0,83 s cast; 26 damage multiplier. - **Phantasm**: Ignores RES, causes Sleep (50%); 0,83 s cast; 39 damage multiplier. - **Doppelblade**: Two group attacks (1,19 each), causes Sap (13%); 2.38 damage multiplier. - Discarded abilities: Shuriken. **Dancer 4** - **Box Step Sarabande**: AOE DEF -40% for 15 seconds. - **Stumble Step**: AOE RES -50% for 15 seconds. - **Exhausting Polka**: AOE ATK -40% for 15 seconds. - **Halting Rumba**: AOE Attack that causes Stop (70%). - **Heathen Frolic Sarabande**: MAG -50% for 15 seconds. - Discarded abilities: Box Step, Stuter Step, Weak Polka, Heathen Frolic. **Celerity 4** - **Shadowbind**: Causes Stop (40%), ranged attack; 2.1 damage multiplier. - **Wind Slash**: Wind ranged attack; 1.4 damage multiplier. - **Tempo Flurry**: Two single attacks (0,90 each), causes Slow (20%); 1.8 damage multiplier. - **Dismissal**: Causes Stun (25%); 2,05 damage multiplier. - **Paralyzing Shot**: Causes Paralyze (25%); 2.10 damage multiplier. - Discarded abilities: Aim, Quickness, Leg Shot, Dagger Toss. **Black Magic 3** - **Firaga, Blizzaga, Thundaga, Waterga, Biora, Dark, Drain** - **Sleep**: Causes Sleep (30%) - **Poison**: Causes Poison (30%) - **Stop**: Causes Stop (70%) - **Blindga**: Causes Blind (60%) - Discarded abilities: Confuse, Fire, Fira, Blizzard, Blizzara, Thunder, Thundara, Water, Watera, Bio, Gravity, Comet, Blind, Ruin ----------------------------------------------- **ABILITY SETUPS** ****Stop right there!**** - Stop/Halting Rumba/Shadowbind - Dance Breakdown or any damaging ability. Using Stop/Halting Rumba/Shadowbind relies on two things: hones and objective. Using Stop/Halting Rumba relies on your hones, since it is easier to hone Stop, due to Halting Rumba being a 4* that uses Greater Power and Wind orbs, which are pretty wanted. However, Halting Rumba is AOE, and it is key to some battles, like [Celerity's Nightmare battle](URL On the other hand, Shadowbind has a lower proc chance (40% vs 70%), but deals damage, which makes it perfect for battles where you need to fulfill a condition but you do not really need to keep the objective stopped forever (like Jenova's DEATH battle, to me). The second slot is dependant on the decision you made before. If you want to keep your target stopped, you might as well pick a dance breakdown and use it every 3 turns, while applying Stop each turn, so you make sure that it can not even move. If you do not care about it being stopped 24/7, just take a damage ability of the listed above. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Great Sea Trench (Gargoyles - FFV), Black Fork Tower (using no-physical abilities - FFVI), Forgotten Capital (FFVII), Whirlwind Maze (FFVII), Shinra No 26 (FFVII), Ragnarok (FFVIII), Mount Gulug (FFIX), Light Cruiser Shiva (FFXII), Fifth Ark 3 (FFXIII) ___________________________________________ ****You can't move, buddy**** - Steal Time/Mug Time - Dismissal You do want to have Mug Time, since it is better than Steal Time in every aspect (100% proc chance vs 50%, 2.5 damage multiplier vs 0), but we need to be realistic and Steal Time is way easier to hone right now. Also, very few bosses are immune to Stun, so a hasted user using Dismissal every turn on a slowed boss is just nuts. It would need a high-honed Dismissal, but there are a lot of factors to take into account, like Soulbreak using. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Basically every boss weak to Slow. ___________________________________________ ****Stephen Hawking**** - Paralyzing Shot - Steal Power/Defense/Dance Breakdown or damaging ability As I said on the disclaimer, Paralyzing Shot has a 25% of proc, which is half of the Intimidate's chance. However, this one deals damage (2.1 multiplier) and can be combined with Steal Power or any kind of dance breakdown. If you are not needed of a breakdown because your support character has the ones needed, you can always bring another damaging ability (or another debuff, if the boss requires of it). **Some elites where you could apply it**: Guardian Tree (FFV), Kefka's Tower, Part 2 (FFVI), Shinra No 26 (FFVII). ___________________________________________ ****Mage's dream**** - Sleep/Phantasm - Stumble Step The Sleep + Stumble Step combo is something that I have been doing quite often while catching up with the latest DUs. Yuffie can not only do that, she can even deal damage while doing it. The bad thing is that Phantasm is a 4* ability, so it requires orbs that would be more useful on an ability not that situational. It also requires of a 5* Thrown/Bow/Dagger/Fist/Katana magical weapon to deal decent damage (which will be listed in the last setup). Leaving that aside, she can easily deal 3k-5k while casting Phantasm (with the proper gear). **Some elites where you could apply it**: Death Valley (FFV), Guardian Tree (FFV), Island Shrine (FFV), Cultist's Tower 1 (FFVI), Yeti's Cave (FFVI), Opera House 2 (FFVI), Ipsen's Castle (FFIX), Shrines of Ipsen (FFIX). ___________________________________________ ****John Cena Meme**** - Blindga - Steal Power/Defense/Dance Breakdown or damaging ability Basically the same as the Stephen Hawking one, bringing Blindga for the Blind status and the other one to fill up the team's needs. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Istory Falls (FFV), Mobliz, Part 2 (FFVI), Kefka's Tower Part 1 (FFVI), Stilshrine of Miriam (FFXII) ___________________________________________ ****Get rekt!**** - Thief's Revenge - Steal Power or Mug Time or a second damaging ability Yuffie is one of the fastest characters in the game. She is currently tied up at 174 with Edge, Faris, Locke, Shadow, Zidane, Rikku and Thancred (at level 80). 170 is the speed required for Thief's Revenge to deal 5 hits; however, we are not getting Yuffie's MC2 for a while (~early June), so she will be stuck at 65 with her 164 speed, which is not enough to deal 5 hits. In this case, we do need Mug Time or a haste source (like Shout). If we are getting hasted, it would be better to take Steal Power (unless we are getting hasted via Shout - we would take another ability if that's the case). Another useful abilities to fill up the second slot would be Dismissal or Tempo Flurry (in case we need to slow the boss). ___________________________________________ ****Poor people's revenge**** - Steal Power - Flurry of Petals As the name says, this setup is only made for poor people (like me). If you are getting boosted (very common these days thanks to Shout), Flurry of Petals is not a bad ability. It has a 2.2 damage multiplier, but it deals 6 hits, so it can not hit the cap (like Pound or Dismissal do when boosted). ___________________________________________ ****Going crazy**** - Doppelblade - Flurry of Petals or Dancer Breakdown or Steal Power/Defense Sadly, the only physical AOE ability that Yuffie can use is Doppelblade. Why do I say ""sadly""? Doppelblade is not the best AOE damaging ability that we can see in FFRK. There are others, like Bio Grenade, Flashing Blade, Tornado Strike or Sky Grinder that are more interesting due to other effects. For example: Bio Grenade has the Poison element and has a 20% chance of poisoning the enemy; Flashing Blade has a higher damage multiplier and still works if the user is blinded; Tornado Strike is more damaging and is wind-enhanced; Sky Grinder has a 50% chance of dealing crits, which makes up its original damage. When does Doppelblade shine? When the boss is weak to Sap, since it has a 13% chance of inflicting it. However, and this is why it is sad, Sap is not a common vulnerability these days. But, if the boss is vulnerable, it is a great asset. The second slot can be whatever your team needs. I just placed Flurry of Petals because it would compensate the probable low hones of Doppelblade. If you have it high honed, you could use a dancer breakdown or steal power/defense. ___________________________________________ ****Elemental Destroyer**** (VERY situational and relic-dependant) - Swift Bolt, Water Veil, Fire Veil, Whirlwind - Dancer Breakdown This setup is only meant to be used against multiple-target fights where you need to burst down the enemies so they can not wreck you over. Also, these enemies need to be vulnerable to Lightning, Water, Fire or Wind, since it is efficient if you are exploiting vulnerabilities. What you need to build this setup: - R5 Swift Bolt, Water Veil, Fire Veil, Whirlwind (50-60k damage total, each cast realized in 0,83 seconds) - A magical weapon (**WITH SYNERGY**) that Yuffie can use: - Magic-boosting relics that Yuffie can equip: Artemis Bow (FFII); Murasame (FFIV); Ichigeki (FFVI); Pinwheel, 4-point Shuriken (FFVII); Fujin's Chakram, Valkyrie, Rising Sun, Cardinal (FFVIII); Skycutter, Airwing, Hawkeye (FFXIII). - Magic-boosting relics that Yuffie can equip (yet to be released): Palom's SSB Dagger (FFIV); Edea's SSB Thrown, Rinoa's BSB Thrown (FFVIII); Garnet's BSB Dagger (FFIX); Hope's BSB Thrown, Serah's SSB Bow (FFXIII). As ninja scrolls ignore the enemies' RES, you can even carry this setup with full-physical teams, as she will not need a single buff or debuff to deal damage. I took as an example the future Ultimate battle in Broken Chains (2 May): Seifer, Fujin, Raijin. Fujin (weak to Lightning) has a really scary attack that deals damage proportional to your HP, so there is no way of mitigating it. However, if you burst it down quick enough, you might not even see it. So, as I have Rinoa's Cardinal, I thought of equipping it to Yuffie. A level 65 Yuffie with Cardinal, Wutai's Headband and Silver Pinion (and no RM equipped) has 390 magic in a FF8 dungeon, dealing 5.7k damage if exploiting weakness, which is really good damage considering that you are using a 3* ability and that you are not using any kind of RES debuff (since you do not need it). ""But, the damage is not that good, considering that you are exploiting weakness. Why not just equip Rinoa with the Cardinal?"" Yuffie can equip a dancer breakdown while doing this, so she can help Rinoa get to the damage cap (if she doesn't already). In fact, my plan for that ultimate is to build Yuffie like I said, Rinoa with Valefor + another one, Quistis with Ruinga + Quake (since I got her whip). Not worth building like this if you do not have a decent synergized weapon. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Lunar Subterrane 3 (FFIV), Underwater Reactor (FFVII), Mount Gulug (FFIX), Fifth Ark 1 (FFXIII) __________ Aaaaand, that's it! - Did you find this useful? If so, which character would you be interested to read about? - Do you see any mistakes? Tell me! - Can you think of another setup with the abilities selected? Thank you for reading!"

This one is going to be dedicated to Rikku, as you read on the title. The first time I read about Rikku, I just thought: ""wow, her ability set is huge"". Indeed, it is. Rikku is a master debuffer. She is able to inflict the enemies with 8 different status effects while being able to debuff them at breakdown levels (read last disclaimer's point) AND buff the party. And guess what: she can still do damage. The purpose of this topic is to discover Rikku's full potential by looking at the different ability setups that she is able to wield against concrete fights, like Elite bosses or future Ultimates. ----------------------------------------- **DISCLAIMER**: - Info gathered from [Enlir's Spreadsheet](URL (ability descriptions), [ElNinoFr](URL (japanese data), [MisterP's PDF Compilation](URL (elite bosses' vulnerabilities), [FFRK Central](URL (elite bosses' vulnerabilities belonging to the last DU, not included in the PDF compilation yet). - Some abilities are discarded for not being useful enough, or for being outclassed by easy-honable abilities. - **There might be some situations where bringing Rikku would not be the best choice. However, as I am aiming to look for Rikku's full potential, we are still taking those situations into account.** - **This analysis takes into account the recent buff that Rikku got in Japan (Dancer 3 to Dancer 5). When are we going to get this buff? We can not know for sure. What we can do know for sure is that buffs come here quickly, so maybe in 3 months? For the Celerity Nightmare Abyss? I will mark those abilities and setups with a [JP!] sign.** ------------------------------------------- **RIKKU's ABILITY LIST** **Thief 5** - **Steal HP**: Heals the user for 30% of the damage dealt; 1,40 damage multiplier. - **Steal Time**: Causes Slow (50%), if successful grants Haste to the user. - **Steal Defense**: DEF -40% for 20 seconds, DEF +50% to the user for 20 seconds. - **Steal Power**: ATK -40% for 20 seconds, ATK +50% to the user for 20 seconds. - **Mug Time**: Causes Slow (100%), if successful grants Haste to the user; 2.5 damage multiplier. - **Thief's Revenge**: 1/2/3/4/5 single attacks (0,70 each) at 140/150/160/170 SPD, heals the user for 30% of the damage dealt; 3.5 damage multiplier. - **Mug Morale** (not released): ATK and DEF -20% for 20 seconds, ATK and DEF +20% to the user for 20 seconds; 3,20 damage multiplier. **Celerity 5** - **Shadowbind**: Causes Stop (40%), ranged attack; 2.1 damage multiplier. - **Wind Slash**: Wind ranged attack; 1.4 damage multiplier. - **Tempo Flurry**: Two single attacks (0,90 each), causes Slow (20%); 1.8 damage multiplier. - **Dismissal**: Causes Stun (25%); 2.05 damage multiplier. - **Paralyzing Shot**: Causes Paralyze (25%); 2.10 damage multiplier. - **Quick Hit**: 0.01 cast time; 2.40 damage multiplier. - **Faultsiphon** (not released): Grants Cast Speed *999 to the user for 1 turn; 2.0 damage multiplier. - **Northern Cross** (not released): Two single attacks (2.0 each), causes Stun (30%) and Stop (30%); 4 damage multiplier. - Discarded abilities: Aim, Quickness, Leg Shot, Dagger Toss. **Machinist 5** - **Blind Shell**: Causes Blind (60%), 2.40 multiplier if the target has Blind, ranged attack; 1.9 damage multiplier. - **Silence Shell**: Causes Silence (60%), 2.40 multiplier if the target has Silence, ranged attack; 1.9 damage multiplier. - **Poison Shell**: Causes Poison (60%), 2.40 multiplier if the target has Poison, ranged attack; 1.9 damage multiplier. - **Confuse Shell** (not released): Causes Confuse (60%), 2.40 multiplier if the target has Confuse, ranged attack; 1.9 damage multiplier. - **Bio Grenade** (not released): Two **Poison** group ranged attacks (1,20 each), causes Poison (20%); 2.4 damage multiplier. - **Penalty Snipe** (not released): Two group ranged attacks (1,45 each), 1,70/1,85/2,00 multiplier if the target has 1/2/3 status ailments; 2.9 damage multiplier. **Dancer 5 [JP!]** - **[JP!] Box Step Sarabande**: AOE DEF -40% for 15 seconds. - **[JP!] Stumble Step**: AOE RES -50% for 15 seconds. - **[JP!] Exhausting Polka**: AOE ATK -40% for 15 seconds. - **[JP!] Halting Rumba**: AOE Attack that causes Stop (70%). - **[JP!] Heathen Frolic Sarabande**: MAG -50% for 15 seconds. - **[JP!] Multi Break**: AOE ATK, DEF, MAG and RES -30% for 15 seconds - Discarded abilities: Box Step, Stuter Step, Weak Polka, Heathen Frolic. **Bard 4** - **Lullaby**: AOE Sleep (20%). - **Mana's Paen**: AOE MAG +15% for 25 seconds. - **Spellbend Etude**: Shellga. - **Enveloping Etude**: Protectga. - Discarded abilities: Requiem, Rallying Etude. **Support 3** - **Boost**: ATK +25% for 25 seconds. - **Cry**: Causes Confuse (30%). - **Intimidate**: Causes Paralyze (50%). - **Silence Buster**: Causes Silence (30%). - **Dark Buster**: Causes Blind (30%). - **Venom Buster**: Causes Poison (30%). - **Sleep Buster**: Causes Sleep (30%). - Discarded abilities: Salve, Revive, Sleep Attack, Silence Attack, Venom Attack, Dark Attack. ----------------------------------------------- **DAMAGE SETUPS** This time I decided to split the setups into damage, vulnerabilities and utility. Damage is going to be focused on damage setups (kappa) and Slow and Stun inflicting. I thought that this was a good idea since Slow and Stun are two status that are mostly used while dealing damage, since your white mage will probable by loaded up with another spell like Protectga or Shellga (therefore, not being able to carry Slowga). ------------------------------------------------ ****Time goes fast when having fun**** - Tempo Flurry - Dismissal After posting Yuffie's How to build, I started thinking about the utility of Mug Time. Dealing damage while slowing the enemy and hasting yourself is something good; the problem relies on you being probably hasted by other sources, like Shout, Divine Guardian, Mighty Guard VIII, or any common hastega source. By using those, the utility of Mug Time decays. In that case, it is probably better to use Tempo Flurry, since it is easily honable and deals decent damage. Once the enemy is slowed, Dismissal is the best ability that Celerity users can use to Stun the enemy (at the moment). **Some elites where you could apply it**: basically against every boss vulnerable to slow. ------------------------------------------------- ****The C L A S S I C**** - Thief's Revenge - Damage/Utility (depending on your Thief's Revenge's honing) Rikku (as Yuffie) can achieve the speed required for Thief's Revenge to deal 5 hits. She can reach it at level 65 in a FFX realm and in every realm once you get her MC2 and get to a certain level which I do not know. What I do know is that she is one of the fastest characters of the game, tied up with a bunch at 174 speed at level 80. Thief's Revenge requires of a decent-honed damage ability to be completely efficient, since you want to save up as many uses as you can for the final stage of an ultimate (because it is then when the boss usually goes nuts). If you have it at R1/R2, it is good to have a R3/R4 Dismissal/Tempo Flurry/Quick Hit/Machinist ability by its side. If you have it at R3+, you might carry it with more utility-oriented abilities like Machinist abilities/dancer breakdowns[JP!]/bard's protectga or shellga. ------------------------------------------------ ****Muk is underrated**** - Bio Grenade - Damage/Utility (depending on your Bio Grenade's honing) Bio Grenade is an AOE two-hit (1,20 each) Poison-enhanced 5* Machinist ability that has a 20% chance of Poisoning the enemy (we get it by clearing the ""Two Sides of the Same Coin"" event's +++ battle, coming to global in June). However, we would not be taking this ability for that chance of inflicting poison (as Poison Shell would be just better in that case). We would use it to exploit the enemy's weakness to Poison, which would result in a 4,80 damage multiplier (2,40 x 2). That's really good damage for a physical two-hit AOE ability. You could be able to deal 20k by cast with the appropiate buffs and debuffs. An R2 could be doing 80k. The second ability would honestly depend on your exact team composition and needs. You can use the ones mentioned above. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Yeti's Cave (FFVI), Galbadia Garden 2 (FFVIII), Galbadia Garden 3 (FFVIII). **Future ultimates where this setup could be useful**: Two Sides of the Same Coin's Ultimate + battle (Vargas is weak to poison). ------------------------------------------------ ****Glitched**** (Long-time planning) - Northern Cross - Dismissal Northern Cross is a two-hit 6* Celerity ability that has a 51% chance of Stunning and Stopping the enemy. Honing a 6* ability is, obviously, pretty hard. However, as you already know, the R2 + R4/R5 combo works pretty well. The idea of this setup is to keep the boss stunned most of the times, so it can not unleash scary attacks. The Northern Cross uses would be saved for those stages of the fight, since it has a double chance of stunning (compared to Dismissal). ------------------------------------------------ ****The perfect machina**** (Relic-dependant) - Faultsiphon - Damage/Utility (depending on the boss you are facing) ""Why is this setup even special?"" Some of you might have one of Rikku's SB. If you are facing a boss where you need to act fast, Faultsiphon is a great ability to have, since it grants cast speed x999 for 1 turn, which means that your next action will be instant-casted. So, if you know that something dangerous is coming, you can unleash your SB with no cast time. The perfect ability to use with Faultsiphon would be Full Charge, but Rikku is not able to use it. Which ability could you use with this setup? I would recommend a Machinist ability if you are facing a boss with a status vulnerability, since your main action would be applying that status as many times as possible (meaning that you will not be using Faultsiphon that often, which allows you to use it even at R1). If the enemy does not have any vulnerabilities, you can always use the famous Dismissal. ------------------------------------------------ **VULNERABILITY SETUPS** The setups below are completely focused on inflicting the enemy with a certain status effect. Rikku can inflict a total of 8 status: Slow, Stun (both mentioned above), Poison, Confuse, Silence, Paralysis, Stop (which will not have a dedicated setup) and Sleep (in Utility setups). However, thanks to her access to Machinist abilities, she is able to deal great damages while doing it, which makes her a perfect asset if you are on the need. ------------------------------------------------ ****Don't drink that wine!**** - Poison Shell - Steal Defense/Steal Power/Dance Breakdown[JP!] Machinist abilities are plain awesome. Leaving aside that they can be used by a pretty decent amount of characters (Tyro, Edgar, Setzer, Cid, Laguna, Rikku, Balthier, Sazh, Mustadio, Barret,Zidane), they do great damage! Just so you can get an idea of how damaging these abilities are, let's do some maths! Imagine that we are facing Leblanc in the ultimate with Ormi and Logos. She had 500 DEF and was vulnerable to poison. Our level 65 Rikku is equipping the Celebration Blade, a 4* FFX Bangle and the FFX Muscular Belt, which leaves her with a pumping 384 ATK. Rikku uses Poison Shell on Leblanc (without any kind of buffs, debuffs or RM action). She would deal 3.9k on the first hit and 4.9k on the following ones (since Machinist abilities go to 2.4 from a 1.9 multiplier if the enemy already has the status inflicted). That's ~30k total damage on a R3 Poison Shell, without any kind of buffs or debuffs applied. You can imagine how high goes the damage if we use Full Break + Shout, for example. As you would not be needing any more damage on her, you could spare the second slot on utility, like Steal Defense, Steal Power (if you are not using Shout or any Boostga), Bard's Protectga/Shellga or a dance breakdown[JP!]. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Lake Dohr (FFIII), Phoenix Cave (FFVI), Narshe 1 (FFVI), Yeti's Cave (FFVI), Ancient Castle (FFVI), Whirlwind Maze (FFVII), Shinra No. 26 (FFVII), Ipsen's Castle (FFIX), Mt. Gagazet 2 (FFX), Mt. Gagazet Cavern (FFX), Fifth Ark 2 (FFXIII). **Future ultimates where this setup could be useful**: Twin Stars of Mysidia's Ultimate + battle (Cagnazzo), Two Faces of the Same Coin's Ultimate + battle (Vargas and Ipoohs), Return of the Hero's Ultimate battle (all of the Turks are vulnerable to Poison). -------------------------------------------------- ****Psy-y-y**** - Confuse Shell - Steal Defense/Steal Power/Dance Breakdown[JP!] It is kind of weird to face bosses that are vulnerable to Confuse. However, Confuse Shell is one of the best abilities to do it (even though it would be great if it was MAG based instead of PHY, since PHY attacks remove the status). If you use Confuse Shell (confusing the enemy) and then use it again, having the chance of removing it, it would still be worth it due to the ATB reset, which would work like a longer Dismissal. But yeah, it is weird for bosses to be vulnerable to it nowadays. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Death Valley (FFV), Cultists' Tower 1 (FFVI), Narshe 1 (FFVI). **Future ultimates where this setup could be useful**: Consorting with Sky Pirates' Ultimate battle (in like 10-14 days I believe?). -------------------------------------------------- ****Pretty much shocked**** - Silence Shell - Steal Defense/Steal Power/Dance Breakdown[JP!] This setup is completely the same as the two mentioned above, but there is something that I need to say: a 100 MND Rikku's Silence would last only 5 seconds less than a 300 MND user's Silence. I know that those 5 seconds can be crucial in some fights but, being fair, you will not get a great damage output by carrying Silenceaga over. Also, you would be using Silence Shell constantly, so you might not even see the status going away during the whole battle. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Narshe 1 (FFVI), Balamb (FFVIII), Galbadia Garden 2 (FFVIII), Ipsen's Castle (FFIX), Mt. Gagazet 2 (FFX), Tomb of Raithwall 1 (FFXII). -------------------------------------------------- ****Changing the furniture's distribution so you trip everywhere**** - Blind Shell - Steal Defense/Steal Power/Dance Breakdown[JP!] Setup explained on the ones above. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Istory Falls (FFV), Mobliz, Part 2 (FFVI), Kefka's Tower Part 1 (FFVI), Stilshrine of Miriam (FFXII). **Future ultimates where this setup could be useful**: Broken Chains's Ultimate battle (Raijin and Fujin), Twin Stars of Mysidia's Ultimate + battle (Cagnazzo), Two Faces of the Same Coin's Ultimate + battle (Vargas) ------------------------------------------------- ****The red wedding**** - Intimidate/Paralyzing Shot - Damage/Debuff The reason why I didn't discard Intimidate is that it has a double proc chance than Paralyzing Shout (50 vs 25), key if you want to keep the enemy paralyzed at all cost. If you are spamming the paralyze constantly, you might not need a damage ability. However, if your objective is a medal condition or a specific part of the fight, you could take one of the damage abilities that we have already mentioned on the Damage Setups section and leave it be. Just for comparison's sake, a 100 MND Rikku's Paralyze would last 4 seconds less than a 300 MND user's Paralyze. **Some elites where you could apply it**: Guardian Tree (FFV), Kefka's Tower, Part 2 (FFVI), Shinra No 26 (FFVII). ------------------------------------------------- **UTILITY SETUPS** The setups mentioned below are focused on providing the team with utility. This utility can be: party buffs, enemy debuffs or party-damage setups (Sleep). Even though it is great to deal damage with every character on your team, sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice one's damage to benefit the party's. These setups are examples of it. ------------------------------------------------- ****This guy is boosted...**** - Spellbend/Enveloping Etude - Damage/Debuff I am pretty sure that you all have faced those stupid hybrid-bosses that deal damage of every kind. In those fights, you need both Protectga and Shellga. Your white mage would probably be carrying one of them but, what about the other one? Spellbend and Eveloping Etude are the Bard versions of Shellga and Protectga. A 100 MND Rikku's Spellbend Etude would last 38 seconds, versus the 44s that lasts a 300 MND User's Shellga. As you can see, it is not that significant, since it is easily honable. It is a great alternative. About the second ability, depends on your team's needs. You might need a dancer breakdown [JP!] to maximize your party's overall damage. If not, you can always get one of the damage abilities that we have already mentioned so many times. ------------------------------------------------- ****I am here to help!**** [JP!] - Mana's Paen/Lullaby - Stumble Step[JP!] I have used this setup so many times with my mage teams while catching up with the latest DUs that I can not even count them. The choice between Mana's Paen (MAG +15% to all allies during 25 seconds) and Lullaby (20% Sleep) relies on your team's damage and the enemy's damage. If you do not care about the enemy's damage, bring Mana's Paen and watch them destroy whoever is in front; if you do care about the enemy's damage and they are vulnerable to Sleep, bring Lullaby. Stumble Step[JP!] is the best ability to bring with those mentioned, since it can maximize your damage, specially if you are bringing summons. **Some elites where you could inflict Sleep**: Death Valley (FFV), Guardian Tree (FFV), Island Shrine (FFV), Cultist's Tower 1 (FFVI), Yeti's Cave (FFVI), Opera House 2 (FFVI), Ipsen's Castle (FFIX), Shrines of Ipsen (FFIX). ------------------------------------------------- ****Classic Support**** [JP!] - Multi Break[JP!] - Exhausting Polka/Heathen Frolic Sarabande[JP!] This is the standard enemy debuffing setup that you should bring against AOE hard fights. We will not be able to do this until Rikku gets the Dancer buff, as I have marked with the [JP!] signs, but it is something to consider while looking to Rikku in the long run. ------------------------------------------------- ****Ultimate Debuff**** (Long-time planning) - Mug Morale - Steal Defense/Power Mug Morale is a 6* Thief ability that lowers the enemy's ATK and DEF by -20% for 20 seconds and buffs the thief's ATK and DEF by +20% for 20 seconds. And, the most important thing, STACKS WITH FULL BREAK. This meaning that you can stack Mug Morale + Full Break + Power/Armor Breakdown or Steal Defense/Power. Let's do some maths! If we use Full Break + Breakdown on an enemy, we get a 58% debuff (29% if resisted). If we use Mug Morale + Full Break + Power/Armor Breakdown or Steal Defense/Power, we get a 66% debuff (33% if resisted). 8% more debuff, while buffing the ally and doing good damage, since it has a 3.20 damage multiplier. Some people may think that it is not worth it, but if you take into account that some of the future ultimate bosses (like Vargas in Two Sides of the Same Coin or Braska's Final Aeon in The Truth about 10 years ago) have powerful attacks that ignore the party's DEF, you do note that every enemy's ATK debuff is worth it. However, we face the same problem: honing 6* abilities is hard. That's why you should take this setup as something that could occur in like 8 months, or so (depending on the player's addiction to grinding, obviously). -------------------------------------------------- Aaaaaaaaaaaand, that's it! - Did you find this useful? If so, which character would you be interested to read about? - This is so long that it probably has some mistakes: do you see any? Let me know! - Which is your favourite setup? Did I forgot a cool one? Thank you for reading!"

A basic autoattack and vulnerability to nearly every status including Petrify. I'm pretty sure you can beat him with a newbie party using autoattack. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 2: Kefka** ###**Boss:** Kefka **Boss HP:** 8,778 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Kefka without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Weak| | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow, Stop, Stun **Moveset:** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Blizzara (deal moderate magical ice damage to one target) * Thundera (deal magical thunder damage to all targets) * Poison (Poison all targets) * Drain (deal heavy magical dark damage, recovering HP proportional to the damage dealt) * Confuse (Confuse one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Use a RW if you have to. Any will do. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 3: Judge Gabranth** ###**Boss:** Judge Gabranth **Boss HP:** 12,159 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Judge Gabranth without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Weak| | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow, Stun **Moveset (Default):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Protect (grant Protect to self) * Kick (deal physical damage to one target) * Judge Cloak (deal physical damage to all targets) * Sentence (deal physical damage twice to one target, ignoring Retaliate) * Body Blow (deal physical damage to one target) **Moveset (Default):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Judge Cloak (deal physical damage to all targets) * Sentence (deal physical damage twice to one target, ignoring Retaliate) * Body Blow (deal physical damage to one target) * Exaction (deal ranged physical damage to all targets, ignoring Retaliate) * Full MBarrier (grants Invincibility to self for a limited time) **Notes and Strategies:** Judge Gabranth starts the fight under Haste status. Not sure how/when Full MBarrier triggers because I one-shot him with Saint's Cross. If you want to similarly avoid having to deal with the fight, bring a holy damage RW like Paladin Cecil's BSB. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 4: Golbez** ###**Boss:** Golbez &amp; Shadow Dragon **Boss HP:** 29,453 (Golbez) | 14,727 (Shadow Dragon) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Golbez without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances (Golbez):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak^1|Weak^1|Weak^1| | | |Weak| | **Elemental Resistances (Shadow Dragon):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Weak| | ^1 : Golbez shifts between elemental weaknesses randomly. He is only ever weak to one of Fire, Ice, and Thunder, and when he isn't weak to an element he's neutral to it. **Status Vulnerabilities (all):** Stun **Moveset (Golbez):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Fira (deal moderate magical fire damage to one target) * Blizzara (deal moderate magical ice damage to one target) * Thundara (deal moderate magical thunder damage to one target) * Drain (deal heavy magical dark damage to one target, recovering HP proportional to the damage dealt) * Bio (deal moderate magical bio damage to one target) * Binding Cold (Paralyze all targets) **Moveset (Shadow Dragon):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Black Fang (Instantly Kill one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Once again, Paladin Cecil BSB will one-shot this encounter. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 5: Exdeath** ###**Boss:** Exdeath **Boss HP:** 106,123 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Exdeath without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Weak| |Null **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stun **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Default):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Vacuum Wave (deal moderate ranged physical damage to and Sap one target) * Bio (deal moderate magical bio damage to one target) * Gravity (deal damage to one target, proportional to its current HP) * Doom (Doom one target) * Earthshaker (deal moderate magical earth damage to all targets) * Flame (deal damage to all targets, proportional to their current HP) * Hurricane (deal damage to one target, proportional to its current HP) **Moveset (Weak):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Vacuum Wave (deal moderate ranged physical damage to and Sap one target) * Earthshaker (deal moderate magical earth damage to all targets) * Firaga (deal heavy magical fire damage to one target) * Blizzaga (deal heavy magical ice damage to one target) * Thundaga (deal heavy magical thunder damage to one target) * Counter Dispel (activates in response to any attack; Dispel one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Exdeath switches to Weak state at 50% HP. A significant portion of Exdeath's damage comes from single target spells, so you might want to use Carbuncle or Lure Magic + Reflect. He does still have Vacuum Wave and Earthshaker to kill people under Reflect, and Counter Dispel to remove Reflect, so that's not a perfect defense. Break his magic and bring a wall and you should do fine, however. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 6: Kuja** ###**Boss:** Kuja **Boss HP:** 129,356 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Kuja without being KO'd. Reduce Kuja's magic. Exploit Kuja's weakness to holy attacks. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Weak| | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stun **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset:** * Thundaga (deal heavy magical thunder damage to one target) * Thundaga (deal magical thunder damage to all targets) * Flare Star (deal moderate magical non-elemental damage to all targets) * Ultima (reduce all targets to 1 HP) **Notes and Strategies:** Kuja uses Ultima as an interrupt when killed. If all living targets are under Reflect status, Kuja will always use Flare Star. If you're worried about this fight, bring thunder resistance accessories/armor, since the majority of his damage output is thunder damage. 100% of his damage is magical, so load up in that regard. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 7: Sephiroth** ###**Boss:** Sephiroth **Boss HP:** 195,181 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Sephiroth without being KO'd. Reduce Sephiroth's attack. Exploit Sephiroth's weakness to holy attacks. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Holy| | **Status Vulnerabilities:** None. **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset:** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Iaido Strike (deal physical damage twice to random targets) * Hachikatana Issen (deal heavy physical damage to one target, ignoring Retaliate) * Shadow Flare (deal heavy physical damage to one target, ignoring Retaliate) * Prison (deal heavy physical damage to all targets) * Counter Flash (activates in response to any attack; deal moderate physical damage to one target and grant Haste to self) **Notes and Strategies:** Draw Fire + Retaliate will keep Counter Flash from Hasting Sephiroth, so if you're worried about that, it's a much stronger strategy than trying to keep Dispelling it. Either way, Seph's damage output is 100% physical, so remove all those magic breaks from the last fight and switch them to power breaks for this one. --- &amp;nbsp; ##** Braska's Final Aeon** ###**Boss:**  Braska's Final Aeon Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Default|140|262,072|666|1000|364|1664|210|500 OVERDRIVE| | |296|1000|364|1664|210|500 Weak / Weak OVERDRIVE| | |720|1125|364|1664|210|550 **Medal Conditions:** Reduce  Braska's Final Aeon's attack. Reduce  Braska's Final Aeon's defense. Exploit  Braska's Final Aeon's weakness to holy attacks. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Holy| | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stun **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Default):** * 1% chance: Attack (deal 110% physical damage to one target) * 24% chance, unlocks turn 3: Attack (deal 190% physical damage to one target) * 30% chance, unlocks turn 3: Jecht Beam (deal 450% magical non-elemental damage to one target, ignoring Reflect) * 45% chance, unlocks turn 3: Cleave (deal 150% physical damage to all targets with an 18% chance to Slow them, ignoring Retaliate) **Moveset (OVERDRIVE):** * 100% chance: Jecht Finger (deal ???% physical damage twice to one target, ignoring defense and Retaliate) **Moveset (Weak):** * 30% chance: Jecht Bomber (deal 200% physical damage to all targets, ignoring defense and Retaliate) * 30% chance: Jecht Beam (deal 450% magical non-elemental damage to one target, ignoring Reflect) * 30% chance: Cleave (deal 150% physical damage to all targets with an 18% chance to Slow them, ignoring Retaliate) **Moveset (Weak OVERDRIVE):** * 100% chance: True Jecht Shot (deal 375% physical damage to all targets, ignoring defense and Retaliate) **Videos:** [Quest Master Clear](URL **Notes and Strategies:** BFA switches to Weak phase at 50% HP. BFA charges his Overdrive meter whenever he attacks or takes damage, and when its full he enters the OVERDRIVE mode appropriate to his current phase. He uses Jecht Finger or True Jecht Shot on his next turn, then returns to the appropriate non-OVERDRIVE mode. Bring lots of physical mitigation for this fight. While he does cast Jecht Beam fairly frequently, it's not actually that strong thanks to this version of BFA's weak Magic stat (364). All of his other attacks are physical, and the two most dangerous ones (Jecht Bomber and True Jecht Shot) ignore defense completely, so bring both Full Break and Power Breakdown. If you have a Power+Magic Break SB, bring that too. BFA is weak to holy, so Saint's Cross and Paladin Cecil's BSB tear him to shreds. **Event Quest Notes:** Tidus doesn't really contribute anything special to this fight, but a Paladin Cecil BSB RW will. Even more so than in the + fight, Cecil is the ideal RW for this one. So much of his damage ignores defense that a Wall isn't super important, and his weakness to holy makes the burst attacks devastating to him. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**+ Evil Warrior and Majin** ###**Boss:** + Garland &amp; + Golbez Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Garland|160|159,579|705|1651|673|2040|445|450 Golbez|160|154,418|596|1584|813|2165|105|450 **Medal Conditions:** Reduce + Garland's attack. Reduce + Golbez's magic.

Golbez switches between elemental weaknesses randomly. I strongly recommend focus firing Golbez first, as you really don't want him around while Garland is doing his Soul of Chaos spam (7x190% physical damage is quite a lot). Golbez is all magic damage but Garland has a hefty physical arsenal throughout the fight, so bring mixed mitigation. I'd recommend keeping Garland Power Broken/Stolen while you deal with Golbez if you can spare the ability slot. Magic Lure + Reflect can help keep Golbez's offense under control (and if his reflected -gas hit himself, he'll deal about 6k damage to himself via his weakness). **Event Quest Notes:** Paladin Cecil's BSB is the star of the show here. Since synergy for this event works like Abyss final bosses in that everything PCecil equips will have synergy, every random RW Cecil will have godly stats and will likely deal 30k+ damage with just the initial cast. Your own character who gets the burst command will then have a double holy AOE attack which will wreck both Garland and Golbez. Saint's Cross is also very good, of course. Do be cautious not to push Garland into Very Weak phase until you kill Golbez, though. "

But what's the right level boost to factor in for an enemy's vulnerability? If there's a holy-vulnerable boss by itself, how much level equivalent boost would cecil (3x single target Saint's Fall) get vs cloud (3x aoe hit Blade Beam)? I know that a single hit from some abilities does more damage than others (8x hits from Zach aren't really big hits). Sometimes there are words like ""massive"" or ""powerful"" hits that seem to denote this, but it doesn't seem like the game uses these adjectives consistently. Is there a good way to deal with this other than trying out the abilities and getting a feel for it?"
247,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,New to summoning and have a very important Question regarding the minimum damages so I can finally (hopefully) get this SINful bastardmut championed,0,49hfn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/49hfn9/new_to_summoning_and_have_a_very_important/,2016-03-08 18:33:23,"Regarding in this case specifically phoenix but it could be shiva for all I care for what my case is this time: So, it says the minimum damage on this 8.0x potency also has a 2200 minimum damage as per enler's datasheet but am curious does that still get doubled for hitting fire weakness so is actually 4400 for my no MAG tyro retaliator? What does my magic have to be to get past whichever one it is? Will elemental weapon boosts affect it or are these raw minimums? and so I went to use ElNino's calculator to play with some figures to see where my MAG has to be to get past that minimum vs the dogs with absolutely nothing fancy happening, just with a very low MAG. But when I have all of the values inputted correctly including the 2200 minimum, the output is telling me my new summon specific minimum (not my real min/max damage, they are listed correctly) is a figure around 600 less than the 2200 and so altered some things and it seems the only thing that alters that number is targets RES. So the minimums aren't actually minimums? And how does elemental vulnerability factor in to the minimums? HELP!!"

Try the [megathread](URL #**Event Quests:** * Beat + Last Will with a party consisting of only FF13 synergy characters. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 1&amp;6: ?Hero of the Bewildering Ordeal?** ###**Boss:** Shiva Nix &amp; Shiva Styria **Boss HP:** 2,959 (Classic) | 45,996 (Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Shiva without being KO'd. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stun **Moveset:** * Wheel Rap (deal physical damage to one target) * Wheel Toss (deal physical damage four times to one target) * Wheel Grind (deal physical damage four times to one target) * Pirouette (deal physical damage four times to one target) * Blizzara (deal magical ice damage to all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** Shiva casts Doom on all targets as an interrupt as soon as the fight starts. Draw Fire + Retaliate almost completely chumps this one. Their Blizzara is fairly rare though and shouldn't pose a large problem. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 2&amp;7: ?Light Fell in the Darkness of Anxiety?** ###**Boss:** Odin **Boss HP:** 5,678 (Classic) | 71,835 (Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Odin without being KO'd. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stun **Moveset:** * Thundara (deal moderate magical thunder damage to all targets) * Flourish of Steel (deal physical damage four times to one target) * Skyward Swing (deal physical damage three times to one target) * Seismic Strike (deal physical damage to all targets) * Crushing Blow (deal physical damage to all targets) * Ullr's Shield (grant Protect and Shell to self) **Notes and Strategies:** Odin casts Doom on all targets as an interrupt as soon as the fight starts. Second verse, same as the first; although Odin has more AOEs, he's still pretty vulnerable to Draw Fire + Retaliate shenanigans. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 3&amp;8: Fight for a Dream** ###**Boss:** Cid Raines **Boss HP:** 10,273 (Classic) | 92,602 (Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Cid Raines without being KO'd. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Slow, Blind, Stun **Moveset (Attack Shift):** * Attack (deal physical damage five times to one target) * Ruin (deal magical non-elemental damage to one target) * Ruinga (deal magical non-elemental damage to all targets) * Heal Shift (changes to Heal Shift state) * Defense Shift (changes to Defense Shift state) * Doom (Doom one target) **Moveset (Defense Shift):** * Heal Shift (changes to Heal Shift state) * Attack Shift (changes to Attack Shift state) **Moveset (Heal Shift):** * Cure (recover HP) * Esuna (remove status effects from self) * Dispel (remove status effects from all targets) * Attack Shift (changes to Attack Shift state) * Defense Shift (changes to Defense Shift state) **Moveset (Metamorphosis):** * Attack (deal physical damage four times to one target) * Bioga (deal heavy magical bio damage to all targets) * Ruin (deal magical non-elemental damage to one target) * Ruinga (deal magical non-elemental damage to all targets) * Doom (Doom one target) * Dazega (deal heavy magical non-elemental damage to and Sleep all targets) * Protect (grant Protect to self) * Shell (grant Shell to self) * Curasa (recover lots of HP) * Seraphic Ray (deal massive magical non-elemental damage to all targets and remove their status effects) **Notes and Strategies:** Cid switches to Metamorphosis state at a specific HP threshold. Cid is actually vulnerable to a couple key status effects (Poison, Slow, Blind), and if you can hit him hard enough he won't have time to switch to Heal Shift state and Esuna himself before he goes into Metamorphosis. His damage is mixed, leaning more heavily on magic, but be aware of his multiple AOE Dispels before you invest too heavily into buffs. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 4&amp;9: ** ###**Boss:** Bahamut **Boss HP:** 22,606 (Classic) | 116,016 (Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Bahamut without being KO'd. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stop, Stun **Moveset:** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Dragon Claws (deal moderate physical damage to one target) * Inferno (deal very heavy magical non-elemental damage to all targets) * Whirlwind (deal moderate physical damage to one target) * Umbral Vise (deal very heavy physical damage to one target) * Ignis (deal heavy magical non-elemental damage to all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** Bahamut casts Doom on all targets as an interrupt as soon as the fight starts. Bahamut's damage is pretty well-mixed, so bring both types of mitigation, or magical mitigation plus Draw Fire + Retaliate; all his physical attacks are single target. He's also vulnerable to Stop if you wish to pursue that avenue. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 5&amp;10: ?Hope Chased by Fear?** ###**Boss:** Alexander **Boss HP:** 31,414 (Classic) | 148,206 (Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Alexander without being KO'd. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Silence, Stun **Moveset:** * Steelcrusher (deal physical damage to one target) * Soaring Uppercut (deal moderate physical damage to one target) * Obliterator (deal heavy physical damage to one target) * Blast Punch (deal moderate physical damage to all targets) * Explosive Fist (deal heavy physical damage to all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** Alexander casts Doom on all targets as an interrupt as soon as the fight starts. Ignore Alex's vulnerability to Silence unless you really want to bring Silence Shell for the damage bonus. Anyway, his damage is 100% physical, but it's largely AOE-based so while Draw Fire + Retaliate will work here, it's not going to be enough by itself. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX Pulse Fal'cie** ###**Boss:** Wight &amp; Ghast **Boss HP:** 66,380 each **Medal Conditions:** Defeat the bosses without being KO'd. Exploit Ghast's weakness to thunder attacks. **Elemental Resistances (Ghast):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak|Weak|Weak| |Weak|Weak| | | **Status Vulnerabilities (All):** Poison, Sleep, Stun **Break Resistances (All):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Wight):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Whirlwind Cut (deal physical wind damage to one target, ignoring Retaliate) * Whirlwind Cut (deal physical wind damage to all targets, ignoring Retaliate) **Moveset (Ghast):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Fire (deal magical fire damage to one target) * Fira (deal magical fire damage to all targets) ###**Boss:** Fal'cie Anima **Boss HP:** 84,983 (Anima) | 20,746 each (Arms) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Anima without being KO'd. Reduce Anima's attack. **Status Vulnerabilities (All):** Stun **Break Resistances (All):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Anima):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Counter Attack (activates in response to any attack; deal physical damage to one target) * Regrow Arms (revive both arms) **Moveset (Arms):** * Attack (deal moderate physical damage to one target) * Attack (deal heavy physical damage to all targets) * Resonant Magic (deal magical non-elemental damage to all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** The Wight/Ghast fight is nothing special, just a glorified trash encounter really. You can Sleep them with a mage team if you really want to. Anima can't do anything to you through Draw Fire + Retaliate if you kill both his arms and keep them dead, but it might be a better idea to just burn the main body down ASAP. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX+ ** ###**Boss:** Barthandelus **Boss HP:** 115,948 (Barthandelus) | 43,987 each (Pauldrons &amp; Ailette) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Barthandelus without being KO'd. Reduce the Ailette or Pauldron's magic. Reduce Barthandelus's magic. **Elemental Resistances (Ailette):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak|Absorb|Weak|Resist|Resist|Absorb|Resist|Resist|Resist **Elemental Resistances (Pauldrons):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Absorb|Weak|Absorb|Resist|Resist|Weak|Resist|Resist|Resist **Status Vulnerabilities (Barthandelus, Parts Alive):** Stun **Status Vulnerabilities (Barthandelus, Parts Dead):** Slow, Stop, Sap, Stun **Status Vulnerabilities (Parts):** Poison, Paralyze, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sleep, Sap, Stun **Break Resistances (all):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Ailette, normal):** * Blizzard (deal magical ice damage to one target) * Water (deal magical water damage to one target) **Moveset (Ailette, amped once):** * Blizzara (deal moderate magical ice damage to all targets) * Watera (deal moderate magical water damage to one target) **Moveset (Ailette, amped twice):** * Blizzaga (deal magical ice damage to all targets) * Waterga (deal magical water damage to one target) **Moveset (Pauldrons, normal):** * Fire (deal magical fire damage to one target) * Thunder (deal magical thunder damage to one target) **Moveset (Pauldrons, amped once):** * Fira (deal magical fire damage to all targets) * Thundara (deal moderate magical thunder damage to one target) **Moveset (Pauldrons, amped twice):** * Firaga (deal magical fire damage to all targets) * Thundaga (deal magical thunder damage to all targets) **Moveset (Barthandelus, normal):** * Enchanted Veil (grant Protect and Shell to one target) * Mystic Aura (grant Haste to and raise one target's magic) **Moveset (Barthandelus, unarmored):** * Ruinga (deal heavy magical non-elemental damage to one target) * Baptism in Ruin (deal magical non-elemental damage three times to one target) * Thanatosian Smile (deal moderate ranged physical damage to all targets, ignoring Retaliate) * Destrudo (deal moderate magical non-elemental damage to all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** Barthandelus casts Doom on all targets as an interrupt when both of his parts are destroyed. This is the standard version of Bart, with some status vulnerabilities added for spice. The Pauldrons and Ailette can be Paralyzed, Slept, Slowed, and even Poisoned although that's not very useful on enemies with only 40k HP, and Bart himself can be Slowed, Stopped, and Sapped. The damage in this fight is very nearly entirely magical, so bring heavy magical mitigation including Shellga. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX++ ** ###**Boss:** Brynhildr **Boss HP:** 201,712 **Medal Conditions:** Exploit Brynhildr's weakness to ice attacks. Reduce Brynhildr's attack. Reduce Brynhildr's magic. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Absorb|Weak| | | | | | | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stun **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset:** * Slash (deal physical damage to all targets) * Valkyrian Scythe (deal physical damage three times to random targets) * Gunshot (deal ranged physical damage six times to random targets) * Pyroshot (deal magical fire damage to one target, ignoring Reflect) * Pyroburst (deal magical fire damage to all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** Brynhildr casts Doom on all targets as an interrupt as soon as the fight starts. Draw Fire + Retaliate will help against her two multi-hit attacks but do nothing to her magical attacks or to Slash. Bring mixed mitigation and be prepared for her to hit hard and fast. Do note that there is (very unusually for a pre-Ultimate fight) no ""Do not die"" medal condition on this one. Brynhildr's speed is only 300, but it appears that all of her attacks come out as interrupts, so her apparent speed is much higher. Expect to be attacked multiple times before you can get a wall up. --- &amp;nbsp; ##** ** ###**Boss:**  Hecatoncheir Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Default|140|237,895|579|944|553|1554|377|650 Revenge Style 1&amp;2| | |579|944|553|1554|377|600 **Medal Conditions:** Reduce  Hecatoncheires's attack. Reduce  Hecatoncheires's defense. Reduce  Hecatoncheires's resistance. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stun **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Default):** * 100% chance: Looming Wrath (enter Revenge Style 1 state) **Moveset (Revenge Style 1):** * 50% chance: Quake (deal 210% magical earth damage to all targets) * 50% chance: Pummel (deal 110% physical damage to one target) * Special: Aerial Tackle (deal 190% physical damage to one target) * Special: Hurricane Kick (deal 150% physical damage to one target) **Moveset (Revenge Style 2):** * 50% chance: Counter (deal 190% physical damage to all targets, ignoring Retaliate) * 50% chance: Force Projection (deal 190% physical damage to one target, ignoring Retaliate) **Videos:** [Master Clear]() **Notes and Strategies:** Hecatoncheir casts Doom on all targets as an interrupt when the fight starts. Hecatoncheir has a very strict AI pattern which he follows exclusively. On his first turn, he will always use Looming Wrath. On his second turn, he will either use Quake followed by either Aerial Tackle or Hurricane Kick as an interrupt or Pummel plus both Aerial Tackle and Hurricane Kick as interrupts. On his third turn, he will use either Counter or Force Projection. Repeat the whole sequence until either you or he is dead. Most of his damage is physical, so pack Protectga and physical breaks, but be aware of the possibility of casting Quake. He's fast enough that it's entirely possible for him use Looming Wrath -&gt; Quake+Aerial Tackle and kill someone before you can get your defenses up. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**+ Last Will** ###**Boss:** + Cid Raines Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Default|160|272,155|607|1217|700|2037|475|500 Weak| | |637|1217|730|2037|475|500 Very Weak| | |667|1217|760|2037|475|500 **Medal Conditions:** Reduce + Cid Raines's magic.

He switches to Weak and Very Weak states at specific HP thresholds (~66% and ~33%). Cid casts Seraphic Ray as an interrupt when he enters Very Weak state. Cid always casts Shell on his first turn and Protect on his second turn. There's a fair bit of RNG to this fight, so fair warning. It's much easier if the 1/3 of his turns he spends casting Cure, Protect, or Shell come at the right times for you, and much harder if they come at the wrong times. That said, bring heavy magic mitigation to this fight because, while his basic attack is actually pretty nasty (404% damage total when a ""heavy"" physical attack is 190% and a ""massive"" one is 230%), he uses offensive magic much more often. If you're not bringing a quest party you can use Draw Fire + Retaliate on his Attack, or you can just have everyone in the back row since it's not a long-range attack. Be careful with how much damage you do once you get him to about 50%, because the instant you deal enough damage to push him into Very Weak state (around 1/3 his HP or roughly the area of his back foot) he'll use Seraphic Ray as an interrupt and Dispel all your buffs. I don't think it's an Ultimate Dispel but don't quote me on that. Winning the fight mostly revolves around managing Seraphic Ray -- if you can trigger it and get your defenses up and everyone healed before he gets his next turn, you'll almost certainly win. **Event Quest Notes:** You can't use Draw Fire + Retaliate to manage his physical attacks but that's no big deal. If you want you can have Snow tank it up in the back row with Draw Fire but that'll probably cost you too much in damage, and using Draw Fire from the front row will probably get him killed. I suggest having Hope carry your Shellga so Vanille can use an AOE heal as soon as Seraphic Ray is triggered and you can still get your Shellga off. Shout works very well as a RW for this fight, though if you have your own hastega, his defenses are low enough that you can probably manage with a wall RW, and he has no defense-piercing attacks either.

250,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Cid's Guide to Pulling Relics: Part 2 - Fragment Dungeon - Ifrit (FFVIII),52,4b324i,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4b324i/cids_guide_to_pulling_relics_part_2_fragment/,2016-03-20 00:19:20,"I was pondering over how I'd actually write up guides for Cid's Mission. Originally I intended to go for specific boss guides, but I feel my general guide to honing and gearing should be sufficient. Then I thought about going realm specific, and it's just actually way too long (FFVI and FFVII will be the death of me). I've decided that instead of focusing on the specific ones, I'll just focus on the hardest ones in the game - the outliers if you will. *Small disclaimer: I have not actually beaten them myself in JP. I have however, tried various setups and I have a good general feel of what I was lacking to complete them. So this could be more insightful rather than general.* *Another small disclaimer: please don't chase the dragon when it comes to these relics. Consider whether the completion of this quest is worth the investment, before you decide to invest in it, and set a limit for yourself on how much you want to spend. Please spend responsibly, everyone!* [Here](URL a short general guide to Cid's Missions (hereby dubbed Part 1. It's badly named, and maybe I'll revise it at some point, like repost it with a better name or something, but it'll have to do for now). Let's begin with the very first one in the series - Ifrit! Credits goes to /u/Zurai001 for the boss' general guide [here](URL ______________________________ ###Part 1: What You Want To Know About the Fight Let's start first by deciding exactly what skills, and general strategy you'll want to use to beat Ifrit. Necessary: * **Hastega**: Ifrit is fast. VERY fast. You will want a Hastega to keep up with his speed. He'll likely hit your party 3 times before you even get your first RW cast off. * **Protectga**: One of Ifrit's most powerful attacks is 4-Attack. This hits a front-row character for 2.6k damage without any mitigation. Four times. It is random target, but it can hit the same character. Multiple times. * **Shellga**: Probably another given. Ifrit has access to the very powerful Meteor and Firaja spells. * **A minimum Cura-level (h55) AoE heal**: This means that shared AoE heals will not work. There's a lot of AoE healing required here, and anything that's Cure level (h35) is not going to be enough. * **Magic Breakdown, Power Breakdown**: Standard mitigation. Ifrit's MAG is actually over the softcap for enemies, so Magic Breakdown will still be a strong option, but it won't reduce as much damage as you'd think. * **Fire-resistance accessories**: At this stage in JP, it was quite easy to outfit your party with Fire-resistance accessories. Aside for the 6\* Inferno Bangle from one of the Abyss dungeon gatekeeper rewards (which has a 50% reduction to Fire-elemental damage taken), every other Fire-resist accessory should give you about 30% resistance. * **Ice-elemental attacks**: Goes without saying. Ifrit is weak to Ice. Ice is the way to go when it comes to dealing damage to Ifrit. * **ATK/MAG buffers**: This entirely depends on your strategy. Either way, you will want some way to boost ATK or MAG, so that you can deal more damage against Ifrit. Blizzaja without Faith will not cap at 9999 unless you have about 700-ish native MAG to my recollection. Blizzaga Strike without any boosts hits for 4.5k with a 400 ATK Squall. * **Squall/Quistis**: They are both requirements for this fight, in particular only for Cid's Mission. Nice to have: * **Heavy Regen**: Passive healing is great! * **RES up**: Ifrit's Meteors are the most problematic of his attacks. Even with RES up, expect to still take a lot of damage. * **Wall**: Some would say Wall isn't mandatory, but I do think it's really nice to have. I'd rate it as necessary, except for the fact that there exists one known clear strategy that didn't use Wall. Having Wall makes your life A LOT easier, despite Ifrit having some ignore DEF/RES attacks. Keep in mind that it will be impossible to have native Wall for this fight, so if you do want Wall, it will always be from RW. * **Magic Lure**: Ifrit's Firaja can hurt. Thankfully there exists a single-target versions, that you can use Magic Lure (in conjunction with the large fire resist accessory) to really reduce his damage. * **Full Break**: Stackable on top of Breakdowns. Might save you in a pinch, but its effects aren't as noticeable in this fight... * **Draw Fire**: 4-Attack's targeting can be manipulated by using Draw Fire, which also comes with a self +100% DEF buff, which stacks with Protectga. You may consider dropping Protectga if you want to bring Draw Fire instead. ______________________________ ###Part 2: Minor Character Reviews Here's a small review for each character available in the realm, and how they can contribute in this particular fight. **Squall**: * He's mandatory, you don't have a choice. * Able to use Blizzaga Strike to hit Ifrit's Ice-elemental weakness. * Has weak 2\* Black Magic and 2\* White Magic (1\* Protect anyone?) otherwise he really doesn't do all that much. * Has one really powerful relic for this fight, which is Squall's Jacket. This jacket's SB, Blizzard Barret, is a 5-hits Ice-elemental physical damage on one target, and grants Squall the En-Ice/Attach Ice buff, which makes Blizzaga Strike, and consequent uses of this SB, hit much harder against Ifrit. * Rating (for this fight): Mandatory/10 **Quistis**: * She's mandatory too. * No 5\* skills, but she is able to go either physical (Breakdowns), or magical (Blizzaja) depending on your preferred strategy. * White Magic is unfortunately at 2\*, meaning it's not viable to manually run Haste and bypass a Hastega instead. * Two rather fantastic SSB's in Mighty Guard (VIII) (Shellga, Hastega, Heavy Regen for entire party), and G.F. Cerberus (Hastega and reduces magic cast time for the next 3 magic attacks for the entire party). Mighty Guard (VIII) fits a more general use party, but G.F. Cerberus is good if you are mage heavy. * Rating: Mandatory/10 Selphie: * She's not mandatory, but she's the only character in VIII capable of using White Magic 4 or above, so she might as well be mandatory. * You will give her Protectga/Shellga, and Curaja. She is unlikely to be running anything else. * Trabia's Light and Dreamstage are two of her best SB's for this fight, with Dreamstage being a clear upgrade, and winner, over Trabia's Light, but Trabia's Light is strong enough. * Rating: Only realm healer/10 Zell: * Piercing Strike is a niche usable option you can use with Zell. Ifrit has 3.8k DEF, and Piercing Strike ignores DEF, but you are unlikely to do a lot of damage with it, due to the way its formula works. You're gonna be averaging about 4.5k damage per hit, and since none of your other skills will hit as hard, you might want to make another Piercing Strike instead to use. Or Punishing Palm for the ATK buff, if you don't have Burning Rave. * He's the only character in VIII with a native Boostga, in the form of Burning Rave. It probably won't do much damage to Ifrit itself, but it might at least allow Squall, and your physical support (Irvine/Quistis) to hit a bit harder, though not by much. * His SSB gives him a self Crit Rate buff, which is a better way to boost Piercing Strike's damage. He may be a viable option if you have his SSB gloves. You can even combine this with the Doublecast: Monk RM and pray Piercing Strike procs twice (and crits twice too hopefully). * Rating: 6/10 Seifer: * The only character with access to Magic Lure/Draw Fire. Also has access to Saint Cross, Full Charge for DPS options, which unfortunately won't do much without a Boostga (and even then, it still might not do much), so if you do consider him, he's really only here for Magic Lure/Draw Fire. * Has access to Support 3, which allows him to carry Boost. You can then use him to Boost Squall's Blizzaga Strikes, but Seifer otherwise spends the rest of the time Magic Luring and Defending, or auto-attacking for a pittance. * Another option for Seifer is to run Minus Strike on him. A Lv80 Seifer with realm synergy has roughly 7.2k HP, and can easily hit 9000+ damage on Minus Strike, as long as he is kept under 2.2k HP (1/4 HP bar). * Both Bloodfest (VIII) and Zantetsuken Reverse are highly useful SB's for this fight. Bloodfest (VIII) comes from his coat, and gives the party RES up, which will help with dealing with Meteor, and Zantetsuken Reverse will give your party DEF up, which helps to deal with his 4-Attack. Magic Lure/Draw Fire in conjunction with the Lionheart RM will allow him to easily spam both of these buffs. * Rating: 7.5/10 Rinoa: * Has access to Blizzaja which hits Ifrit on weakness. * Has access to White Magic 3, which allows her to run Faith to boost herself or any other mage in your party individually. In JP, WM3 also meant access to Water of Strength. * Has access to Support 2 to Boost your physical members as well. * Rinoa gets a fantastic Burst Soul Break that was pretty much made for this fight. Sorceress' Awakening deals 14.4x multiplier Ice-elemental magic damage as an initial cast, then it ups her stats by 20%, and gives her access to a spammable Ice-elemental magic attack command that has a 10.48x multiplier. * Magic is also the easier option for this fight, as it is easier to cap with Blizzaja compared to Blizzaga Strike. * Rating: 9/10 Edea: * Has access to Blizzaja as well. * Not as versatile as Rinoa, so Blizzaja is all she will be good for. * Edea has two unique SB's that are both useful against Ifrit. Ice Strike deals 14.22x Ice-elemental magic damage, and Sorceress' Parade grants your party a MAG+20% buff and Hastega. Sorceress' Parade in particular means you can run a double mage setup including Edea/Rinoa (with Quistis as physical support), or Edea/Quistis (with Irvine as physical support). Most importantly, native Sorceress' Parade allows you to RW Wall, which largely increases your survivability. * Rating: 8.5/10 Irvine: * The only character in VIII with access to Full Break. Full Break will be pretty much your entire reason for wanting to bring Irvine or not. * He is not going to deal much damage even with an RS weapon, and being Boosted, similar to Zell. Unlike Zell, he doesn't even have Piercing Strike. * Don't expect any damage to come from Irvine. He's really only there for Full Break and for more Breakdowns (ie. running him with Quistis so you can bring 3 Breakdowns + Full Break). * Canister Shots is a fantastic SB for this fight. The damage will be pitiful, but it does come with a large DEF/RES reduction effect, which further helps to soften Ifrit. * Rating: 5/10 Laguna: * He really doesn't offer anything to this fight. * Except his 2nd SSB, Limit Freezing Bullet, which is a 7-hits multiple-target Ice-elemental ranged physical attack that applies Imperil Ice on the target. The problem is, outside of the damage, Ifrit already has a +100% vulnerability to Ice, and you can't reduce vulnerabilities further than 100%, so the Imperil Ice bit is wasted. If anything, if you own this SB, Laguna is just going to go there and Lifesiphon (which will deal pitiful damage to begin with) -&gt; Limit Freezing Bullet spam, hopefully Boosted in some way as well. * Rating: 2/10 Given the above information, your starting template should look like this: * Squall * Quistis * Selphie * DPS #1 * DPS #2 ______________________________ ###Part 3: Roaming Warrior: Here, I'll cover what are your best roaming warrior options for this fight. **Cheer Haste** (Echo): I honestly don't know if Global will ever get Echo. Or the Mobius event. But if we do, this gets my top pick. Reason being that it is a party-wide Haste, Shell, and RES+50%. What's important about this RW choice is that it allows you to bring Protectga on Selphie. I originally wanted to try Ifrit with my own setup in JP, utilizing a Cheer Haste RW, but apparently nobody had one (even in the JP friend code site), so I gave up. **Divine Guardian** (Garnet): If you took Echo's SSB above, and replaced Shell with Heavy Regen, you'd get Garnet's SSB. We already have this in Global. If you are able to fit Shellga into your party, Garnet's SSB is a better choice than Echo's due to the additional Heavy Regen component. /u/lindmejo beat Ifrit with [this](URL setup utilizing a Divine Guardian RW. My personal recommendations would be to not consider Garnet IF you don't have a Protectga and do not want to run Draw Fire Seifer, as from experience, I wasn't dying to Meteors or Firajas, but I was dying to 4-Attacks. **Red Scorpion** (Quistis): Quistis' first SSB is equally fantastic as an RW. Technically it loses out to Garnet's over the RES up buff, but more importantly, it frees up a slot for Shellga, so you can bring Protectga. You may have a little more problem with Meteors, without the RES+50% buff, so you'll want to have strong enough AoE heals. **Sentinel's Grimoire/Stoneskin II** (Tyro/Y'shtola): Good ol' Wall. I will only suggest bringing Wall IF you have your own native Hastega RW. There are three native Hastegas in the VIII realm when this Fragment Dungeon drops (Quistis will have two SSB's at this point, and then there's also Edea's Sorceress' Parade SB). **Marvelous Time** (Sazh): If you have one of Quistis' SSB as a native option, Marvelous Time might also be an option. Sazh's SSB gives your party Protectga, Heavy Regen, and MAG+20%. This will also give you a bit of problems with Meteor, since you lack RES+50%, but like in the Red Scorpion rating, it could be manageable if you have a good AoE heal (ie. Dreamstage). This one works really well with Quistis' 2nd SSB, as you can bring Shellga on Selphie, and gain both MAG+20% and a cast time reduction for 3 turns. **Flawless Grimoire/Aetherial Pulse** (Tyro/Y'shtola): Both the Keeper and the catgirl strikes again here. Both of these SB's ain't Walls, but what they do provide is both Protectga and Shellga. That's where the similarity ends. Flawless Grimoire gives your RW caster a +20% stat buff, and access to Tyro's Burst commands (ATK/MAG -10%, DEF/RES -10%, both factored in with Break resistance), and gives your party Magic Blink, whereas Aetherial Pulse gives your party Heavy Regen instead, but with no other added benefits. Magic Blink completely nullifies Meteor and AoE Firaja, but only once per use (twice per fight max), whereas Heavy Regen gives you small but consistent healing. Again, I only suggest considering this one if you have a native Hastega of your own (ie. both of these works very well with Sorceress' Parade. In the case of Tyro's BSB, let Squall RW it, and he'll get a +20% stat buff, which is a form of self-buff, and just have him spam Blizzaga Strikes). The choice here boils down to: do you want an additional stat buff for one user, 10% ATK/MAG reduction on Ifrit (stackable), and a one-time only Meteor/AoE Firaja blocker, or Heavy Regen with no other added benefits? ______________________________ ###Part 4: The Battle Strategy Given that your strategy will revolve around your choice (or ownership thereof) of any of the FFVIII Hastega SB's, let's go through your options: * **Sorceress' Parade** (Edea) gives MAG+20% to your entire party. Naturally if you pull this, you will want to run at least 2 mages. Quistis CAN be converted into a mage, if you lack a Whip, but this means you will have to run Irvine for Support (not all bad, you can even have Quistis carry 1 Breakdown and a Blizzaja, then have Irvine carry a Breakdown and Full Break). This is also the case if you have Quistis' G.F. Cerberus SSB. * **Mighty Guard (VIII)** (Quistis) gives you a bit more flexibility. If you have Burning Rave, you can run a physical party (you're going to find the lack of damage from physicals very jarring here, even with Burning Rave, if you're not hitting Ice-elemental weaknesses, or using Blizzaga Strike). Alternatively you can still run a Mage Meta party using the Witchcraft SB, which we all got on the Witch's Hat for free on Halloween. * If you don't own any of those three, Hastega will have to come from your RW then. Check the RW section above for suggestions on a Hastega RW to use. If you foresee yourself running 2 mages, make sure you have synergy MAG weapons for each. I've highlighted below what banners contain what relics, so as to help you plan your relic pulls in regards to the Ifrit FD fight. ______________________________ ###Part 5: The Relic Pull Strategy Now that we know what we need, let's get down to the nitty gritty - time to analyze some banners! ##Super Soul Break Spectacular - Banner 1 This banner has Red Scorpion (VIII) on it, which gives Quistis access to the powerful Mighty Guard (VIII) SSB. For what it's worth, this is looking like the last time this relic will ever appear for us (maybe it'll return in BSB fest?), so if you're going to base your strategy for Ifrit around this SSB, this would be the time to pull it. Usual warnings about chasing the dragon, and making sure you have enough money to live through the current month applies. Revolver may have a really outdated SB, but unless you're already swimming in FFVIII synergy swords, it's not bad for a stat stick. Consolation prizes include: Excalibur (V), and Yoshiyuki (VII). Excalibur returns on the much better Krile/Exdeath MC2 event (alongside Faris' BSB), and Yoshiyuki doesn't return, so it's about how badly you want Red Scorpion (and Yoshiyuki to a degree). **Verdict**: How badly do you want Red Scorpion for Ifrit? ##Super Soul Break Spectacular - Banner 3 Laguna's Machine Gun relic comes featured in this banner as one of its featured SSB's. However, the SB itself is unlikely to help you, you are unlikely to use Laguna for this boss, and as a stat stick, the only two characters that can equip guns in VIII are Laguna and Irvine (who is better off with his own gun really). Don't even bother, since you'll likely be chasing a dragon (which in this case is really just a household lizard). Consolation prizes include: Physician's Staff (XIII), and Maduin's Horn (VI). Physician's Staff returns in the Cid Raines event first banner (along with many other goodies including Hope's BSB, Cid's SSB), and Maduin's Horn returns in about 3 or 4 weeks from now, on the Relm event second banner (alongside goodies such as Celes' SSB, Kefka's Cloak), so even the consolation prizes aren't worth it to pull here. **Verdict**: Skip. ##Super Soul Break Spectacular - Banner 5* This banner contains Rinoa's Cardinal. It's a solid FFVIII Thrown MAG weapon, but I feel that it isn't good enough to justify going all out on this banner alone for - from experience, I have Cardinal in JP too, and this turned out to be nothing more than a stat stick (at least you'll get to use the SB bar for something, since Blizzaja with weakness is 18x multiplier, and Wishing Star hits for a total of 18x as well - about the same as a Blizzaja with weakness, but with a much longer charge time. Thanks /u/pintbox). This banner also has a lot of other goodies, including Genji Blade (V), Peacemaker (XIII), Sentinel's Grimoire (C), Wutai Headband (VII), Wizard Rod (IX), and some others, so lots of consolation prizes to be had. **Verdict**: The other stuff that aren't Cardinal might be worth pulling, especially a native Wall. Remember that if you can't complete Cid's Missions, at least be sure you're able to clear it with your A-team, and Wall will be an easy part of it. ##Broken Resolve (Squall Dress Record, Edea introduction event, Zell/Edea MC2) - Banner 1 Ok, our first non-celebration banner. All the relics here will give RS, so let's rate the individual relics themselves. Name|Type|Character|Soul Break|Notes|Rating| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| Twin Lance|Sword|Squall|Lion Rush|This relic provides Squall with his own Burst Soul Break, which is really an inferior version of Bartz's Burst Soul Break. Other than being a stat stick, and self-Haste and +20% stats from Burst Mode, it won't be all that useful for Ifrit. On its own, it's fairly solid.|5.5/10| Sorceress' Strength|Thrown|Edea|Ice Strike|This relic provides Edea with an SSB that does 6-hits Ice/Non-elemental magic damage to all enemies. It's a fairly solid relic for Edea, for the purposes of Ifrit|8/10| Laguna's Jacket|Light Armor|Laguna|Missile Barrage|This isn't really going to do much against Ifrit. On top of that, Laguna is again, unlikely to be brough for Ifrit. As a stat stick, it could be useful if you intend to use Draw Fire/Magic Lure Seifer, for additional defensive stats.|6/10| Ulysses|Gun|Irvine|Canister Shots|This is a solid SB for Irvine. You won't be doing much damage with it, but you will be able to use it to Wallbreak Ifrit's massive defenses, which allows your characters to hit that much harder. Irvine himself won't be dealing much damage for this fight, but he will be able to bring Full Break to the table if you decide to bring him.|7/10| Gauntlet|Fist|Zell|Meteor Barrage|Not a very powerful SB for Ifrit. Best used as a stat stick if you intend to bring Zell, since Zell is the only person who can equip Fists in VIII.|4/10| Inferno Fang|Dagger|-|Inferno Fang (Shared)|A Fira Strike SB against Ifrit? Really? Stat stick at best.|4/10| Pinwheel|Thrown|-|-|Standard Thrown MAG weapon. Does nothing else really.|2/10| **Verdict**: Not an overly great banner to pull on. This is a skip for me, unless you really want Squall's BSB for whatever reason. ##Broken Resolve (Squall Dress Record, Edea introduction event, Zell/Edea MC2) - Banner 2 Name|Type|Character|Soul Break|Notes|Rating| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| Ehrgeiz|Fist|Zell|Different Beat|This is Zell's SSB that does 8-hits single-target + gains a self 25% Crit Rate buff. Not going to be solid for Ifrit, but that crit rate buff may mean much higher damage to Piercing Strike, which is the better way to buff its damage than to buff ATK. Consider running Zell if you do pull these gloves (he's the only one who can use them anyway).|7.5/10| Crescent Wish|Rod|Selphie|Dreamstage|AoE Curaga + Magic Blink. Nuff said.|10/10| Party Dress|Light Armor|Rinoa|G.F. Brothers|Self en-Earth, and Earth-elemental magic damage is not going to help you out much against Ifrit. If anything, once again it's a good stat stick that comes with some MAG, and good defensive stats.|6.5/10| Sorceress' Crown|Hat|Edea|Sorceress' Parade|Hastega + MAG+20% for party is FANTASTIC for Ifrit. Blizzajas will cap at 9999, and you get to RW Wall. Win-win.|10/10| Seifer's Coat|Light Armor|Seifer|Bloodfest (VIII)|Bloodfest isn't spectacular against Ifrit by any means, but it does come with a RES+50% buff. Used in conjunction with Magic Lure Seifer, it's quite easy to get full uptime on this buff. Plus it's a Light Armor, so it also works very well with Draw Fire/Magic Lure Seifer.|8.5/10| Inferno Fang|Dagger|-|Inferno Fang|A Fira Strike SB against Ifrit? Really? Stat stick at best.|4/10| Pinwheel|Thrown|-|-|Standard Thrown MAG weapon. Assuming you didn't pull for Edea's SSB, and you don't have any other VIII MAG weapons for Edea with synergy, this wouldn't be a very bad pull here at all, especially if you also net her crown on this banner.|4/10| **Verdict**: This is actually a fantastic banner to pull on. But read on... ##Downpour of Destruction (Seifer/Irvine MC2) - Banner 1 Note: This event also comes with its own Ultimate and Ultimate+ difficulty Cid's Mission fights. Name|Type|Character|Soul Break|Notes|Rating| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| Shooting Star|Thrown|Rinoa|Sorceress' Awakening|This BSB will literally single-handedly kill Ifrit for you. It will also help you with killing the Propagators (Ultimate) in the event this banner is introduced for.|10/10| Vega|Guna|Laguna|Limit Freezing Bullet|It's multi-hit, it's Ice-elemental, but other than that, Laguna doesn't bring anything to the table against Ifrit.|6.5/10| Beast Killer|Whip|Quistis|G.F. Cerberus|This is Quistis' 2nd SSB that comes with Hastega and Reduced Magic Cast Time buff for 3 turns. Hastega is always important for this fight, and reduced cast time always works for a mage-oriented comp. Value is diminished if you own Red Scorpion however.|9/10| Scorpion Tail|Rod|Selphie|Rapture|This SB of Selphie's simply deals damage to all enemies and Stuns them. A fairly useless one, but a good stat stick otherwise.|4/10| Party Dress|Light Armor|Rinoa|G.F. Brothers|Self en-Earth, and Earth-elemental magic damage is not going to help you out much against Ifrit. If anything, once again it's a good stat stick that comes with some MAG, and good defensive stats.|6.5/10| Iron Giant Sword|Sword|-|-|Generic RS sword. At least you'll have something for Squall (and Seifer) for damage purposes.|7/10| **Verdict**: Shooting Star alone may be worth pulling on this banner, and Quistis' Beast Killer is a nice consolation to have. You should read on, as the Verdict for this banner is sort of tied to the next... ##Downpour of Destruction (Seifer/Irvine MC2) - Banner 2 Name|Type|Character|Soul Break|Notes|Rating| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| Revolver A|Sword|Seifer|Zantetsuken Reverse|This SSB does big damage (won't be much against Ifrit, unless he's severely defensively broken and Seifer has a large damage boost), but it also increases DEF for your whole party. Not bad by all means, and the DEF buff may come in handy, but it's certainly not required. Still a good stat stick though.|6/10| Bismarck|Gun|Irvine|Dark Shot|This SSB won't be doing much damage to Ifrit, since Ifrit cannot be Blinded or Slowed. And Irvine isn't generally known for dealing damage anyway.|4/10| Crescent Wish|Rod|Selphie|Dreamstage|Train Train, Take Us Away, Far Away, To the Future, We Will Go. Where It Leads, No One Knows|10/10| Squall's Jacket|Light Armor|Squall|Blizzard Barret|This SB will also single-handedly kill Ifrit to a degree - this SB is a 5-hits single-target Ice-elemental physical attack, and also gives Squall the En-Ice buff. The first cast may be underwhelming, but the second cast onwards should see this SB deal big damage. Blizzaga Strike will also likely cap damage at 9999 per use with the En-Ice, and if you pair it with Ace Striker, you can easily re-build your SB gauge to spam this SB. The only issue is this relic isn't a weapon, so you'll want a good RS weapon that Squall can use, but this is also a Light Armor, and will help with Squall's survivability.|9.5/10| Sorceress' Crown|Hat|Edea|Sorceress' Parade|Hastega + MAG+20% for party is FANTASTIC for Ifrit. Blizzajas will cap at 9999, and you get to RW Wall. Win-win. Unlike Edea's MC2 banner though, there's no chance for a weapon for Edea with this one.|10/10| Gauntlet|Zell|Fist|Meteor Barrage|Not a very powerful SB for Ifrit. Best used as a stat stick if you intend to bring Zell, since Zell is the only person who can equip Fists in VIII.|4/10| Iron Giant Sword|Sword|-|-|Generic RS sword. At least you'll have something for Squall (and Seifer) for damage purposes. Complements Squall's Jacket on this banner very well, but is otherwise standard without it.|7/10| **Verdict**: This banner has almost literally all you need to kill Ifrit. Sorceress' Parade will allow you to run a mage party with Edea and Quistis as mages - alternatively you can use Quistis for support, and bring Rinoa as your second mage instead to complement Edea, and Squall's Jacket with an RS sword (there's two swords on this banner) will allow him to be self-sufficient for dealing damage to Ifrit. What it's missing are RS weapons for Quistis and Edea (I hope you haven't thrown away that Flail++!). This banner complements Banner 1 well, in that Banner 1 has 3 mage RS weapons (Shooting Star, Beast Killer, and Scorpion Tail), and this banner has the SB's you need to deal with Ifrit. ____________________________________ Difference between **Broken Resolve (Squall Dress Record, Edea introduction event, Zell/Edea MC2) - Banner 2** and **Downpour of Destruction (Seifer/Irvine MC2) - Banner 2**: Both banners feature rather similar pools of relics, in regards to Ifrit FD. But there's a few differences. * The first one contains Zell's SSB gloves which aren't released anywhere. Compared to Seifer's SSB. Fists are only useful for Zell, whereas Swords can be used by Seifer, Squall, and Laguna. You are unlikely to fit both into your party, so if you had to pick one, pull on who you would pick. * The first one contains Pinwheel as its generic non-SB weapon. This means that if you pull for Sorceress' Crown on the first banner, there's also a chance for an RS MAG weapon for Edea if you don't have one, whereas the second one will have a Sword for Squall. If you have an RS weapon for Edea not from Banner 2, you can consider going for Sorceress' Crown on the 2nd one instead. ____________________________________ Credits goes to /u/Enlir for his fantastic spreadsheet again as usual.

251,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Stepping Stones: 3*-5* Ability Priorities and Comparisons,160,4bkae8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4bkae8/stepping_stones_35_ability_priorities_and/,2016-03-23 11:36:32,"Updated guide: URL About a month ago I wrote a guide on the 4\*-5\* abilities, but we have enough information now that I can include some thoughts on the upcoming 5\* abilities. There's many of you still uncertain about ability investments, so I'm writing this guide to cover a quick breakdown and a more detailed explanation. I've compiled the knowledge from my personal experience and the general community consensus on these abilities. Ability hones have a huge impact on your endgame experience, and hopefully this guide will cover the important details on the essential abilities and help you make a decision when spending your orbs. *** # About this guide (NO LONGER UPDATING. SEE LINK ABOVE) * I wanted to focus more on abilities that are more essential to progression and are more accessible to people with limited orbs. I'll at least include a few, if not all, niche possibilities afterwards. Anything not included is either due to my lack of knowledge on it (usually a future ability) or something that didn't seem essential to progression. * This guide assumes you already know about or currently use retaliate strategies and are looking beyond that to expand your ability collection. * Everyone plays differently, so you don't necessarily need every single ability listed here, but I felt that it was a good pool of abilities to start with. Also, everyone acquires orbs at a different pace, so one might be able to skip lower tier abilities in favor of a better one. * This guide includes unreleased abilities (at the time of writing) as well, so if you don't see it in game, that is why. Check the spreadsheet at the bottom for more information. The names used for some of these abilities are tentative and are subject to change with translation. * Thoughts written below are suggestions. I am not here to tell you how to play the game, but I am trying to offer ability creation/honing optimization advice from my personal success and the community's suggestions. People are interested in this kind of information, and I am trying to help them. * This guide will exclude 1\* and 2\* abilities because they are incredibly easy to hone these days and there isn't much orb competition for them. /u/pintbox already covers them in the Beginners Guide if you really want to know more about the relevant ones (link at bottom). Some abilities like poison are included in the guide, since it's the only spell form for that debuff. * If you want more details on any individual ability such as its duration, potency, etc., check the link at the bottom of this guide. I will only cover reasons for priorities. * Please let me know if you spot any mistakes or want to offer some feedback/suggestions. I would like to make this as useful as possible. There are some future 5\* abilities I did not include, since I don't know too much about their applications. If you would like me to add them, please elaborate on them and I will credit you. *** # Creation/Honing Suggestion Summary If you want a quick breakdown on my honing suggestions, check the categories below. If you want more details on the choices, check out the detailed ability category sections after this section. ## General Tips * Orb Ratio via conversion: 100x 3\* Orb -&gt; 10x 4\* Orbs -&gt; 1x 5\* Orb * Work on the highest tier of abilities that you can effectively hone (R3+) first. A low hone of a high tier ability tends to be less useful than a high hone of an ability on the previous tier. Convert your higher tier orbs down if necessary * It is a generally good idea to make sure each character has a total of about 10 ability uses to last for a boss fight. For example, a healer with R3 Curaga and R1 Shellga should not run out of its 8 Curaga uses easily in a boss fight even though its Shellga is not a spammable ability. To maximize battle contribution, you typically want your characters using abilities or SBs instead of regular attacks. * For spammable abilities, if you value several abilities equally and they have overlapping orb costs, it's okay to stop at R3 on one ability and spread orbs around until all the others are at R3. The jump between R3 and R4 gets really expensive when you can get more than 2 uses from using those orbs on a new creation or low hone. * By endgame, your mitigation ability options should at least include Shellga, Protectga, Magic Breakdown, and Power Breakdown/Steal Power. NOTE: The following breakdown is just a general guideline. At some point, you should decide which abilities are suitable to your play style and party composition. This is mainly to introduce you to some of your best options, while the detailed ability categories can help you make your choices. * Ability names marked with a 1 (i.e. Ability^1) are my suggestions for initial creation/honing * Ability names marked with a 2 (i.e. Ability^2) are abilities that can meet the requirements for the occasional target scores for dungeon mastery * Ability names marked with a 3 (i.e. Ability^3) are abilities that have very rare target scores for dungeon mastery * Ability names that meet multiple of the above criteria are marked with multiple numbers (i.e. Ability^(1, 2)) ## Creating A Foundation: 3\* Abilities 3\* orbs are more plentiful as you delve deeper into harder content, so these abilities will probably be easier to hone while you work your way up to higher tier abilities. Healing and mitigation are essential to help you survive tougher fights. Pick your damage and utility abilities based on your needs. Move to the next tier once you feel you have enough ""spammable"" 3\* abilities. Ability Name | Recommended Rank | Brief Description | -------|--------------------------|---------------------| Power Break^(1), Magic Break^1 | R3+ | Mitigation: single target ATK/MAG reduction debuff Curaga^(1), Renewing Cure | R3+ | Healing: single target Firaga^(2), Blizzaga^(2), Thundaga^(2), Waterga^(2), Biora^2 | R3+ | Elemental Damage: single target Black Magic Fira Strike^(2), Blizzara Strike^(2), Thundara Strike^(2), Watera Strike^(2), Aerora Strike^(2), Bio Strike^2 | R3+ | Elemental Damage: single target physical Shiva, Ifrit, Ramuh|R3+|Elemental Damage: AoE Summoning Tempo Flurry^2 | R3+ | Utility: damage + slow Dispel^3 | R2+ | Utility: enemy buff removal ## Refine Your Arsenal: 4\* Abilities Once you get more 4\* orbs, you can finally have access to the strongest mitigation abilities available. Breakdowns are direct upgrades to breaks if you have a 4\* Support character to use them. Damage and utility options are a lot more diverse and powerful at this level. Read the details in the sections below to help you with your decisions beyond the generally useful abilities. Focus on the next tier once you have enough high hones for your frequently used 4\* abilities. Ability Name | Recommended Rank | Brief Description | -------|--------------------------|---------------------| Power Breakdown^(1), Magic Breakdown^1 | R3+ | Mitigation: stronger single target ATK/MAG reduction debuff Exhausting Polka, Heathen Frolic Sarabande | R2 | Mitigation: strong AoE ATK/MAG reduction debuff Protectga^(1), Shellga^1 | R1-R2 | Party Buffs: DEF/RES increase Curaja | R3+ | Healing: single target Diaga^2 | R3+ | Elemental Damage: single target White Magic Memento Mori | R2+ | Darkness Self Buff: MAG Waterja^(2), Thundaja^(2), Firaja^(2), Blizzaja^(2), Bioga^2 | R3+ | Elemental Damage: single target Black Magic Ruinga | R3+ | Non-Elemental Damage: Black Magic AoE Maduin, Valefor | R3+ | Non-Elemental Damage: Summoning Fireblossom^(2), Yukikaze, Darkmoon | R2+ | Various Physical Damage: Samurai AoE Bladeblitz | R2+ | Physical Damage: Combat AoE Lifesiphon | R3+ | Utility: SB gauge boost for multi-hit SB or other useful SBs Steal Power, Punishing Palm, Mirror of Equity| R2+ | Self Buff: ATK Banishing Strike^(2, 3) | R2+ | Utility: Holy damage + enemy buff removal ## Invest In A Specialization: 5\* Abilities At the time of writing, collecting a lot of major orbs is a daunting task, so high hones are out of reach for many. I suggest starting with Full Break for general purpose and because you're most likely running a 5\* Support on your team at this point. Hone the other abilities based on the type of parties you use frequently. R2 can be a decent pausing point for most abilities as long as you pair it with a useful 3\* or 4\* ability to make sure your hones will last for an extended fight. Unless you are swimming in orbs, honing beyond R2 for damage abilities means you are committing to using that ability set often. Ability Name| Recommended Rank | Brief Description | -------|--------------------------|---------------------| Full Break^1, Multi Break | R2 | Mitigation: ATK/MAG/DEF/RES reduction debuff Flare | R3+ | Non-Elemental Damage: single target black magic Meteor| R2 | Non-Elemental Damage: black magic AoE Bahamut | R3+ | Non-Elemental Damage: Summoning AoE Flashing Blade, Sky Grinder | R2+ | Multi-Hit Physical Damage: AoE (2 hits) Saint Cross^2 | R2+ | Multi-Hit Physical Holy Damage: single target Knight (2 hits) Thief's Revenge | R2+ | Multi-Hit Physical Damage: single target Thief (170 SPD for 5 hits) Full Charge | R2+ | Multi-Hit Physical Damage: single target Combat (4 hits) Exploding Fist | R2+ | Multi-Hit Physical Damage: single target Monk (5 hits) Dark Zone | R3+ | Multi-Hit Dark Damage: single target Darkness (2 hits) ## Utility: Supplementary Abilities If you are aiming for mastery target scores, I recommend at least having a *blind*, *poison*, *silence*, *sleep*, and *paralyze* ability. Choose one of the abilities in those categories or more if you want more options. Even without the target score, those status effects can give you advantages against bosses that are vulnerable to those effects. The other abilities have their niche uses as well. Ability Name | Recommended Rank | Brief Description | -------|--------------------------|---------------------| Armor Break, Mental Break, Armor Breakdown, Mental Breakdown, Box Step Sarabande, Stumble Step | R2 | Damage Increase: DEF/RES reduction debuff Blindga^(2), Dark Buster^(2), Blind Shell^2 | R1+ Blindga, R2+ others | Status: blind Poison^(2), Venom Buster^(2), Poison Shell^2 | R2+ | Status: poison Silencega^(2), Silence Buster^(2), Silence Shell^2 | R1+ Silencega, R2+ others | Status: silence Sleep^(2), Sleep Buster^(2), Phantasm^(2), Lullaby^2 | R2+ | Status: sleep Intimidate^2 | R3+ | Status: paralyze Dismissal | R4 | Status: stun Drainga, Drain Strike, Thief's Revenge, Leeching Leap | R3+ | Self-Sustain: damage + heal Exausting Polka, | R2+ | Mitigation: AoE ATK/MAG reduction debuff Slowga^2 | R1 | Status: slow Stop^3 | R4-R5 | Status: stop;

can clear poison/sap with its Regen * Curaja becomes more necessary when you have more characters near or at level 80 due to the large HP pools * R3 should be sufficient, but with more uses, while under haste, you can spam your heal more for SB charging for characters like Y'shtola (Stoneskin II), Tyro (Sentinel's Grimoire) or healers with other relevant SBs ## Self-Sustain Ability Name|Requirements|Damage Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Drainga|4\* Black Magic|7x (magic)|heals user for 30% of damage dealt, dark element Drain Strike|3\* Spellblade|1.7x (physical)|heals user for 30% of damage dealt Leeching Leap|4\* Dragoon|2.3x (physical)|heals user for 40% of damage dealt, ranged, 2.2s air time Thief's Revenge|5\* Thief|3.5x MAX (physical)|heals user for 30% of damage dealt, from 1 up to 5 hits based on SPD (140/150/160/170) * can compensate for the lack of AoE heals by reducing the number of targets your healer has to heal often * deals decent damage while self-healing; 2 for 1 action that doesn't change your general dynamic with a damage dealer * if you want the convenience, aim for these if they aren't tying up your orb costs * you generally only need enough to keep your character alive, but high hones give you more breathing room *** # Elemental Damage NOTE: hitting a weakness charges SB gauge to a rate of about more than half of lifesiphon's rate (see the linked PDF below for specific info) ## Elemental Black Magic/Summoning Ability Name|Requirements|Magical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Firaga, Blizzaga, Thundaga, Waterga|3\* Black Magic|4.9x|associated with respective element Firaja, Blizzaja, Thundaja, Waterja|4\* Black Magic|9x|associated with respective element Biora|3\* Black Magic|4.8x|1% chance to cause poison to target, poison element Bioga|4\* Black Magic|8.8x|1% chance to cause poison to target, poison element Drainga|4\* Black Magic|7x|heals user for 30% of damage dealt, dark element Shiva, Ifrit, Ramuh|3\* Summoning|5.5x|2 hits, associated with respective element * a 3\* elemental black magic spell and elemental summon can still hit relatively high on weakness, depending on target's RES; not ideal outside of weakness * in terms of orbs, 4\* elemental black magic spells are the cheapest source of single target damage when damaging neutral targets; generally honed to avoid elemental resist/null/absorb * for neutral targets, it is recommended to hone Waterja as the first 4\* elemental black magic spell due to its faster cast time than the other elements, its lower cost on specific orbs, and its nature of being least resisted * Drainga may not have the highest multiplier for being a dark elemental spell, but it has better utility; may want to consider Darkness magic instead for dark element (see next category) * hone each element to at least R3 before moving on to the next one; low hones essentially makes black mages useless quickly * since the double hit update, elemental summons can easily break the damage cap on weaknesses, so they are useful for both AoE and single target purposes * 4\* elemental summons are more or less luxurious upgrades, considering the costs; better against neutral targets, but Valefor/Maduin hit higher with no element, anyways * use MAG boosting effects for optimal damage, especially for elemental summons which can hit near 20k in the best case ## Holy/Dark Magic Ability Name|Requirements|Magical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Diaga|4\* White Magic|8.3x|single target, holy element Memento Mori|4\* Darkness|8x|inflicts a Doom-like status to user and increases user's MAG by 30%, single target, dark element Dark Zone|5\* Darkness|9x|2 hits, individual hits 6.75 each instead if user under any Doom status, single target, dark element * if a white mage doesn't have access to damage ability sets outside of white magic, Diaga will be their primary way of dealing damage if so desired * Diaga can be used for neutral targets, since holy is not resisted much * Diaga starts with 2 additional uses compared to black magic spells; may not need to hone as much for extended use * reduce target's RES to increase damage for Diaga * combine Dark Zone with Memento Mori for optimal damage * Memento Mori may not need high hones, but Dark Zone should be R3+, since you're working with a time limit ## Elemental Physical Damage Ability Name|Requirements|Physical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Fira Strike, Blizzara Strike, Thundara Strike, Watera Strike, Aerora Strike, Bio Strike|3\* Spellblade|1.8x|associated with respective element Ice Jump, Lightning Jump, Wind Jump|3\* Dragoon|2.1x|associated with respective element, 2.2s air time Fire Blossom|4\* Samurai|1.6x|AoE, fire element damage * 3\* spellblades and jumps can hit relatively high on targets with respective weaknesses, depending on DEF; not ideal for neutral targets due to better physical options * use an ATK boost to maximize damage * Aerora Strike and Wind Jump are, at the time or writing, the strongest sources of wind ability damage * 4\* spellblades are unnecessary if it competes for orbs you can use elsewhere, since boosted ATK with synergy weapons should hit the damage cap easily * Fire Blossom is the second best Samurai AoE on neutral targets * hone high (R3+) for consistent damage *** # Non-Elemental Damage ## Magic Damage Ability Name|Requirements|Magical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Ruinga|4\* Black Magic|5.9x|AoE Meteor|5\* Black Magic|9x|AoE Valefor, Maduin|4\* Summoning|9.6x|2 hits, AoE Bahamut|5\* Summoning|15x|2 hits, AoE Flare|5\* Black Magic|12x|N/A * Ruinga and Meteor are not ideal for single target damage unless working around a reflected target * Ruinga is less effective for ultimate fights; outdamaged easily by Valefor/Maduin and Meteor * when hones are low, use mana spring II for multi-stage dungeons to get more uses * Valefor uses more wind orbs, while Maduin uses up more summon orbs; hone based on your orb restrictions * Summons have low uses, so R3+ is ideal to use them for a more extended fight * Only hone Flare if you are committing to using a black mage who has no access to 5\* Summoning (or possibly even 5\* Darkness) * Meteor, Bahamut, Flare, and Dark Zone compete with each other for orbs * hone enough for your personal use ## Self-Boost for Physical Damage Ability Name|Requirements|Physical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Punishing Palm|4\* Monk|2.1x|ATK +30% to user Mirror of Equity|4\* Samurai|2.2x|ATK + 30% and sap status to user Steal Power|4\* Thief|N/A|ATK -40% to target and ATK +50% to user * typically best to use in hybrid parties or where physical party ATK boosts are not available * these ATK boosts will not stack with other effects that boost only ATK such as Shout, Burning Arrow, or Planet Protector * these ATK bossts will stack with most other effects that boost additional stats like Hand of the Emperor (ATK and DEF +30%) * pair with a spammable damage ability for maximum effect, especially one with multiple hits (i.e. Tempo Flurry or Double Cut) because it has the potential to break 9999 damage * Steal Power can replace Power Breakdown (same debuff effect) for mitigation if not using Shout ## Physical Single Target Burst Damage Ability Name|Requirements|Physical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Lifesiphon|4\* Combat|1.8x|100% hit rate, generates 150 SB points Chainstarter/Faultsiphon|5\* Celerity|2x|next cast (including SB) is instant Thief's Revenge|5\* Thief|3.5x MAX|heals user for 30% of damage dealt, from 1 up to 5 hits based on SPD (140/150/160/170) Saint Cross|5\* Knight|3.4x|2 hits, holy element, self Esuna and Low Regen Full Charge|5\* Combat|4.68x|4 hits, 3.3s casting time Exploding Fist|5\* Monk|2.9x|5 hits, 20% chance to crit * because of the steep requirements, there are very limited users for one or more of the 5\* abilities above; decide carefully when choosing to create/hone * the 5\* abilities above have the shared capability of breaking 9999 damage with their multiple hits * it is generally more valuable to prioritize creating/honing one of the 5\* abilities above for a character that lacks a 5x potency or higher physical damage SB to rival the damage of that SB * use Lifesiphon if you have a combat user with a 5x potency physical damage SB or higher * Thief's Revenge at 4 hits (160 SPD) is basically barrage with a drain effect; outside of synergy, most 5\* thieves will need to level past 65 to reach 5 hits * Saint Cross is unfortunately capped at just under 20k damage due to its 2 hits, but it is powerful, consistent damage for a wider range of users; benefits from holy boosting equipment, especially in realms where you lack synergy * Full Charge is the most accessible 5\* ability of these, and its drawback is remedied by Chainstarter/Faultsiphon's effect; probably the most ideal of these abilities to use for Cid's Missions * Exploding Fist is on the weaker side of damage compared to the other abilities here, but it's definitely useful if you use a monk frequently and have nothing better to slot in; doesn't compete heavily for orbs with the other abilities here * if tight on orbs, R2 is sufficient for the 5\* abilities as long as it is paired with an appropriate highly honed 3\* or 4\* ability ## Physical AoEs Ability Name|Requirements|Physical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Bladeblitz|4\* Combat|1.5x|N/A Yukikaze|4\* Samurai|1.5x|20% chance to cause Blind Darkmoon|4\* Samurai|1.5x|20% chance to cause Silence Flashing Blade|5\* Samurai|2.66x|2 hits, 100% hit rate Sky Grinder|5\* Dragoon|2.3x|2 hits, 50% chance to crit, no air time * Bladeblitz is the most accessible physical AoE * Yukikaze and Darkmoon are unique in being able to deal damage and proc a status effect with a physical AoE * Flashing Blade and Sky Grinder having multiple hits grants them the potential to break 9999 damage * boost ATK of user for best results *** # Utility/Miscellaneous ## Damage Increase Debuffs Ability Name|Requirements|Physical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Armor Break|3\* Combat|1.7x|DEF -30% to target Armor Breakdown|4\* Support|2.1x|DEF -40% to target Mental Break|3\* Combat|1.7x|RES -30% to target Mental Breakdown|4\* Support|2.1x|RES -50% to target Box Step Sarabande|4\* Dancer|N/A|DEF -40% to all enemies Stumble Step|4\* Dancer|N/A|RES -50% to all enemies * Combat 3+ is very accessible, so many characters can use the breaks * breakdowns are limited to Support 4+ characters, which are less frequent than Combat 3+ characters * these debuffs will not stack with other effects that modify the same single stat, regardless of magnitude * these will stack with the stat reduction effects of Full Break and Multi Break (affects 4 stats) * mental break and mental breakdown will increase your MND-based damage to the target (i.e. Diaga) * with enough abilities, it may be hard to fit these in your ability slots later on; honestly not really needed compared to ATK/MAG boosts * use with damage boosts for maximum effect ## Taunts/Redirection Ability Name|Requirements|Additional Effect ---|---|---| Draw Fire|3\* Knight|grants Draw Fire status to user (+100% DEF and lures single target PHY attacks to user) Magic Lure|4\* Knight|grants Magic Lure status to user (+100% RES and lures single target BLK attacks to user) Reflect|3\* White Magic|grants reflect Status to target Carbuncle|4\* Summoning|grants reflect Status to party * Draw Fire and Magic Lure are great for bosses that have an excess of single target PHY or BLK attacks; look for information about boss movepools to make use of these * combine retaliate with Draw Fire for counter attacks * combine Magic Lure with reflect (RM or ability) for magic counter * Reflect will not affect AoE spells * use drain abilities or an AoE heal to heal reflected character * Carbuncle's party reflect will restrict your ability to heal; best to use in encounters that are heavy on single target spells * in some cases, you can cast reflect on an enemy who is going to be targeted by buffs, making it bounce onto your team * if you want to use single target Black Magic against a reflected target, bounce spells off one of your reflected characters; gets around magic counters, too ## Buff Removal Ability Name|Requirements|Physical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Banishing Strike|4\* Knight|2x|removes buffs from target, holy element Dispel|3\* White Magic|N/A|removes buffs from target * use for removing troublesome boss buffs like protect/shell/haste/reflect * if boss resists/nulls/absorbs holy or has a nasty counter to physical damage, use dispel instead * use banishing strike if there is a holy weakness or if it is safe to use for damage * Banishing Strike should be honed high (R3+), especially if using for damage * Dispel should be honed based on how often you think you will be casting it; R2+ is usually a safe amount ## ATB Manipulation Ability Name|Requirements|Physical Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Slowga|4\* White Magic|N/A|80% chance to cause Slow Tempo Flurry|3\* Celerity|1.8x|2 hits, 20% chance to cause Slow Stop|3\* Black Magic|N/A|70% chance to cause Stop Halting Rumba|4\* Dancer|N/A|AoE, 70% chance to cause Stop Intimidate|3\* Support|N/A|50% chance to cause Paralyze Dismissal|4\* Celerity|2.05x|25% chance to cause Stun (reset ATB gauge) * Slow (slows down target's ATB gauge) is a frequent boss vulnerability and target score; essentially gives you more turns, especially when affected by Haste * Slowga is typically better for mage teams, while Tempo Flurry's lower proc chance is offset by its damage potential * Tempo Flurry can break the damage cap with its double hits; use ATK boosts for maximum effect * the Stop and Paralyze status pause the turn timer for the affected target * to Stop-lock a boss vulnerable to it, hone two copies of Stop to R4 and have each caster alternate * Paralyze is a somewhat frequent status vulnerability; may not need to bring mitigation if you can keep it up 100% * Dismissal's stun effect typically best against targets afflicted with slow and/or targets with slow ATB gauges * Dismissal works best in multiples (R3+) if capitalizing on stun (not really a reliable strategy) ## Restriction Debuffs Ability Name|Requirements|Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Blindga|3\* Black Magic|N/A|60% chance to cause Blind Dark Buster|3\* Support|1.7x|30% chance to cause Blind Blind Shell|4\* Machinist|1.9x|60% chance to cause Blind, 2.4x instead if target already has Blind, ranged Sleep|1\* Black Magic|N/A|30% chance to cause Sleep Sleep Buster|3\* Support|1.7x|30% chance to cause Sleep Phantasm|4\* Ninja|39x|ignores RES, 50% chance to cause Sleep Lullaby|2\* Bard|N/A|AoE, 20% chance to cause Sleep Silencega|3\* White Magic|N/A|60% chance to cause Silence Silence Buster|3\* Support|1.7x|30% chance to cause Silence Silence Shell|4\* Machinist|1.9x|60% chance to cause Silence, 2.4x instead if target already has Silence, ranged * these debuffs show up as target scores and boss status vulnerabilities somewhat frequently * the spell versions of these debuffs are typically better for mage-focused teams * the support versions of these debuffs are the most accessible for physical damage dealers * the machinist versions of these debuffs are the most powerful, but restricted to a few characters * The Sleep debuff is generally best used with a mage team so that the target won't wake up * Phantasm uses a different damage formula than magic, so don't let the multiplier fool you; its sleep chance is its best feature * Blind can sometimes allow you to forego physical damage mitigation, since the target will have a hard time hitting you * use high proc chance abilities where the debuff is extremely urgent that it interacts with the targets' mechanics or if you are pressed for time during the fight ## Damage Over Time Debuffs Ability Name|Requirements|Multiplier|Additional Effect ---|---|---|---| Poison|1\* Black Mage|N/A|30% chance to cause Poison Venom Buster|3\* Support|1.7x|30% chance to cause Poison Poison Shell|4\* Machinist|1.9x|60% chance to cause Poison, 2.4x instead if target already has Poison, ranged * the Poison status is great for vulnerable bosses that have a high HP pool, since each tick damages by a percentage of that boss's HP * the Poison status only needs to be applied once, since it lasts the entire battle * the Poison spell is more useful for mage teams that are trying to sleep a boss * Venom Buster is the most accessible for physical damage dealers * Poison shell is the most powerful and potent way to apply poison, but its drawback is that its users are limited *** # Other Resources If you're interested in more specifics about abilities and their applications, check out these links.

254,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Questions regarding En-spell in Japan.,2,43fn6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/43fn6y/questions_regarding_enspell_in_japan/,2016-01-31 06:57:32,"Hi people, this is my first Thread :D As title says I have a few questions about the Enspell effect in battle. Some new JP soulbreaks have this new effect that increases the damage of certain abilities (~~As the new Edgar's Soulbreak that inflicts Enpoison~~ apparently doesn't apply it), I would like to know if: Those also apply the effect of Barspell? Or the barspell is not a thing? Enemies get benefits of the status? How much enspells we have until now? Is there any strategy involving this status? o3o/ Edit: Apparently we 2 have different effects: * Vulnerability to element: Now it's weak to element. * Enspells: Attack gets the element. Abilities with the element deal 50% more dmg. Soulbreaks with the element deal 80% more dmg. Reduce element damage by 20% (""barspell"")"
255,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"Using a ""rope-a-dope"" strategy against Ultimate Beatrix",26,4477q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4477q0/using_a_ropeadope_strategy_against_ultimate/,2016-02-05 07:38:26,"Just championed this fight, and after a few failed runs I realized something which helped me master it without an extreme amount of S/Ling: Beatrix's combination of vulnerability to sap and low damage output during her initial phase creates an opportunity to build up soul break charge before she gets really dangerous. Seriously, *don't attack her at all* during this phase. Instead, 1.)Apply defensive buffs/debuffs on the first turn; 2.)Use Shadowsteel or a similar ability to proc sap; 3.)Have everyone sit back and defend, until just before the sap damage causes her to transition to her second phase. Beatrix's initial stage attacks are all single target, and not particularly damaging, so unless you get very bad RNG or are severely undergeared, she's unlikely to kill any of your characters with Shock, Thunder Slash, or regular attacks if you have mitigation up, and you're going to HP 1 when she hits you with Climhazzard anyway so it's not like taking the damage hurts your medal count. What she will do, however, is build up your SB charge. Right before her HP ticks below the Climhazzard trigger, cue up your Medica. In phase two, you can also do this to an extent though the addition of Holy to her arsenal means you'll have to have magic mitigation up as well. Before she uses her scripted Seiken Stock Break and transitions to her most lethal AI pattern, make sure all buffs and debuffs are applied. Then go to town on her with everything you have once she's below 40% HP. If you're lucky, between tanking her initial attacks and Lifesiphoning her in stage 2, you should have enough SB bar to chain offensive soul breaks and cast Medica more than once in stage 3. She doesn't pose much of a danger during phase 1, so use this time to your advantage to ramp up for later in the fight! "

Just keep track of its turn count. Stop attacking after its second turn and wait out the Mist Form. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 2&amp;7: Fabul Castle** ###**Boss:** Kain **Boss HP:** 5,064 (Classic) | 65,209 (Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Kain without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | |Resist| | | | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow, Stop, Stun **Moveset:** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Jump (deal heavy physical jump damage to one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Tauntaliate and forget it. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 3&amp;8: Dwarven Castle** ###**Boss:** Golbez &amp; Shadow Dragon **Boss HP:** 5,342 (Golbez, Classic) | 3,082 (Shadow Dragon, Classic) | 48,153 (Golbez, Elite) | 27,781 (Shadow Dragon, Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Golbez without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances (Golbez):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak^1|Weak^1|Weak^1| | | |Weak| | **Elemental Resistances (Shadow Dragon):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Weak| | **Status Vulnerabilities (both):** Slow, Stun **Moveset (Golbez):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Fira (deal moderate magical fire damage to one target) * Blizzara (deal moderate magical ice damage to one target) * Thundara (deal moderate magical thunder damage to one target) * Drain (deal moderate magical damage to one target, recovering HP proportional to the damage) * Bio (deal magical bio damage to one target) * Cold Air (Paralyze all targets) **Moveset (Shadow Dragon):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Black Fang (Instantly Kill one target) **Notes and Strategies:** ^1 Golbez switches between Fire, Ice, and Thunder vulnerability at random on his turn. When he's vulnerable to one, he's neutral to the other two. He is always vulnerable to Holy. All of Golbez's attacks except his basic Attack command and Cold Air are Reflectable, so Carbuncle chumps him. Black Fang is still an issue, however, so kill Shadow Dragon quickly. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 4&amp;9: Land of Summoned Monsters** ###**Boss:** Asura **Boss HP:** 10,173 (Classic) | 61,207 (Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Asura without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Absorb|Absorb|Absorb| | |Absorb| | | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow, Stun **Moveset (Mercy):** * Curaga (recover large HP) * Counter Fight (activates in response to physical attacks; deal physical damage to one target) **Moveset (Anger):** * Protect (grant Protect to one target) * Counter Fight (activates in response to physical attacks; deal physical damage to one target) **Moveset (Laughter):** * Raise (revive one target) * Counter Fight (activates in response to physical attacks; deal physical damage to one target) ###**Boss:** Leviathan **Boss HP:** 12,433 (Classic) | 74,809 (Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Leviathan without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Absorb|Weak|Resist|Resist|Absorb| | | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Slow, Blind, Stun **Moveset:** * Tsunami (deal heavy magical water damage to all targets) * Blizzaga (deal moderate magical ice damage to all targets) * Blizzara (deal magical ice damage to all targets) * Blizzara (deal moderate magical ice damage to one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Asura changes faces randomly on her turn. Reflect on Asura prevents her from healing/Protecting herself, and she does not counter magical attacks, so relying on AOE spells or Summons or using Tauntaliate will prevent you from taking any damage at all from her. Leviathan is 100% pure magical damage so prepare defenses accordingly. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 5&amp;10: Cave of Bahamut** ###**Boss:** Bahamut **Boss HP:** 32,892 (Classic) | 165,449 (Elite) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Bahamut without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Resist|Resist|Null|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist| **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Slow, Stop, Blind, Stun **Moveset:** * Megaflare (deal moderate magical non-elemental damage to all targets, ignoring Reflect) * Counter-Reflect (activates in response to magical attacks; grant Reflect to self) **Notes and Strategies:** Bahamut counts down from 5 to 0. On 0, he casts Megaflare, then resets the count. Bahamut does nothing for his first five turns, so there's no excuse not to have maximum mitigation up for the Megaflare if you even let him get that far. AOE Magic Barrier (Tyro BSB, Arc SSB, Rosa SSB, Selphie SSB, etc) also completely and utterly nullifies his offense. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX Confrontation With Destiny** ###**Boss:** Calcobrina **Boss HP:** 28,746 (Calco &amp; Brina, each) | 71,865 (Calcobrina) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Calcobrina without being KO'd. Do not let Calcobrina form. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Slow, Blind, Berserk, Stun **Break Resistances (all):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Calco/Brina):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Counter Attack (activates in response to physical attacks; deal physical damage to one target) **Moveset (Calcobrina):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Hold (Paralyze all targets) * Gaze (Confuse one target) * Counter Attack (activates in response to physical attacks; deal physical damage to one target) * Counter Flame (activates in response to fire damage; deal magical fire damage to one target) * Counter Tsunami (activates in response to water damage; deal moderate magical water damage to all targets) * Counter Lightning (activates in response to thunder damage; deal heavy thunder damage to all targets, proportional to their current HP) ###**Boss:** Golbez &amp; Shadow Dragon **Boss HP:** 74,739 (Golbez) | 43,119 (Shadow Dragon) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Golbez without being KO'd. Exploit Golbez's weakness to holy attacks. **Elemental Resistances (Golbez):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak^1|Weak^1|Weak^1| | | |Weak| | **Elemental Resistances (Shadow Dragon):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Weak| | **Status Vulnerabilities (both):** Slow, Stun **Break Resistances (both):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Golbez):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Fira (deal moderate magical fire damage to one target) * Blizzara (deal moderate magical ice damage to one target) * Thundara (deal moderate magical thunder damage to one target) * Drain (deal moderate magical damage to one target, recovering HP proportional to the damage) * Bio (deal magical bio damage to one target) * Cold Air (Paralyze all targets) **Moveset (Shadow Dragon):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Black Fang (Instantly Kill one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Calco and Brina will form Calcobrina if the last Calco dies before the last Brina or vice-versa. You must defeat the last Calco and the last Brina at the same time with an AOE attack to get the medals. ^1 Golbez switches between Fire, Ice, and Thunder vulnerability at random on his turn. When he's vulnerable to one, he's neutral to the other two. He is always vulnerable to Holy. While Calco and Brina are 100% single target physical damage, beware of using Tauntaliate against them as that makes it very hard to control when they die. You need to use an AOE to finish them off or they'll form Calcobrina who is both much harder and a lost medal condition. Golbez, meanwhile, is still critically vulnerable to Carbuncle. Make sure you kill Shadow Dragon ASAP again to prevent Black Fang from taking anyone out. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX+ Mad Scientist** ###**Boss:** Lugaeborg **Boss HP:** 175,625 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Lugaeborg without being KO'd. Exploit Lugaeborg's weakness to thunder attacks. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | |Weak| | | | | | | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow, Stun **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset:** * Attack (deal heavy physical damage to one target) * Flamethrower (deal moderate magical fire damage to all targets) * Poison Gas (deal magical bio damage to all targets) * Treatment (recover one abnormal status) * Beam (deal heavy ranged physical damage to one target) * Laser (deal massive ranged physical damage to one target) * Counter Sleeping Gas (activates in response to physical attacks; Sleep one target) **Notes and Strategies:** There really isn't much to this fight. You do need mixed mitigation unless you bring Tauntaliate (all his physical damage is single target and Retaliatable), but he's really not incredibly dangerous. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX++ Onslaught of the Trinity** ###**Boss:** Magus Sisters **Boss HP:** 83,928 (Sandy &amp; Mindy, each) | 103,446 (Cindy) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat the Magus Sisters without being KO'd. Remove Cindy's Reflect status. Defeat Cindy first. **Status Vulnerabilities (Cindy):** Poison, Blind, Sap, Berserk, Stun **Status Vulnerabilities (Mindy/Sandy):** Poison, Blind, Sap, Stun **Break Resistances (all):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Sandy):** * Attack (deal physical damage to all targets) * Cura (recover large HP to one target) * Slow (Slow one target) * Berserk (Berserk one target) * Confusion (Confuse one target) * Reflect (grant Reflect to one target) **Moveset (Cindy):** * Attack (deal heavy physical damage to one target) * Arise (fully revive one target) * Attack (deal physical damage to all targets) **Moveset (Mindy):** * Bio (deal magical bio damage to one target) * Fira (deal moderate magical fire damage to one target) * Blizzara (deal moderate magical ice damage to one target) * Thundara (deal moderate magical thunder damage to one target) * Delta Fira (deal heavy magical fire damage to one target) * Delta Blizzara (deal heavy magical ice damage to one target) * Delta Thundara (deal heavy magical thunder damage to one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Sandy is the tall one in the back, Cindy is the rounded one in the middle, and Mindy is the little one in the front. Cindy will revive her sisters if they die before she does. This fight isn't as easy as the FF10 Magus Sisters fights, but it's still not too terribly bad as long as you survive the first Delta Attack. Cindy isn't all that durable and without her around you're safe to use Carbuncle and Tauntaliate to mitigate all remaining damage. --- &amp;nbsp; ##** Fiend of Wind** ###**Boss:**  Barbariccia Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Default|140|249,551|562|882|547|1346|391|500 Spinning| | |547|1206|538|1763|391|550 **Medal Conditions:** Disrupt Barbariccia's spin with a jump ability.

Barbariccia always starts the fight by casting Haste on herself, so be ready with your Dispel/Banishing Strike. She has mixed physical and magical damage, but it's mostly magical so hedge your bets in that direction. If doing a quest run on her, I strongly recommend a physical team since she doesn't counter physical attacks in her Default state. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**+ King and Queen of Summoned Monsters** ###**Boss:** + Asura &amp; + Leviathan Phase|LVL|HP|ATK|DEF|MAG|RES|MND|SPD ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Asura, All Faces|160|121,280|668|1143|729|1638|860|450 Leviathan, Default|160|169,153|641|1778|662|2321|430|400 Leviathan, Weak| | |721|1778|718|2321|430|550 **Medal Conditions:** Reduce Leviathan's magic.

She switches between Mercy and Anger (red face) states with a 30% chance at the end of each of her turns; she can switch to the state she is currently in. She will automatically switch to Laughter state (purple face) if Leviathan is dead and raise him on her next turn. Leviathan switches to Weak state at 50% HP. A Knight with Draw Fire helps immensely by tanking Asura's physical attacks and Leviathan's first couple of turns of basic attacks. Leviathan's water-elemental physical attacks are NAT type and thus ignore Draw Fire, unfortunately. Lean heavily on magical mitigation because Tsunami *hurts* even through wall + Full Break + Shell. If bringing a quest party, I very strongly recommend Paladin Cecil, since he can use Banishing Strike to remove buffs and Draw Fire to tank Asura's attacks. Physical or magical doesn't matter as much in this fight since Asura counters all attacks in this version, so just bring your best/best-fitting 4 FF4 characters plus Rydia. Don't forget that Asura absorbs thunder damage! The only elements which neither Asura nor Leviathan resist are holy, dark, and bio, so if you bring AOE make sure they're one of those or non-elemental."
257,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,[Forgotten Bond] Quick Relic Analysis - ...AHEM! There are SAND on these relics!,22,44vc85,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/44vc85/forgotten_bond_quick_relic_analysis_ahem_there/,2016-02-09 17:16:21,"**ETA: Feb 8** First off, I'd like to apologize for the lateness of this. I've beenreally busy with school ~~and Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth, which if there are any fellow digimon fans in the reddit, please grab it if you own a vita or PS4, it's so good~~ and so I haven't been on my computer as of recently, thus unable to type this up. As I speak, I also am in the middle of a project but I want to at least get this out to you! Please forgive me if there are any initial errors. So finally, our favorite ~~waiter~~ clown general, Kefka, is here! Uwee-hee-hee! Not only that, Terra becomes the second Black Mage to break her limits! (but yet doesn't trance...) As always, Best/Good/Selective/Okay relics! --- Banner 1 | Banner 2 | Shared ----- | ----- | ----- Maduin Horn (Terra; SSB) | Kefka's Cloak (Kefka) | Magus Rod (Rod) Lamia Flute (Kefka) | Dragon Claw (Sabin) | Thief Bracer (Bangle) Drill (Edgar) | Soul Sabre (Celes) | Crystal Mail (H. Armor) Holy Lance (Mog) | Sasuke (Shadow) | Assassin Dagger (Dagger) | | Gaia Gear (Robe) (note: I almost put Naruto where I put the character's name, oops) --- **Best** Terra's new relic is her SSB relic, the **Maduin Horn** (Banner 1)! The stats are really nice for a black stick (118 MAG is the best magic stat for a good bit til Vivi's Mace of Zeus which isn't for another month, the rest being 50 ATK and 61 MND) and as it's a Mage SSB, Terra will get +10 Mag for mastering her SSB which only buffs her over Rinoa. Also, let us not forget about the SSB. So, we have Terra's ~~trance form~~ magitek suit shooting 10 non-elemental magic attacks a a single foe. As we all know, 10-hits means they're not going to hit for much, but the multiple hits means you can *boost* her magic. The SSB being NE also means they're not going to have to deal with weaknesses which is really nice. Overall, this is the best relic because the SSB is solid and powerful and the rod is the best you're going to get for a good bit. Following along, **Kefka's Cloak** (Banner 2) appears (with Kefka's body). Mage meta players will be making good use of this as the SB lets Kefka boost party magic by 20% (status 601) and it grants haste, letting your mages go a little faster! The stats are pretty solid for any mage who can equip light armor (17 MAG, 107 DEF/RES) and gives your mages a good magic buff to whatever magic they had. It's the best mage relic out there for mage teams, tied with Lulu's Hairpins. Good villains get good relics (GVGGR). **Good** To compliment Kefka's Mage Meta relic, we have Mog's **Holy Lance** (Banner 1). The only reason this is in good is because it's a spear but the thing is, if you have this spear, you'll probably be using Mog as it's a very *niche* spear. The spear has 103 ATK and 95 MND and all the while the attack is low, it makes up for it by giving a great mind stat for Mog to use. Only other characters who can properly equip this spear is Ashe and Penelo who can take advantage of the mind stat. The SB is for those physical parties and it boosts the party's ATK by 30% (s. 603) and grants high regen. Although it's no PP, it gives a great substitute for the lack of ATK boost. It's a great spear over all, but it's *niche* in who can use it. However, it provide a fantastic SB and has good stats, it's really good. Also, that animation! Sabin punches in with his **Dragon Claws** (Banner 2) which is another great physical relic with 121 ATK and a SB that fits for a physical party. The SB allows Sabin to boost the party's ATK by 30% and blow 3 AOE hits to the enemy, which is effective on a physical character. If you hadn't thought about using Sabin and use a physical party, this relic would definitely make you consider him. Also, fists have a good selection of characters you can pick from, even if it's not as expansive, that can make use of it's stat (Nanaki for Support, Gilgamesh for Reta, etc). It's overall a solid relic that is good for your party if you use physical teams. ~~Naruto's~~ Shadow's **Sasuke** (Banner 2) lands a spot here for being a ranged SB and being a solid weapon. Sasuke ~~ran away from the village~~ is a katana with 116 ATK *and 10 MAG* that grants Shadow the SB of ~~INTERCEPTOR KILLING EVERYTHING~~ Wild Fang, that does 4 hits to a single enemy and has a chance for Sap (16%). It's overall a solid Katana as there's a good lack of them and sap is a good status most bosses don't block it. Also, that 10 random magic might not do much, but a little boost is better than none. Edgar's **Drill** (Banner 1) digs a place here as it's a ~~drill~~ spear with 118 ATK **and 20 DEF**. This odd defensive spear just so happens to work nicely with Edgar and even physical characters who need a tiny boost in DEF. The SB allows you to set up defense even further as it boosts DEF (s.604) by 50% and hits an enemy with 3-hits. Solid overall and nothing you can say that really knocks it down! Kefka's **Lamia's Flute** (Banner 1) is a ~~flute~~ instrument that grants 79 ATK and 116 MAG. As a instrument, it's solid for Kefka with a strong MAG and as an instrument, the attack is able to let him auto and do some good damage on lower difficulties and maybe even a bit of higher ones, especially from the back row (since it's ranged). The SB does 3 AoE NE hits as he attempts to land Blind and Paralysis procs on the enemies. It's an effective weapon for black mages who can equip instruments, but unfortunately, that honor only goes to Kefka and Desch (III character, won't even be around until estimated around May). Still, it's solid over all, but it definitely could use work. The shared **Crystal Mail** is REALLY useful for anyone who can use this heavy armor. The stats are good for a physical battle (113 DEF, 57 RES) and the SB is Draw Fire. Using it, especially with anyone who can use Lifesiphon or SB booster RM, you can set up a good tank or if you use Retaliate, you can go for Tauntulate a bit better. Overall, pretty good. **Selective** Sorry Celes, your **Soul Sabre** (Banner 2) goes here. In a few days, Exdeath will come and he will just just show you what Runic is REALLY about. The sword has been around since the early days of the first (and only) survival events and has 109 ATK, which now is considerably low for a sword. The SB allows you to absorb any single target black magic and in return, use it to restore your abilities. It's great against enemies who use magic that's not AOE. It's a gimmick SB that has its uses, but this relic is truly a timed relic now. However, when Relm comes, you'll get your SSB which just outclasses this pitiful sword. See you then though. The shared **Magus Rod** is a rod with 104 MAG, 34 ATK, and 59 MND. It's useful if you don't have any other FF6 rod. It has a single hit ice magic attack with a magic break (-30%) on it. The SB-less **Gaia Gear** goes here. Stats are decent for a robe with 81 DEF and 125 RES, but the thing is there's also an earth resist on it. It has its uses. **Okay** The shared **Thief's Bracer** is a bangle with an AoE Slow (40% proc), which is useful. The stats are decent. (21 ATK, 18 MAG/MND, 84 DEF, 81 RES). It's alright but it's not completely terrible. AoE Slow has its uses and if you have a suck default SB, this can help it out. SB-less **Assassin's Dagger** has 97 ATK, which is decent for a dagger and a death proc. It's there if you need synergy and you know you're going up against an enemy with a vulnerability to death. --- **Overall:** The relic pool is very interesting. The biggest thing to note is some of these relics are very gimmicky while others are very solid and you should consider what's best suited for you team. Need good Mage weapons? Kefka and Terra have you covered while Mog's spear makes him a solid WM to add to your team. Physical party? Then the Figaro siblings, Celes, and Shadow have you covered. **Should I Pull:** If you need VI synergy or like Terra or need some good boosts to your team. It's a good banner but not well suited all together. As before, make sure you check on what you need or want before you actually pull. Mage gear? Physical gear? Or is it a pull for your favorite game/character? The next banner for VI is *Relm's Banner* which contains SSBs for Relm (AoE heal (h85) + Strong Regen), Shadow (8-hit single target + Self-Mirage 2; has 0 charge time), Celes (Runic II (Absorbs Blk+Wht magic) + hits a single enemy 5 times), and brings Terra's SSB back. Strago also gets a new relic then. For the **SSSSBFest**, Locke gets a new SSB relic that allows him to hit 1 enemy 8 times. Taking away, we have *BSBFest* which Terra gets her BSB which lets her summon her daddy [:^)] and grant herself 2 commands of dual magic attacks (Fire/None + Water/None in place of the atk and def buttons). Finally, in **Gau's** Banner, Edgar and Sabin get SSBs. Edgar's Chainsaw makes enemies weak to poison and does 6-random hits. Sabin gives all allies mirage while hitting a enemy 8 times. Man, what is it with VI and 8? (also Cyan gets an SSB and Relm's return). Shadow's relic returns here with Interceptor. So while Terra gets a flashy BSB in the future, she doesn't really upgrade to anything else, Celes getting a improved Runic, Shadow's Sasuke return. Sabin and Edgar get upgrades in the future and Kefka just stays Kefka. **Rating:** 6.5/10 Thanks to [Sandslice](/u/Sandslice) for his relic discussions and [kaonohiokala](/u/kaonohiokala) for their spreadsheet of all relic data! **Upcoming Events:** * The Malice Within (Exdeath; Galuf MC2) (ETA: Feb 15) * Destiny's Path (Jecht; Yuna MC2) (ETA: Feb 21) * The Lone Wolf's Lament -Cloudy Wolf- (Tifa MC2; Cloud Dress/BSSB) (ETA: Feb 27) * A Meeting Beyond Time (Laguna; Selphie MC2) (ETA: March 4) * A Summoner Reborn (Freya; Garnet MC2) (ETA: March 10) * Accessory of Light (WoL MC2) (ETA: March 26) * Chamber of Rituals (8 new MC2s, pick 4 MC2s) (ETA: ???) Also to note, I'm checking the Event Spreadsheet and it seems we may have another Festival soon after Destiny's Path. Maybe not, but the more important thing to note here is that **the first Abyss (Memory of Ultima) will be here soon too!** (thanks to [Col_Mobius](/u/Col_Mobius) for maintaining that!)

258,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Something interesting with Healer RM,10,46d54q,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/46d54q/something_interesting_with_healer_rm/,2016-02-18 16:04:42,"I have premade parties built ready to take on daily dungeons through auto-battle. I use haste RMs and Thunderstrike with one using the healer RM to help mitigate the occasional hit. Well today I accidently manually targeted an enemy with my Healer whm (mog), who hit for 3100. Target was undead, naturally. There's a stark difference between the attack formula and the healing formula it seems, because I get healed for less than 500 hp when targeting a player, and even accounting for x2 damage for vulnerability, that' still 1550 damage. Incidently, I would LOVE for healer RM to cure 1500 hp to a player, but it doesn't happen. Don't think this info will change anyone's playstyle unless you like the healer RM and are going into undead-heavy dungeons. Mog had 313 Mind for this, by the way, I imagine the damage would be higher with higher mind. And of course, the target would need to be undead. FFVI daily dungeon has 3/4 undead mobs."
259,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,FFRK Character Review - Kefka,39,46hlj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/46hlj8/ffrk_character_review_kefka/,2016-02-19 10:15:40,"#**Kefka - The Mage (HE DESERVES A BETTER TITLE)** #**Stats, Equipment &amp; Abilities** Kefka is a Black Mage with access to a large variety of both offensive and supportive skills. The following are his important stats at level 65 compared to other similar characters. | Character| HP | ATK | DEF| MAG| RES| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:| |*Kefka*|*3889*|*110*|*81*|*135*|**135**| |Quistis|3883|111|76|132|115| |Golbez|**4530**|110|**110**|135|130| |Rikku|4380|**130**|93|80|90| |Terra|4314|90|76|**154**|130| **Equipment:** Dagger, Rod, Staff, Instrument| Shield, Hat, Light Armor, Robe, Bracer **Abilities:** Black Magic 5, Support 3, Dancer 4, Bard 5 **Soulbreak:** *Exhilarating Magic* - Randomly cast either Fira, Thundara, or Blizzara. | *Havoc Wing* - Deal three non-elemental magic attacks to all targets with a chance to both Blind and Paralyze. (3.15x magic damage per attack, 21% chance of Blind, 16% chance of Paralyze) | *Magic Infusion* - Grants Haste to all allies and temporarily increase their MAG. (MAG +20% for 25 secs, grants Haste) #**Comparing:** &amp;nbsp; ##**PROS** * It's freaking Kefka. * I like to consider Kefka as the magical version of Rikku. Both have quite the variety of abilities however don't exactly excel at anything. * One of two characters (other being Cait Sith) who has access to 4+ abilities from both the Bard and Dancer skill groups. * Black Magic 5 gives Kefka access to every current and future Black Magic spell. His MAG isnt the best, however one of the great things about Black Magic is that a slightly low MAG stat doesnt even matter if youre exploiting an elemental vulnerability. * Dancer 4 gives him the exact same power a 4 Support has, and lets you play him as a supportive caster, which can be extremely useful especially in mage parties. * Bard is a bit underrated though for good reasons as we yet to even have a 5 Bard skill. The AoE ATK and MAG buffs can always come in handy in full AD/AP comps though, and we shouldnt forget the 4 Bard skills are exact replicas of Protectga and Shellga! This means you can essentially play him like a Sage or Paladin with Protect/Shellga in one ability spot, and an offensive spell in the other. * 3 Support is probably the weakest out of all his abilities however it still lets him use Boost and Status Busters. * Pretty good equipment kit with standard Mage gear as well as Instruments, Light Armor and Shields. &amp;nbsp; ##**CONS** * The main problem with Kefka, is that he's only useful when you need either Bard or Dancer abilities. As a Black Mage, his defensive stats are pretty good, but are outclassed by Reno and Golbez, and his MAG is significantly lower than other strong Black Mages like Terra, Terra or even Terra. * It also doesn't help that FFVI already has quite a few Black Mages. I'd say Kefka is better than Strago and Celes as a Black Mage, buuuut then you have Terra! * Bard as an ability set has a lot of potential, but DeNa hasn't released any new Bard skills in over 6 months! The ones we do have are all decent skills but really aren't anything game changing like 5 Dancer for example. * Dancer skills are awesome but we're still missing a couple of them and honing them might be a pain for people who have already have high honed Breakdowns. * His MND is one of the lowest in the games. I don't have the exact numbers on how long the duration of Protect/Shell changes based on the character's MND, but he has 50-60 MND less than the Paladins and over 90 MND less than several White Mages which will definitely lower the duration of Spellbend and Enveloping Etude (Shellga and Protectga) as well as status effect magic. * He has yet to get an MC2 or even any other unique weapons in the Japanese version. A bit surprising considering Kefka'a popularity but it's been a while since Japan had a FF6 event so hopefully he'll get some new things soon! &amp;nbsp; #**Conclusion:** It's actually a bit funny how they portrayed Kefka in FFRK. I mean he kinda dances when he walks around and I guess his [signature laugh](URL is beautiful enough to buff your whole party, but honestly it was a strange character approach. While it is strange, hes one of TWO characters (Three including Tyro) who can use high level skill from both Dancer and Bard and is also one of two Black Mages who has Bard (Other being FFIII Desch) and one of two Mages with Dancer (other being FFI Echo). This can open some unique possibilities, however hes outclassed by others in all three of his individual classes. His MAG isnt high enough to play him as a main caster and his HP and DEF are good but are outclassed by other Mages, Dancers, and Bards. 4/5 Bard | 4.5/5 Dancer &gt;We literally have 4 Bards in the global version and in the next 6 months well only be getting three others, so Kefka doesnt have much competition here. I dont think Bard suits him as well as it does on Rikku or Edward though because Kefka has much better offensive ability options. I think the Black Mage/Dancer combo is actually excellent especially on bosses with multiple parts as you can chain the Dances (which affect all enemies) with AoE Black Magic spells like Ruinga and Meteor. Unfortunately he doesnt have Dancer 5 which actually could have made him a top tier character. 3/5 Black Mage &gt;I really dont see any reason in using him as a full Black Mage. If you want a tanky caster, Reno and Golbez both crush him in DEF and HP and have the exact same MAG as him, and obviously there are many casters with higher MAG, some of them even match or have higher HP than Kefka. 3.5/5 Overall &gt;He can bring ability combinations no other character has, however whether or not youd ever use him is almost entirely dependant on if you need Dancer/Bard skills as well as an extra caster. 4/5 Overall W/ Relic &gt;So his Havoc Wing SB is good like most other caster SBs however the status debuffs are common immunities on bosses, so a Break effect or a Slow/Stun would have been much more useful against most bosses. His Magic Infusion SB however seems to be one of the best Soulbreaks for mage parties. One of the main reasons you would pick LH/Boon over SG/SSII as a RW is for the Haste those two SBs bring even though SS/SG provides a stronger defensive buff. With Kefkas Cape SB, it eliminates the need to bring a Haste RW which can be really useful. Some problems with this SB though is that his very low MND will lower the duration of Haste, and of course the MAG buff will only be useful if you have other Mages in the party. *Im back!

As such, **Carbuncle strats may not work very well** unless you can clear the adornments in 3 rounds. I recommend mitigating the damage with Wall + SHellga for phase 1. **EDIT2:** ~~Barthandelus's counter Dispel seems to have a low chance of triggering. Watch [this video](URL from 4:00 onwards. A lot of direct attacks at Barty but little Dispels were seen.~~ Barty's Counter Dispel has 30% chance of happening * Unlike other versions of Barthandelus we have seen, the Ultimate version of Barthandelus **does not use Doom** after both adornments are destroyed. * The biggest and most important thing to note is that Barthandelus may counter any attack with Dispel that removes buffs from **all targets**, and this Dispel **removes SG/SS2 as well**.

262,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,FFRK Character Review - Edge,28,4100mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/4100mm/ffrk_character_review_edge/,2016-01-15 09:31:05,"#**Edge - The Prince of Eblan** #**Stats, Equipment &amp; Abilities** Edge is a Celerity fighter who can also use both Ninja and Thief skills. The following are his important stats at level 65 compared to other similar characters. | Character| HP | ATK| MAG | DEF | RES | |:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:| |*Edge*|**4271**|*137*|*100*|*87*|**105**| |Shadow|4530|135|100| 87|**105**| |Yuffie^(JP)|4200|132|**128**| 87|85| |Bartz|4700|**140**|95|**105**|90| |Locke|**4745**|137|80|92|100| EDIT: Added MAG stats. *Yuffie isnt released yet, but will be very soon.* **Equipment:** Dagger, Katana, Fist, Thrown | Hat, Light Armor, Bracer **Abilities:** Ninja 5, Thief 4, Celerity 5, Combat 2 **Soulbreak:** *Eblan Stunner* - Deal physical damage to one target, with a small chance to paralyze it. (1.5x physical) | *Eblan Water Veil* - Deal three physical water attacks to all targets with a high chance to interrupt their actions. (1.15x water physical damage per attack, 100% chance of Stun. #**Comparing:** &amp;nbsp; ##**PROS** * Even if you don't have a Katana or Fist, we all have a 5 Thrown weapon now that Edge can use in the back row. * Thief and Celerity is a great combo! Giving him Steal Armor and putting him in the backrow is also a nice combo that'll make him pretty tanky. * There are a few Ninja skills now and he has access to Thrown weapons so if you have either Rinoa's or Hope's unique weapons Edge might be able to do decent damage with the Ninja Scrolls. * Sap isn't the most common vulnerability on bosses but the Ninja skillset is the only one currently that has a skill that inflicts Sap. &amp;nbsp; ##**CONS** * It sucks, but not having Swords is a pretty huge weakness for physical characters. * If you have Ashe or Terra's MAG Swords, it would help him deal more damage with Scrolls, buuut he can't equip Swords. The only way you can really get him a high MAG is if you have either Hope/Rinoa's Thrown weapon, or Edge's own Katana. * His Armor options are alright, but he doesn't have Helms, Shields or Heavy Armor so if you have a good Armor piece from any of those types, Edge might not be the best character for you. * Preeeeetty bad stats for a physical character. His DEF and HP are lower or on par with some of the casters, and unlike Mages, you're probably going to have him in the front row. * I'm still super confused about the Ninja scrolls, but it does seem like they're only really useful if you don't have your Black Magic honed yet or against bosses that cast Reflect. Either way, Edge is dependant on unique weapons to give him a reasonably high MAG. * We're getting a ton of Thief/Celerity characters recently and while it is a pretty great combo, there's no reason to use Edge outside of FFIV realms because there are other Thieves that simply outclass him in Equipment, Abilities and Stats. * He only has 1 other unique weapon and doesn't have a SSB or MC2 yet. &amp;nbsp; #**Conclusion:** We've been getting a lot of Thief/Celerity characters recently. DeNa likes to give these characters a third ability option unique to that character though. Locke has high SPD, Bartz has basically everything, Faris has Support, Rikku has Dance/Bard. Edge has Ninja which has potential but DeNa hasn't really put too much into helping Ninja's perform better in FFRK. 2.5/5 Thief/Celerity &gt;The only time to use Edge over other characters in this role is if you have his 5 Relic and/or are in a FFIV realm. As I said before, it's a great combo but he just gets way too outclassed! 4/5 Ninja &gt;Like most of the other small ability types there isn't much competition between Ninja's. I'm still not exactly sure how important MAG is on Ninja's because if it's actually really useful, Yuffie might be better as she has a 20~ MAG advantage over Edge. 3/5 Overall &gt;Another character that's useable but doesn't bring anything special. Even in FFIV realms you might not find yourself using Edge since there are quite a few other strong characters from the realm, but his Steal skills and Celerity 5 are always useful. 3/5 Overall W/ Relic &gt;So since I started rating characters with their unique relics, I've always increased their rating because I figured if you have a character relic there's a higher chance of you wanting to use the character. A lot of the damage dealing SBs though aren't really high priority unlike Medicas or Buffs. In Edge's case, the 100% chance of Stun is nice, but other than that you'd probably only want to use it in FFIV realms or against bosses weak to water. [Other Character Reviews](URL "
263,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,FFRK Character Review - Yuffie,30,422b6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/422b6w/ffrk_character_review_yuffie/,2016-01-22 09:04:03,"#**Yuffie - The Materia Hunter** #**Stats, Equipment &amp; Abilities** Yuffie is a badass Ninja/Thief who can be used in both the front and back rows. The following are her important stats at level 65 compared to other similar characters. | Character| HP | ATK| DEF | MAG | RES | |:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:| |*Yuffie*|*4200*|*132*|*87*|**128**|*85*| |Edge|4271|**137**|87|100|**105**| |Shadow|**4530**|135|87|100|**105**| |Rikku|4380|130|93|80|90| |Faris|4010|125|80|80|93| **Equipment:** Dagger, Katana, Fist, Bow, Thrown | Hat, Light Armor, Bracer **Abilities:** Ninja 5, Black Magic 3, Celerity 4, Thief 5, ~~Dancer 4~~ **Soulbreak:** *Grease Lightning* - Deal physical damage to one target. (1.5x physical damage) | *Landscaper* - Targets all enemies with three Earth elemental ranged physical attacks and a medium chance to inflict Slow. (1.2x Earth elemental physical per attack, 20% chance of Slow) | *Clear Tranquil* - Instantly recovers all allies HP based on their max HP. (Restores 40% of all allies max HP, no charge time) #**Comparing:** &amp;nbsp; ##**PROS** * Who the hell doesnt like Yuffie!? * Her equipment is a bit strange considering she only really had Thrown in FF7. Like the fact that you can equip Sephiroth's Masamune on this lil Ninja is actually hilarious. * Adding onto the last point, while it is strange, its also very good. Katanas, Fists, Bows, and Thrown each have at least one weapon with both a good ATK and MAG which is perfect for Ninjas like Yuffie. * Her Armor isnt the best for a physical character, but I dont think shes really meant to be used as a Celerity/Thief fighter like Locke or Bartz, and instead is more of a Supportive Caster and in that case her Armor is fine. * 5 Ninja is actually pretty good on Yuffie. She has the highest MAG by far out of all the other Ninjas so shes easily the best for the Ninja Scrolls (besides Tyro). * 5 Thief is also great as it lets her debuff enemies, as well as buff herself. I think other characters can take advantage of Steal Power better than Yuffie, but giving her Steal Armor and putting her in the back row can actually be a good combo. Shes also one of the characters who can take full advantage of Thiefs Raid in JPN. * 4 Celerity lets her use the important Celerity skill we currently have. *Tempo Flurry* and Dismissal are two of the best physical abilities in the game and she can use both of them! * 3 Black Magic isnt that useful but does let her use some Status Effect magic which can come in handy! * As I said before, her MAG stat is the highest out of all the Ninjas. This is actually awesome because the main problems with the other Ninjas was that they couldnt take advantage of their own Ninja Scrolls, and were outclassed by other Thief/Celerity fighters. Yuffie isnt the strongest physically, but because of her high MAG she should be able to use the various Ninja Scrolls effectively on those high RES or multiple part bosses. * She has 4 unique 5 weapons all with pretty good SBs, especially the instant AoE heal, and a MC2 in Japan * I actually almost published this review without even realizing Yuffie didn't get her 4 Dancer when she first came out. I'm not exactly sure when the 4 Dance skills come out, but hopefully Yuffie gets her buff as those abilities are released because they're actually very good and essentially make Yuffie a viable Support. &amp;nbsp; ##**CONS** * Though her MAG is high for a physical character, she is still very dependant on 5 weapons. There arent any 1-4 Katanas, Fists, Daggers or Thrown weapons with MAG so unless you have those specific 5 weapons it would probably still be a better idea to use Tyro for getting high damage with Ninja Scrolls. * She doesn't have Swords and Helms while other thieves do so she might not be the best physical thief. * She also doesn't have Heavy Armor, Shields or Robes. None of those are very good Armor types but if you have a good 5 of one of those types you might not want to use Yuffie. * It is unfortunate that they didn't give her Rods. While it doesn't make sense from FF7 logic, neither does giving her Katanas or Fists! I would really have loved to see what a full MAG ninja could do! * Surprisingly bad RES. Giving the fact that casters tend to have high RES, and the other Ninjas have the highest RES out of nearly all of the physical characters, its strange how low her RES actually is! At a time where bosses have extremely strong magic attacks this could leave Yuffie more vulnerable than others if you dont give her a Hat or good Light Armor/Bracer. &amp;nbsp; #**Conclusion:** Yuffie is a very unique character, which is always something we should be excited for in a game where your typical sword wielding warriors runs everything. Shes one of those characters who a lot of us might not use but if you have a 5 relic that she can use (Katanas, preferable Edges, Hope/Rinoas Thrown, Maria/Serahs Bows, Paloms Dagger) she can become a really useful addition to your party. If you dont have a 5 she can use, she probably wont see much unless you really need Scrolls against a specific boss because shes outclassed in her other roles. Once she gets Dancer this might change as Dance gets some really good skills and they synergize very well with Ninja since both are AoE. 5/5 Ninja &gt;Yuffies gonna take the top Ninja spot for now as she brings a lot of different things to a party and is the only Ninja with a really high MAG. Just waiting for Ramza though... 3/5 Thief/Celerity &gt;The Thief/Celerity combo works great on any characters with both these abilities however since we have so many of these characters now Yuffie is outclassed by characters like Bartz, Balthier, Locke, etc. in stats and equipment. 3.5/5 Overall &gt;Because shes dependant on relics to deal good scroll damage and is outclassed by others with physical abilities it might be hard to use Yuffie effectively. Shes still a good character with a pretty good weapon kit and lots of different abilities to use though. Once she gets her Dance skills and a MC2 in a few months we might see her be used more. 4.5/5 Overall W/ Relic &gt;Now her Landscaper SB isnt the best because its elemental and Earth is an element that's commonly resistant and is rarely a bosss vulnerability. Her Clear Tranquil is AWESOME though. An instant heal that cures for 40% of all allies max HP is super useful. Not exactly sure how much it would heal compared to a typical Medica like Yshtolas, Selphies, etc, but the fact that its instant is a good enough reason to use Yuffie in your party against bosses with AoE attacks. Her other two SBs in Japan are both pretty good as well. 8 single attacks + Sap is her next one, and a 3 hit AoE + Blink on all allies is her SSB I think! [Other Character Reviews](URL "

You'll still get countered though. * Otherwise, the ""proper"" way to approach the fight is to hit it with a regular attack, get countered (it will reveal its weakness), exploit its weakness, Spherimorph uses Elemental Shift, then you hit it with a regular attack again and you repeat this process until it dies. * Pray for no Press. ****** ###07: Mt.

265,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,The Source of Mist +++ a.k.a Fighting the fugly tree unscathed,23,3uzbjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3uzbjx/the_source_of_mist_aka_fighting_the_fugly_tree/,2015-12-01 20:52:12,"Heya All! Here we go again~ It's been a while since I wrote one of [these](URL **Bit of a preamble / rant:** Ok, I haven't been so heavily active on reddit the past week or so due to work commitments and what not but from what I have seen, there's ALOT and I mean *ALOT* of posts about the difficulty of Soul Cage. Which for the most part is warranted given the AoE speed wall that it is. As a result, it feels like many round here have tried to climb this tree, but fell and hit every single branch on the way down. And for the most part, we're not too good anymore. And some I hear tried climbing it 300+ times... My personal experiences with it weren't so bad. First run, I walked in half cocked with typical mitigation. And walked out about 6 or so S/L's later knowing I wouldn't beat it. Second run, 1 S/L only, and walked away with a relatively easy master. So, to everyone still struggling or to those who wish to farm but are worried, I offer you the following approach / set up guide. The other aim of this post is to consolidate all the helpful hints spread out through the MANY soulcage threads. **Preparing the Defense** ~ *How to take a hit from a fugly tree and still look good.* So for those who have fought it already, you already know full well what you're dealing with. For those that haven't, a quick wander to the [AI thread](URL by /u/TFMurphy reveals that its a giant pile of screw you AoE. There is a slight bias towards physical damage. It's also stupidly fast (for a tree) but comes with a blind vulnerability. (Thank goodness). As a result, the following defensive layers are suggested. - Blind on a character with Auto-Haste RM. In order of preference: Blindga (60%), Dark Buster or Blind (30%) and Yukikaze (20%. If you use Dark attack (10%)...Good luck. I'd recommend the auto-haste over the auto-full ATB RM due to its unreliability. **Heavily recommended** - Lunatic High / Boon / SG / SS2 as a RW or the actual character with Mako Might. I would recommend the hastega options, but work with what you got. If you're lucky enough to have the latter, it does free up your dps options. But alas, not everyone is so lucky. If you don't have access to one and don't want to use it as a RW, then you'll need another WM or Sage. - WM with either Protectga or Shellga, which ever was missed from the above. - Optional: Magic / Power break/down or equiv. ability on someone. Again if you have Red or Sazh, it will free up slots. And as Zidane is a coin requirement, he can easily tag along with Steal Power. The above recommendations are there to REDUCE the S/L's required. Unfortunately unlike the Bahamut fight, I cannot guarantee no S/L's but these should help ease the frustration. I'd also recommend a slight gear bias towards RES than DEF. **Prepping the Offense** ~ *aka how to chop down the tree, burn it or turn it into a landscape feature.* Where as the above defensive set up I would consider near mandatory, the offensive side of things are a little bit more lax. Albeit with some words of warning. Again back to the AI, you'll notice that Soulcage has a big chunk of DEF (550) and an even bigger chunk of RES [819] and if you burn it with fire, those stats rise by 100. As a result, I'd recommend a physical build if you have the gear for it over a magic build, especially since the monkey is required in the party. But as I recognize everyone has different gear, hones etc you'll have to make up your own mind. And for those with a serious lack of RS, there is always Advantilate. So whether you go Lumberjacking (pick Armor break/down) or burn / light it up (pick Mental break/down), or you feel like lighting an axe on fire (hybrid, full break it), its up to you. Now the word of warning. **DO NOT BURN THE TREE unless you have blind up**. It will instantly use Fire Blades. It will hurt. Your face will be both burning and ugly. Due to the stat raise, i'd recommend not burning it at all. And if you do, bring along Water / Ice spells. As for the Holy coin requirement, its up to you. Either bring Dia/ra/ga (if you're running magic, you should have this anyway), the Holy Attack RM, or just use Cure/ra/ga/ja on the tree. I found that if you get the mitigation up, your healer should actually have enough time to heal the tree as well. **Example Party Set up** ~ *aka Arborists in training.* With the above in mind, an example party would appear like this. * DPS * DPS Monkey (Zidane) * Mitigation Slave with Mako Might or Shellga / Protectga with Haste RM * Blind Slave with Haste RM (Oh gods did I just call a blind person a slave...) * Shellga / Protectga Healbot (w. Haste RM IF you dont have Hastega Slave.) Yep! Generic eh? My party ended up looking something like [this](URL Yes I have Yshtola with SS2, but I never used it. Yes I was lucky enough to have Vegas too. As you can see I ended up using the Adv method more so I could get the fight over and done with. Busy with life and work yo. You'll also notice a lot of things can be swapped in and out depending on what approach you use. Looking at it now, instead of Hope I could have used Terra or Golbez who can cast Blindga and then use dbl cut to increase the retal damage output, using the healbots cure instead to pass the coin requirement. HECK the monkey can steal DEF which has a bigger armor reduction... **The Fight** ~ *I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK, I sleep all night and I work all day~* Sad to say but this fight is won or lost in the first round. Recommend entering the fight with battle speed 1 or 2. Needless to say, the blind, hastega w. shellga and protectga should go off first round. If you eat a full AoE, I'd recommend S/L, if you eat a mitigated AoE, it should be possible to heal through it (I think I did...?). If you get blind off and you don't get hit, then you're sweet. The defensive set up above should help with this IMMENSELY. From here on wards, it should be pretty obvious what you do. Apply the secondary mitigation if not done so already, and proceed to chop / burn / light up the tree. Don't forget to reapply the secondary mitigation when applicable. Note that blind / shellga / protectga should last the duration of the fight. **Conclusion:** Hope this helps those still struggling with the battle and / or those who wish to farm the boss with however long we have left in this event. I myself will probably go somewhere else, most likely playing with dolls... As for credit...well there's a crap tonne to be given. There are a ridiculous amount of threads out there, with various player input. Too many for me to sort through. But you know who you are. Stay classy people. EDIT: Slight change with the 2nd defensive recommendation. EDIT2: I see the downvoter's are at it again."

I don't run Mage party often but there is always that one boss with sleep vulnerability. Thoughts? Edit: So it seems everyone is in agreement to keep both and was kinda leaning towards that myself but wanted a group opinion. Thanks all

This is a single path event rather than a classic/elite event. You must complete each stage before you can progress to the next in line. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 1: Mist Cave** ###**Boss:** Mist Dragon **Boss HP:** ~3,000 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Mist Dragon without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | |Resist| | |Absorb|Weak| **Special Status Immunities:** Haste, Protect, Shell, Reflect, Regen **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stun **Moveset (Default):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) **Moveset (Fog):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Freezing Mist (deal magical ice damage to all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** Mist Dragon changes back and forth between Default and Fog states at a set interval (likely every 3 turns). While in Fog state, Mist Dragon cannot be harmed and counters every attack with Freezing Mist. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 2: Underground Waterway** ###**Boss:** Octomammoth **Boss HP:** ~3,800 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Octomammoth without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | |Weak| | |Absorb|Absorb|Weak| **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Silence, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sap, Stun **Moveset:** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Blind it and/or Tauntaliate and move on. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 3: Antlion's Cave** ###**Boss:** Antlion **Boss HP:** ~10,260 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Antlion without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- |Weak| | | |Absorb| | | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Silence, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sap, Stun **Moveset:** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Pincers (activates in response to physical attacks; deal physical damage to one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Blind it and/or Tauntaliate and move on. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 4: Mt. Hobbs** ###**Boss:** Mom Bomb **Boss HP:** ~10,200 (Mom Bomb) | ? (Bombs &amp; Grenades) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Mom Bomb without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances (Mom Bomb):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Absorb|Weak|Resist| | |Weak| |Weak| **Elemental Resistances (Bombs &amp; Grenades):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Absorb|Weak| | | | | | | **Status Vulnerabilities (All):** Slow, Stop, Sap, Stun **Moveset (Mom Bomb, Default):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) **Moveset (Mom Bomb, Huge):** * Prepare to Explode (does nothing) * Huge Explosion (deal magical fire damage to all targets) **Moveset (Bombs &amp; Grenades):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Self-Destruct (activated in response to fire damage or after a certain number of turns passes; deal damage equal to remaining HP to one target, then die) **Notes and Strategies:** Mom Bomb transforms into Huge state at a specific HP threshold. After Huge Explosion, Mom Bomb transforms into three Bombs and three Grenades. It's possible (but untested) that you can avoid the whole splitting into Bombs and Grenades part of the fight by Stopping Mom Bomb herself before you kill her. Really though, any real AOE will take them all out at once at this early stage so it's not that worthwhile to try. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 5: Fabul Castle** ###**Boss:** Kain **Boss HP:** ~28,400 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Kain without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | |Resist| | | | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow, Stop, Stun **Moveset:** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Jump (deal ranged physical damage to one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Tauntaliate and move on. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 6: Mt.

Silencing Scarmiglione will stop his counter-Thunders and possibly his Drain. AOE will take out the Skullnants with little to no fuss. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 7: Mt. Ordeals Summit** ###**Boss:** Scarmiglione **Boss HP:** ~71,800 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Scarmiglione without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak|Absorb| |Absorb| | |Weak| | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow, Stop, Stun **Moveset:** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Gas (activates in response to fire damage; Poison, Silence, Blind, and Sleep all targets) * Cursed Elegy (activates in response to physical attacks; Slow all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** If you attack only via Retaliate and non-fire spells, Scarmiglione can't do much of anything to you. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 8: Mt. Ordeals Monument** ###**Boss:** Dark Knight **Boss HP:** ~92,600 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Dark Knight without being KO'd. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow, Stop, Stun **Moveset:** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Darkness (deal heavy magical? dark damage to all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** You can just defend and heal for 20 turns and he'll die. Otherwise, just beat down as usual. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 9: Old Waterway** ###**Boss:** None! --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 10: Baron Castle** ###**Boss:** Baigan **Boss HP:** ~83,000 (Body) | ~13,700 (Arms) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Baigan without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances (All):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Weak|Resist| | | | | | **Status Vulnerabilities (Body):** Poison, Silence, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sap, Stun **Status Vulnerabilities (Arms):** Poison, Silence, Slow, Stop, Blind, Petrify, Sap, Stun **Break Resistances (All):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Body):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Haste (grant Haste to all allies) * Reflect (grant Reflect to self) * Restore (resurrects defeated Arms) * Attack (deal physical damage to all targets) * Counter Reflect (activates in response to black magic; grant Reflect to self) **Moveset (Left Arm):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Paralyze (Paralyze one target) * Self Destruct (activates when the Body is defeated; deal damage equal to remaining HP to one target) **Moveset (Right Arm):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Vampire (deal physical damage to one target, recovering HP based on the damage dealt) * Self Destruct (activates when the Body is defeated; deal damage equal to remaining HP to one target) ###**Boss:** Cagnazzo **Boss HP:** ~106,000 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Cagnazzo without being KO'd. **Elemental Resistances (Default):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Weak| | | |Absorb| | | **Elemental Resistances (Gathering Water):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Weak|Weak| | |Absorb| | | **Elemental Resistances (Shell):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Weak|Resist| |Resist|Absorb|Resist|Resist| **Status Vulnerabilities (Default/Gathering Water):** Poison, Slow, Stop, Blind, Stun **Status Vulnerabilities (Shell):** Slow, Stop, Stun **Moveset (Default):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Slow (Slow one target) **Moveset (Gathering Water):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Tsunami (deal heavy magical water damage to all targets) **Moveset (Shell):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Recovery (recover own HP) **Notes and Strategies:** Cagnazzo switches to Gathering Water form after a certain number of turns. Being dealt thunder damage will scare him out of Gathering Water form. In Shell form, his defense and resistance are greatly increased. For Baigan, you can try to Stop his arms immediately before you kill his body. Alternately, kill all three at the same time. For Cagnazzo, just keep your thunder damage attacker on reserve to immediately knock him out of Gathering Water state and hammer him with ice attacks. There's not much you can do about it if he goes into his shell, just keep icing him down. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX Scarmiglione of the Four Fiends** ###**Boss:** Scarmiglione &amp; Skullnants **Boss HP:** 47,462 (Scarmiglione) | 18,985 (Skullnants) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Scarmiglione without being KO'd.

I recommend a mage team just to avoid the transformed version's counterattacks; AOE Slow is annoying if not especially dangerous in this fight. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX+ Captain of the Guards** ###**Boss:** Baigan **Boss HP:** 104,968 (Body) | 50,981 (Arms) **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Baigan without being KO'd.

Defeat Baigan without letting the arms use Self-Destruct. **Elemental Resistances (All):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Weak|Resist| | | | | | **Status Vulnerabilities (Body):** Poison, Silence, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sap, Stun **Status Vulnerabilities (Arms):** Poison, Silence, Slow, Stop, Blind, Petrify, Sap, Stun **Break Resistances (All):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Body):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Haste (grant Haste to all allies) * Reflect (grant Reflect to self) * Restore (resurrects defeated Arms) * Attack (deal physical damage to all targets) * Counter Reflect (activates in response to black magic; grant Reflect to self) **Moveset (Left Arm):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Paralyze (Paralyze one target) * Self Destruct (activates when the Body is defeated; deal damage equal to remaining HP to one target) **Moveset (Right Arm):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Vampire (deal physical damage to one target, recovering HP based on the damage dealt) * Self Destruct (activates when the Body is defeated; deal damage equal to remaining HP to one target) **Notes and Strategies:** [Video](URL again, this is the exact same fight as earlier, just with higher stats. You can try Stopping the arms (with Stop Rumba or Aerith's Seal Evil), or just kill them all at once. Note that the arms are considerably tougher than the earlier version of this, while the body actually isn't buffed too much. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX++ King of Baron** ###**Boss:** Odin **Boss HP:** 219,200 **Medal Conditions:** Defeat Odin without being KO'd. Exploit Odin's weakness to thunder attacks while he is weak to them. Lower Odin's attack. **Elemental Resistances (Default):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | | | |Resist **Elemental Resistances (Sword Raised):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | |Weak| | | | | |Resist **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow, Stun **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Default):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Attack (deal physical damage to all targets) **Moveset (Sword Raised):** * Zantetsuken (deal massive physical damage to all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** Odin switches to Sword Raised state randomly on his turn. Odin uses Zantetsuken on his second turn in Sword Raised state (the first turn he does nothing). Odin is only vulnerable to thunder while in Sword Raised state. [Video](URL A full team of Retaliators can do this fight without taking any damage past the first turn. Barring that, just bring your standard tank and spank crew with a focus on physical mitigation. Slow will help a lot with ensuring you have plenty of time to exploit his thunder weakness and also with decreasing his damage output, but note that it will also make him slower to raise his sword in the first place. --- &amp;nbsp; ##** Grudge** ###**Boss:** Geryon **Boss HP:** 264,657 **Medal Conditions:** Exploit Geryon's weakness to thunder attacks when he is weak to thunder. Exploit Geryon's weakness to ice attacks when he is weak to ice. Lower Geryon's magic. **Elemental Resistances (Phase 1):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Resist|Weak|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist **Elemental Resistances (Phase 2):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Weak|Resist|Resist|Resist|Weak|Resist|Resist|Resist **Elemental Resistances (Phase 3):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist **Status Vulnerabilities:** Stun **Break Resistances (All):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Phase 1):** * Attack (deal physical damage to one target) * Tsunami (deal heavy magical water damage to all targets) * Recovery (recover a large amount of HP) * Gas (Poison and Sleep all targets) * Curse (lower one target's attack, defense, magic, and resistance) * Maelstrom (deal damage to all targets, proportional to their current HP [50%]) * Cursed Elegy (activates in response to any attack; Slow all targets) **Moveset (Phase 2):** * Inferno (deal supermassive magical fire damage to one target) * Inferno (deal heavy magical fire damage to all targets) * Firaga (deal magical fire damage to a random target three times in a row) * Gas (Poison and Sleep all targets) * Curse (""reduce all the single status""; your guess is as good as mine) * Maelstrom (deal damage to all targets, proportional to their current HP [50%]) * Cursed Elegy (activates in response to any attack; Slow all targets) **Moveset (Phase 3):** * Lightning (deal very heavy magical thunder damage to all targets) * Tornado (deal damage to one target, proportional to its current HP [50%]) * Doom (Doom one target [30 seconds]) * Gas (Poison and Sleep all targets) * Curse (""reduce all the single status""; your guess is as good as mine) * Maelstrom (deal damage to all targets, proportional to their current HP [50%]) * Cursed Elegy (activates in response to any attack; Slow all targets) **Notes and Strategies:** Geryon switches to Phase 2 and Phase 3 at specific HP thresholds (roughly 66% and 33% by eyeball). When Geryon enters a new phase, he casts Maelstrom. [Video](URL Aside from his opening basic attack, Geryon's damage is entirely magic and status based. The real danger of this fight isn't his damage output (it's pretty trivial if you go all in on magical mitigation), but rather his AOE Slow counterattack. There's nothing you can do to prevent him from using it, and the entire party being Slowed can cause massive problems, mostly by letting Sentinel's run out. In Phase 3 he tends to mostly use Doom, so his damage output is greatly reduced (of course, so is yours, thanks to his resistance to all elements). --- &amp;nbsp; ##**+ Cagnazzo of the Four Fiends** ###**Boss:**  Cagnazzo **Boss HP:** 344,455 **Medal Conditions:** Exploit Cagnazzo's weakness to thunder attacks when he is gathering the water. Exploit Cagnazzo's weakness to ice attacks when he is weak to ice. Lower Cagnazzo's magic. **Elemental Resistances (Default):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Weak|Null| | |Absorb| | | **Elemental Resistances (Gathering Water):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Null|Weak| | |Absorb| | | **Elemental Resistances (Shell):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist|Resist|Absorb|Resist|Resist|Resist **Status Vulnerabilities (Default/Gathering Water):** Poison, Blind **Break Resistances (All):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Default):** * Attack (deal physical damage and Poison one target) * Slow (Slow all targets) * Sleep (Sleep all targets) * Haste (grant Haste to self) * Watera (deal magical water damage to all targets) * Watera (deal magical water damage to a random target three times in a row) * Waterga (deal heavy magical water damage to one target) * Counter Stop (activates in response to physical attacks; Stop one target) **Moveset (Gathering Water):** * Tsunami (deal magical non-elemental damage to all targets, ignoring their resistance) * Watera (deal magical water damage to all targets) * Watera (deal magical water damage to a random target three times in a row) * Waterga (deal heavy magical water damage to one target) * Haste (grant Haste to self) * Counter Stop (activates in response to physical attacks; Stop one target) **Moveset (Shell):** * Attack (deal physical damage and Poison one target) * Recovery (recover a large amount of HP) * Slow (Slow all targets) * Sleep (Sleep all targets) * Counter Stop (activates in response to physical attacks; Stop one target) **Notes and Strategies:** Cagnazzo switches to Gathering Water state randomly at any time. Cagnazzo switches from Gathering Water state to Default state after either casting Tsunami or receiving thunder damage three times (unsure if multi-hit attacks matter here). Cagnazzo switches to Shell state randomly once its HP drops below a certain threshold (60%?). Cagnazzo switches from Shell state to Default state randomly. Note that he can essentially go from Shell straight to Gathering Water thanks to how extremely random his Gather Water state is. [Video](URL (mature language warning on the video, I was pretty frustrated by the time I cleared the fight) Cagnazzo *is vulnerable to Poison* when he's out of his shell, and has no means to clear it. I very, very strongly recommend bringing a means to exploit that vulnerability; it will deal ~5200 damage per tick. I also strongly recommend bringing a Banish Raid to dispel any potential Hastes he may cast; you **do not** want Cagnazzo Hasted. He's also vulnerable to Blind but his offense is almost entirely magical. And by ""almost entirely magical"" I mean it's entirely possible for him to hit you with a triple cast Watera for 8000 damage a pop before it's even possible for you to have gotten mitigation up (I had to stop and stare at the screen for a moment when that happened to me; he Hasted himself before even my 80% starting ATB character had acted, immediately went into Gathering Water state after that, and cast his triple Watera before Sentinel's had gone off from that first character's action). Cagnazzo goes into Gathering Water state with extremely high frequency and almost always enters it before your first full round of actions. However, it isn't absolutely essential to knock him out of it; Tsunami ignores Resistance, but you can still debuff his Magic to reduce its damage. With Full Break plus Magic Breakdown, it deals roughly 1300 damage, which honestly is way less than his triple Watergas if you don't have much mitigation up. EDIT: For those having trouble, try Carbuncle + AOE regen instead of a traditional healer setup. Carbuncle negates his Counter Stop and all of his spike damage. He does heal some from reflected Watera/gas but it's not too bad if you're debuffing his magic heavily. EDIT2: Can confirm Carbuncle works without needing anything more than standard Regen and without using Lightning's SSB (which I used the first time). I just mastered the fight with [this party](URL I did still need an AOE heal (fortunately I have Vanille's Blessing of Oerba) in addition to the Carbuncle. Landing Poison early is an absolute requirement, it's literally 1k DPS and this is a long fight."
268,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Thinking about my Summon Orb needs,1,3y7328,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3y7328/thinking_about_my_summon_orb_needs/,2015-12-26 04:19:31,"So I'm going through my abilities and thinking about what I want to hone. I'm really interested in the new summoner meta, I have a lot of 5* rods. With many summons now hitting twice, if they hit vulnerability the 4* summons are the hardest hitting abilities in the game. The 3* summons are 100 potency under Flare, but capped at 20k instead of 10k. The 4* summons are ~6-800 potency above that. Right now I have all three 3* summons R5, Valefor R4 and R3, and Bahumat R2 (not optimal, but fun). What I'm curious about is how many Ultimate bosses have elemental weaknesses, and which ones. Leviathan, Alexander, and the assorted lightning summons are pretty amazing if they're hitting a vulnerability. I just don't know how often they're going to come up. If they come up a lot, I want to spend more time in the current phase, if no ultimate bosses have a vulnerability (or just fire and ice) then I want to quickly move on to farming Wind and Power Orbs.

Don't bother with the minions; Flame Eater will just resummon them. The easiest path to victory is to use Intimidate to keep Flame Eater paralyzed and just hammer it with ice attacks. Even without that, though, he only has ~2000 HP in Classic and ~21k in Elite. Any good roaming warrior will kill him. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 2 &amp; 9: The Espers' Gathering Place** ###**Boss:** Ultros **Boss HP:** 49,089 **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Ultros. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak| |Weak| | |Absorb| | | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Paralyze, Slow, Blind **Moveset (Normal):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Ink (ranged Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Blind) * Tentacle (Physical damage to a single target) * Stone (ranged Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Confuse) * Hailstone (Gravity attack to a single target) **Moveset (Strong):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Magnitude 8 (moderate Magic Earth damage to the entire party) * Aqua Breath (heavy Magic Water damage to the entire party) **Notes and Strategies:** When reduced to a certain HP threshold, Ultros casts Protect and Haste on himself then switches to Strong mode. Fortunately this version of Ultros doesn't have the nasty magic counters like the fight in FF6. His first phase is entirely physical with a couple of annoying statuses, while his second phase is mostly magical. Bring a Dispel to counter his buffs, or just Paralyze him from full health to dead. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 3 &amp; 10: Airship (Before the World of Ruin)** ###**Boss:** Air Force **Boss HP:** 43,101 (Air Force) | 9,554 (Parts) **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Air Force. **Elemental Resistances (all):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | |Weak| | |Weak| | | **Status Vulnerabilities (Air Force):** Paralyze **Status Vulnerabilities (Parts):** Paralyze, Slow, Stop **Moveset (Air Force):** * Sweep Laser (Physical damage to the entire party) * Magitek Laser (Magic Lightning damage to a single target) * Wave Cannon (20% Max HP damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Laser Gun):** * Atomic Ray (heavy Magic Fire damage to the entire party) * Sweep Laser (Physical damage to the entire party) * Magitek Laser (Magic Lightning damage to a single target) **Moveset (Missile Bay):** * Missile (Gravity attack to a single target) * Launcher (moderate Physical damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Bit):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** When either the Laser Gun or Missile Bay are destroyed, Bit is released. While Bit is alive, Air Force will count down to 0; on 0, it will use Wave Cannon. Once again, the main boss is vulnerable to Paralyze. It's a little harder to cheese this time since there are other parts of the boss which will attack, but with the main body paralyzed Wave Cannon can't be used. For those who don't have a honed Intimidate, it's probably not worthwhile to kill the Laser Gun and Missile Bay. Just focus your Thunder attacks on the main body. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 4 &amp; 11: Solitary Island** ###**Boss:** Black Dragon **Boss HP:** 81,423 **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Black Dragon. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak| | | | | |Weak| |Absorb **Status Vulnerabilities:** Paralyze, Confuse, Slow, Stop, Doom, Instant Death, Sap **Moveset:** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Sandstorm (heavy Magic Wind damage to the entire party) **Notes and Strategies:** Black Dragon is undead and will be harmed by healing magic. Undead and vulnerable to instant death? Cast Raise on it and move on. Death, Odin, Pressure Point, and Iai Strike all also work. If you don't have/won't make any of those, bring Shellga and some Fire and/or Holy abilities. Paralyze and Stop both work on Black Dragon, so those are alternate means to ensure the boss never takes a turn. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 5 &amp; 12: Airship (World of Ruin)** ###**Boss:** Deathgaze **Boss HP:** 92,602 **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Deathgaze. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak|Absorb| |Null| | |Weak| |Absorb **Moveset:** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target) * Death (instantly kill a single target) * Aeroga (heavy Magic Wind damage to the entire party) * Poison Claws (Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Poison) **Notes and Strategies:** Deathgaze's most dangerous attacks are all magical. You may want to bring a Carbuncle to bounce Death and Blizzaga, but that makes healing from Aeroga a lot more troublesome. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 6 &amp; 13: Owser's Mansion** ###**Boss:** Chadarnook **Boss HP:** 136,016 **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Chadarnook. **Elemental Resistances (Goddess):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak| | | | |Absorb|Absorb| | **Elemental Resistances (Demon):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak| |Absorb| | | |Weak| | **Status Vulnerabilities (Goddess):** Poison, Paralyze, Slow, Stop, Sleep, Sap **Status Vulnerabilities (Demon):** Poison, Slow, Stop, Sleep, Sap **Moveset (Goddess):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Counter Lullaby (counters any attack; Sleep the entire party) * Counter Doom (counters any attack; Doom a single target) * Counter Entice (counters any attack; Confuse a single target) * Counter Phantasm (counters any attack; Sap the entire party) * Counter Fight (counters any attack; Physical damage to a single target) **Moveset (Demon):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to the entire party) * Flash Rain (Magic Water damage to the entire party) * Counter Thundara (counters physical attacks; Magic Thunder damage to a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** Goddess-Chadarnook switches to Demon form after a certain amount of time passes. Demon-Chadarnook switches to Goddess form after being damaged five times. Demon-Chadarnook can be put to Sleep. Bring a Mage Team, defend until the Demon appears, Sleep it, kill it. You can also Stop Demon-Chadarnook, though that pretty much requires your White Mage to do nothing but cast Stop. Goddess-Chadarnook can be Paralyzed, but cannot be killed, so there's no point. If you don't intend to chump the fight with statuses, bring Shellga; the Demon's only dangerous attacks are magical and it can counter with magic as well. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**Stage 7 &amp; 14: Tower of Fanatics** ###**Boss:** Holy Dragon **Boss HP:** 165,449 **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Holy Dragon. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | | | | |Absorb| | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Confuse, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sleep, Berserk, Sap **Moveset:** * Holy (supermassive White Magic Holy damage to a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** If any party member has Reflect status, Holy Dragon will cast Dispel on a random Reflected party member as an interrupt on its turn. This fight is the same as the version in the story dungeons, except he's vulnerable to way more statuses. Sleep makes the fight easy for a mage team, Stop does the same for any team but doesn't last as long, etc. If you don't intend to use his status vulnerabilities against him, keep in mind that Magic Break/down won't reduce his damage because Holy uses Mind to determine its damage, not Magic. Bring Shellga and a Grimoire/Stoneskin RW instead. Exdeath's Grand Cross SB or Celes's SSB will also negate 100% of his damage while they last. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX Confrontation of Fate** ###**Boss: Ultros** **Boss HP:** 93,424 **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Ultros. Afflict Ultros with Blind. **Elemental Resistances:** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak| |Weak| | |Absorb| | | **Status Vulnerabilities:** Blind, Sap **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset:** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Ink (ranged Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Blind) * Tentacle (Physical damage to a single target) * Stone (ranged Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Confuse) * Hailstone (Gravity attack to a single target) * Magnitude 8 (moderate Magic Earth damage to the entire party) * Aqua Breath (heavy Magic Water damage to the entire party) * Counter Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga (?% chance to counter attacks of same element; heavy Magic Fire/Ice/Thunder damage to a single target) ###**Boss: Ultros &amp; Typhon** **Boss HP:** 87,013 (Ultros) | 71,193 (Typhon) **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Ultros. Win before Typhon uses Snort. **Elemental Resistances (Ultros):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak| |Weak| | |Absorb| | | **Elemental Resistances (Typhon):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Absorb|Weak| | | |Weak| | | **Status Vulnerabilities (Ultros):** Blind **Status Vulnerabilities (Typhon):** Silence, Blind **Break Resistances (Both):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Ultros):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Tentacle (Physical damage to a single target) * Ink (ranged Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Blind) **Moveset (Typhon):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Fight (moderate Physical damage to the entire party) * Fireball (Magic Fire damage to the entire party) * Snort (Remove a single target from the battle) **Notes and Strategies:** When reduced to a certain HP threshold (90%?), Ultros 2 summons Typhon. Typhon uses Snort on a specific turn. [Video](URL No Paralyze vulnerabilities here, unfortunately. For the first fight, bring magic mitigation and don't use the primary three elements against him (the counters are nasty). For the second, tickle Ultros a little until Typhon joins then focus all firepower on him to kill him before he Snorts. The first fight is harder than the second, so you might want to prep for that one a little heavier. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX+ Soul Possession** ###**Boss:** Wrexsoul &amp; Soul Savers **Boss HP:** 135,721 (Wrexsoul) | 48,364 (Soul Savers) **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Wrexsoul. Reduce Wrexsoul's Magic. Exploit Wrexsoul's vulnerability to Ice attacks. **Elemental Resistances (All):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Absorb|Weak| | | | |Absorb| | **Status Vulnerabilities (Wrexsoul):** Blind **Status Vulnerabilities (Soul Savers):** Slow, Blind, Petrify, Doom, Instant Death, Berserk **Break Resistances (All):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Wrexsoul, Default):** * Fight (Physical damage to the entire party) * Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to the entire party) * Possess (Possess a single target, see Notes and Strategy below) * Doom (Doom a single target) **Moveset (Wrexsoul, Strong):** * Fight (Physical damage to the entire party) * Thundaga/Firaga/Blizzaga (massive Magic Thunder/Fire/Ice damage to the entire party) * Doom (Doom a single target) * Cure (Recover a small amount of HP) * Reflect (Reflect self) * Osmose (Reduce the number of uses of a single target's random ability) **Moveset (Soul Savers):** * Fight (Physical damage to the entire party) * Thundaga/Firaga/Blizzaga (heavy Magic Thunder/Fire/Ice damage to a single target) * Cure (Recover a small amount of HP) * Reflect (Reflect self) * Osmose (Reduce the number of uses of a single target's random ability) **Notes and Strategies:** If both Soul Savers are killed, Wrexsoul will end any current Possession and switch to Strong state. When Wrexsoul is Possessing someone, he leaves the battlefield and only returns when the Possessed character is dealt physical damage by a party member; there is no way to tell who he is Possessing. ""Reduce Wrexsoul's Magic"" means you can use any means of doing so, you aren't restricted to just Magic Breakdown like in previous medal conditions. You only need to defeat Wrexsoul to win the battle. [Video](URL This is a fight where Carbuncle shines. If you leave the Soul Savers alone, all of their magic is single-target and will be reflected. Wrexsoul himself still has a strong AOE Thundaga, though, so don't totally neglect magic mitigation. The length and difficulty of this fight will mostly be based on how often Wrexsoul uses Posses; if you don't waste a bunch of time attacking your own party, this fight shouldn't be too bad. Incidentally, try not to bring any instant-death proc weapons (like FF6 Zantetsuken or FF6 Assassin's Dagger), since those have a 27% chance to instantly kill any party member you attack with them, and sometimes it's hard to remember not to do so in the heat of a fight. --- &amp;nbsp; ##**EX++ Ambition of Youth** ###**Boss:** Hidon &amp; Erebus **Boss HP:** 205,734 (Hidon) | 34,835 (each Erebus) **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Hidon. Exploit Hidon's weakness to Holy attacks. Defeat Hidon before it uses Grand Delta. **Elemental Resistances (Hidon):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak| | |Weak| | |Weak| |Absorb **Elemental Resistances (Upper-Center Erebus):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak| | | | | |Weak| |Absorb **Elemental Resistances (Top Erebus):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Weak|Weak|Weak|Weak|Weak|Weak|Weak|Weak|Weak **Elemental Resistances (Bottom-Left Erebus):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- | | |Weak| | | | |Absorb **Elemental Resistances (Lower-Center Erebus):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- Absorb|Absorb|Absorb| |Absorb|Absorb|Absorb|Absorb|Absorb **Status Vulnerabilities (Hidon):** Slow **Status Vulnerabilities (Upper-Center Erebus):** Paralyze, Confuse, Slow, Stop **Status Vulnerabilities (Top Erebus):** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Confuse, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sleep, Berserk **Status Vulnerabilities (Bottom-Left Erebus):** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Slow, Stop, Blind, **Status Vulnerabilities (Lower-Center Erebus):** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Blind, Berserk **Break Resistances (All):** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Hidon, Default):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Poison (Poison a single target) * Bio (heavy Magic Bio damage to the entire party) * Venomist (heavy Magic Bio damage to a single target with a chance to Poison) * Leech (heavy Physical damage to a single target and recover HP based on the damage dealt) **Moveset (Hidon, Strong):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Poison (Poison a single target) * Bio (Magic Bio damage to the entire party) * Venomist (Magic Bio damage to a single target with a chance to Poison) * Leech (Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target and recover HP based on the damage dealt) * Grand Delta (Magic Non-Elemental damage to the entire party, ignoring Resistance) **Moveset (Upper-Center Erebus):** * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) **Moveset (Top Erebus):** * Mega Claw (Physical damage to a single target) **Moveset (Bottom-Left Erebus):** * Venom Claw (Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Poison) **Moveset (Lower-Center Erebus):** * Confuse Claw (Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Confuse) **Notes and Strategies:** Hidon switches to Strong state if all four Erebuses are killed. Lower-Center Erebus is under permanent Reflect status. You only need to defeat Hidon to win the battle. [Video](URL This fight can be a hot mess. You really don't want to kill all of the Erebuses, because that will switch Hidon to Strong state and allow him to cast Grand Delta, which will, at the very least, prevent you from getting mastery. Depending on how strong it is and whether you brought Magic Breakdown, it might even lead directly to a party wipe, since it ignores Resistance and thus Shellga and Sentinel's Grimoire. Hidon is mostly magical damage, while the Erebuses are entirely physical damage. Tauntaliate is only recommended if you don't intend to use any AOE abilities or Soul Breaks, as otherwise it will eventually kill all the Erebuses and trigger a potential Grand Trine. If you only use single-target attacks, however, and ensure you hit Hidon at least once before you get Retaliate up, you can actually leave all four Erebuses alive. Only Topmost Erebus's attack will actually be countered by Retaliate (because only it is using the basic Fight command), but the other three Erebus will still attack and miss, so you're negating all that damage. --- &amp;nbsp; ##** Charming Devil** ###**Boss:**  Chadarnook **Boss HP:** 280,547 **Medal Conditions:** Use a Holy attack against Chadarnook's Goddess form. Win before Chadarnook uses Poltergeist three times. Reduce Chadarnook's Magic. **Elemental Resistances (Demon):** Fire|Ice|Thunder|Earth|Wind|Water|Holy|Dark|Bio -------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- |Absorb|Absorb|Absorb|Absorb|Absorb|Weak|Absorb|Absorb **Break Resistances:** Power, Armor, Magic, Mental **Moveset (Goddess):** * Counter Lullaby (counters non-Holy attacks; Sleep the entire party) * Counter Entice (counters non-Holy attacks; Confuse a single target) * Fight (Physical damage to a single target) * Lullaby (Sleep the entire party) * Entice (Confuse the entire party) **Moveset (Demon, Default):** * Fight (heavy Physical damage to the entire party) * Fight (Physical damage to a single target, 4 times in a row) * Thundaga (very heavy Magic Thunder damage to the entire party) * Flash Rain (heavy Magic Water damage to the entire party) * Counter Thundara (counters magic attacks; Magic Thunder damage to a single target) * Counter Drain (counters any attacks; heavy Magic Dark damage and recover HP based on the damage dealt) **Moveset (Demon, Weak):** * Fight (heavy Physical damage to the entire party) * Thundaga (very heavy Magic Thunder damage to the entire party) * Thundaja (very heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target) * Flash Rain (heavy Magic Water damage to the entire party) * Poltergeist (supermassive Magic Thunder damage to the entire party with a chance to Sap) * Counter Thundaga (counters magic attacks; heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target) * Counter Drain (counters any attacks; heavy Magic Dark damage and recover HP based on the damage dealt) **Notes and Strategies:** Chadarnook starts in Goddess form. Goddess form uses Entice every 3 turns. Goddess form switches to Demon form after receiving Holy damage or after a certain number of turns pass. Demon form cannot be affected by physical attacks until it has received magic Holy damage (this only needs to be done once in the entire fight). Demon form will switch back to Goddess form after 5 turns. When Chadarnook reaches a specific HP threshold (50%?) it no longer switches back to Goddess form and changes to Weak state. In Weak state, Chadarnook uses Poltergeist every 5 turns. Unlike the normal version of the fight, damage you deal to the Goddess form still counts against the Demon form's HP total, so feel free to use your powerful Holy skills against her. [Video](URL Bring strong magic mitigation and some physical mitigation to this fight (Grimoire should be enough for physicals). You also need a lot of holy damage sources, including an absolute bare minimum of one Dia-family spell. Keep track of Demon form's turn count so that you don't accidentally attack him after he switches back to Goddess form (unless you're using Holy attacks, in which case it doesn't really matter). Another thing you can do (thanks /u/juniglee for the suggestion!) is to put Thunder-resistant accessories and armor on your characters. A lot of Chadarnook's damage is Thunder-elemental, so even a minor resistance helps considerably. Just do yourself a favor and **do not** equip the Gigas Armlet from the FF2 Misfortune battle, if you have it; don't forget that it adds Water vulnerability, and Chad's Demon form has Flash Rain. My general strategy was to bring Gilgamesh with Draw Fire and Retaliate to negate Chadarnook's 4-hit combo attack and return minor damage, then have everyone else capable of dealing Holy damage in some way. I brought two white mages (one with Diaga and Shellga, one with Diara and Curaga), one character had Warrior of Light's record materia which converts Attack into Holy-elemental, and then a knight with Saint's Cross and Banish Raid. WoL's materia was so I didn't have to ""waste"" charges on switching Goddess form to Demon form, but in hindsight Goddess form has lower defenses and isn't immune to damage like in the standard version of the fight, so attacks against her are actually quite beneficial. Despite the Goddess form having some status effects, I wouldn't recommend Esuna; she only uses Sleep and Confuse, which can both be solved by hitting the afflicted character. Aside from that, it's actually a pretty standard tank-and-spank as long as you keep track of when the Demon form is going to switch back to Goddess form."

Exploit Necrophobes weakness to wind attacks. **Drops:** Summon Orb / Greater Dark Orb / Major Dark Orb **Notes:** * Necrophobe cannot be damaged nor targeted until all Barriers are defeated. There are 4 barriers in total. * Barriers cast very damaging magic like Flare and Holy, and also capable of -ga magic to single and all targets. * **Carbuncle** is an excellent way to deal with these magic spams, though you can't reflect their AoE -gas. In this case you want to make sure you have mitigation up, or heal it through with AoE heals like Hymn of the Fayth. * Runic Blade doesn't work as well as Carbuncle because it doesn't absorb Holy, but you can use it for ability replenishes if you want. * AoE, obviously, is great here. Meteor owners rejoice \o/ * Once the barriers are down, Necrophobe is pretty much defenseless as he is weak to everything except the Dark element. Beware of his AoE blind though, it can be annoying if you have a melee-heavy party. ****** ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit my guide at URL If you spot any mistakes, or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here or in the guide itself, I'll do my best to attend to you ASAP! ****** ###Other links: * [[Should I Pull?]](URL by /u/Cptn_marvelous * [[Relic Discussion]](URL by /u/Sandslice"

Shellga too, but Cerberus is able to Dispel. * Consider offensive Breakdowns to boost your party's damage. #Diablos **HP:** ~95000 **Weakness:** Wind | **Nulls:** Earth **Debuff Vulnerabilities:** Slow / Blind **Target Score(s):** 1.

(couple this with Full Break + Mental/Armor Breakdown for maximum damage!) * If you don't have enough damage to push for Pre-Megido-Flame lethal, bring an AoE heal RW (or your own if you have one) and **heal after MT8 uses Corona**. Before Megido Flame is used, make sure you have mitigation up. ****** ****** #Sorceress and Knight +++ (40 STAM) #Boss: Edea &amp; Seifer **HP:** ~95000 (Seifer), ~156000 (Edea) **Weakness:**  **Seifer:** Poison  **Edea:** None **Break Resistance:**  **Seifer:** Power / Armor  **Edea:** Magic / Mental **Debuff Vulnerabilities:**  **Seifer:** Slow / Sleep  **Edea:** Slow / Blind / Sleep **Target Score(s):** 1. Defeat Edea &amp; Seifer without being KO'd. 2. Exploit Seifer's weakness to poison attacks. 3. Win without Squall being KO'd. **Drops:** Summon Orb / Greater White Orb / Major Lightning Orb **Notes:** * Edea cannot be targeted nor damaged as long as Seifer is alive. * When Seifer is defeated, Edea will use Maelstrom as her first action. * If this encounter is anything like the one in the story Classic/Elite paintings, expect Seifer to have high DEF + low RES and Edea to have high RES + low DEF. * Bring a couple copies of Bio/Biora/Bioga to quickly take down Seifer. * As for Edea, you can use Carbuncle to bounce back some of her spells, but do note that she can Dispel your party. If you have a honed Carbuncle, consider bringing it. * A hybrid team of mages + melee is recommended here, with more emphasis on your physical melee to deal with Edea. If you can take care of your own mitigation, consider taking an offensive RW like Advance/PP or something similar. ****** ****** **For full rewards, featured relics, boss stats, videos and tips/strategies, please visit my guide at URL If you spot any mistakes, or have suggestions on how to improve the quality of my guides, feel free to comment here or in the guide itself, I'll do my best to attend to you ASAP! ****** ###Other links: * [[Should I Pull?]](URL by /u/Cptn_marvelous * [[Relic Discussion]](URL by /u/Sandslice * [[Enemy Stats &amp; AI]](URL by /u/tfmurphy"

277,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,FFRK Character Review - Zidane,45,3udhy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3udhy7/ffrk_character_review_zidane/,2015-11-27 05:27:18,"#**Zidane - Tantalus Member** #**Stats, Equipment &amp; Abilities** Zidane is a front row warrior who is best played with Thief and Celerity abilities. The following are his important stats at level 65 compared to other similar characters. | Character| HP | ATK | DEF |RES | |:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:| |*Zidane*|*4551*|*138*|*95*|*90*| |Bartz|4700|140|**105** |*90*| |Vaan|4600|138 |94|90| |Zack|4582|**142**|96|**105**| |Locke|**4745**|137|92|100| **Equipment:** Dagger, Sword, Katana, Thrown | Hat, Light Armor, Bracer **Abilities:** Combat 4\*, Thief 5\*, Celerity 5\* Support 3\*, Knight 3\*, **Soulbreak:** *Whats That!?* - Moderate chance to Stop all targets. (50% chance of Stop) | *Scoop Art* - Deal three consecutive physical attacks to one target. (1.75x Ranged Physical per hit) #**Comparing:** &amp;nbsp; ##**PROS** * Zidane has a great ability kit, with 4\* Combat, Thief and Celerity 5, and mid tier Support and Knight. * Now that we are finally getting Steal Power, Thieves now have the ability to be very strong characters and Zidane is no exception! * Steal Armor stacks with EVERY other skill that boosts Armor (Protect, SG etc.). Steal Power doesn't stack with some skills like Boost or PP but it actually has the same multiplier as PP and still stacks with some other SBs like Leon's and Luneth's, so both of these Steal Skills are really solid abilities. * Celerity has gone from zero to hero. There are actually only two really useful Celerity skills (Dual Delay and Dismissal) but both of them are extremely useful on almost any physical character. * Even though Zidane has Knight skills, he isnt really your typical Tank. In FFIX he has a unique skill that covers the female party members so I guess they wanted to implement that in FFRK, and honestly it doesnt fully go to waste! Steal Armor and Draw Fire can actually work nicely in some situations * ~~Bartz trades Celerity for Spellblade, while Zidane vice versa. Honestly if you're fighting a boss with no weaknesses, Steal Power+Tempo Flurry/Dismissal is really strong because of the status effects both those skills bring. If a boss does have an elemental vulnerability though, I'd say stick with Spellblade.~~ * Can use the Status Effect Busters, and later will get 4\* Machinist which actually seems like a pretty cool ability group. * Can equip Swords and Katanas, and is also one of the few good physical characters who can use Thrown weapons. * Interesting default SB and gives another option besides Aerith for bosses who can be Stopped. * 3 unique SB weapons including a SSB in Japan currently however does NOT have a MC2. &amp;nbsp; ##**CONS** * I was very lucky and got two Genji Helms back in the day which I equip on almost every warrior. Zidane not being able to equip Helms is a huge problem for anyone who has them and is a big enough reason to use other similar characters over him. * His defensive stats are all decent for his role, but are slightly outclassed by other Thief/Celerity fighters. * Vaan and Bartz both have huge equipment selections which is great for people who have some of the more rare weapon types like Axes, Hammers or Spears. Zidane does have Katanas and Thrown, but it's definitely not on the same level as the other two. * 5\* Thief is a good replacement for the 4\* Breakdowns, but they could have given him Breakdowns since Vaan also has both. * He doesn't have a MC2 yet in Japan while other Thieves like Locke and Bartz do. &amp;nbsp; #**Conclusion:** Zidane is one of those characters missing like only **one** important thing, but it's something that totally changes their rating. I'd say Helms are the best armor type for an offensive fighter as they have a good balance of ATK, DEF and even RES. Zidane already has some tough competition with Vaan and Bartz, and having a weakness in his armor selection doesn't help him out at all. He is still a great character with a nice weapon and ability selection. 3/4 Warrior/Thief &gt; He has a huge ability selection which gets even better once we get Machinist skills (which is still months off) and has a ton of unique different ability combinations he can use. His stats and armor selection both are decent, but do have some large enough weaknesses to lower his rating. 3/4 Overall &gt;Great character overall and can totally sneak his way into a party. As always, if you're a fan of Monkey-Boy pulling on this banner and using Zidane is completely fine. In FFIX realms (which we will be seeing a lot more of in the upcoming months) Zidane can easily be a permanent member of your party because RS makes up for his slightly lower stats. *TWO REVIEWS IN TWO DAYS WHAT IS THIS MADNESS!?* [Other Character Reviews](URL &gt;**Edit:** *I can either do Steiner, Garnet or Amarant but dont have enough time to do all of them, so let me know who'd you like to see reviewed this week!* "

I'm kinda new to the game, so I was wondering how to build a proper team. Currently I'm using this guys: URL My strategy was BM for vulnerability on bosses, P. Cecil for Draw and Breakdown (I don't have *4 white magic) but after being 50 (I don't have his Memory Crystal, it's from the campaign or from an event?) I replaced him for Tyro. Everyone just attack with their skills and when I'm done, I use reta. So, which character could I use instead of Tyro as a P. Cecil tank?

279,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,[Japan] Proof of Lost Bonds event mini-Megathread,15,3jgmho,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3jgmho/japan_proof_of_lost_bonds_event_minimegathread/,2015-09-03 17:18:08,"**Proof of the Lost Bond** (Ends September 11th, 2 AM Eastern Time) &amp;nbsp; **Stage 1: Magic Continent East** / **Stage 8: Magic Continent East (Elite)** **Boss:** None! Enjoy squishing the easy trash. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 2: Magic Continent Escape** / **Stage 9: Magic Continent Escape (Elite)** **Boss:** Nelapa **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Nelapa. **Elemental Resistances:** Absorbs Fire; Nulls Earth, Wind, Water, Dark, and Poison **Elemental Weaknesses:** Ice, Thunder, Holy **Status Vulnerabilities:** Paralyze, Confusion, Berserk **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Fire (Magic Fire damage to a single target), Fira (Magic Fire damage to a single target), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target), Fireball (Magic Fire damage to the entire party), Death Sentence (Doom to the entire party), Death Roulette (Instantly kill a single target). **Notes and Strategies:** Nelapa starts the fight by casting Death Sentence to Doom the whole party. This is no sweat in Classic but if you have a low level party it's something to be prepared for in Elite. Other than that, his entire offense is magic-based, so Boon is the perfect RW to bring for him, both giving you Haste to help with the Doom countdown and Shell to mitigate all that fire damage. Do watch out for Death Roulette, he never used it on me but he can just kill one of your characters randomly. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 3: Fanatics' Tower** / **Stage 10: Fanatics' Tower (Elite)** **Boss:** Magic Master **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Magic Master. **Elemental Resistances:** Varies based on Wallchange status. When he's weak to Fire, he absorbs Ice (and vice versa). Same with Earth and Wind, Holy and Poison, and Water and Thunder. All other elements are nulled. **Elemental Weaknesses:** See above. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Berserk **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Fira/Blizzara/Thundara/Bio (Magic damage of the relevant element to a single target), Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga (heavy Magic damage of the appropriate element to a single target), Silence (Silence a single target), Ultima (massive Magic Non-Elemental damage to the entire party). **Notes and Strategies:** Magic Master will Wallchange every time he's attacked, and his attacks aren't tied to his weakness, so if you don't read Japanese hitting him with elemental damage is pretty useless. Just hit him with physical attacks, Comet, and Ruin/ga. Note that he's always immune to Dark damage so especially don't bring any of that. He can be Berserked, which I believe prevents him from Wallchanging like in FF6, so that's also an option. EDIT: Also keep in mind that, just like in FF6, Magic Master casts Ultima when he dies. Keep your characters' health up! &amp;nbsp; **Stage 4: Daryl's Tomb** / **Stage 11: Daryl's Tomb (Elite)** **Boss:** Dullahan **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Dullahan. **Elemental Resistances:** Absorbs Ice **Elemental Weaknesses:** Fire **Status Vulnerabilities:** Paralyze, Slow, Blind, Sap **Moveset (Normal):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Blizzara (Magic Ice damage to a single target), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Holy (massive Magic Holy damage to a single target), Cura (Recover medium HP), Morning Star (Physical damage to a single target) **Moveset (Weak):** Same as Normal, plus Absolute Zero (heavy Magic Ice damage to the entire party), Northern Cross (Stop the entire party) **Notes and Strategies:** Dullahan switches to Weak state after taking a certain amount of damage. Dullahan's offense is mostly magic based, so bring appropriate defenses. He can be Paralyzed and Slowed, so if you have a honed Intimidate make sure to bring it. Be careful of Northern Cross once he switches to Weak state; if he lands Stop on the wrong people things can go south real fast. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 5: Dreamscape** / **Stage 12: Dreamscape (Elite)** (AKA Cyan's Dream) **Boss:** Larry, Curly, and Moe **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Larry, Curly, or Moe. **Elemental Resistances (Larry):** Absorbs Ice, Wind **Elemental Resistances (Curly):** Absorbs Fire **Elemental Resistances (Moe):** Absorbs Thunder **Elemental Weaknesses (Larry):** Fire **Elemental Weaknesses (Curly):** Ice, Water **Status Vulnerabilities (Larry):** Blind, Silence, Confuse, Slow **Status Vulnerabilities (Curly):** Blind, Sleep **Status Vulnerabilities (Moe):** Blind, Stop **Moveset (Larry):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Blizzara (Magic Ice damage to a single target), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Reflect (Reflect self), Blizzara-all (Magic Ice damage to the entiry party) **Moveset (Curly):** Fira (Magic Fire damage to a single target), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target), Slow (Slow a single target), Silence (Silence a single target), Stop (Stop a single target), Reflect (Reflect self), White Wind (Recover medium HP for all enemies), Fira-all (Magic Fire damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Moe):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Thundara (Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Cura (Recover medium HP), Protect (Protect a single enemy), Shell (Shell a single enemy), Haste (Haste a single enemy), Reflect (Reflect self), Thundara-all (Magic Thunder damage to the entire party) **Notes and Strategies:** For reference, Larry is the one with the smirk and his hands on his hips, Curly is the pink one, and Moe is the one looking into a hand mirror. Once all three brothers drop below a certain HP threshold, Curly will interrupt with White Wind once. Each of the three brothers has a different role. Larry is the offense-oriented one, Curly is the debuffer and healer, and Moe is the buffer. Assuming you don't AOE them to oblivion, I recommend taking out Curly first because he's the most annoying, between the status effects and White Wind. After that I'd take out Larry since he attacks more often than Moe. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 6: Ancient Castle** / **Stage 13: Ancient Castle (Elite)** **Boss:** Blue Dragon **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to the Blue Dragon. **Elemental Resistances:** Absorbs Water **Elemental Weaknesses:** Thunder **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Slow, Blind **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Aqua Breath (heavy Magic Water damage to the entire party), Flash Rain (Magic Water damage to the entire party), Acid Rain (Magic Water damage to the entire party with a chance to Sap), Tsunami (massive Magic Water damage to the entire party), Ripple (Dispel the entire party; this only dispels status-type buffs) **Notes and Strategies:** Blue Dragon starts the fight by casting Tsunami as an interrupt the moment the fight starts. Be sure your characters are healed up! This is mostly the same fight as the Blue Dragon we faced in the global A Fateful Coin Toss event, except with different status vulnerabilities and Ripple instead of Slow. Also he's not Break resistant. Bring Magic Break/down, Sentinel's Grimoire, and plenty of Thunder attacks and you'll have this one in the bag. His magic is much, much more dangerous than the occasional basic physical attack, so don't worry about physical defensive measures, even though he can be blinded. Slow will decrease his DPS by a goodly amount and if you need the extra help he can be Poisoned. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 7: Kefka's Tower** / **Stage 14: Kefka's Tower (Elite)** **Boss:** Inferno **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Inferno **Elemental Resistances (Inferno):** Absorbs Fire **Elemental Resistances (Ketu):** Absorbs Ice **Elemental Resistances (Rahu):** Absorbs Thunder **Elemental Weaknesses (Inferno):** Thunder **Elemental Weaknesses (Ketu):** Fire **Elemental Weaknesses (Rahu):** Ice **Status Vulnerabilities (Inferno):** Slow, Blind **Status Vulnerabilities (Ketu and Rahu):** Slow, Stop **Moveset (Inferno, both arms alive):** Thundara (Magic Thunder damage to a single target), 1,000,000 Volts (heavy Magic Thunder damage to the entire party), Atomic Ray (heavy Magic Fire damage to the entire party), Shock Wave (Physical damage to a single target), Delta Attack (Stone one target), Sobat (chance to counter any Physical attack; Physical damage to a single target) **Moveset (Inferno, one arm dead):** Same as both arms alive, minus Delta Attack, plus Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Meteor (massive Magic Non-Elemental damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Inferno, both arms dead):** Same as one arm dead, plus Magitek Barrior (Reflect self) **Moveset (Ketu):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Metal Cutter (Physical damage to the entire party), Slash (Physical damage to a single target) **Moveset (Rahu):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Rapier (Physical damage to a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** Ketu is the arm on the right side from the player's perspective, Rahu is the one on the left from the player's perspective. Inferno will resurrect any slain arm shortly after they die with full health. If Inferno didn't resurrect his arms, there'd be a question of whether to kill his arms to remove Delta Attack at the risk of Meteor. However, there's really no such choice because the arms get fully revived very quickly. Instead, just focus fire on Inferno and bring plenty of magic mitigation abilities. Sentinel's Grimoire is very good here because you will still be taking physical damage from both arms and Inferno's Sobat counter. If you have an AOE slow Soul Break like Angel Wing Quake or Mirage Strike, all three parts are vulnerable to Slow and that will help a lot with incoming damage. &amp;nbsp; **EX: Esper's Bequest** **Boss:** Ifrit &amp; Shiva **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Ifrit or Shiva. Exploit Ifrit's weakness to Ice attacks. **Elemental Resistances (Ifrit):** Absorbs Fire; Nulls Thunder, Earth, Wind, Water, Holy, Dark, Poison **Elemental Resistances (Shiva):** Absorbs Ice; Nulls Thunder, Earth, Wind, Water, Holy, Dark, Poison **Elemental Weaknesses (Ifrit):** Ice **Elemental Weaknesses (Shiva):** Fire **Status Vulnerabilities (Both):** Slow, Blind, Paralyze **Moveset (Ifrit):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Fire (Magic Fire damage to a single target), Fira (Magic Fire damage to a single target), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target), Flame (Magic Fire damage to a single target) **Moveset (Shiva):** Blizzard (Magic Ice damage to a single target), Blizzara (Magic Ice damage to a single target), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Blizzard-all (Magic Ice damage to the entire party) **Boss:** Tritoch **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Tritoch. Exploit Tritoch's weakness to Fire attacks. **Elemental Resistances:** Absorbs Ice; Nulls Thunder, Earth, Wind, Water, Holy, Dark, Poison **Elemental Weaknesses:** Fire **Status Vulnerabilities:** Blind **Moveset:** Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Blizzara (Magic Ice damage to the entire party), Freezing Dust (Stop a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** This is the first boss rush I've seen with only two bosses. Regardless, it's pretty straightforward; both bosses deal pretty much exclusively magic damage, so there's no need to bring physical mitigation. Ifrit &amp; Shiva are vulnerable to Paralyze, so you can just Intimidate Ifrit and dump all your Ice attacks on him. Tritoch is just a slugging match. As this is a Japanese EX match, expect the bosses to deal a lot of damage if you don't bring appropriate mitigation. &amp;nbsp; **EX+: Dancing Mad** **Boss:** Kefka **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Kefka. Afflict Kefka with the Slow status. Bring Terra and do not let her die. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow **Break Resistances:** Power, Magic, Armor, Mental **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Blizzara (Magic Ice damage to the entire party), Thundara (Magic Thunder damage to the entire party), Poison (Poison a single target), Drain (Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target and recover HP based on the damage dealt), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Confusion (Confuse a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** This is a pretty straightforward fight. Once again, the damage is primarily magic-based, so prepare with Shellga/Boon/Sentinel's Grimoire. Kefka can poison characters, but this should just be considered a free turn; poison damage is too low to be a threat to characters in a fight like this. He has no elemental resistances or weaknesses so just bring your strongest overall abilities, but make sure to bring a way to inflict Slow for the medal condtion. &amp;nbsp; **EX++: Kefka's Guardian** **Boss:** Inferno **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Inferno. Exploit Inferno's weakness to Thunder attacks. Use the Power Breakdown ability. **Elemental Resistances (Inferno):** Absorbs Fire **Elemental Resistances (Ketu):** Absorbs Ice **Elemental Resistances (Rahu):** Absorbs Thunder **Elemental Weaknesses (Inferno):** Thunder **Elemental Weaknesses (Ketu):** Fire **Elemental Weaknesses (Rahu):** Ice **Status Vulnerabilities (Inferno):** Blind **Status Vulnerabilities (Ketu and Rahu):** Stop **Break Resistances (All):** Power, Magic, Armor, Mental **Moveset (Inferno, both arms alive):** Thundara (Magic Thunder damage to a single target), 1,000,000 Volts (heavy Magic Thunder damage to the entire party), Atomic Ray (heavy Magic Fire damage to the entire party), Shock Wave (Physical damage to a single target), Delta Attack (Stone one target), Sobat (chance to counter any Physical attack; Physical damage to a single target) **Moveset (Inferno, one arm dead):** Same as both arms alive, minus Delta Attack, plus Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Meteor (massive Magic Non-Elemental damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Inferno, both arms dead):** Same as one arm dead, plus Magitek Barrior (Reflect self) **Moveset (Ketu):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Metal Cutter (Physical damage to the entire party), Slash (Physical damage to a single target) **Moveset (Rahu):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Rapier (Physical damage to a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** Ketu is the arm on the right side from the player's perspective, Rahu is the one on the left from the player's perspective. Inferno will resurrect any slain arm shortly after they die with full health. This is the same fight as earlier in the event, just with all the numbers increased, Slow vulnerability removed, and Break resistance added. Expect Inferno to be very fast, as most EX++ bosses are. His DPS will be significantly higher than the Elite version of this fight, but the strategy should be the same overall. You still can't worry about the arms because he'll still revive them quickly, so bring all the Thunder abilities you can fit, a Sentinel's Grimoire/Stoneskin RW, and Shellga. EDIT: Now that I've done this fight, I strongly recommend bringing a Tauntaliator. There are a lot of single target physical attacks flying around. &amp;nbsp; **Evil: Resurrected Bond** **Boss:** Maduin **Medal Conditions:** Attack Maduin with a Fire attack. Attack Maduin with an Ice attack. Attack Maduin with a Thunder attack. **Break Resistances:** Power, Magic, Armor, Mental **Moveset (Magic Sealed):** Fight (heavy Physical damage to a single target), Fight-2 (two attacks, Physical damage to a single target), Fight-4 (four attacks, Physical damage to a single target), Fight-all (Physical damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Magic Released):** Fira (Magic Fire damage to the entire party), Blizzara (Magic Ice damage to a single target), Thundara (Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Chaos Wave (heavy Magic Non-Elemental damage to the entire party), Holy Regen (Regen self), Protect (Protect self) **Moveset (Magic Released, Weak):** Same as Magic Released, plus Evil Dispel (Dispels all buffs on the entire party; this will clear all positive statuses, even Sentinel's Grimoire and the like) **Moveset (Magic Released, very weak):** Fira (Magic Fire damage to a single target), Hellfire (heavy Magic Fire damage to the entire party), Blizzara (Magic Ice damage to a single target), Diamond Dust (heavy Magic Ice damage to the entire party), Thundara (Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Judgment Bolt (heavy Magic Thunder damage to the entire party), Chaos Wave (heavy Magic Non-Elemental damage to the entire party) **Notes and Strategies:** When Maduin is in Magic Sealed state, you won't be able to cast any spells. Maduin alternates between Magic Sealed and Magic Released state throughout the fight based on his current HP; presumably he'll switch to Sealed state when you do enough to drop him to Weak and then again when you drop him to Very Weak, after which he'll swap to Magic Relased Weak/Very Weak as appropriate. Maduin will use Evil Dispel only once in the fight, when you first get him to Magic Released Weak state, so plan accordingly. I can only guess at a strategy here, but Tauntaliate seems like it will be very useful for the Sealed portions of the fight to help mitigate damage while you can't heal. Remember to bring all three basic elemental attacks for the medal conditions, and good luck! EDIT: Some more details on his phases and AI: He starts the fight in Magic Sealed state and remains in that state until approximately 90% HP. Once he hits that point, his barrier immediately drops and he switches to Magic Released state. This does *not* reset his turn, so try to get it to happen on a Retaliate strike so you have the most time to prepare. On his first turn after the barrier drops, he will cast Chaos Wave, which will deal 4-5k damage if it hits you with no mitigation up. On his second turn after the barrier drops he'll cast Protect on himself. After that point he can use any of his MR state abilities. Once he drops to ~60% health, he switches back to Magic Sealed state, which is a bit of a breather if you have your tauntaliate still up. Once he drops to ~50% health, he switches to Magic Released Weak state, where he will fire off a Chaos Wave on his first turn and Evil Dispel on the second. You want your first Sentinel's Grimoire to still be active for that 50% health Chaos Wave, because you need the second RW charge for after Evil Dispel. This is the part I'm stuck on at the moment, so more tips to come later if I can get past it. EDIT2: Have made some more progress (gotten him down to ~5% now). I can confirm 100% that Holy Regen is Dispellable, so it's probably a good idea to bring either Dispel or Dispel Strike/Banish Raid/Vanish Raid (whatever you want to call it). EDIT3: Managed to beat (and Master, surprising the heck out of me!) Maduin. And to boot, I did it without Tauntaliate, although to be fair I don't know that the strategy I used is viable without a SSB. [Here](URL is the party I used. My strategy was to use Squall's SSB to break the Magic Barrier in both Magic Sealed phases (with Boost, it dealt 7500x4, which is just a little more than is needed), combine Magic Breakdown/Sentinel's Grimoire/Shellga to reduce Maduin's damage to levels that Kirin could mostly heal through, and have Dispel to remove his buffs. The rod I have equipped on Terra has an Ice shared SB for the mastery condition, though Squall could have used Blizzaga Strike for that condition. It got pretty tense at the end when the second Grimoire wore off and Wakka died at &lt;5% health, but everyone else was fairly topped up thanks to Vanille's AOE heal SB. In the end Squall fired off his fourth SSB to overkill Maduin and get me the mastery. Pretty happy with the process of figuring out the fight."
280,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,[Japan] The Residing Will of Evil event Boss Guide,17,3kig4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3kig4i/japan_the_residing_will_of_evil_event_boss_guide/,2015-09-11 16:42:09,"**The Residing Will of Evil** ends September 21st, 0200 AM US Eastern Time &amp;nbsp; This is a single-path event like Golbez, where the levels aren't duplicated in a classic/elite setup but are instead just 14 consecutive unique levels. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 1: Wind Shrine, Entrance to 2F** **Boss:** None! &amp;nbsp; **Stage 2: Wind Shrine, 3F to 4F** **Boss:** Wing Raptor **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Wing Raptor. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Everything *except* Stone **Moveset (Default):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Wing Gale (Gravity attack on the entire party) **Moveset (Wings Closed):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Claw (100% chance to counter any attack; Physical damage to a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** This is identical to the fight in the story mode dungeon. He alternates between his forms every 3 turns. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 3: North Mountain, First Half** **Boss:** None! &amp;nbsp; **Stage 4: North Mountain, Second Half** **Boss:** Magissa &amp; Forza **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Magissa or Forza. **Status Vulnerabilities (Magissa):** Poison, Silence, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sap **Status Vulnerabilities (Forza):** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Confuse, Slow, Stop, Blind, Berserk, Sap **Moveset (Magissa):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Fire (Magic Fire damage to a single target), Blizzard (Magic Ice damage to a single target), Thunder (Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Aero (Magic Wind damage to a single target), Drain (medium Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target and recover HP based on the damage dealt) **Moveset (Forza):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Tackle (Physical damage to a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** Again, this is the same fight as in the North Mountain story dungeon. You can Silence Magissa and Blind or Sleep Forza to make things easy on yourself. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 5: Walse Tower** **Boss:** Garula **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Garula. **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Confuse, Slow, Blind, Stone, Berserk, Sap **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Rush (Physical damage to a single target with a chance to inflict Sap) **Notes and Strategies:** Once again, the same as the Story Dungeon fight. Use Break for an easy win, or Blind/Paralyze, or Tauntaliate. At low health he'll start to attack multiple times and counterattack if you fight him fair. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 6: Exdeath's Castle, Lower Levels** **Boss:** Gilgamesh **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Gilgamesh. **Status Vulnerabilities (Initial):** Slow **Status Vulnerabilities (Transformed):** Slow, Blind **Moveset (Initial):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Critical (medium Physical damage to a single target), Ki Waves (reduce the charges of a single target's random ability by 1), Doubtful Dance (Sleep a single target), Flash (Blind the entire party), Hurricane (Gravity damage to a single target), Rocket Punch (Gravity damage to a single target) **Moveset (Transformed):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target **Notes and Strategies:** This is the same as the Story Dungeon fight too, but this is a fight we haven't gotten in global. Basically you want to keep him Slowed at all times and don't worry about Blinding him; he does become vulnerable to it and switch to pure melee attacks after transforming, but he does that at very low health and it's easier to just kill him at that point. He shouldn't be too terribly threatening since it's still a non-Elite level. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 7: Exdeath's Castle, Upper Levels** **Boss:** Exdeath **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Exdeath. **Elemental Resistances:** Nulls Poison **Elemental Weaknesses:** Holy **Status Vulnerabilities:** Slow **Break Resistances:** Power, Magic, Armor, Mental **Moveset (Initial):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Vacuum Wave (heavy Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Sap), Bio (Magic Poison damage to a single target), Gravity (Gravity damage to a single target), Death Sentence (Doom a single target), Earthshaker (massive Magic Earth damage to the entire party), Flame (Gravity damage to the entire party with a chance to Sap), Hurricane (Gravity damage to a single target) **Moveset (Weak):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Vacuum Wave (heavy Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Sap), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Earthshaker (massive Magic Earth damage to the entire party) **Notes and Strategies:** This is another Story Dungeon boss we havn't seen yet. His most threatening attacks are non-physical (though some of them are Gravity-based attacks and thus ignore mitigation), so bring Boon/Shellga/Sentinel's Grimoire. Make sure to keep him Slowed and hit him with as much Holy damage as possible. You might want to bring Kirin or the white magic equivalent to un-Sap people hit by Flames. Note that he does have Break Resistance! Don't just bring Magic Breakdown and expect that to be enough. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 8: Tycoon Castle** **Boss:** None! &amp;nbsp; **Stage 9: Death Valley** **Boss:** Antlion **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Antlion. **Elemental Resistances:** Nulls Earth **Elemental Weaknesses:** Water **Status Vulnerabilities:** Silence, Confuse, Slow, Blind, Sleep, Berserk **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Critical (medium Physical damage to a single target), Ki Waves (reduce the charges of a single target's random ability by 1), Digestive Acid (heavy Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Sap) **Notes and Strategies:** Antlion is vulnerable to Blind and all his attacks are single-target physical attacks so Tauntaliate completely neuters him. Use either or both and the fight should be easy. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 10: Pyramid, Entrance** **Boss:** Gargoyles **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to the Gargoyles. **Elemental Resistances:** Absorbs Holy **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sleep **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Critical (medium Physical damage to a single target), Separation (fully revive one ally), Fusion (Instantly Kill self, fully heal one ally) **Notes and Strategies:** This is a gimmick fight. You have to kill the two Gargoyles on the same turn; if one of them is dead, the other will use Separation to revive it with full health. Furthermore, after a certain number of turns of being alive, one of them will use Fusion to kill itself and fully heal the other, and the other will on its next turn use Separation to fully revive the one which sacrificed itself. It is possible to Sleep or Stop them to prevent this from happening, so choose that or just using pure AOE damage. Two Cloud SSB Roaming Warrior summons should be enough if you hit them with incidental AOEs while those are charging. The Gargoyles don't have any AOE damage, or much damage at all for that matter. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 11: Pyramid, 1F to 4F** **Boss:** None! &amp;nbsp; **Stage 12: Pyramid, 5F to 8F** **Boss:** Rock Statues **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to the Rock Statues. **Elemental Weaknesses:** Thunder **Status Vulnerabilities:** Silence, Slow, Berserk **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Fight-2 (Physical damage to two random targets), Fight-all (Physical damage to the entire party), Break (Stone a single target), Pressure (Physical damage to a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** There are 4 Rock Statues. They deal entirely physical damage and mostly use single-target attacks, so Tauntaliate will be very effective here. Do be aware that they have an AOE physical, though, so don't skimp on the Protectga. If you have an AOE Slow SB, it's worth considering; it'll reduce the amount of damage they deal to themselves via Tauntaliate, but will reduce the chance that two or three of them all AOE you without a chance to heal in between as well. Silence will prevent them from casting Break but is probably not worth the effort to silence all 4 of them. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 13: Guardian Tree** **Boss:** Melusine **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Melusine. **Elemental Resistances (Fire Weak Form):** Absorbs Ice, Thunder; Nulls Earth, Wind, Water, Holy, Dark, Poison **Elemental Weaknesses (Fire Weak Form):** Fire **Elemental Resistances (Ice Weak Form):** Absorbs Fire, Thunder; Nulls Earth, Wind, Water, Holy, Dark, Poison **Elemental Weaknesses (Ice Weak Form):** Ice **Elemental Resistances (Thunder Weak Form):** Absorbs Fire, Ice; Nulls Earth, Wind, Water, Holy, Dark, Poison **Elemental Weaknesses (Thunder Weak Form):** Thunder **Elemental Resistances (Physical Weak Form):** Absorbs Fire, Ice, Thunder; Nulls Earth, Wind, Water, Holy, Dark, Poison **Status Vulnerabilities:** Paralyze, Slow, Stop, Blind, Sleep **Moveset (Fire Weak Form):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Blizzaga-all (heavy Magic Ice damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Ice Weak Form):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target), Thundaga-all (heavy Magic Thunder damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Thunder Weak Form):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target), Firaga-all (heavy Magic Fire damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Physical Weak Form):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Temptation (Confuse a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** Melusine starts the fight in Fire Weak Form and shifts every 3 turns afterwards to a random form. Because the form she shifts to is random, I very, very strongly recommend not letting her shift forms if you're not capable of reading Japanese. Put her to Sleep and/or Paralyze her and keep her that way while you burn her down with Fire and Non-Elemental magic. &amp;nbsp; **Stage 14: The Void** **Boss:** Necrophobe **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Necrophobe. **Elemental Resistances (Barriers):** Nulls Earth **Elemental Weaknesses (Necrophobe):** Everything *except* Dark **Status Vulnerabilities (Barriers):** Silence, Slow, Stop **Status Vulnerabilities (Necrophobe):** Silence, Slow, Blind **Moveset (Barriers):** Flare (massive Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target), Holy (massive Magic Holy damage to a single target), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target), Firaga-all (heavy Magic Fire damage to the entire party), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Blizzaga-all (heavy Magic Ice damage to the entire party), Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target), Thundaga-all (heavy Magic Thunder damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Necrophobe):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Vacuum Wave (Physical damage to the entire party), Sap (light Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Sap), Death (Instantly Kill a single target), Hurricane (Gravity damage to a single target), Flash (Blind the entire party), Flare (massive Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target) **Notes and Strategies:** There are 4 Barriers which must be killed before Necrophobe becomes targettable (much like the Guado Guards in the Seymour/Anima fight). Fortunately, Necrophobe will not act before the Barriers are destroyed. Unfortunately, the Barriers are a serious threat in and of themselves. They have two massively powerful single target spells as well as three different AOE nukes, and since there are four of them you absolutely, positively need Sentinel's Grimoire up ASAP. EDIT: Another option is to bring Aerith and use her default SB for AOE Stop + Silence. Both statuses won't hit all four Barriers, but one or the other should hit each. EDIT2: Note that there are trash waves before Necrophobe, so you can set up Shellga, Sentinel's Grimoire, and such on the wave before him. Also, you can bring the 3 star dance ability  (it's the pink one), which is AOE Magic Break, to put a serious damper on the Barriers' ability to hurt you. As for killing the Barriers, AOEs are the way to go. Try to save your single target elemental damage abilities for Necrophobe himself since he's weak to nearly everything. Consider bringing Blindga and Silencega for Necrophobe to completely prevent him from killing anyone once the Barriers fall; he'll still be able to use Flash and Hurricane but neither can kill you. As mentioned, Necrophobe is weak to every element except Dark, so he should die pretty fast once the Barriers are dealt with. &amp;nbsp; **EX: Ancient Library** **Boss:** Byblos **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Byblos. Exploit Byblos's weakness to Fire attacks. **Elemental Resistances:** Absorbs everything *except* Fire **Elemental Weaknesses:** Fire **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Paralyze, Slow, Blind, Berserk, Sap **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Confusion (Confuse a single target), Magic Hammer (halve the number of ability uses of a single target's random ability), Web (Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target with a chance to Slow), Gale Cut (Physical damage to the entire party), Ki Waves (reduce the number of ability uses of a single target's random ability by 1), Counter Protect (?% chance to counter physical attacks; Protect self) **Boss:** Ifrit **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Ifrit. Exploit Ifrit's vulnerability to Ice attacks. **Elemental Resistances:** Absorbs Fire; Nulls Poison **Elemental Weaknesses:** Ice, Water **Status Vulnerabilities:** Poison, Silence, Paralyze, Confuse, Slow, Blind, Berserk, Sap **Moveset:** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), High Kick (uncounterable Physical damage to a single target with a chance to Paralyze), Fira (Magic Fire damage to a single target), Flame (heavy Gravity attack to the entire party) **Notes and Strategies:** Yes, this is the order they come in, *not* Ifrit then Byblos. The easy solution is to just paralyze lock the both of them. They are both vulnerable to it. If you don't have the Intimidate charges to lock them both down, you have to decide whether to do it to Byblos (with his annoying Magic Hammer and Ki Waves but overall less dangerous attacks) or Ifrit (with a Flames-High Kick/Fira combo threatening to two-shot someone). Ifrit can be somewhat trivialized by Silence + Blind although I believe Flames may be a NAT ability and thus castable through Silence. Pick your poison. &amp;nbsp; **EX+: Island Shrine** **Boss:** Wendigo **Medal Conditions:** Do not die to Wendigo. Afflict Wendigo with Sleep. Bring Exdeath and do not let him die. **Elemental Resistances:** Absorbs Water; Nulls Earth **Status Vulnerabilities:** Sleep **Break Resistances:** All **Moveset (Wendigo):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target or to the entire party), Confusion (Confuse a single target), Mind Blast (Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target with a chance to paralyze), Hurricane (Gravity attack to a single target), Counter Blaze (?% chance to counter AOE attacks; Magic Ice damage to the entire party with a chance to Sap) **Moveset (Illusion):** Counter Blaze (?% chance to counter AOE attacks; Magic Ice damage to the entire party with a chance to Sap) **Notes and Strategies:** There is one real Wendigo and three illusory copies. None of them will display a HP bar until you damage the real Wendigo, at which point it will swap with one of the clones and the HP bar will disappear again. If he's asleep, his HP bar will remain visible and he won't swap places. This is a gimmick fight. Unless you inflict Wendigo with a status effect, you'll never know which is the real one, and using AOEs will get your party Blazed to death. Just reload until you put him to sleep (you'll know because you won't be attacked; there's no visual indicator like there normally is for sleep) then blast him. He's got very low HP, only about 40k or so, so once you find the right one it's quick. &amp;nbsp; **EX++: Great Sea Trench** **Boss:** Triton, Nereid, and Phobos **Medal Conditions:** Exploit Triton's weakness to Ice attacks. Exploit Nereid's weakness to Fire attacks. Exploit Phobos's weakness to Earth attacks. **Elemental Resistances (Triton):** Absorbs Fire **Elemental Resistances (Nereid):** Absorbs Ice **Elemental Resistances (Phobos):** Absorbs Poison **Elemental Weaknesses (Triton):** Ice **Elemental Weaknesses (Nereid):** Fire **Elemental Weaknesses (Phobos):** Earth **Status Vulnerabilities (Triton &amp; Nereid):** Poison, Blind, Sap **Status Vulnerabilities (Phobos):** Poison, Blind, Sleep, Sap **Break Resistances (All):** All **Moveset (Triton):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target), Flamethrower (heavy Magic Fire damage to the entire party), Delta Attack (Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target with a chance to Stone) **Moveset (Nereid):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target), Ice Storm (Magic Ice damage to the entire party), Frost (Magic Ice damage to the entire party with a chance to Sap), Delta Attack (Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target with a chance to Stone) **Moveset (Phobos):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Bio (heavy Magic Poison damage to the entire party), Rainbow Wind (Blind, Silence, and Sap a single target), Delta Attack (Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target with a chance to Stone) **Notes and Strategies:** For reference, Triton is the red one, Nereid is the purple one, and Phobos is the green one. They can resurrect one another, so you need to kill them within a turn or so of the first one dying. I recommend bringing as many non-Ice, non-Fire, non-Poison AOEs as you can get your hands on, and bring Shellga, Unfaith Dance (the three star pink one), and Sentinel's Grimoire/Stoneskin as their damage is largely magic. You might need to bring some single target damage as well, as they don't all have the same HP totals; Phobos seems to have more than the other two. Note that Phobos can be put to sleep and they can all be Poisoned, Slowed, and Sapped; an AOE Slow SB will be super, super useful, but I wouldn't recommend Poisoning or Sapping them as it will likely cause their HP to desync. &amp;nbsp; **Evil: Necrophobe** **Boss:** Necrophobe &amp; Barriers **Medal Conditions:** Exploit Necrophobe's weakness to Fire attacks. Exploit Necrophobe's weakness to Ice attacks. Exploit Necrophobe's weakness to Thunder attacks. **Elemental Resistances (Barriers):** Nulls Earth **Elemental Weaknesses (Necrophobe):** Everything *except* Dark **Break Resistances (All):** All **Moveset (Necrophobe, Barriers Active):** Flash (Blind the entire party) **Moveset (Barriers):** Holy (massive Magic Holy damage to a single target), Flare (massive Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target), Blizzaga (heavy Magic Ice damage to a single target or the entire party), Firaga (heavy Magic Fire damage to a single target or the entire party), Thundaga (heavy Magic Thunder damage to a single target or the entire party), Counter Hurricane (?% chance to counter Magic attacks; Gravity attack to the entire party), Counter Flare (?% chance to counter Magic attacks; massive Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target), Counter Holy (?% chance to counter Magic attacks; massive Magic Holy damage to a single target), Counter Flash (?% chance to counter Physical attacks; Blind the entire party) **Moveset (Necrophobe, Barriers Dead):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Vacuum (Physical damage to the entire party), Sap (Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target with a chance to Sap), Hurricane (Gravity attack to a single target), Flash (Blind the entire party), Flare (massive Magic Non-Elemental damage to the entire party) **Moveset (Necrophobe, Weak):** Fight (Physical damage to a single target), Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga (heavy Magic Fire/Ice/Thunder damage to a single target or the entire party), Flare (massive Magic Non-Elemental damage to a single target), Vacuum (Physical damage to the entire party), Counter Hurricane (?% chance to counter Magic attacks; Gravity attack to a single target) **Moveset (Necrophobe, Very Weak):** Same as Weak except -ga spells upgrade to -ja spells **Notes and Strategies:** According to the event info, the Flares and Holies in this encounter will pierce Runic Blade and Grand Cross. There's enough single target magic thrown around this encounter to make Carbuncle a high priority. I didn't see if a Flare or Holy would bounce (EDIT: They do not, all Flares and Holies pierce Reflect; fortunately Necrophobe mostly sticks to his elemental nukes) but all the -gas and -jas do (the single target ones anyway). Once he changes to Very Weak state and starts casting -jas, he gets two actions per turn. If you're lucky, this will mean he starts doing 20k to himself every turn instead of 7k. If you're unlucky, he'll doublecast the AOE versions instead. This fight is a hot mess, although at least Necrophobe doesn't have a Dispel. You're going to be absolutely inundated with magic damage, gravity attacks, and Flashes from the very start of the fight. I strongly recommend putting anti-Blind accessories on your physical characters and it may be worthwhile to bring Esuna on a support like Sazh instead of Power Breakdown unless you're bringing an all-mage party. Note if you take the mage party route, Necrophobe has a gravity-based counter to magic. EDIT: Beat him. The strategy isn't too much different from the one earlier in the event. The main difference is that they're immune to statuses, so no Aerith SB trivializing the Barriers, and I brought Carbuncle and Kirin. I didn't bother bringing any Magic Break abilities; the Barriers only deal 100-200 damage after Shellga and Grimoire and Necrophobe is a pure DPS race. You have to kill him before your second Grimoire/Carbuncle wears off or he will kill you. If you get unlucky with Necrophobe using the AOE versions of his elemental nukes, or your physical fighter(s) get Blinded by Flash, the fight gets a lot harder. I missed mastery by a couple turns, and I blame that squarely on Squall getting blinded right at the start and thus missing four Firaga Strikes which would have done 40k damage. EDIT2: Went back and mastered him with the same party. [Here](URL is the exact setup I used, for reference. Gilgamesh has his first relic SB, Squall has his SSB, and Vanille has Blessing of Oerba, for reference. Blessing is the only one I used in the fight, and the Protectga side effect wasn't super relevant so any AOE heal should work fine."

(2.8x magic damage per attack) **Comparing:** So the FF4 event featuring Golbez has probably been the most hyped thing in the history of history for a couple reason! The increased 5\* equipment drop rate thing which actually hasnt happened yet. The amazing banner which features tons of mage weapons basically two considering one is only useable on Golbez. And of course, the sick characters however fortunately Tellah and Golbez are both pretty awesome and unique characters! Golbez is a Thaumaturge, which I guess is a fancy way of saying a battle mage, and thats something we really havent seen yet in FFRK! Yes we have Terra and Celes, but Terra as a battle mage is a ton more dependant on her 5\* Relic than Golbez, and Celes is a pretty crappy character until her buff which does actually look pretty sick! Golbez can actually be equipped with a Sword that has a MAG stat and do decently well in the front row with both physical and magical attacking! As his MAG is significantly higher than his ATK it does make more sense to equip him like a normal caster though, and this is where his problem lies! The 10 MAG that separates Golbez and Rydia, Terra and Rinoa, and the 20 between him and Vivi, is actually very important to point out. Youre not going to be using Golbez as a normal warrior character, even though he can equip more weapons than several other warriors and does have 3\* Combat because of his low ATK, and as a Black Mage his MAG is quite a bit lower than the top tier Black Mages and both of these problems leave him in a strange spot. I see Golbez most effectively used in Caster parties, where having a character who can both tank and deal physical damage (with very specific equipment though) as well as cast Black Magic can be really helpful! In your average 3 Warrior 2 Caster party, I do strongly recommend replacing one of your warriors with Golbez and not making him your dedicated Black Mage because Vivi, Rinoa or Rydia are a lot better in that role. Golbezs HP and DEF are both excellent for a caster. His HP is only 100~ points below Cloud and on point with several ranged warriors. His DEF is only 1 point below Cloud and above several warriors including Squall and Lightning! As many of us who dont have any battle mage equipment are most likely going to equip a rod on him and use him in the backrow, Golbez can be SUCH a tanky character! Even his RES is on par with top tier casters like Terra, Lulu and Tellah! His default SB is similar to Aeriths in that it does no damage but has a chance of inflicting a status effect on all enemies. Unfortunately unlike Aeriths which has a 70% chance of landing Silence and Stop, Golbezs only has a 20% chance of landing Paralyze. Paralyze is a very common status vulnerability but a 20% chance is pretty crappy. Do I need to even explain his unique 5\* Relic SB? There aren't too many offensive SBs that get better than a 4 hit non elemental magic damage SB and it definitely makes spending Mythril on this banner a good choice, even though I trash talked it a lil ;). **Conclusion:** Sometimes I wish DeNa switched up events so we don't know exactly what's coming next because I can't imagine how shocked the Japanese players must have been when Golbez came out. Us Global players finally have him and its exciting to be able to use one of the coolest characters in Record Keeper! Golbezs only weakness is in his low base MAG stat which does really show in his Black Magic damage output compared to other mages like Rinoa and Vivi, but against bosses with elemental vulnerabilities or if you have honed 4\* Black Magic on him, he can still do very well as a mage. His high DEF and HP are amazing considering how squishy several normal casters are, and his armor and even weapon selections are some of the largest in the game! 3/4 Black Mage &gt;Great character, but his significantly lower MAG stat does lower his rating as a Black Mage. Equipping him with 4\* Black Magic is quite important as his damage output will be quite a bit lower than other mages with 3\* Spells. His defensive stats and equipment choices are all excellent which does make up for the lower MAG stat. 3.5/4 Overall &gt;Even if you dont get his super cool SB, Golbez is a cool and unique character who fits in perfectly with the Mage Meta. His default SB kinda sucks, but other than that he is just such an awesome character. *Sorry for the delay! Busy with school stuff :( Thanks for reading everyone!* [Other Character Reviews](URL "

Already have Thundaja and Waterga R3. Can hone Waterga to R4 but have not really been running out of casts on boss rushes with Mana Font on the mage who takes both -ajas. Am thinking that I may want to save some Ice orbs, and ration the Greater Blacks into another tool in my toolkit. Honing Bioga to R3 will cost 30 Greater Blacks and 45 Greater Darks, both of which I have. Opportunity cost for this does not seem very great - Darks are also needed for Magic Breakdown (I have R2) and Ruinga (not out yet, I have Quake and Valefor R3 and Meteor so not sure if I will hone). Mostly concerned about the Greater Blacks since we have not been getting a lot lately. Curious about your opinions. EDIT - yeah, my thinking for honing it is more along the lines of ""few are resistant / immune."" With the Greater Orb tier of Black Magic, my team is generally getting close to damage cap with Mental Breakdown without the amplification from vulnerability, so it's more about having the ability to do more damage to critters who have no weaknesses. And yeah, Dark orbs are easy to farm, and not sure if I really need Ruinga with my existing AoE skillset. More concerned about opportunity cost of the Greater Blacks though. "

You are not obligated to follow this guide to complete this boss fight as your loadout and skills may vary greatly from mine. Constructive criticism is most welcomed* *Edit : Floating Continent Heroic is in the [comment](URL below* ##Tactic## *Edit : I did a mistake regarding trash fights. There were two types of ninja monsters that used almost similar assets. Ninjas which deals AoE elemental damage and Outsiders that throw weapons. Pointed out by /u/Knofbath in his [reply](URL *Edit 2 : /u/Zeynon reported that there is another trash formation.* There are 7 types of trash fights that can be encountered in this dungeon. There are:- * Ninja and Samurai * Ninja and Ninja * Robot and Ninja * Robot and Samurai * Robot and Outsider * Samurai and Outsider * Samurai and Samurai (by /u/Zeynon) Of all the trash fights to get, the worst would be ninja and ninja or robot and ninja. The robots can deal large AoE damage whereas the ninja's can deal elemental AoE damage (Veils). Outsiders can throw weapons that deal huge damage regardless of formation (Honestly, why can't you pick up thrown weapons? I'd love me some free 5\* Kiku-ichimonji's). Samurai's are more manageable and if you get a lot of them, be very, very thankful. There are multiple tactics that can be employed to clear these trash stages fast without losing any medals (This is important especially if you are not bringing Edgar in your team). One method is to use AoE attacks such as summons, bladeblitz and quakes to clear the trash fast! However, this requires black mage RM2 and summoner RM2 in order to have enough sustain through all of the trash stages. Another tactic that can be employed (which I used) is to bring elemental weaknesses for the trash mobs and kill them off in one hit before they can do much damage. Ninjas and outsiders are weak to holy spells so if you have a highly honed Diara (especially from the Tidus event) you can most likely KO them in one cast. Robots are weak to thunder. However, do note that the final boss is also weak to thunder and it's better to save thunder skills for the final boss. Bringing a weaker variant (Thundara, Thunder strike) that you have honed is good for this dungeon as you can finish the robot while saving the higher tier skills for the boss. Samurai's are weak to poison skills so use those Biora skills you honed for bringing down Seifer! For those that are interested in how much damage is needed to bring down these trash mobs, as long as you can hit within the 4k damage region, you can mostly one-shot them. Boss fight:- Blue Dragon is quite an easy boss due to it only casting damaging spells while having a weak attack. Coupled with a lightning element weakness and poison vulnerability, most players should have no trouble bringing him down (Especially with the last Edea event which gave tonnes of lightning orbs). Magic break this boss, put up sentinal grimoire, poison it and just go to town with this boss! ##Character lineup## * Cloud (Level 60) *front* * Wakka (Level 59) *back* * Vivi (Level 52) *back* * Cyan (Level 50) *front* * Yuna (Level 52) *back* ##Ability Used## **Character**| **Ability 1**| **Ability 2**| **Record Materia** :--------:|:--------:|:--------: |:--------: Cloud | R4 Drain Strike| R4 Thundara Strike|Soldier Strike Yuna | R5 Curaga| R3 Diara |Concentration II Wakka | R2 Magic Breakdown | R4 Venom Buster|Sky Pirate Pride Cyan | R3 Armor Break| R4 Double Hit |Katana Master Vivi | R4 Biora | R4 Thundaga|Attunement II RW : Tyro Sentinal Grimoire ##Equipment used## **Character**|**Weapon**| **Armor**| **Accessory** :--------:|:--------:|:--------: |:--------: Cloud | 5\*+ Zantetsukan **(RS)**| 3\* Diamond Helm **(RS)**|Hyper Wrist **(RS)** Yuna | 5\* Judgement Staff| 5\* Monk Robe |Angel Ring Wakka | 5\* Fujin's Chakram | 3\*++ Diamond Vest **(RS)**|Hyper Wrist **(RS)** Cyan | 5\* Kiku-ichimonji **(RS)**| 4\* Crystal Helmet **(RS)** |Hyper Wrist **(RS)** Vivi | 4\*++ Gravity Rod **(RS)** | 4\*+ Black Robe|Angel Wings **(RS)** ##Damage input and output## Ninja veils dealt an average of 600 damage per character and normal attack hits for 500 damage. Thrown weapons by Outsiders deal a massive 1.3k damage to my BACK ROW characters! Samurai's deal roughly 550 damage and robots deal about 800 - 1k damage with magitek laser. Missile deals 50% of max HP as damage and another AoE missile skill deals about 600 - 900 damage. Blue dragon hits at 1k damage without mitigation and 200 damage with break + SG up. Physical attack hits at 300 damage with SG up. Average dpr (boss fight only):- * Cloud : 9999 (Thundara Strike)/ 6000 (Drain Strike) / 3000 Normal * Yuna : 2000 (Diara) * Wakka : 2000 (Breakdown)/ 1800 (Venom Buster) * Cyan : 4000 (Armor Break) / 5000 (Double hit) / 3000 Normal / 8000 (Bushido Flurry) * Vivi : 9999 (Thundaga + Focus Magic) / 6000 (Thundaga) / 5000 (Biora + Focus Magic) / 3000 (Biora) *dpr = Damage per round* ##Frequently asked questions## **How much did your 5\* equipments contribute to the fight?** Honestly, the 5\* equipment helped me in increasing my DPS in my fights. However, this dungeon is still easy for those without 5\* equipment. I used Cyan as I had his relic, thus I wanted to get full use out of it (How often can you even use Cyan with his relic??). If your Cyan is weak, I'd recommend changing him out for another character for higher damage output or maybe even another black mage. If you are still having problems with the trash mob, consider equipping Attunement I and Attunement II on your magic casters. I did that for Vivi and my magic damage for trash mobs reached near 5k damage (That was with Attunement II mind you). Tyro's RM and Quistis' RM are a very big asset to have in this dungeon due to all the elemental weakness so use them to the fullest! **Why didn't you bring Edgar?** My Edgar is still level 1 and I didn't want to throw my sanity away by S/L multiple times just to keep him alive. I will level up Sabin and Edgar before the EX battles though. **If you didn't bring Edgar, how do you maintain enough medals to master this dungeon?** S/L whenever you get hit by veils or missiles. One AoE skill is enough to get one medal from you so plan properly. You can only lose a maximum of 7 medals in this dungeon to master it and without Edgar, you already started with 3 medals lost. Assuming that you lose 7 medals in the last battle with the boss fight, you cannot afford to lose any medals at all for the first three battles. Kill those ninjas and robots off FAST so you can prevent medals lost in the early battles. ##Acknowledgements## A big thanks to /u/TFMurphy on his [A Fateful Coin Toss Enemy Stats and AI](URL thread.

Just mastered it but had to burn a mythril on Ultima as my abilities were bone dry going into it. Here's the [team](URL used. Sky Pirate on Edgar Double Hit on Sabin SOLDIER Strike on Cloud Mana Spring 2 on Vivi Concentration 2 on Yuna I don't know if you're expected to go back and auto the Magitek Armors down a bunch of time for ability refreshes but I just wasn't going to be able to do it with this team and the elixir refreshes I got. Even with a full refresh on ultima I burnt through all of my damage abilities on both Cloud and Vivi. There is just tons of HP to burn through with all of these bosses and not enough weaknesses. Magitek I used just used 1 ability each from the caters and then 1 from the melee then autoed them down so that I knew I would be full for the following bosses. Vargas I burned a SG charge to mitigate the damage and burnt the bears down as quickly as I could with fire. After they were down with a magic break on him he was pretty easy but still took a lot of attacks. Orthros was actually pretty easy, I just blinded him and went to town on his fire vulnerability. He got two ink blinds through still but not a big deal. The Tentacles took forever with only having access to two elemental vulnerabilities and I ended up getting bio'd quite a few times which hurts even with keeping two intimidated while I worked on the rest. About half way through this one I realized i'd never be able to finish ultima without a refresh so just gave up and used all of my abilities. Amazingly I still almost had a character die from poison while being out of curagas. I'm a first week player so I have enough orbs to hone all of my 3* abilities to rank 5 if I wanted but looking back I still don't think that would be enough with the elixir refreshes I got. If I were to do this again i'd probably swap out slowga and quake for more damage. This is the first boss fight I've felt like you really needed a lot of luck on elixir refreshes(too bad you can't save/load for that!) or some character specific relics to make it through without a mythril refresh. Hope you other record keepers have better luck than me!"

Shellga ran out with about 3 turns left. If I were to do it again i'd change out Blizzaga with my R4 Thundara as the armor broke pretty quickly and with vulnerability that would have sped along the boss. Used a Rhiona friend summon (who had a resist accessory on grumble grumble...) and I think that was much better then a Sentienals as I was only taking 100-200 aoe damage with magic breakdown and Shelga on him. Also I'd probably change out Yuna for a stronger black mage as Shellga ran out even with her high mind stat and Diara was hitting like a wet noodle. I'd replace her with a mage that could run Shellga and R4 Firaga. Anyways I know I like reading as many guides as I can before I attempt so hope this helps someone. 
288,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,"Giant of Babil, Part 2 [Retaliate Strategy w/ HP Bar]",0,3ghzp2,http://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3ghzp2/giant_of_babil_part_2_retaliate_strategy_w_hp_bar/,2015-08-11 05:15:30,"**Preface** [Setup](URL [Lost 1 Medal](URL I used /u/Cloudpr's strategy as a baseline for determining some rational thought going into this dungeon, so I flooded my strategy around having ample Thunder based spells to take care of trash without losing any medals. You can see his guide here: URL However, I wanted to see if I could master this with a Retaliate strategy as well, since there were so many opportunities to bring different abilities and maximize the output. I'm a F2P player, so I don't have the best gear, but I've been a little bit on the lucky side with pulls but no where near RNG-status. I think some people are wary of using Retaliate against a multi-mob boss because of inaccurate targeting, but that's actually controllable. As long as you never use a randomly targeting multi-hit skill and never target the defense node, you're good to go. I explain in detail below under the boss fight strategy. **Party Composition** * **Cloud** - Primary damage dealer; retaliator. Attunement II (because I'm using a dagger) * Squall** - Backup damage dealer, Thundara Striker #2. Soldier Strike * **Wakka** - Breaker + Double Cut feeder. Sky Pirate Haste * **Quistis** - Breaker + Boost. Double Hit for Retaliate feeder * **Vivi** - Thunder Killa. Devotion * **RM** - Tyro Sentinel Grimoire (not pictured) Most of my skills are honed R4+ but for the Thunder based moves, you really don't need it honed that high. The only thing I'd really recommend to come in honed with are Armor Breakdown R2+ and Retaliate R4+ since it's a relatively long fight depending on your gear. You probably want Boost R3+ also. **Strategy** * 1st level trash mobs just spam any Thunder spell available. You want to maximize the damage to kill output ratio, so you don't end up using extra moves for no reason. Use common sense here, and with the HP bar available now (as of 8/10), you should be able to get maximum medals. * 2nd level trash - do the same thing with the trash mobs. However, this time, before you get to Round 3 (the boss) you want to have SG up. I put up SG in the 2nd round before the last mob died but you could easily put it up anytime in Round 1 or 2. * **BOSS Fight** At a high level, you kill in this order: Attack Node &gt; CPU &gt; Defense Node. To kill the Attack Node simply land Power Break + Armor Break, Thundara Strike + Thundaja and it should be dead within 1-1.5 rotations. Ideally speaking, you only want to let the Attack Node get off only 1 AoE attack. If he hits you twice, then I'd recommend S/L'ing until the ATB gauges are in your favor. Make sure after your final strike to NOT queue up any attack. This could accidentally attack the Defense Node and mess up your entire Retaliate targeting. * Once the Attack Node is down, it's easy sailing as long as you keep up Retaliate, Boost and Armor Breaks. Below is the exact casting order I did (I skipped until Quistis was first in rotation). This should keep CPU targeted with the Retaliate attacks and you should never have to worry about mis-targeting the Defense Node. * **Quistis Armor Break on CPU &gt; Cloud Retaliate &gt; Squall Double Cut on Cloud &gt; Wakka Double Cut on Cloud &gt; Vivi Attack on Cloud &gt; Cloud Attack (Target CPU) &gt; Quistis Boost on Cloud** * After the first rotation, just keep Double Cutting and Attacking Cloud until you have to refresh Retaliate, Boost and Armor Break. 3x Armor Breaks lasted the entire fight against CPU. * **To land the Thunder vulnerability**, this took some patience but here's what I did. I killed CPU down till he had about 2-3% HP left (thank you HP bar!) and waited with Cloud until CPU's reflect ability went down. I turned the game speed up to 5 (combo'd with Cloud's attack speed) and just waited for the right moment and as soon as it went down, I hit Thundara Strike and it landed before it was able to re-cast Reflect. During this time, the Defense Node healed CPU a few times but that's negligible because you just put Retaliate back up and go back to work business-as-usual. **Edit:** Apparently Thundara Strike doesn't get reflected, so....you can just do that instead of my cool way. After that, just own the Defense Node in the same fashion and win with a smile on your face. Good luck!"
289,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,FFRK Character Review - Aerith,23,3hl8gg,http://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3hl8gg/ffrk_character_review_aerith/,2015-08-20 00:43:09,"**Aerith - The Flower Girl** **Stats, Equipment &amp; Abilities** Aerith is a backrow caster with a focus on White Magic. The stats below are Aerith's (important) stats at level 50 compared to other White Mages. | Character| HP | DEF | MAG | RES | MND | |:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:| | *Aerith*|*2680*|*51*|*94*|*85*|*120*| | Yuna | 3015 | 59 | 116 | 104 | 116 | | Selphie | 2948 | 54 | 94 | 101 | 120 | | Lenna | 2678 | 51 | 93 | 94| 123| **Equipment:** Dagger, Rod, Staff | Hat, Robe, Bracer **Abilities:** 5\* White Magic, 2\* Support, 2\* Summon, 3\* Black Magic **Soulbreak:** *Seal Evil* - Stop and Silence all enemies (70% chance of landing for both status effects) | *Healing Wind* - Restore HP to all allies (Slightly stronger than 2\* WHM Cura) | *Planet Protector* - Increases all allies ATK (+50% ATK ?) **Comparing** I'll be honest with everyone. I love Aerith, I love FF7, I've played almost every Final Fantasy game and FF7 is my favorite by far. I tried a lot harder than I do with other character reviews to think of reasons why Aerith is one of the better White Mages in FFRK, and I'll be honest, it was tricky. Aerith has the second highest Mind in both versions of the game (behind Lenna and tied with Selphie and Rosa), but all her other stats are lower than most other White Mages. Her HP and DEF are some of the weakest in the game, and unlike other mages, even her RES is actually the second lowest out of all the casters (Behind all other Casters except Rinoa), including some Core Characters! Her ability kit is actually pretty good. 2\* Summon gives her access to Kirin which is basically the only Summon under 4\* that's actually good! She doesn't have 5\* Summon unlike Garnet, Yuna and Eiko which can be a problem (Plot Twist - She gets 5\* Summon in a buff!!), but only for now because DeNa realized Aerith was lacking a bit and they do give her 5\* Summon sometime in the future. 3\* Black Magic isn't too bad. Yuna, Garnet, Lenna and Eiko all can't use 3\* -aga spells, which is actually something that is occasionally useful on a White Mage if you just need to fulfill a boss vulnerability requirement and don't have a dedicated Black Mage in your party, however in harder difficulty dungeons you probably shouldn't be using Aerith as your Black Mage! 2\* Support let's her use Boost, which won't be as important once Water of Strength comes out, and Yuna has 3\* Support letting her use the Status Effect Busters if necessary so Support is pretty much useless on Aerith. Now Seal Evil is another one of Aerith's ""strong"" points. A 70% chance of landing both Silence AND Stop is amazing... on bosses vulnerable to either Silence or Stop! Fortunately they are *fairly* common vulnerabilities on bosses, but there will always be bosses immune to both effects, making this SB useless. This does make her another good character to equip a non-character specific SB on, but not everyone has 5\* equipment (Never do a 11x pull without praying to RNGesus!!!). Both of her 5\* SBs unfortunately seem pretty weak. Healing Wind is only slightly stronger than a Cura, and her Guard Stick has terrible stats (125 MAG, 75 MND) especially considering it's SB is a heal! I have no idea why Planet Protector increases ATK in FFRK, considering in FF7 it makes all allies invincible for a while... and she get's a 3rd SB weapon in a couple months which gives her a Soul Break called Dragon Force which makes all allies invincible against one enemy physical attack I believe, however has a completely different effect in FF7 and is a skill Aerith never even uses as she ""leaves"" the party prior to where you can obtain Dragon Force! No idea what went wrong there but it's not a huge deal as majority of us don't have any of her 5\* Weapons :) **Conclusion:** Aerith was our first and best White Mage ""back in the day"", but as Memory Crystals were released I myself forgot about Aerith and comparing her now to Yuna, Garnet, and even Selphie and Vanille, I see how many weaknesses she has. Her +4 higher MND over Yuna, doesn't nearly make up for Aerith's -350 HP, -8 DEF, -24 MAG, and -20 RES, and this stat disparity is nearly the same for Garnet and some other White Mages. Her Seal Evil is very useful against bosses who are vulnerable to either status effects, but is completely useless if the boss is immune to either, and while her abilities options are good it really doesn't make up for her other flaws. 2.5\4 White Mage/Caster &gt;5\* White Magic and great Mind Stat. She has a lot of variety in her ability kit and gets even more once she is buffed with 5\* Summons. Her other stats are crappy which significantly lowers her rating. 2/4 Overall &gt;The only time I can see myself using Aerith over Yuna, Garnet, and other future White Mages, is against a group of bosses vulnerable to either Stop or Silence, which has honestly happened a couple times! Her defensive stats leave her as one of the squishiest characters in the game, and she can't even equip Light Armor to make up for that. Sorry Aerith :'( &lt;/3 *Eiko and Steiner next week! Thanks for reading!!* "

Reno is very annoying due to his ability to confuse your character which when broken out off, will cause their ATB to reset, effectively delaying your character's turn. But his trademark annoyance is Pyramid which is a **STRONG DISPEL** that dispels all buffs and debuffs (Including Sentinel Grimoire!). Status vulnerabilities are blind and slow. Both bosses are at 120k HP ---- #General Tactics Alright, this is something I don't usually do. This fight is annoying due to Pyramid as it removes all self buffs. What more, both bosses are resistant to breaks which make it worse. Thus, comes the debate : Who do you aim first, Reno or Rude? I'd only recommend both if you have highly honed summons and AoE skills. **Rude first** If you aim Rude first, be warned that you will eat a lot of confusion and pyramids. Self buffs are practically useless at this point unless you have a highly honed Protectga or Shellga which I'm sure many don't. Focus your strategy around breaks and less on self buffs. Blind is also a necessity here as Reno's physical attacks are useless when blinded. Slowing Rude also helps with damage mitigation and buys time for Aerith to heal. *Recommended abilities : All breaks, Dark buster, Slowga, RW Shadow Flare* **Reno first** If you decide to aim Reno, you are going to have to pray a lot and also be ready to kill off Reno fast. This is due to Rude pumping out a lot of damage and Reno having the ability to cast Pyramid. Focus your strategy more in self buffs in this fight. Blind is not a neccessity though if you can fit it in your strategy, it would be best. The strategy usually involves having both Protectga and Shellga up to mitigate the damage from Rude, slow both bosses down while having Hastega up. This effectively gives your team 2.5 rounds per boss attack which should be enough in bringing Reno down fast before moving on to Rude. *Recommended abilities : Shellga, Protectga, Slowga, Lunatic High, Boon* **My strategy will be aiming Rude first.** ---- #Character lineup# * Cloud (Level 65) *front* * Vivi (Level 54) *back* * Quistis (Level 50) *back* * Tyro (Level 60) *back* * Aerith (Level 50) *back* #Ability Used# **Character**| **Ability 1**| **Ability 2**| **Record Materia** :--------:|:--------:|:--------: |:--------: Cloud | R3 Power Break| R3 Magic Break|Self-Sacrifice Vivi| R4 Comet| R2 Thundaja| Rod Mastery Quistis | R4 Comet | R2 Waterja| Devotion Tyro | R4 Faith| R2 Mental Breakdown|Sky Pirate's Pride Aerith | R5 Curaga | R1 Slowga|Light of the Fayth RW : Sephiroth's Shadow Flare #Equipment used# **Character**|**Weapon**| **Armor**| **Accessory** | **Focused Stats** :--------:|:--------:|:--------: |:--------:|:----: Cloud | 5\*+ Zantetsukan| 4\* Crystal Helmet |Champion Belt **(RS)** | ATK 310 Vivi| 5\* Full Metal Staff **(RS)** | 5\* Monk Robe| Angel Wing | MAG 351 Quistis | 2\*++ Mythril Rod **(RS)** | 5\* Sanctum Gloves| Magic Armlet | MAG 251 Tyro | 5\* Fujin's Chakram| 5\* Emerald Shield | Barrier Ring | DEF 176, RES 156 Aerith | 5\* Judgement Staff | 4\*+ Black Robe |Angel Ring | DEF 112, RES 189, MND 263 ---- #Tactics# During the first round, Cloud is to summon Sephiroth ^^^that ^^^sounds ^^^so ^^^wrong and with his first turn, hope that Reno is blinded to mitigate his physical attack damage. Don't worry if you miss the first time, but S/L if you fail to blind him. Aerith is to cast Slowga on Rude to reduce his damage output and buy time for Aerith to heal the team while Tyro casts Faith on Vivi. Vivi then casts Thundaja on Reno (If your Vivi has low MAG, hold out until the next round). Quistis is to do nothing. In the second turn, if you manage to blind Rude, quickly magic break him to reduce Fira's damage. Aerith should heal whoever is damaged as from experience, unless you have uber RS gear, you are going to mostly die to 2 attacks from them. Tyro should have 3 turns by now with haste. His second turn should be used to cast Faith on Quistis and the third turn is to cast mental breakdown on Rude. Now, a tip regarding the timing. Make sure that immediately after casting your breakdown, both Vivi and Quistis are to start casting their spells at the same time. This is to maximise damage output and fully utilise the time of the breakdown (Remember, we are still at the 72 action limit). The breakdown is to be refreshed after Vivi and Quistis cast 2 magic skills (Time it that way). Tyro should just wait out while Vivi and Quistis spam their spells so that he can break any confusion or pyramid that occurs. Refresh Faith if pyramid is casted. After Rude is dead, just go ham on Reno. If blind wears off, Slowga him and he should be manageable. #Damage input and output# Average damage received:- Without mitigation, Fira hits everyone at near 1.6k. Reno and Rude hits at 2k for Cloud and 1.5k for the backrow characters (1.2k for Tyro). After breaks are up, Fira hits at 1.3k while their physical attacks hit at around 1.6k for Cloud and 1.2k for the backrow characters (1k for Tyro). Average damage output :- * Cloud : 3500 (Breaks) / 2000 (Normal) * Vivi : 9999 (Thundaja + Faith) / 9600 (Thundaja) / 9000 (Comet + Focus + Mental Breakdown) / 8000 (Comet + Faith + Mental Breakdown) / 6000 (Comet + Faith) / 4000 (Comet) * Quistis : 9999 (Waterja + Faith + Mental Breakdown) / 8000 (Waterja + Faith) / 6800 (Waterja) / 6000 (Comet + Faith + Mental Breakdown) / 4500 (Comet + Faith) / 3000 (Comet) ---- #Frequently asked questions# **How much did your 5\* equipments contribute to the fight?** Full Metal Staff obviously helped my Vivi reach 9999 damage with just Faith so I could get a quick headstart without waiting for Mental Breakdown to go online. However, if you don't have it, as I had said, just wait for Mental Breakdown to go online and you should be hitting near the damage cap with Mythril Rod and Faith (See Quistis). Other 5\* equipment effects are almost negligible... **Can I use a physical heavy lineup?** Yes but it is most recommended if you can bring additional breaks as well so that the fight will be more bearable. **Where can I benchmark my damage?** The Demon Gate has almost similar stats to both Rude and Reno so you can benchmark your damage there. ---- ##Acknowledgements## A big thanks to /u/TFMurphy on his [Footsteps of the Cetra Enemy Stats and AI](URL thread.

URL The Rinoa reissue will need you to bring Irvine for the Seifer boss fight, it shouldn't be difficult but if your Irvine is in low level I would consider drag him to Sunday dungeons. You can only lose two medals for the final ++ boss fight: Seifer, Fujin and Raijin, with HP combined more than 300K. They do have debuff vulnerability like sleep/slow, and poison weakness. You really want to hone abilities for this one. For ppl don't bother go through videos JP players seem to spam their highest honed summons like valefor or alexander, two sets of quakes and bioras, so be prepared and do daily if necessary. The Golbez was covered recently so there is no much to say, I personally plan to hone three R4 Biora instead of comet. Zack is coming next then is Auron. Kimahri is required in one of the boss fight(almost forgot about him!). But his MC is released with this event so most of us will remember to level him. Edit: You get one Biora as reward in the Rinoa reissue event. Edit2: Being stupid and forgot one 0 for their HP, it is 300K combined."

The stats below are Eiko's important stats at level 50 compared to other White Mages and Summoners. | Character| HP | DEF | MAG | RES | MND | |:-----------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:| | *Eiko*|*2646*|*51*|*113*|*112*|*118*| | Yuna | 3015 | 59 | 116 | 104 | 116 | | Garnet | 3015 | 55 | 119 | 103 | 112 | | Aerith | 2680 | 51 | 94 | 85| 120| **Equipment:** Dagger, Rod, Staff, Instruments | Hat, Light Armor, Robe, Bracer **Abilities:** 5\* White Magic, 5\* Summon, 4\* Bard **Soulbreak:** *Shell - All* - Casts Shell on all allies. | *Millennial Decay* - Attack all enemies with Wind magical damage and reduce all enemys Magic (7.5x Magic Damage, -30% MAG, Might be incorrect!) **Comparing:** Eiko is one of the first characters who can use Bard skills and Im really excited about finally getting some Bard abilities. Bard abilities in past FF games are generally buffs, however unlike single target skills we currently have like Boost and Faith, Bards can buff your entire party with only one ability! Japan currently has both Sinewy Etude, which increases all allies ATK by 15% and Manas Paean, which increases all allies MAG by 15%, as well as a [few other skills](URL Boost increases ATK by 25% and Faith increases MAG by 20% but obviously only on one ally, which really can make Bard ability stands out! As Eiko has 4\* Bard, she is able to use every Bard skill currently in Japan as there aren't (and probably wont be for a while) any 5\* Bard abilities. I see this as a huge advantage over 1 to 3\* Support which quite a few White Mages have, as Eiko can really bring a lot of supportive power if youre using an all Mage or an all Warrior team. 5\* White Magic and Summoning is also very nice and both her MND and MAG stats are excellent so she can even use offensive Summons if necessary. Eikos equipment set is actually really good. Along with the typical caster weapons, she can equip Instruments which isnt *too* important as there are actually only two 5\* currently in Japan, but does give her another option if you have either of those weapons. Being able to equip Light Armor is HUGE for Eiko as her base HP and DEF are very low. Her HP is the 2nd lowest outside of Core characters in Japan and Light Armor cant fix that, but it can significantly raise her DEF and RES (Though her RES stat is actually excellent) higher than most other White Mages who are stuck with Robes, Hats or Bracers. Bringing up RES, Eiko has the 3rd highest RES in the Japanese version and its significantly higher than several of the other White Mages. Her default SB, which is basically Shellga, can be very useful as it can save an ability spot where you would have needed to equip Shellga! Her second SB is one of the very few Wind SBs and Wind abilities in general which should make getting some Friends who have it a priority for those bosses with Wind vulnerability conditions! **Conclusion:** I was worried about how Eiko would fare against Yuna and Garnet as all 3 are Summoners with only significant differences in their HP and DEF which Yuna and Garnet easily beat Eiko in, however because she can equip Light Armor it solves most of that problem. Compared to Selphie, Vanille, Aerith and Lenna, I see Eiko as more useful mostly because of her Summoning and Bard, however both Aerith and Lenna have default SBs that youd definitely want in certain situations but even then, Eikos default SB is also super helpful against any Magic casting boss. Her low HP is probably her biggest problem but its only about 50 points lower than both Lenna and Aerith and again she has the Light Armor advantage over most White Mages. 4\4 White Mage/Caster &gt;5\* Summons and White Magic as well as 4\* Bard gives Eiko a perfect variety of Healing, Support and Damage and the Bard skills give her a lot more Supportive power over Boost or Faith as the entire party benefits from just one cast. Both her HP and DEF are low (though only very slightly lower than Aerith and Lenna) however she can equip Light Armor to boost her DEF significantly higher, and her RES is the 3rd highest in the Japanese version! ~~3~~3.5/4 Overall &gt;While her Shellga SB is useful, there are several times when youre going to be against a full physical boss making it completely useless. Of course there are also going to be times when having a free Shellga is going to be a lifesaver, but along with her super low base HP it is significant enough to slightly lower her rating to a ~~3~~ 3.5 from a 4.

293,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Buffs and Debuffs Timing : Tips and Tricks (Part 2),25,3i7kdu,http://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3i7kdu/buffs_and_debuffs_timing_tips_and_tricks_part_2/,2015-08-25 01:12:30,"As promised, here is the continuation of the guide regarding buffs and debuffs. If you missed the last guide, the link to it is [here](URL This analysis will be divided into two parts. The first part is more of a basic usage of the first guide and is catered more to beginners. The second part will be more to exploiting the knowledge from the first guide to maximise each buff and debuff and is recommended for more advanced players. With that, let's begin ---- #Basic Tips and Tricks ##**1. When to refresh your skills?** If you have read the first guide, you should have a rough idea on how many turns a status debuff/buff last. Always remember to use the last round to refresh your buffs/debuffs so that they never expire. This is crucial for certain effects (Breaks, Paralyse, Sleep, Protect and Shell) as you want to avoid a foul hit by the boss when your buffs/debuffs are down. For example, paralyse lasts 2 rounds and three-quarters of a yellow bar. However, it is highly recommended to start refreshing the debuff two turns after it lands. Meaning, your order of action will be (Paralyse &gt; Action &gt; Paralyse). The extra time is just some bonus casting time if you miss it. ##**2. Chaining Buffs and Debuffs** So, you are interested in using the retaliate meta. However, to ensure that you don't end up hitting your own party member and accidentally killing him off, be sure that you refresh retaliate every two turns. This means that the order of action will be Retaliate &gt; Action &gt; Retaliate. This can be timed together with Boost which increases your attack even further. Boost is to be casted at every 3rd cast of Retaliate. This means that once your retaliator casts his third retaliate, Boost is to be refreshed as to chain the buffs so that it will never expire. Breaks can also be chained that way. Since breaks have the same duration as Retaliate, their order is also the same (Break &gt; Action &gt; Break). If you are using the mage meta instead, Faith replaces Boost and the same principle applies (Faith &gt; Action &gt; Action &gt; Action &gt; Faith). Please note that all the discussed order of action are that of normal ATB times. For hasted ATB times, it changes slightly. For example, the order of action for retaliate becomes (Retaliate &gt; Action &gt; Action &gt; Retaliate). ##**3. Check your enemy MND** This tip is for a niche of monsters that have high MND. A good example would be Materia Keeper from the FF7 dungeons. Now, there is a mechanic that I didn't highlight in the first part of this guide is that the status debuffs (poison, silence, paralysis, etc.) are dependent on MND. Blind, sleep, paralysis and stop increases or decreases in duration (1 second) for each 50 MND difference between the caster and the enemy whereas confuse and silence are 40 MND. Now, this is usually not a problem but enemies such as Materia Keeper have absurdly high MND which results in these status debuffs to last shorter than intended. Generally, if the difference is above 150MND, expect to lose one round in the status duration. For example, against Materia Keeper, if you use a fighter to paralyse him, the paralysis would only last roughly 2 full rounds only instead of the usual 2 full rounds and three-quarters a yellow bar. Be sure to check the enemy stats before deciding on the status debuff! ##**4. Theorycrafting** This is important for later bosses where they have high HP pools and your abilities are limited. Always benchmark your damage on the stage before the boss fight as those monsters usually have almost similar stats with the boss. Now, with the knowledge from the first guide, you can estimate how long your buffs and debuffs last and whether you can take the boss down within that given duration. For example, let's assume that an extremely hard boss is vulnerable to paralysis. Each paralysis lasts 2 full rounds and three-quarters a yellow bar. Assuming that you are bringing an R3 Intimidate and only half of the paralysis land (3 charges), will you be able to blitz the enemy down within the given time before he kills your team? Or do you need extra turns which require you to bring haste which should give you more time to damage him? Or more mitigation perhaps so you have more leeway to defeat him? Alright, maybe the example above is slightly ambiguous. Let's take the Rinoa EX+ battle as an example. We are only allowed to lose two medals in order to obtain mastery. In that fight, you will have to deal a total of 300k damage to Seifer, Fujin and Raijin. If we aim to lose one medal at action taken and one medal at damage taken, our actions are limited to 72 turns and HP loss to about 57% of the party total HP. Now, one of the status vulnerability of the bosses is Sleep. Sleep lasts 5 full rounds unhasted and if chained properly (According to /u/pintbox, there will be a relic that casts AoE sleep). you will have 10 full rounds to take them down. Ask yourself, will you be able to take them down in 10 turns? If not, how much mitigation will you need to master it. Knowing your limits before entering these boss battles will help you make better decisions regarding your ability loadout. Of course, I can continue to theorycraft at this fight but we'll leave this topic hanging here with hopes that you got the rough idea of it. ---- #Advanced Tips and Tricks ##**Synchronising timers between casters to maximise buff and debuff** The name might be fancy but this works in the same concept as shown by timing the Boost to Retaliate cast (Refreshing Boost at the third Retaliate cast). However, this is going to be an advanced version to the tactic where we will exploit it to maximise damage output with minimal honed abilities. Alright then, from the first part of the guide, it can be seen that breaks lasts 2 rounds and three-quarters of a yellow bar. Thus, the usual order of action would be to Break &gt; Action &gt; Break. In this order of action, usually the mages or hitters will get to slot in one or two ability usage. This means that the average ability to break ratio is 2:1 in the usual order of action. Now, if we were to synchronise the turn order of the break to that of the mage/hitter, we would be able to increase the ability to break ratio to 3:1, thus garnering an additional ability usage for each break. How you ask? It requires timing the ability usage to start directly after the break is used. This ensures that each spell hits within the break duration! For example, let's say that your supporter and your two mages all have their ATB gauge filled. Your supporter casts mental breakdown. Immediately as he begins the cast, your other mages should start casting their abilities as well. Hence, when the break is applied, both spells go off at roughly the same time. That means that you have synchronised the timing of your mages to that of the break! Thus, the break is only refreshed after your mages cast another two spells, giving it a total of three spells to one break! If this is confusing, here's a table to show you the order of the action. Note that the turns have been synchronised. Any desynchronisation will result in the spell to hit while the break is down though there is much leeway in this part (Three-quarters of a yellow bar to be exact) Character | 1st turn | 2nd turn | 3rd turn |4th turn :---- | :----: | :----: | :----: | :---: Support | Break | Action | Action | Break Mage | Spell | Spell | Spell |Spell Mage | Spell | Spell | Spell |Spell Now, this is only regarding spell casting. But what about those like Runic and Sentinel Grimoire (SG) for example? Is it possible to synchronise it to the enemy ATB? The answer is yes. Cast time of RW is roughly twice as long as the ordinary spells casted so assume that the length of the RW is about 3s which is two times the duration of the red bar. If you want to use it to block 5 enemy attacks instead of 4, you are going to time it very well. The timing is as such. Assume that the enemy has a 5s ATB gauge. If the first turn goes to the enemy, you can start estimating the ATB gauge of the enemy. Time the character to start casting the RW approximately 1 second after the enemy has taken its turn. That way, your Runic or SG will be able to block 5 enemy hits instead of 4. However, timing it requires practice and luck but getting that extra block is extremely useful especially in EX and EX+ boss fights. How about advantaliate? Similar to the first method, if you are able to synchronise the time your advance starts with all of the double cuts, you will be able to get an extra advance turn which translates to much more damage in one advantaliate turn! However, that requires much more precise timing as there isn't much leeway for advance (5 Full Rounds). ---- That's all from me. Hope you enjoyed the analysis and thanks for your attention.

294,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,FFRK Character Review - Vivi,19,3czd1k,http://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3czd1k/ffrk_character_review_vivi/,2015-07-12 13:59:37,"**Vivi - The Black Mage** **Stats, Equipment &amp; Abilities** Vivi is a backrow Black Mage and his stats to take note of are magic and resistance. &gt;1st highest Magic (Both Global and JPN version) &gt;2nd highest Resistance (Both Global and JPN AGAIN) &gt;&gt;Behind Celes &gt;Equipment: Dagger, Rod, Staff | Hat, Robe, Bracer &gt;Abilities: Black Magic 5* &gt;Soulbreak: Focus Magic: Temporarily raise users magic (by 30% for 25 secs according to [FFRK Toolkit](URL **Comparisons** When I first saw Vivi I thought he would be kind of like Lenna, in that they both have the highest stat in their respective class and trade that stat for a lack of other abilities. In Lenna's case that can be seen as a problem as White Mages should be able to at least use Support skills IMO, but Black Mages really only need that 4 or 5* Black Magic to be a viable Black Mage. Vivi's high magic stat paired with his default Soulbreak can lead to some crazy high damage amounts and you're going to almost always find Vivi easily hitting 9999 damage when exploiting a vulnerability. As we are all aware, it's a staple in FF games for casters *(White, Black, Sages etc.)* to have low Health and Defense stats and this really stands out in Vivi as he has the lowest Health out of all the named characters (Non-Core Characters), and his Defense is also pretty low. First off, why the Core Character Knight has less health than Vivi and Rydia who are both like 10 years old really confuses me but anyways Vivi's extremely low Health is easily his biggest weakness as he has about 400 less health than Rinoa and 700 less health than Terra **at level 50**, and even at level 65 barely beats Terra in health. Bringing up the level cap though, a huge reason why Vivi is such a popular character now is because he is one of the few Black Mages who has a Memory Crystal currently! Compared to Terra and Rinoa, Vivi does lack the variety the ladies have in both equipment and abilities. Both Terra and Rinoa can equip a physical weapon type, Swords for Terra and Thrown for Rinoa, and as both of those are fairly common weapon types it does help them out quite a bit. Both have a large variety of ability sets and Terra can use all armor types in the game, which clearly makes Terra and Rinoa two very good characters. Vivi has a higher magic stat as well as a default Soulbreak which increases his magic output, unlike both Terra and Rinoa who have pretty crappy defaults, and most importantly Vivi has a Memory Crystal while the other two will most likely not be getting Memory Crystals for at least a month or two! **Conclusion** If you got Vivi's Memory Crystal, which I'm assuming several of you readers have as the Princess of Alexandria event was only a few weeks ago, I'd have to recommend making Vivi your go-to Black Mage as his Magic stats are unmatched, and both his Record Materia are very good (10% more damage with Rods and MAG +20% DEF -10%, correct me if I'm wrong on that!) and both help increase his already high magic even farther. Vivi's Double Bio Soulbreak is also pretty awesome as there aren't too many bosses with resistances to bio, and he also has a Double Meteor Soulbreak in the Japanese version... Who doesn't like Double Meteors!? I give Vivi a **4.5 out of 5** rating. Until we get more Black Mages, or Memory Crystals for the current ones, Vivi is going to stay as a top tier character! It would be interesting to know how Vivi compares to the other Black Mages in the Japanese version, because I can see his low Health and Defense becoming problematic even at level 65, but his high Magic and Resistance could easily make up for that! *Going to be doing Red XIII or Fran next! Leave a comment if you have any specific requests though. Thanks for reading!*"
295,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,New Players - what to do with your stamina,35,3d2ges,http://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3d2ges/new_players_what_to_do_with_your_stamina/,2015-07-13 10:05:31,"Hey guys, Typed up this real quick for another post, and figured I would make a quick thread in case it helps anyone - seeing lots of new players enter the game and I know that it is overwhelming with so many options. Here is a quick list of recommendations: &gt; Your first priority is to win events (at least ""complete"") and pick up new characters. However, it is important to note that you can generally leave events for just a few days before they expire, as the longer you wait, the more powerful you will get, particularly with respect to being able to plan a strategy. Always check this reddit for suggested ability loadouts, hones, etc, it has helped me get through just about every event with no problems since I have started using it. &gt; Your second priority is to increase stamina. You will do this by completing the storyline dungeons. The ""classic"" round of dungeons generally give two shards if you master - you should plan to master each one the first time around. This means read the boss guide and bring appropriate abilities. Hones are less important than sheer variety at this point, but don't go overboard. Also note that, as discussed below, you should strongly consider taking Tuesdays-Thursdays off of both events and dungeons in favor of HONING. Also, the Sunday XP bonus daily is generally a great time to get new characters up to speed, and you will probably need to run gold / equipment upgrade dailies from time to time in order to support the rest of the strategy I am outlining. &gt; As alluded to above, your third priority is to acquire and hone some very important abilities that will be key to your success. They are as follows, in general priority order: &gt;&gt;**Retaliate** - hone to R5 ASAP &gt;&gt;**Curaga** - same as above &gt;&gt;**Boost** - the only useful 1* ability long-term, hone it early on and use religiously &gt;&gt;**Intimidate** - hone to R3 at least; many bosses are susceptible to it &gt;&gt;**Firaga / Blizzaga** - hone to R3 ASAP, then R4 when you have orbs. Note that I left out Thundaga, it is too Lightning orb-intensive to be a priority, get a R3 Thunder Strike on your spellblades and/or bring Rinoa RW instead for exploit weakness criteria / deeps. &gt;&gt;**Spellblades** - start with crafting the 2* variants so you can bring to storyline dungeons for masteries, and gradually hone higher as you need them; swap to 3* variants once your mage has enough casts (don't waste time honing 2* BLM after a certain point). &gt;&gt;**Power / Magic Break** - hone to R2 ASAP, these help with longevity, stretching the value of your heals and other hones. &gt;&gt;**Armor Break** - more DPS also stretches value of heals, but this is a bit less important. &gt;&gt;**Protectga** - this should be your first 4* ability unless you have an item such as Kaiser Shield that casts it as a SB. Maybe craft R1 Quake first still... &gt;&gt;**Quake** - this should be your first or second 4* ability, and also your first 4* hone &gt;&gt;**Slowga** - extremely good, esp. if you are not using Tidus. R1 is fine. &gt;&gt;**Berserk** - has some surprising effects when you use on bosses, from turning AoE abilities into single-target, to actually having your enemy heal / buff you. Useful to have as an option, but hone Curaga to R4 first. &gt; In order to acquire these abilities, it is very important to ""grind"" specific daily dungeons, namely from Tuesday to Thursday. Summing everything up, here is a quick schedule that I would recommend following: &gt;&gt;**Sunday**: XP Daily - try running Heroic first stage with AoE PHYSICAL damage RW summons as soon as you can. Boost Retaliate and then RW + DEFEND should be able to get you through once you have a decently geared warrior. Until then, run hard, and don't forget to put everyone besides retaliator on back row until you can deal with incoming damage. When going for mastery for maximum XP + eggs, Sentinel Grimoire RW is your friend. &gt;&gt;**Monday**: Stamina / Events &gt;&gt;**Tuesday**: Orbs (lesser until enough for Retaliate R5, then normal for breaks / spellblades / busters) &gt;&gt;**Wednesday**: Orbs (lesser until enough for Retaliate R5, then normal for Curaga R5 and Intimidate) &gt;&gt;**Thursday**: Orbs - just normals for Curaga R5 and more physical hones. &gt;&gt;**Friday**: Stamina / Events &gt;&gt;**Saturday**: Stamina / Events **Some more points** - S/L is doing a force reset on your app when something bad happens, such as a nasty debuff, RNG character death, dumb move, or other shenanigans. The effect is that you go back to the beginning of the battle that you were just in. You also have the option to retreat. Note that this game is not really possible to play without abusing this ""feature."" In fact, we are pretty sure that the devs have long since given up putting in a fix and have balanced the game around the fact that we have this option available at any point. This is also the correct way to retreat, as doing so ingame will ""save"" all of your ability uses, health, character deaths, and RW counter, whereas doing it from the ""Interrupted"" screen will wipe out all of that nonsense. Make sure to accept quests before you craft or hone abilities. Here is a nice little list (not made by me) of all the quests: URL HOWEVER, resist the urge to craft something just to complete one of these quests. Your first use of Summon Orbs should be Shiva (help with Baigan elite, no other form of AoE ice damage in game as of yet). Incidentally, make sure that you accept the quest. Probably OK to hone this one too (get quest!). Cloud is the best character in the game, he is the best (and one of the only) option for Retaliate Meta, and is useful for just about every setup. That does not mean that he should get all of your growth eggs. In fact, don't give him any, unless it is your first few weeks and you somehow got a greater. It is generally better to save the eggs for boosting new characters (all will start at level 1) in order to grab as many elite event rewards as possible with the help of the +10 level synergy bonus. Related to above; I did not specifically discuss Retaliate Meta although I mentioned the ability. sevenhundredone detailed how it works below in case you are not aware, so I won't waste your time rehashing, just be aware that this game is all about offense, and giving your best-geared warrior additional actions is very strong. I would not go so far as to hone Double Cuts though and this is why I did not mention them above - your other melee should be using Breaks and/or Busters by the time you get a mature set of abilities, so the retaliate is really only there for the mage and healer to have something to do, and to reduce incoming physical damage by 20% (5 members, 1 will not take damage while retaliate is active). It is certainly possible to clear content without Retaliate, and I actually find myself using it less and less, but there is no doubt that it is extremely useful for new players with very little gear and hones. There is also something called VIT0 but I don't particularly want to talk about it here. You can get by without it. In fact, don't rush leveling to 65, as each level you get closer to 65 is one more opportunity you are giving away to perform a level up in the middle of a boss rush to refresh abilities. Once your main party starts going over level 50, consider swapping in other characters that will either be useful for future events, or have very strong record materia (**Black / White Mages, Bard**). If you can afford it, do the **100 gem first draw** on each banner. I actually did not know about this until last month, nice little opportunity to snag something good (even most 3* gear will likely be very useful, esp. with synergy). **RW Summons** - in particular, try to grab the following: &gt;Tyro - Sentinel Grimoire: always useful, particularly when going for heroic daily mastery (can't lose star for incoming damage more than once) &gt;Red13 - Lunatic High: fantastic SB, even better than SG in some situations (more speed = less damage taken, faster heals, can prolong longevity of Retaliate / buffs / debuffs). However does not impede magical damage, and sometimes you need to stack Protectga AND SG... &gt;Sephiroth - Shadow Flare: AoE physical damage + blind, very nice and one of the only ways to get blind status. &gt;Vanille - Deprotectga: this is fantastic, AoE, acts as an armor and magic breakdown for ~30 seconds, causing all of your abilities to hit harder, and only does a tiny bit less damage than other AoEs. Does not exploit vulnerability though, so not always the best choice. Note that Wakka's Status Ball is also good, but has like 1/3 the duration on one target. &gt;Cecil - Sentinel: causes user to ""taunt"" all enemies, having them send all attacks to him. Long duration. Can be used for great effect with retaliate! Very nice vs a few bosses that have multiple targets that have really painful physical attacks (FF13 esp.). Also nice to have as an option in general, another tool under your belt... &gt;Rinoa - Valkyrie: 3 hit thunder attack, will break damage cap without vulnerability , with vulnerability it's likely 3x 9999 (another reason I do not recommend crafting Thundaga - those bosses get erased by this). &gt;Vivi - Doublecast Venom: one of the only ways to cast poison damage, and can break damage cap, 2x 9999 vs vulnerability. &gt;Aerith - Seal Evil: very useful vs a few bosses; not a lot of people still run this as it is a default SB, but try to keep two or three on your list for when you need it. &gt;Locke - Mirage: AoE slow and good damage, very useful vs a few bosses. &gt;Anyone - AoE Magic: Terra, Rydia, anyone with Full Metal Staff or comparable relic. NOT Cloud with Thunder Sword, Earthquake, etc, those blow. You want 250+ MAG stat, preferably with realm synergy (you can drill down to see stats by holding down on portraits). &gt;Sephiroth - Hell's Gate: One of the few AoE Physical SBs worth a damn. &gt;Celes - Runic: one character absorbs incoming black magic, refreshing abilities on that character instead of taking damage. There are better SB options for most scenarios. Note that, while it does not intercept all black magic cast, it does have a very long duration, so you could potentially have two of your party members (likely the mages) immune to nasty spells while restoring abilities. Situational but could turn out to be invaluable down the road. &gt;As far as physical AoE or single target such as Tidus Spiral Cut, Cloud Braver, etc, you can grab a few, especially level 65s, but in general, magic AoE is better because it can exploit vulnerability. &gt;AoE heals are, for the most part, garbage SBs. Great to have on your team though. &gt;I may have missed a few good ones, feel free to add to thread. See this thread for codes: URL **Mythril** - in general, try to avoid temptation to use it for stamina refresh or event completion / matery early on; the first 11x draw will likely multiply your power significantly. That said, be careful as to which banners you pick to 11x draw from. If there is no 5* sword or dagger option, I would pass. If you will end up getting a duplicate 5* with respect to realm synergy, I would pass. There are other guides on this that go into more detail, but the big picture is to be frugal and avoid trying to target specific items; the RNG Gods do not like to be tested. One more thing of note - while we are all currently in Retaliate Meta, and it is expected to continue to thrive, there is a Mage Meta on the horizon. So when you are pulling for that shiny sword and get a 5* rod instead, you should be very happy with it! In general, only grind XP on Sundays; grind **orbs &gt; stamina &gt; events** on other days as discussed above, picking up gold and upgrade materials as needed. **Final Words** Regarding the 100 gem first time draw, if you are able / planning to spend Real Money on this game, I would highly recommend considering this as your ""subscription"" and blocking yourself from making any additional investments. There is abundant mythril in the game at present, more than enough to get you enough gear from new banners in order to progress. Furthermore, this game is FUN to play, as long as it remains a challenge. You can either plan, research, experiment, or you can flip a coin to decide as to which of your 7*-geared unstoppable dervishes of destruction you will throw on the hapless unsuspecting event boss this week. Which sounds more enjoyable to you? Not to mention that the unsubsidized cost of the draws is redonkulous - two 11x draws = the price of a AAA game...really? Certainly there are people out there willing to pay these prices; all the rest of us can do is thank them for their sponsorship! Remember, have fun, and enjoy this nostalgic romp through the 90s. If you are stuck and need help on a boss, let us know, we can help you. If you take the route of the drooling gambling addict spending your kid's college fund to try to get Sephy's sword... we can't help you, so don't do that, OK? May add more to this later, in the meantime please post if you have any specific questions or comments."

With RecordPeeker and a little work, you can. RecordPeeker (and Forever24): URL When running recordpeeker, try ""recordpeeker -h."" Note the verbosity option. The description seems off, so try ""recordpeeker -v2."" Then enter a battle. In your terminal, you'll see the normal recordpeeker drop table. But you'll also see stuff above it. Search that for the name of an enemy in battle, and it'll give the stats et al. For example, if fighting the Archaeosaur battle, you can search for ""Archaeosaur"" and find: ""disp_name"": ""Archaeosaur"", ""eva"": ""62"", ""exp"": 576, The Archaeosaur (in the normal Rinoa dungeon) has EVA 62 and gives 576 experience. This also has stuff like the Level (19), HP (19798), its attacks and frequencies, counters and frequencies, and vulnerability to elemental and status effects. You can even find stuff like messages that should appear if you take specific heroes into specific battles. (E.g., Rinoa into Edea's fight. Or Irvine...) I don't have it all worked out, and I'm still waiting on stamina to just finish Rinoa's normal event. So I'm hoping the community can work together to get stats on stuff without reinventing the wheel. (Is there an enemy stat spreadsheet? I couldn't find one.) I'm sure we'd all love to see hard numbers on the Rinoa Elite enemies and the harder daily dungeons, but stats on earlier dungeons would still be helpful for many. (I'm going to flair this under Cheat/Exploit because RecordPeeker is cheating. At the least, you can see potion/ether drops at the start of the round.) "
301,vulnerability,FFRecordKeeper,Why I think we should prioritize honing our 3* breaks (Really Long Post),12,36frca,http://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/36frca/why_i_think_we_should_prioritize_honing_our_3/,2015-05-19 11:13:22,"Of course we always have discussions for both newer and older players about which skills are great to hone. Current strategies including VIT0, Retaliate + Boost, and honed Quakes to easily clear stages are great, but we must accept that these strategies may not be applicable in all situations and perhaps some dungeons will require party compositions that will not allow us to take advantage of these skills. I mention the above strategies because they have garnered a lot of attention as of late on this subreddit and I wanted to make sure that a surely viable strategy is also not overlooked. I want to talk about the 3* breaks and their importance. Before I begin, I will have to say I'm likely biased because break honing is currently the strategy I use to clear content on JFFRK. Additionally, I am by no means claiming to be a seasoned veteran of this game or a prodigy, and nor do I think I hold a vast knowledge of every strategy possible. Also I apologize because that last sentence is written really bad but I'm too lazy to fix it. Lastly, for some reason I worship lindmejo (youtube guy) and that's where I get this idea from. I think it's super important to hone your 3* break skills. I'm talking like 8-10 uses each of armor, power, and magic break (I don't use mental break because the 5* weapons I have pulled are all physical so my parties are mostly physical based). Unfortunately, unless we all agree that a strategy which includes the consistent (and well-timed) application of breaks is one of the most consistent strategies to clear content not only now but also in future content, my input is practically irrelevant and impractical. This is because if we want to clear content, surely we would want to use a strategy that is tried and true. Long boss battles with multiple separate health bars (like the squid from FFVI that has multiple health bars so it's impossible to kill him in 1-hit technically) as well as boss rushes (dungeons with consecutive boss fights) already exist in JFFRK. If we intend to clear these dungeons and events without the use of mythril, then we will somehow need to maintain the health of our characters, right? We ought to consider ways to conserve health in these fights. How about simply taking less damage and dealing more through the use of breaks? Because of this, we will need multiple uses of each break to maintain their duration throughout long fights. When talking about maintaining health, why wouldn't we just create parties that have two or more dedicated healers? For now, lets assume spells that apply status ailments like sleep, poison, and slow cannot be relied on in future content. Now, consider that these healers would be equipped in one of two ways: two honed healing spells such as a honed curaga and a honed cura, or a honed healing spell alongside a supporting spell that reduces damage or increases damage such as protectga/shellga or boost (Aerith for example is capable of this setup). This is surely a viable composition but is clearly dependent on the use of retaliate in order to deal a damage consistent enough to maintain medals in both damage and actions taken. That's my explanation on throwing this idea out the window. Finally, I should supply reasons why every party should at least include the damage reduction breaks. The first being that reduction of damage means that your characters do not became endangered of dying too quickly. Some bosses taken multiple actions for their turn which may result in your entire party taking massive damage or leaving a member of your party on the edge of dying. Your healer may not be able to keep up with this, and thus damage taken ought to be mitigated in some way. Pretty obvious, right? A second reason that some people may like is that honing of breaks is not entirely weapon dependent. What I mean by this is that, well theoretically, as long as bosses deal low and manageable amounts of damage, then you will live to kill said bosses and clear content (albeit possibly without mastering it). This means that if the damage stats of your characters are relatively low due to a lack of strong weapons or record-synergy, you need not to fear because constant break application is by your side. I'll leave some videos here that I suggest people who are interested should watch. The first is of Lindmejo clearing the Elite T-Rex boss and obtaining a mastery score with a considerably ill-equipped team which can be found here: URL Again, make note that his strongest character is Cloud equipped with a Galbadian Blade++ (I assume it's ++). With management of his power break, none of his party members die despite his healer running out of heals. Another video which perhaps demonstrates the entirety of my post is the FFXIII boss battle for Hope's Memory Crystal: URL A few things to mention about this video: - We can see this player has some 5-star relic weapons, with Auron's and Cloud's being character specific and not generic 5-stars, meaning that these weapons provide 100+ points in their respective damage stat. However it is obviously not the best equipment possible (FFXIII synergistic equipment would be the best), and thus the player is working with what he has. I must mention that Cloud's and Auron's Soul Breaks deal tremendous amounts of damage (Cloud's deals over 10,000), yet the player barely manages to survive in the end thanks to careful management of break duration alongside support from the friend-system. Do you think this boss is beatable with zero deaths with no 5-star equipment? Likely not. Therefore, we can conclude that this fight is difficult. - The boss fight is separated into three parts (four, technically), each with their own distinctive health bars. If we assume that applying a break ability such as power break only reduces the incoming damage from that particular part AND that the timing of each break is of utmost importance because it is not possible to kill that particular part within the duration of said break, then it becomes clear how important having a high number of breaks available to use is. - Because of the high amount of health this boss has and that they are separated with some parts being untargetable until a previous part is destroyed, strategies such as VIT0 and Armor Reduction stacking (armor break + armor breakdown + Wakka's Soul Break) are likely not viable. - This last part is speculation, but the only reason the player used Hope (a black magic user) in this battle is because the 1st and 2nd parts have elemental vulnerability. The 3rd part does not and is also timed. Because the last part is timed and that you must use skills to pass the first two parts, you need highly honed abilities to last the entirety of the battle. That's all I wanted to say. I know that some of my points are really obvious, but I hope that the importance of breaks and their usage becomes known for everyone. It'd be great to hear other's thoughts on this subject as well."
