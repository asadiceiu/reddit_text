He felt offended I never talked about his health and dumped me. We stayed friends. He continued to feel offended that I avoided the topic of mental health. I have realized later on, after he ended our relationship for good, that maybe I was the issue too. He's been in a domestic relationship with the same woman for a good while now. He could be a jerk some days but he wasn't well, and no one supported him. The man i'm dating now also has mental health issues. He quit his medication and without it he can't control his impulses. He's agreed to seek help. He picked up his medication again and has started taking it. While he's been without it we've argued all the time. He gets very sad some days and say I never say anything nice to him whereas he always goes on about everything he likes about me. He feels that I don't say sweet things *and* I don't want to express my emotions physically due to the pandemic so he gets nothing. And he kinda doesn't seem to understand the seriousness of the pandemic which angers me. I have a short fuse. He tries though. He took his meds again without argument and he's done other things too. But we are not in a good place. We haven't talked for a few days but I texted him a bit tonight, we'll likely talk tomorrow. We're drifting apart and it's causing pain in both of us. The communication is failing somewhere and that's most likely on me. He's good at expressing himself, I never have been. That is my issue -everything related to communication. I don't show my emotions. I just have this blockage when it comes to showing vulnerability. I'm always on defense too. It's no excuse but i've been hurt before so i'm always ready to attack and I don't feel bad about it until it's far too late. Even getting wronged the tiniest bit triggers me. I would really appreciate some advice on how to handle this better. I honestly suck at being self aware when it comes to my own issues and only see what the other person does wrong but I can be pretty toxic myself and I want to improve that."
1,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Be Patient With Yourself Right Now. [Story &amp; Ramblings],1,i4hfbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/i4hfbq/be_patient_with_yourself_right_now_story_ramblings/,2020-08-06 10:29:52,"This is a really long post. Like, really long. I wrote it mostly for myself to help me process all of this. But I decided to post it in hopes of maybe it'll help one or two of you. It has been a really tough year. At the end of last year everything in my life finally seemed to be falling into place. I got a huge promotion that earned me a leadership role at work. I was losing weight, I was working hard on my mental health with my therapist, hell, I was even getting more reading done than I usually do! Honestly, I was in a better place than I'd been in in years. This continued into January and February of this year, but then in March the company I was working for started struggling because of COVID. I was told that I needed to come up with a list of who I would keep on my team if I had to cut 75% of them. That week was hard. Gossip travels fast, and soon my team was asking me if they should be worried about layoffs. I looked them in the eyes and said I hadn't heard anything, even while I was making that list. A week later I was meeting with my manager going over my final list when a mysterious meeting got put on our calendar. The guest list was hidden. We both wondered what it was about. Thirty minutes later we (and 25% of our company) were told by our CEO over Zoom that if we were on this call, we were being laid off. IT locked me out of the computer within thirty seconds of the meeting ending. No saying goodbye. No getting contact info from coworkers. Over. I was a week from my four year anniversary with the company. Now I've always struggled with depression and some anxiety, but it was always manageable by exercising a couple times a week, making sure to drink enough water, write in my journal--the little things. But after getting laid off, depression hit hard. In 2019 I lost about sixty pounds. Since I got laid off I've gained 20 of it back. The anxiety was a slow burn though. I didn't notice how bad it was getting. After George Floyd's murder, a few friends of mine decided to go to one of the BLM protests in town--the chapter in my area was doing a car protest where we'd drive around the sheriff's office and honk and I was determined to go. The night before, I woke up at 2am having a panic attack. I'd never had one before. It was awful. About a week later my parents got exposed to COVID. I became convinced despite their good health that they were going to die from this, so I drove down to help my sister living at home take care of them in quarantine. But really, I just knew I wanted to be there if these might be their last days. They have a fairly big house, so we easily sectioned off half for them, and had a hand off point where we'd fill up pitchers of water and bring them food. Thankfully they never developed any symptoms, so after a week I drove home and started my own quarantine just in case. A few days later I couldn't fall asleep because of really bad shortness of breath. I thought, here it is. This was the risk I took for my parents, and now I got it. I have a hard time with doctors, so I waited a couple days to see if symptoms would worsen. Each night and for most of the day I had shortness of breath. Finally after one really bad night, I set up an appointment to get tested. What surprised me was that as soon as I got tested, I immediately felt better. That should have been a sign it might have been anxiety. I tested negative for COVID. For about a week I was fine. But then the shortness of breath kept coming back every few days. Usually the shortness of breath came after obsessively looking at footage of violence at the protests that I was ashamed I wasn't able to attend. Finally after a week or two and a really bad night, I called my doctor. I had been reluctant, not only because of my weird thing with doctors, but I was ashamed that the last time I saw him he had been raving about how much weight I lost last year, and I didn't want him to see how much I'd put back on in so short of a time. But lastly I was hesitant because I'd been laid off! I no longer had my amazing health insurance, and was too mentally drained to look up and see what Medicaid would cover. When I finally got in to see the doctor I was so emotionally and physically drained. I think he could tell and was immediately pretty sure it was anxiety. But just to be safe he gave me a lung X-Ray and did an EKG. The EKG came back slightly abnormal, so he consulted with a cardiologist who recommended I get a stress test done. I went in for the stress test, honestly almost feeling dead inside by that point--convinced my struggle with obesity in adulthood had now ruined my heart. They put tracer in me so they could image my heart. I then got on the treadmill, and they told me that normally they'd rather have people just run until their heart rate gets up high enough. But because of COVID and the potential of aerosolizing the virus, they told me they recommended I take a special medication that would artificially stress out my heart instead. I really didn't want to do it that way, especially since even though I'm a big dude, I'm perfectly capable of running. But I also didn't want to put anyone at risk, so I agreed. Honestly, the whole thing was an awful experience. It felt like my flight or fight response was triggered. My heart started pounding and I was sweating while only walking on the treadmill. I hated it. Thankfully after all the tests everything came back normal, and the doctor told me that my anxiety was definitely causing my issues. It felt like such a defeat to be prescribed medication for something I'd always been able to manage my whole life. Especially when I looked back at how I started this year! I would have been angry and frustrated if I wasn't so numb. Fuck 2020 I kept telling myself. As the side effects for the medication rocked me even more, I kept thinking, fuck 2020. As my appetite and libido dropped to nothing: fuck 2020. When I alternated between nausea and diarrhea: Fuck 2020. Insomnia? Fuck 2020. When on that third week my depression got worse than it's ever been? Fuck 2020. Today it's been six weeks since I was prescribed medication. I realized that I've finally felt good consistently for the past three or four days. I've been sleeping better, I've been responding to texts, I've even gotten back to working on my writing projects again. My mind is clearer. I've been cooking breakfast again. I went for a walk yesterday. My libido has even returned (mostly). I know this year has been rough. I know it's put on hold a lot of things in our lives. I know there are so many awful things happening in the world right now that it's hard to even know what to do. But my doctor said he's getting multiple people every day with the exact symptoms as me. Anxiety and depression are hitting us all hard. Be mindful of how you're feeling, and don't be afraid to get what you need to survive. We need to remember to let go of what we have no control over, and be patient with ourselves when it's just too hard to keep going. Right now, for me it's a daily effort to stop hating myself for the weight I gained back and for the time I wasted on projects I was too depressed to work on. But I have to remind myself that I'm just not in a place to live my life as normally as I usually do. Right now my priority is to get better. That needs to be your priority too. I live a very privileged life. Even with still being laid off, I'm lucky enough to be in a financial place that I've been able to make it so far. I know a lot of you are in worse situations and don't know what to do. I know a lot of you might even be in better situations but are still really struggling right now too. Don't forget to be patient with yourself if you've had to put projects or goals on hold. I think our achievement based society makes us feel like failures if we aren't constantly moving, but fuck that shit. At least for right now, fuck that mentality. But if you're in a place right now where you aren't even worried about achievements or goals, and are just worried about surviving--right now I want you to make a promise to yourself and to me that you'll do what it takes to take care of yourself during all this. Because you fucking deserve it. If you need help, please reach out to someone. Whether it's a family member, a friend, or to me. I know how fucking hard it is to reach out. It's so hard. But think about the times when other people have reached out to you for help and how nonjudgemental and ready you were to help them. You deserve to feel that support in response to some vulnerability too. Have a good cry in the shower. Meditate. Workout. Eat an ice cream sandwich for breakfast (did that yesterday, highly recommend). Do whatever you have to do! If you've been looking for a sign this is it. You deserve to be okay. Do what you have to do to get the help you need to survive this. We'll worry about growing again once we're strong enough to do so. Until then, patience. And while we're at it let's cut other people a break too. Many of us live extremely privileged lives even when we're struggling. You don't know what people around you are going through either. Be excellent to each other."

4,vulnerability,mentalhealth,The Freedom in Embracing Conflict,1,iea3b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/iea3b7/the_freedom_in_embracing_conflict/,2020-08-22 11:58:17,"Last week, I discussed some of the cultural reasons for why [conflict was so terrifying for me as an Asian American](URL But conflict in general can be intimidating for many reasons: * It requires vulnerability. * It tests the relationship between two people. * It can end up being verbally, emotionally, or even physically painful. However, conflict doesnt have to be bad and it doesnt always have to damage a relationship. Conflict can be good. It can get people on the same page and prevent future misunderstandings from happening. It can even strengthen a relationship. In this way, there is freedom in embracing healthy conflict. # My Friend Bob I had a friend in seminary who was also in the Pastoral Care and Counseling program. One day, he got upset with one of the professors. He felt like the professor was a hypocrite and that the professor didnt care about him. Because of this, Bob refused to forgive him until the professor apologized. Bob ended up venting to me everyday in class for over month. He stewed in his anger and with each passing day, it grew worse. His frustration was palpable. It manifested in the way he slouched in his chair in class and the anger he had when he talked about the professor. But heres the thing. The professor had no idea that he had offended Bob. So Bob was essentially stuck in an endless cycle of anger and bitterness without an exit strategy. The professor wasnt going to apologize because he wasnt aware of what was going on! Eventually I encouraged Bob to confront the professor and said, Why dont you talk to him about it? He has no idea that you feel this way. Youre holding him to a standard he isnt aware of and youre blaming him for not living up to it which is making you angrier. Im sure hed apologize if you brought it up. Watching Bob struggle like this was painful for me. Why? Because I was (am) Bob. There have been several times in my life where Ive held onto bitterness and have regretted it. I wasted so much time and energy being mad that it robbed me of my opportunity to enjoy life. Had I only embraced conflict and not been so terrified of it, the quicker I couldve resolved it and gotten more out of life. Looking back, there were several occasions where I had wasted years of a relationship due to a simple misunderstanding. For example in High School, I had a close friend named James. He was a huge Lakers fan and I was a huge Clippers fan. I made a really dumb comment about Kobe and we ended up not talking for an entire year until he approached me to bury the hatchet. What a silly reason to miss out on a years worth of friendship! Avoiding conflict has robbed me of many wonderful opportunities. But embracing it has given me the freedom to experience them. ## The Freedom of Embracing Conflict By choosing conflict, several things happen: 1. You communicate that you care enough to fight for the relationship. 2. You stand up for yourself. 3. You create opportunities to strengthen the relationship. When I was in therapy, there were a few rocky moments that occurred. One of them was when I felt like my therapist broke a promise he made with me. The week before, we had run out of time when I was processing something difficult and he assured me that he would bring it up first thing in our next session. Unfortunately, he ended up forgetting. Because of this, my trust in him was slightly broken. I was hurt because I felt like maybe my issue wasnt important enough for him to remember. But the funny thing is, I was mentally aware that I was being very overly sensitive. He probably had several clients that week. Hes also human and so he should be allowed to make mistakes. If I really wanted to talk about the issue, I should be the one to bring it up. But it still bothered me so I decided to confront him. At first I was scared. I didnt want to further ruin the relationship because I was making a fuss over something so small. I was ashamed of how I felt. But it was important for me to give a voice to my feelings and so I confronted him. When he apologized, the relationship was very quickly repaired and my trust in him grew even stronger. After that, I was able to go deeper in our sessions because I felt safe. Also, the other times he made a mistake didnt affect me as much because our relationship was more secure. By embracing conflict, I was able to clear the air and get on the same page. I was also able to stand up for myself by giving my feelings a voice. And finally, I felt the boldness and the freedom to go deeper in my sessions with my therapist. # Discussion Questions * When has conflict resulted in something positive in your life? * What happened? * What lessons did you learn from it?"

I am not looking to self diagnose in any way I am simply looking for advice on my current situation. I have strong reason to believe that I have some sort of mental illness or disorder. I very suddenly get what I call (to myself) rage attacks. It is similar to what I would perceive a panic attack is like but not really. It can randomly happen out of nowhere with just the smallest thing like accidentally dropping something, or someone annoying me triggering it. It also happens when I am injured heavily. It begins with a sudden feeling of vulnerability or irritancy. I slowly escalate into more and more rage and violent aggression. In my mind I see it slowly happen and cant do anything to stop as I slowly become more impulsively violent. It gets to the point where even the smallest thing such as someone asking are you ok will make me want to bash their skull in with whatever I have on hand. When this happens it usually lasts a few minutes and I have to isolate myself and tell anybody near me to stop talking. It ends just as fast as it begins. I have read about IED and it seems similar but I really dont know. This could just be a normal thing but I doubt it. Any input about this from anyone would help. Thanks in advanced."

I wanted to scream because she told me this too late and I'm already long past that threshold. I also cried in my room blaming myself for slipping up a little on the facade that I was okay the other night. It's not like I've been metaphorically sucker punched for opening up about issues before, but for as long as I remember I've just kept everything negative I thought inside, the few times I told someone how I felt can be counted on one finger and all except for one incident have been with friends online under anonymity. So yeah, vulnerability scares me. I want to yell about all my feelings to someone because I know one day this will all blow up in my face but nothing comes out of my mouth. I don't want to be more of a burden to anyone than I already am, I don't want anyone to deal with my problems because this is my mess that I myself made and no one should have to deal with that. My dad thanks me for growing up healthy and strong, and I always feel guilty about it because I'm not strong at all. It's messed up, but sometimes I wished they didn't care so much about me, because they'll be better of not having had me at all. I don't know if I really mean it, but I think about how many people pray for parents who care, and if I could trade places with any of them I would because they deserve it. On one hand, I want to talk about this to someone, maybe a counsellor or my parents, and I want to know how I can do that. On the other hand, the thought of opening up to someone literally makes me cry. I don't understand myself at all."

I moved to a new country with little to no emotional support as a teenager. My family was on the verge of destroying itself, I had no place to turn to for comfort as everyone I confided in was either gone or living in a bubble of their own misery. During this time I learned how to cope with constant emotional pain. Not in a healthy way, though. My preoccupation with the problems in my life and adjusting to a completely new environment had made me fall back socially. I didnt think I was interesting, good looking, or frankly worth any attention. I became the most introverted, anxious, and avoidant person Ive ever known. With this, I got into bad eating, exercising, and social habits. I didnt care for my well being anymore. When I finally had a self-care epiphany in 2018, it was not born out of a healthy mindset. Looking at all the beautiful, confident people on the streets and in social media made me feel like I deserved nothing and I was nothing until I stepped up to their level. (For context, I have acne, slightly crooked teeth, a stutter, allergies, a morally dysfunctional family, and a deep inferiority complex.) Hence, I got into a really unhealthy habit of beating myself up mentally and physically for hours each day if I messed up. I did not allow myself to talk freely, to eat freely, to think freely, or to let go of anxiety. I completely forgot how to make special bonds with people. At this point, the only thing keeping me alive was the thought that this would all be over soon. And yes, this way of thinking actually reaped results for me. I started becoming fit, eating healthy, being grateful, and practicing self care, which I am still doing now. However, when grief or disappointment strikes (amplified by the lockdown right now), I revert back to my old ways of thinking. I do not allow myself to accept myself as I am, or to think that Im worth anything unless Im as perfect as I want to be. Im addicted to this way of thinking again. I cannot find a way to accept myself. Accepting myself feels like giving up, since I built my entire identity over the past few years on being the perfect human being to hide my pain and to completely stop my vulnerability. Even though Im actively improving myself, Im still hiding under the veil of desiring unattainable perfection. My only, sole goal is being unattainably perfect, and being the ideal person. How do I stop? Where do I go from here? How do I realize that I have inherent worth without feeling like Im taking the easy route in life?"

I have come that working out gets rid of that physical sensation, but for mental processing it goes for 100 to 0 after working out. I have no idea how to process the thoughts there though As for love and affection, I am very lost for these. I am awkward about getting compliments, but I am slowly able to accept them from strangers. I feel awkward with closer people though. It's strange, it feels good and it's a happy feeling is all I know so far and maybe some fear due to upbringing. Basically I have no idea how to cross the fear because its mixed with some happiness in it. With anger, it's easier. Maybe it's because these ones require some vulnerability? I have no idea how to open up to that nor process the thoughts because its quicker reaction to shut off before I process any of it. Do I have to think of why I am afraid of it or??? Asking because this place sounds good for pointers and guides."
11,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Why am I not anxious at work?,2,hwq43w,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hwq43w/why_am_i_not_anxious_at_work/,2020-07-24 08:58:09,"My anxiety has gotten much much worse over the years. Always present at family/social gatherings. As I started hiding more and more of my personal life at home, and more of my home life to my friends it became much worse. The one place I have no social anxiety whatsoever apart from online is working front register at a fast food joint. At home I occasionally have anxiety attacks, maybe once a month. Every day is an excruciating and debilitating one riddled with anxiety due to my complete lack of privacy. I used to think it was because I was constantly hiding something from my family, or that I wasn't comfortable at all expressing any shred of myself or my personality around them( I pause music, freeze up, and avoid eye contact near my entire family when they enter my room), but I also get anxiety near any welcome guests or visitors, even if they're 5 year old children having a play date. I have a thought that it might be due to vulnerability, but i'm not sure. Any thoughts or ideas?"
12,vulnerability,mentalhealth,"How can I become more self aware, and overcome my irrational thoughts? (Long rant)",1,i0qg0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/i0qg0r/how_can_i_become_more_self_aware_and_overcome_my/,2020-07-31 03:40:56,"I am a pathetic 17 year old girl. I have not had any friends since I was 12 or 13 and in the 7th grade. And even when I did have ""friends"" they werent really friends. It was more so just people that I occasionally talked to, or hung out with during breaks. I have severe to moderate social anxiety. Online schooling and social distancing has not improved my anxiety in social situations. I cant fathom school opening, and having to interact with others in person. And I want to make it clear that I am not a misanthrope. I do enjoy people, and the interesting qualities and experiences they hold. I like talking to others, but fear is what hinders me from doing so. My irrational fears have trapped me within a cycle of self isolation. And I know my fears are irrational, but It seems as if there is a roadblock that stops me from overcoming the power of my thoughts. I have no grip on how I want to feel, and even the tiniest intrusive thought can make me plummet into a full blown session of self deprecation. For the past 4 years I have been stuck. Every time that I have tried to befriend someone it usually ends within a short period. We will hang out for a couple of weeks, and then they will become bored of me. I dont know exactly why. I am quiet, so maybe they take this as a sign of being aloof. I cant pinpoint why. And I do like being alone. I can enjoy being alone for longer periods of time than the average person. But, there comes a point in which being alone turns into loneliness. I start to think about cool things that I could be doing if I had friends. I start to think about all the friendships that I am missing out on. I have this irrational fear that when I talk to someone they will think I am an idiot. They will come to the same conclusions as I have; that I am in fact ugly, stupid, weird, and a slew of other negative qualities. And I have this worrying suspicion that maybe all of my irrational thoughts and feelings are true. What if all my life ever equates to is failed attempts at social interactions? What if I never experience deep and meaningful friendships that I carry with me for a lifetime? I havent had a friend since I was 12. Its not that I get bullied. My peers treat me normally, but I dont enjoy being vulnerable. I know that friendship, when basically analyzed is a swapping of information. You share intimate details with someone else, and in that way your platonic relationship feels, and is different than the ones you share with random people or acquaintances. But, I cant seem to commit myself to that. My lack of vulnerability with others leads them to get bored of me, and I completely understand. It is my fault, not theirs. I used to attend therapy a year ago, but stopped. After 3 sessions I quit. Its not because I didnt like my therapist. They were very kind and I actually liked them. But, the truth is I lied. I lied to save myself perceived embarrassment. I lied about how I want to kill myself. I downplayed my morbid thoughts about death. I downplayed my social anxiety, and how much it does interfere with my relationships, and day to day life. Therapy became a game of, ""lets show the therapist I am ""normal"" and dont need therapy."" I have never had those hallmark teenage rites of passage. And I know it is stupid to get caught up in these, but I want it so badly. I want to feel normal. I would rather peak in Highschool knowing that I collected all the teenage rites of passage. If I have peaked(which I believe is true) I am absolutely pathetic. I dont know how to help myself at this point. This feeling of destiny is overwhelming. I feel doomed(which I know is so pessimistic), but I cant seem to help it. I know, that from a objective perspective these thoughts are irrational, but I still let it control me. I have so many intrusive thoughts. I am tired of getting the same worn out responses telling me that it will get better. On top of this.... I have an a aversion to being touched. It makes me uncomfortable to sit closely next to someone, or to have to touch someone. When I am sitting close to someone I begin to sweat, and my nervousness increases. I become hyper aware of every movement I make, and have to slowly inch my self away from the person. Then, once I am finally a comfortable distance away from them the anxiety and internal panic drift away. I even feel uncomfortable doing so with my close family. I hate being hugged by them. I cant fathom having sex, because you are literally pressed up against another person. I cant fathom kissing, because again there is no room for space. I became very aware of my discomfort to touch and general closeness at around the age of 12. Before that it didnt bother me too much, but now it has become a source of anxiety. If someone sits next to me at a table, especially a stranger I have to slowly inch away to create space so they dont notice. I dont want them to think that I have a personal issues with them. Standing close to people also makes me uncomfortable. I am so worn out by the everyday tasks of life. The normal things seem so daunting to me, and exhaust me. What truly scares me and keeps me up at night, is that my life hasnt even really started. I am just at the precipice. How can I except to flourish in adulthood when I am already so tired, and on the verge of giving up? I dont want to do this anymore, and I trying so hard not to give up. I am trying not to hate myself, but I just cant commit. Everything is out of reach."

I woke up this morning unable to motivate myself to get up. I laid in bed for hours until I finally got up and just lost it. Now I'm replaying everything my dad ever did to me in my head, thinking about all the things I wish I could say to him, imagining me using violence against him and forcing him out of my life forever. During this process I got so wound up I took a wrench and smashed at my bedroom trash can a few times. This isn't the first time this has happened. When someone close to me died I freaked out and broke a mirror. I've smashed multiple bongs out of frustration that I continue to come back to substances instead of dealing with my trauma. Really it's like a regular occurrence that every few months or so, I just reach a breaking point. I'll suddenly just slip down a rabbit hole of all the shit I endured as a kid, and now looking back I see what was clearly abusive. The issues that set me off aren't always related to my dad or my abuse, but they inevitably lead back to it. In those moments of vulnerability it's like I can see how my experiences have shaped me. I feel like my damaged relationship with my dad left me with very low self esteem growing up, I also hesitated from pursuing my own interests for many years. I was definitely a late bloomer, not wanting to form my own identity out of fear of being ridiculed. I really just don't know what to do. I'm not a violent or angry person otherwise. But when it comes to my dad, I just lose it. being near him or even just texting him affects my state of mind dramatically. I do a good job of keeping a level head but as I said, eventually I have an outburst. I'm not equipped to deal with this on my own. I have an okay support network but I don't think any of them know the full extent of how this is effecting me. I'm thinking about seeing a therapist, I'm just anxious and don't know where to start. It was hard enough to organize my thoughts into a reddit post, I'm not sure what I'd say or what I even need to overcome this. Any thoughts?"

Did anyone have a memorable experience? Good? Terrible? Many people who I've talked to about challenge day oddly enough either don't remember much it, or, what they do remember was invasive. My own was rather unique. I, a male, ended up opening up in a share group surrounded by girls, with my old kindergarten teacher as the adult voice. I was one of those at the cross the line section who seemed to be on the wrong side of the line, everytime. Suicide, no childhood, done drugs, involuntary sexual acts. This same teacher, once i opened up my feelings about my childhood molestation and my part in furthering and eventual attempting to stop the cycle, got me alone and used police interrogation tactics, my irrational fear of jail, my suicidal proclivity &amp; shame to manipulate a confession out of who i felt i had harmed the way i had been. She then conducted a witch hunt, starting with that boy, using me to tell him it was ok to talk to her, finding out whom he had fooled around with, and so on with others. She wss making a list of names. It wasn't until she stated asking me about younger family members that i learned she was targeting these other kids for having simply having learned how to masturbate and laying that at my feet as a scapegoat to shame them as well. I know finally broke free of her mind games at that and i got other adults involved. Decpite having cornered, graded, threatened public humiliation and exposing and exploiting the vulnerability of myself and other children - to this day i don't think anything came from her manhunt except that she was asked to leave. I don't remember much after that expecpt worrying about my fate once she told my extremely homophobic family. To be honest, i had repressed this memory for a long time. I remember talking to the other adults after she was asked to leave. I couldn't understand how someone as skilled s manipulation, with such a specific agenda geared against my worst fears, could have possibly been there unless the event staff intended for her to be there. As far as i know, she went back to teaching the next day and may have since."

Both my dad and my sister are Bipolar (dad undiagnosed, sister diagnosed) and Im pretty sure I dont have that, but Ive started to realize I might struggle with anxiety and depression. Not in the way that most people would think because Im very social, and seem to keep it together. I will have weeks where Im feeling very confident, but then months where Im not. I have a very poor inner dialogue with myself. I quit playing sports (I played my whole life until this past year) and I think that did diminish my self esteem because that is what I felt I was best at. I have struggled with addiction issues since I was 15, but rarely do drugs anymore. (Aside from weed and alcohol). I feel like I do have that part of my life under control now, but I am dependent on both of those things to some extent. Sometimes I wish I could avoid social situations all together to not feel anxious all the time. Also, I dont know if I should label myself as depressed because its not like I physically cannot leave bed at times, and in general, I can talk myself off a ledge when I am feeling down. I make a lot of reckless decisions, and then feel guilty about them and wish I could do better. I kind of live my life in opposite extremes at times. There is a lot more to it, but this post is already quite lengthy. Mainly, I am just looking to see if i can handle this on my own, or if professional help is necessary.

16,vulnerability,mentalhealth,My Story - TW,1,gwvm0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gwvm0j/my_story_tw/,2020-06-05 12:10:24,"I have never actually posted anything on reddit and I am pretty anxious about doing so. I originally wrote this with the intention of solely writing about me and my brothers relationship, but somehow it turned into this really long story about my life. So, if anyone takes the time to read this thank you for listening. There might be some triggering topics in this post so be wary of that if topics of rape/self harm/suicide/drug addiction are triggering to you. My brother and I have never had a good relationship. Growing up in a dysfunctional family and with a father that struggled with drug addiction throughout our childhood, one would think that would draw us closer together and allow us to lean on each other for support having dealt with the same traumas. However that is not even close to how the dynamic of our relationship works. My brother growing up kept to himself. He didnt want to talk about anything going on and understandably so. I know people handle traumas in different ways. But as the younger sister I always looked up to my brother for support, but I never got that. He didnt want anything to do with me. When I would turn to him for comfort he would get so angry, scream at me to leave him alone. I remember years later after we both were in college and our dad had been sober for several years I confessed to him how much our dads addiction had affected me and continues to affect me to this day. I cried to him and he was completely stoic and only said stop acting so privileged. Many people have it much worse. Growing up in a household that turned a blind eye to the addiction and abuse we all endured and especially with a brother who claims it has had no effect on him at all made me feel extremely alone. I had no one to turn to. When I got older, in my early teenage years, I hit a very rough patch. My dad had again relapsed and left our family for weeks draining the bank accounts to use for drugs. One day my mom and I drove around our town trying to find him and when we finally did he was in his car with this extremely pale, gaunt woman. It was clear years of drug abuse had taken a toll on her body. My mom followed his car and got out at a stop light to try to talk to him. When she grabbed the door handle, my dad drove off causing my mom to fall hard on the concrete. She quickly got back in the car and continued to follow him and he led us to a crack house on the sketchy side of town. At that point I was hysterically crying. I felt so betrayed and honestly in shock of how my dad was treating his own family. I felt unwanted by my own dad. I begged him to come home and he lied straight to my face saying hed come back that night. He didnt come home for weeks. When he finally did it was because he owed some drug dealer money and they had shot at him while he was driving. After this whole ordeal my dad went to a baker-act facility and then stayed at a halfway house for about a month. My mom claimed throughout this time that she would finally divorce my dad so wed never have to go through this again. But to my surprise he moved back in not even a month later. It seemed like my mom did a complete 180 and now that my dad was home we were expected to treat him like nothing had happened. My dad constantly would demand respect from me. I was so angry at this time. I hated living there and I hated having to see my dad every day. I felt betrayed by my dad, by my mom, and by my brother who completely shut me out. During this time is when I really started to act out. I was 14 years old when I met a group of not so good friends. I started smoking weed, drinking, smoking cigarettes, and becoming sexually active. I would stay out way past curfew and honestly just defied my parents in every sort of way. At the time I didnt realize why I was acting that way. I dont think you ever really do when youre going through it. Only in retrospect do I realize how much my fathers addiction had affected me. I would cut myself every night and I still have scars to this day from years of self mutilation. I hated myself very much and still struggle with self hate even now. On the night I tried vodka for the first time ever, I got black out drunk. At the time I thought I was with reliable friends. But later that night, I came to completely naked on the beach with random people trying to dress me. They took me home and the next day when I checked my Instagram, pictures of me naked on the beach were all over my timeline. A hate account was made about me that posted the picture with a caption that said how much of a disgusting slut I was. A bunch of kids from my high school commented on it agreeing, calling me a whore and a slut. Come to find out later that the guy friend I was with that night took advantage of my state, raped me on the beach, and left me there for random people to find me. And the people who took the photo and posted it were my friends that just so happened to come across me on the beach that night. After this I fell into the darkest depression I had ever experienced before. I cut myself twice as much and would walk home directly after being dropped off at school. I knew everyone was talking about what happened and could hear the whispers of slut being passed around as I walked by. Even this wasnt the end all for me. The reason I tried to take my life that night was ultimately because of what my dad said to me. I returned home that night after a full day of skipping school and hiding out at the community recreation center. My parents had gotten another call from my school that I had skipped yet again and they were understandably very angry. I understand why they were so mad but they knew what had happened and they werent sympathetic at all. They didnt understand that I couldnt show my face at that school. I felt so ashamed and hated by everyone. And most of all I hated myself. The argument escalated and my dad told me you will never amount to anything but a hooker and that was it. I was defeated and I knew I couldnt do it any longer. I didnt know how to kill myself but I tried taking all the pills I could find in my house. I took two whole bottles of melatonin, a bottle of ibuprofen, and I tried to drink bleach but couldnt make myself drink more than a sip. I laid down in my bed so tired, so exhausted and fell asleep. I woke up abruptly in the middle of the night in complete agony. The amount of pain I was in was incomprehensible. I was vomiting violently everywhere. I just couldnt keep in it. I felt like I was dying. My parents rushed me to the hospital where I was stabilized. From there a cop hand cuffed me, put me in the back of the patrol car, and transferred me to the same baker act facility my dad had been to so many times before. I stayed there a full week and was diagnosed with a copious amount of mental disorders and put on medicine. When I came back home nothing had changed. My brother still didnt want anything to do with me. My dad was still expecting the utmost respect and discipline from me and my mom still followed my dads orders like a puppy dog. And I was still just as broken as ever before. I was expected to change though and when I didnt well... all hell broke loose. Unfortunately, my suicide attempt open my parents to the door of mental health rehabilitation. They put me in and out of psych wards for the next several months, each time a new mental disorder was assigned to me. The third time I was put in they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on probably the worse medicine I have ever been on: abilify. The doctor gave me way too high of a dose to start off on. Keep in mind I am a 90 pound 15 year old at this time being given a high dosage of an anti-psychotic drug. A day after starting the drug I got extremely ill. I had a splitting migraine that lasted for days and was throwing up every half hour or so. They gave me Benadryl to try to calm me down I guess which only made me extremely high as I physically could not fall asleep because of the pain I was in. I remember calling out for my mom in a daze as I sat high as a kite in the common room while everyone else slept. After being discharged from the facility and being on abilify for at least a month, it had completely deteriorated me as a person. I was a shell of my past self and felt like a zombie. I had a hard time concentrating on anything and couldnt keep up a conversation. When I went to visit my guidance counselor (who was the worst guidance counselor in existence and told me I had screws loose in my head, but thats a story for another time) at school she asked me if I was on drugs because apparently I had a dead pan stare. I was on the verge of exploding. Every day was a struggle for me and the only time I felt anything at all is when I was drunk with my friends. One specific day I went to the beach with friends and got very drunk. We were hanging out with a man who Id never met before. He was in his 20s and provided the alcohol. At one point during the day he brought up the idea to get some cocaine. I was extremely drunk and thought this was a good idea. We got the coke and started doing bump after bump. Me and my girl friend then decided we wanted to run away and start a new life in Miami. The older guy agreed to drive us down there. We drove for hours down to Miami drunk and high off our asses and he dropped us off on a corner. My friend said she had a friend down there that could give us a place to stay but when she tried to call him on a pay phone he wouldnt answer. So two 15 year old girls were stuck in downtown Miami with only bathing suits and cover ups on. We walked miles to Miami Beach and sat outside a restaurant where we met two Argentinian men that sat down with us and talked. Another man joined us and the Argentinian men offered for us to go back to their place to drink and hang out. We said yes. The man who had joined later said he would give all of us a lift there. Right as we were getting dropped off the two Argentinian men were talking in Spanish and the man who drove told them to get the fuck out of the car and that we werent going with them. Apparently the two men were planning on getting us really drunk and having sex with us not knowing the other man knew Spanish. For the sake of not making this any more confusing than it already is Im going to call the man who drove, Tony. Tony took us to his place and let us stay there that night. He probably saved us from being raped or worse that night but unfortunately he wasnt a saint either. He tried to sleep in the same bed as us and with each passing second I felt more and more uncomfortable. The drunk and high was long worn off by this point and I was regretting every decision we made. I wanted to go home but I didnt know how. The next day Tony dropped us off back at Miami Beach. We asked him if he could spare some cash for us and he said he would for a kiss. We decided against that and were left at the beach with no money and no idea what we were going to do next. We spent the day at the beach trying not to think about nightfall but as it was growing closer I knew we couldnt stay here. We went into the lobby of a hotel and I connected to the WiFi on a iPod I had brought with me. I called my mom on some app I had downloaded and to my surprise she was already on her way down to Miami to try to find me. She had called the cops and talked to my friends and figured out where we had gone. My mom picked us up drove us hours back home and immediately to the psych ward where I stayed for a week and from there was sent to a long term behavioral rehabilitation facility. To be very clear, I am not condoning anything that I did. I know how wrong it was. I know I fucked up real bad and there are no excuses. The thing is now looking back I can understand how it had gotten to that point. I wish I could change a lot of things I did in the past. I wish I never got involved with that group of friends. I wish I never got drunk that fateful night on the beach. I wish I never tried to kill myself. I wish I didnt try to run away so many times. I wish I never did coke and go to Miami. But I was in an environment that left me completely vulnerable to the actions of people around me. As a child I could never escape the cycle of addiction and abuse from my father. I was trapped in a crumbling household that acted like it wasnt crumbling! That we were perfectly fine. I was the malfunctioning piece to my family and I think instead of finding the root of the problem and fixing it my parents tried to fix the thing that from the outside looking in was broken. But if you looked just past that outside layer, all our wires were frayed. Our family was broken. Our whole family was malfunctioning. I was just the scape goat. And so I spent 2 months in this rehab facility. From the outside, mental health facilities look like a perfect place to send misbehaving children. The website says they have pet therapy! And arts and crafts! The first day in I knew this new environment was going to be hell. We had very strict rules. Single file lines, waking up at 7am and to bed by 8pm. Immediately after waking up we had to sit in the common room completely silent while they handed out medication. This took literal hours for everyone to get their drugs and if you talked or got up when you werent supposed to you would get something called hours. Hours were a punishment given where you had to sit in a chair for a MINIMUM of 4 hours. You couldnt speak, you couldnt sleep. You literally had to sit there for hours doing nothing and many of the times they made you face the chair towards the wall. If you fell asleep the hours wouldnt count and youd have to redo them. Hours were a minimum of 4 and depending on the severity of your crime it would go up by 4. So you could get 4 hours, 8, 12, and so on. If you spoke or got up during the time they gave you medication you would get 4 hours. I met with my psychiatrist once a week for a few minutes. I didnt even know his name. My therapist there was the worst therapist Ive ever had. He was unsympathetic and didnt listen to me. He would drag on and on and hardly let me speak. He told me I needed to accept the blame for causing my family so much pain. I already felt so ashamed. I cried nearly every day. The kids in there were very abrasive. If you were violent youd be transferred to basically the bad girls ward where you were placed with other violent girls. I remember one time this girl was mad because this other girl was talking bad about her. The day before the other girl was going to be discharged she took all her belongings out of her dresser (she was her roommate so she was allowed in their room) and pissed all over her stuff. Yes, she urinated on her belongings. When the other girl found out she flipped shit and they got in a physical fight and the whole unit was on lock down meaning we werent allowed to leave the common room and go to the gym or cafeteria for days afterward. The girl was transferred to the violent girls ward. This kind of thing happened a lot while I was there. Somehow kids snuck in drugs. People would get away with having sex under the technicians noses. There was a place called the quiet room where if you were acting up they would lock you in there. It was all white with padded walls. I remember kids getting put in there and hearing their screams go on for hours. This wasnt a healthy place to be is what Im trying to get across. Also there was no pet therapy like the website said. I felt so hopeless. So alone. I was on the most medication than I ever had been on before. When I finally got out I cannot tell you how depressed I was. I didnt know how to function anymore. I didnt have any friends as I completely stopped talking to all my friends from before. I stopped going to school so all I really did was stay home every day doing absolutely nothing. I didnt go out in public and I didnt talk to anyone. Finally a few months later I went back to school. At this point I was a sophomore in high school and I was doing really really poorly. I met a group of friends that again werent the best influence but I didnt run away anymore due to fear of being put back in the facility again. I met an older guy through this group of friends. He was 19, drove a car, didnt have a job but that didnt matter to me. I thought he was so cool and he liked me which made me feel even more special. We started dating and my parents did not approve of it at all. But what can you do as a parent? They tried getting the cops involved but they couldnt do anything because of some vague law that allows for that sort of thing. I didnt realize it then but this man was taking advantage of my vulnerability and age once again. It was a very toxic relationship and extremely emotionally abusive. He strung me along as he cheated on me multiple times. Hed ignore me and manipulate the situation so I would be begging him to forgive me. I felt like I was falling apart but I couldnt let go of him. I looked to him for validation and if he didnt give me it then I was nothing. I tried to get out after he cheated once again. But he would text me everyday and tell me how sorry he was how much he loved me and needed me. So I took him back. He ended up getting involved with a girl a year younger than me. He helped her move across country while we were dating and I learned later on that he took her virginity on this trip. I was devastated. It felt like my whole world was falling apart. And so I finally cut him off completely after 6 months of manipulation and abuse. It was so painful at the time. I remember crying every night for weeks. The thing is when youre in an abusive relationship you feel like you cant ever get out. You feel like you need them but after a few months I realized just how horrible my life was with him in it. And now looking back I am disgusted with myself for ever getting involved with him. He preyed on my age. He took advantage of me being so much younger than him and so influential at the time. Its just another thing on my list of things I regret. Junior year was a good year for me. I got out of that relationship and really started focusing on myself. I had been on and off medication during this whole time and I was completely off at the start of junior year. I felt clearer than I ever had before. Not to say medication is a bad thing I know it has helped many people but I was put on so many drugs and they had so many horrible side effects. Abilify made me a zombie and made me gain at least 20 pounds within a few months. I took another that gave me nose bleeds daily and made my vision blurry. Overall my medicine experience has not been a good one and Ive never seen a positive effect from being on them. So when I went into my junior year I focused solely on school. I went to all my classes and did really well. I got straight As that year and my GPA went up a pretty good amount because of it. I took my SAT and got a decent score and I started thinking about college. I really just made a complete 180 during this time and Im so glad I did. The problem is my depression and anxiety never truly went away. Im not really sure whats wrong with me. They told me I was bipolar then later said I had borderline personality disorder. I know you cant fully diagnose someone with those things during this age so it wasnt a for sure thing. I dont know if I really need a label I guess. I fall into deep depressive episodes a lot and I struggle with anxiety and especially social anxiety every day of my life. I dont have any self confidence and I question everything I do. I struggle to make friends and I dont trust people easily. I know I have a problem with basing my self worth on what other people think of me and especially men. I get involved with someone and I get so excited and think Ill finally find someone thats going to treat me right and they end up being an asshole or completely ghosting me. I stopped cutting myself junior year too but it is still something I still struggle with to this day. When you spent so many years relying on that to help cope its hard to not fall back into that self destructive behavior. And even now I sometimes wish I could just go off the deep end like I did when I was younger. A lot of times I feel like Im just standing on the edge peering down at the abyss. I wanna just jump off head first. But now I wouldnt even know how to. My feet wont move. So Im stuck in this in between place of not totally off the edge but so close I feel its presence weighing me down all the time. I really couldnt tell you a time I felt totally free. Maybe when I was younger and didnt understand anything. When I didnt know how awful humans could be to one another. I remember when I was really young at least 5 years old. I was sleeping in my moms bed. My dad had come home probably from a long night of drinking and drugs and I wanted to go out to the kitchen to get a snack. I snuck out of my moms room and out into the hallway. Everything was dark except the luminescent light of the bathroom breaking the darkness. I walked down the hallway and slipped in front of the bathroom doorway. My dad was standing there doing something over the sink. There was a knife and thick blood dripping from his arm. Only later did I realize I had witnessed my dad cutting himself. My memory gets fuzzy sometimes of that event and I see blood covering the walls like a sick horror movie in my dreams. I know its not real but when I think of it it makes me shudder. I am now 20 years old. I have spent 2 years in college jumping around to different majors not really knowing what I want to do. Im transferring to a new university this fall hoping that will make my college experience better but to be quite honest with you I dont feel like I belong anywhere. I feel disconnected from the rest of society. Like everyone else is in on the joke and I just never got it. Back to the point before I got way too deep about my life, my brother and I just dont have a good relationship. I have always wanted to be his friend and I feel like he just shuts me out or doesnt even like me. Whenever we get into an argument he always has to bring up the fact that I was on medication. He says that Im fucking crazy and that I need to go back on meds. It makes me feel like no matter what I do I will never escape my past. I will always just be that crazy teenage girl. He told me once that I embarrassed him in high school. My brother is only one grade above me so he was aware of everything when it happened. When I hear him say that it makes me feel even more ashamed of myself. Like all I am is just an embarrassment to him. He never tries to talk to me about anything from our past or anything I went through. Hes a very angry person and isnt very self aware. I know our childhood trauma has affected him in ways that he will never realize. He was in a relationship with a girl for almost 2 years in which he was verbally and emotionally abusive to her. He decided to break it off but later regretted that decision and begged for her back. When she said no he took to social media to bash her and victimize himself. His explosive anger and total lack of self awareness in certain situations just goes to show the impact our childhood has had on him. I love my brother and I always have. I think thats my weakness too. I care too much about what he thinks of me and the things he says to me. Hes very condescending and loves to tell me that Im a disappointment. He says I know you can act smarter than you do and its disappointing that you act that way anyways over pretty simple mistakes I make. Its like he expects the people around him to be perfect and when they arent he sees them as inferior. I want to have a good relationship with my brother but I have tried for years and to no avail. I think we will never see eye to eye and that to me is so upsetting because there is no one else in the world that has experienced exactly what I have except him. Through out our childhood we both experienced our father leaving and returning, going on drug binge after drug binge, the explosive fights between our parents, the house going into foreclosure. We experienced it all together and yet completely separate. And now were here years later and we couldnt be anymore distant. Its sad and I dont think I will ever find a single person who truly understands me. Sorry for the very long post. Honestly I could write a book with all my experiences. I just want to be very clear about one thing I am not looking for sympathy or pity. I think sometimes its good to get all of this out and I contemplated a lot on whether or not to even post this. If anyone has gone through similar experiences feel free to reach out. This world can be so hard sometimes and so lonely. I hope we can all find our way and maybe there is a reason for all this suffering. If you have made it this far, again thank you for listening and I hope you have a great night/day. I know everyone on this subreddit is struggling with their own unique adversities and I truly hope everything works out in the best way it can for all of us"
17,vulnerability,mentalhealth,My Story - TW,1,gwvobh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gwvobh/my_story_tw/,2020-06-05 12:14:29,"I have never actually posted anything on reddit and I am pretty anxious about doing so. I originally wrote this with the intention of solely writing about me and my brothers relationship, but somehow it turned into this really long story about my life. So, if anyone takes the time to read this thank you for listening. There might be some triggering topics in this post so be wary of that if topics of rape/self harm/suicide/drug addiction are triggering to you. My brother and I have never had a good relationship. Growing up in a dysfunctional family and with a father that struggled with drug addiction throughout our childhood, one would think that would draw us closer together and allow us to lean on each other for support having dealt with the same traumas. However that is not even close to how the dynamic of our relationship works. My brother growing up kept to himself. He didnt want to talk about anything going on and understandably so. I know people handle traumas in different ways. But as the younger sister I always looked up to my brother for support, but I never got that. He didnt want anything to do with me. When I would turn to him for comfort he would get so angry, scream at me to leave him alone. I remember years later after we both were in college and our dad had been sober for several years I confessed to him how much our dads addiction had affected me and continues to affect me to this day. I cried to him and he was completely stoic and only said stop acting so privileged. Many people have it much worse. Growing up in a household that turned a blind eye to the addiction and abuse we all endured and especially with a brother who claims it has had no effect on him at all made me feel extremely alone. I had no one to turn to. When I got older, in my early teenage years, I hit a very rough patch. My dad had again relapsed and left our family for weeks draining the bank accounts to use for drugs. One day my mom and I drove around our town trying to find him and when we finally did he was in his car with this extremely pale, gaunt woman. It was clear years of drug abuse had taken a toll on her body. My mom followed his car and got out at a stop light to try to talk to him. When she grabbed the door handle, my dad drove off causing my mom to fall hard on the concrete. She quickly got back in the car and continued to follow him and he led us to a crack house on the sketchy side of town. At that point I was hysterically crying. I felt so betrayed and honestly in shock of how my dad was treating his own family. I felt unwanted by my own dad. I begged him to come home and he lied straight to my face saying hed come back that night. He didnt come home for weeks. When he finally did it was because he owed some drug dealer money and they had shot at him while he was driving. After this whole ordeal my dad went to a baker-act facility and then stayed at a halfway house for about a month. My mom claimed throughout this time that she would finally divorce my dad so wed never have to go through this again. But to my surprise he moved back in not even a month later. It seemed like my mom did a complete 180 and now that my dad was home we were expected to treat him like nothing had happened. My dad constantly would demand respect from me. I was so angry at this time. I hated living there and I hated having to see my dad every day. I felt betrayed by my dad, by my mom, and by my brother who completely shut me out. During this time is when I really started to act out. I was 14 years old when I met a group of not so good friends. I started smoking weed, drinking, smoking cigarettes, and becoming sexually active. I would stay out way past curfew and honestly just defied my parents in every sort of way. At the time I didnt realize why I was acting that way. I dont think you ever really do when youre going through it. Only in retrospect do I realize how much my fathers addiction had affected me. I would cut myself every night and I still have scars to this day from years of self mutilation. I hated myself very much and still struggle with self hate even now. On the night I tried vodka for the first time ever, I got black out drunk. At the time I thought I was with reliable friends. But later that night, I came to completely naked on the beach with random people trying to dress me. They took me home and the next day when I checked my Instagram, pictures of me naked on the beach were all over my timeline. A hate account was made about me that posted the picture with a caption that said how much of a disgusting slut I was. A bunch of kids from my high school commented on it agreeing, calling me a whore and a slut. Come to find out later that the guy friend I was with that night took advantage of my state, raped me on the beach, and left me there for random people to find me. And the people who took the photo and posted it were my friends that just so happened to come across me on the beach that night. After this I fell into the darkest depression I had ever experienced before. I cut myself twice as much and would walk home directly after being dropped off at school. I knew everyone was talking about what happened and could hear the whispers of slut being passed around as I walked by. Even this wasnt the end all for me. The reason I tried to take my life that night was ultimately because of what my dad said to me. I returned home that night after a full day of skipping school and hiding out at the community recreation center. My parents had gotten another call from my school that I had skipped yet again and they were understandably very angry. I understand why they were so mad but they knew what had happened and they werent sympathetic at all. They didnt understand that I couldnt show my face at that school. I felt so ashamed and hated by everyone. And most of all I hated myself. The argument escalated and my dad told me you will never amount to anything but a hooker and that was it. I was defeated and I knew I couldnt do it any longer. I didnt know how to kill myself but I tried taking all the pills I could find in my house. I took two whole bottles of melatonin, a bottle of ibuprofen, and I tried to drink bleach but couldnt make myself drink more than a sip. I laid down in my bed so tired, so exhausted and fell asleep. I woke up abruptly in the middle of the night in complete agony. The amount of pain I was in was incomprehensible. I was vomiting violently everywhere. I just couldnt keep in it. I felt like I was dying. My parents rushed me to the hospital where I was stabilized. From there a cop hand cuffed me, put me in the back of the patrol car, and transferred me to the same baker act facility my dad had been to so many times before. I stayed there a full week and was diagnosed with a copious amount of mental disorders and put on medicine. When I came back home nothing had changed. My brother still didnt want anything to do with me. My dad was still expecting the utmost respect and discipline from me and my mom still followed my dads orders like a puppy dog. And I was still just as broken as ever before. I was expected to change though and when I didnt well... all hell broke loose. Unfortunately, my suicide attempt open my parents to the door of mental health rehabilitation. They put me in and out of psych wards for the next several months, each time a new mental disorder was assigned to me. The third time I was put in they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on probably the worse medicine I have ever been on: abilify. The doctor gave me way too high of a dose to start off on. Keep in mind I am a 90 pound 15 year old at this time being given a high dosage of an anti-psychotic drug. A day after starting the drug I got extremely ill. I had a splitting migraine that lasted for days and was throwing up every half hour or so. They gave me Benadryl to try to calm me down I guess which only made me extremely high as I physically could not fall asleep because of the pain I was in. I remember calling out for my mom in a daze as I sat high as a kite in the common room while everyone else slept. After being discharged from the facility and being on abilify for at least a month, it had completely deteriorated me as a person. I was a shell of my past self and felt like a zombie. I had a hard time concentrating on anything and couldnt keep up a conversation. When I went to visit my guidance counselor (who was the worst guidance counselor in existence and told me I had screws loose in my head, but thats a story for another time) at school she asked me if I was on drugs because apparently I had a dead pan stare. I was on the verge of exploding. Every day was a struggle for me and the only time I felt anything at all is when I was drunk with my friends. One specific day I went to the beach with friends and got very drunk. We were hanging out with a man who Id never met before. He was in his 20s and provided the alcohol. At one point during the day he brought up the idea to get some cocaine. I was extremely drunk and thought this was a good idea. We got the coke and started doing bump after bump. Me and my girl friend then decided we wanted to run away and start a new life in Miami. The older guy agreed to drive us down there. We drove for hours down to Miami drunk and high off our asses and he dropped us off on a corner. My friend said she had a friend down there that could give us a place to stay but when she tried to call him on a pay phone he wouldnt answer. So two 15 year old girls were stuck in downtown Miami with only bathing suits and cover ups on. We walked miles to Miami Beach and sat outside a restaurant where we met two Argentinian men that sat down with us and talked. Another man joined us and the Argentinian men offered for us to go back to their place to drink and hang out. We said yes. The man who had joined later said he would give all of us a lift there. Right as we were getting dropped off the two Argentinian men were talking in Spanish and the man who drove told them to get the fuck out of the car and that we werent going with them. Apparently the two men were planning on getting us really drunk and having sex with us not knowing the other man knew Spanish. For the sake of not making this any more confusing than it already is Im going to call the man who drove, Tony. Tony took us to his place and let us stay there that night. He probably saved us from being raped or worse that night but unfortunately he wasnt a saint either. He tried to sleep in the same bed as us and with each passing second I felt more and more uncomfortable. The drunk and high was long worn off by this point and I was regretting every decision we made. I wanted to go home but I didnt know how. The next day Tony dropped us off back at Miami Beach. We asked him if he could spare some cash for us and he said he would for a kiss. We decided against that and were left at the beach with no money and no idea what we were going to do next. We spent the day at the beach trying not to think about nightfall but as it was growing closer I knew we couldnt stay here. We went into the lobby of a hotel and I connected to the WiFi on a iPod I had brought with me. I called my mom on some app I had downloaded and to my surprise she was already on her way down to Miami to try to find me. She had called the cops and talked to my friends and figured out where we had gone. My mom picked us up drove us hours back home and immediately to the psych ward where I stayed for a week and from there was sent to a long term behavioral rehabilitation facility. To be very clear, I am not condoning anything that I did. I know how wrong it was. I know I fucked up real bad and there are no excuses. The thing is now looking back I can understand how it had gotten to that point. I wish I could change a lot of things I did in the past. I wish I never got involved with that group of friends. I wish I never got drunk that fateful night on the beach. I wish I never tried to kill myself. I wish I didnt try to run away so many times. I wish I never did coke and go to Miami. But I was in an environment that left me completely vulnerable to the actions of people around me. As a child I could never escape the cycle of addiction and abuse from my father. I was trapped in a crumbling household that acted like it wasnt crumbling! That we were perfectly fine. I was the malfunctioning piece to my family and I think instead of finding the root of the problem and fixing it my parents tried to fix the thing that from the outside looking in was broken. But if you looked just past that outside layer, all our wires were frayed. Our family was broken. Our whole family was malfunctioning. I was just the scape goat. And so I spent 2 months in this rehab facility. From the outside, mental health facilities look like a perfect place to send misbehaving children. The website says they have pet therapy! And arts and crafts! The first day in I knew this new environment was going to be hell. We had very strict rules. Single file lines, waking up at 7am and to bed by 8pm. Immediately after waking up we had to sit in the common room completely silent while they handed out medication. This took literal hours for everyone to get their drugs and if you talked or got up when you werent supposed to you would get something called hours. Hours were a punishment given where you had to sit in a chair for a MINIMUM of 4 hours. You couldnt speak, you couldnt sleep. You literally had to sit there for hours doing nothing and many of the times they made you face the chair towards the wall. If you fell asleep the hours wouldnt count and youd have to redo them. Hours were a minimum of 4 and depending on the severity of your crime it would go up by 4. So you could get 4 hours, 8, 12, and so on. If you spoke or got up during the time they gave you medication you would get 4 hours. I met with my psychiatrist once a week for a few minutes. I didnt even know his name. My therapist there was the worst therapist Ive ever had. He was unsympathetic and didnt listen to me. He would drag on and on and hardly let me speak. He told me I needed to accept the blame for causing my family so much pain. I already felt so ashamed. I cried nearly every day. The kids in there were very abrasive. If you were violent youd be transferred to basically the bad girls ward where you were placed with other violent girls. I remember one time this girl was mad because this other girl was talking bad about her. The day before the other girl was going to be discharged she took all her belongings out of her dresser (she was her roommate so she was allowed in their room) and pissed all over her stuff. Yes, she urinated on her belongings. When the other girl found out she flipped shit and they got in a physical fight and the whole unit was on lock down meaning we werent allowed to leave the common room and go to the gym or cafeteria for days afterward. The girl was transferred to the violent girls ward. This kind of thing happened a lot while I was there. Somehow kids snuck in drugs. People would get away with having sex under the technicians noses. There was a place called the quiet room where if you were acting up they would lock you in there. It was all white with padded walls. I remember kids getting put in there and hearing their screams go on for hours. This wasnt a healthy place to be is what Im trying to get across. Also there was no pet therapy like the website said. I felt so hopeless. So alone. I was on the most medication than I ever had been on before. When I finally got out I cannot tell you how depressed I was. I didnt know how to function anymore. I didnt have any friends as I completely stopped talking to all my friends from before. I stopped going to school so all I really did was stay home every day doing absolutely nothing. I didnt go out in public and I didnt talk to anyone. Finally a few months later I went back to school. At this point I was a sophomore in high school and I was doing really really poorly. I met a group of friends that again werent the best influence but I didnt run away anymore due to fear of being put back in the facility again. I met an older guy through this group of friends. He was 19, drove a car, didnt have a job but that didnt matter to me. I thought he was so cool and he liked me which made me feel even more special. We started dating and my parents did not approve of it at all. But what can you do as a parent? They tried getting the cops involved but they couldnt do anything because of some vague law that allows for that sort of thing. I didnt realize it then but this man was taking advantage of my vulnerability and age once again. It was a very toxic relationship and extremely emotionally abusive. He strung me along as he cheated on me multiple times. Hed ignore me and manipulate the situation so I would be begging him to forgive me. I felt like I was falling apart but I couldnt let go of him. I looked to him for validation and if he didnt give me it then I was nothing. I tried to get out after he cheated once again. But he would text me everyday and tell me how sorry he was how much he loved me and needed me. So I took him back. He ended up getting involved with a girl a year younger than me. He helped her move across country while we were dating and I learned later on that he took her virginity on this trip. I was devastated. It felt like my whole world was falling apart. And so I finally cut him off completely after 6 months of manipulation and abuse. It was so painful at the time. I remember crying every night for weeks. The thing is when youre in an abusive relationship you feel like you cant ever get out. You feel like you need them but after a few months I realized just how horrible my life was with him in it. And now looking back I am disgusted with myself for ever getting involved with him. He preyed on my age. He took advantage of me being so much younger than him and so influential at the time. Its just another thing on my list of things I regret. Junior year was a good year for me. I got out of that relationship and really started focusing on myself. I had been on and off medication during this whole time and I was completely off at the start of junior year. I felt clearer than I ever had before. Not to say medication is a bad thing I know it has helped many people but I was put on so many drugs and they had so many horrible side effects. Abilify made me a zombie and made me gain at least 20 pounds within a few months. I took another that gave me nose bleeds daily and made my vision blurry. Overall my medicine experience has not been a good one and Ive never seen a positive effect from being on them. So when I went into my junior year I focused solely on school. I went to all my classes and did really well. I got straight As that year and my GPA went up a pretty good amount because of it. I took my SAT and got a decent score and I started thinking about college. I really just made a complete 180 during this time and Im so glad I did. The problem is my depression and anxiety never truly went away. Im not really sure whats wrong with me. They told me I was bipolar then later said I had borderline personality disorder. I know you cant fully diagnose someone with those things during this age so it wasnt a for sure thing. I dont know if I really need a label I guess. I fall into deep depressive episodes a lot and I struggle with anxiety and especially social anxiety every day of my life. I dont have any self confidence and I question everything I do. I struggle to make friends and I dont trust people easily. I know I have a problem with basing my self worth on what other people think of me and especially men. I get involved with someone and I get so excited and think Ill finally find someone thats going to treat me right and they end up being an asshole or completely ghosting me. I stopped cutting myself junior year too but it is still something I still struggle with to this day. When you spent so many years relying on that to help cope its hard to not fall back into that self destructive behavior. And even now I sometimes wish I could just go off the deep end like I did when I was younger. A lot of times I feel like Im just standing on the edge peering down at the abyss. I wanna just jump off head first. But now I wouldnt even know how to. My feet wont move. So Im stuck in this in between place of not totally off the edge but so close I feel its presence weighing me down all the time. I really couldnt tell you a time I felt totally free.

18,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Stop telling boys that they shouldn't cry.,1,gxz85r,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gxz85r/stop_telling_boys_that_they_shouldnt_cry/,2020-06-07 07:16:55,"When I was around 10 years old, I watched my teenage brother nurse a wound. He was crying as he soaked his scraped knee with water in the bathtub. I looked at him with disdain. ""Why are you crying?"" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected something that I had been taught earlier in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to cry. When I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldnt control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men. I think Im one of the millions of men out there whove been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can lead to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldnt show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below. For all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think thats even more manly than being a tough guy. Thank you guys so much for reading this. Please be safe, everyone. xoxo Listen here: URL"

I know that theres people around me who would check on me if I reached out and said I needed help, but I feel guilty and dont want to burden them with my on and off fluctuations. I always assume theyre busy dealing with their own shit. But I just had an idea for an app that I know i would definitely use. The app would have a place to check in for my daily mental health (maybe rate my emotions, have I eaten? Have I slept enough?) and I would be able to share this check in status with my friends. I would be able to see their check ins too so that if I was feeling stable on a given day and my friend wasnt, I could reach out to them (and they could do the same for me on my rough days). Doing this would be less scary than overthinking what text i want to send to a friend when I need some support and would also probably set up a stronger connection between my support group. I have no coding experience though so if anyone makes apps and wants to pick up this idea, please let me know."

More than simply a means to a paycheck, work gives individuals a sense of dignity and accomplishment. Feeling as though one is participating in meaningful work, whether it is contributing to a massive project or an individual artistic pursuit, allows one to feel as though they have a purpose. While this urge to create or work appears to be a universal human trait, the conditions in which individuals work are constantly changing. This is particularly the case during or following major technological revolutions. Neolithic revolutions throughout the world transformed hunter and gatherer societies into sedentary farming communities. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution that began in Europe during the eighteenth century saw the rise of steam power, the precursors to modern factories, and technologies that led to the widespread decline of cottage industries, guilds, and artisanal labor in general. This was just the first of many such revolutions. It was followed by the Second Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which saw the introduction of electricity, the modern assembly line, and the use of interchangeable parts  particularly in North America and Europe. The Third Industrial Revolution, which began in the middle of the twentieth century, was characterized by the rise of digitalization, computing, information technologies, and the globalization of supply chains. The latter process has led to the deindustrialization of many regions within the Global North (such as the Rust Belt in the Great Lakes region) and the accelerated industrialization of parts of the Global South, especially provincial cities in the Far East, which have become magnets for previously rural migrant workers ([nongmingong](URL or min-gong) who have been displaced by industrialized and automated farming systems. Some (most notably [Klaus Schwab](URL now posit that we are entering into a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will be characterized by rapid technological developments in the fields of artificial intelligence, digital networking, quantum computing, robotics, materials science, and genetics, and that these advances will once again radically change society. Some of these changes will undoubtably be good. Novel medicines will likely be developed that can prevent or cure a host of diseases. Advances in renewable energy technology, building science, and other fields may ensure humanity averts a climate disaster. The growth of decentralized distribution networks could allow us to eliminate a great deal of food waste. The list goes on. While all these changes have the capacity to eliminate suffering and to use resources more efficiently, the same technology has the potential to fundamentally alter the concept of the job by making work scarcer and more precarious for all but a privileged minority. **The Rise of the Precariat** All technological revolutions have made certain jobs, skills, and previous technologies obsolete. This is known as technological unemployment. For workers who are affected by these changes, they can either fight against the process or look for opportunity elsewhere. (Those in the former group are often called [Luddites](URL a term which refers to a group of highly skilled textile workers in eighteenth-century England who destroyed the mechanical looms and weavers that threatened their livelihood.) The fight against change, however, is not easy, as new technologies make products cheaper to produce and cheaper to purchase. This leaves them at odds not only with owners, but consumers, too. As adoption becomes more widespread, the fight becomes increasingly quixotic. This phenomenon is not rare, nor is it a relic of the past. If anything, it is becoming more common as computers have become smaller and more powerful (see [Moores Law](URL and the rate at which broader technological advances occur has accelerated (see [Kurzweils Law](URL For futurists and tech CEOs, this kind of disruption is considered good because it allows for more innovative solutions to problems and to replace existing markets. For [less educated and older workers](URL it can mean the effective disappearance of their professions. This has already happened to many manual workers who lack specialized training or experience. Millions have been displaced by globalization or automation that has occurred in the last fifty years  in regions like the Rust Belt, for example  and they have been forced to take refuge in the service economy or, more recently, by participating in what is known as the gig economy. Many theorists have taken to calling this new group the [precariat](URL (a portmanteau combining the words precarious and proletariat) because these jobs are oftentimes tentative or part-time. If the Fourth Industrial Revolution follows this trend of accelerating the process of displacement, these industries that have served as a refuge for the precariat will also see increased automation via AI and robotics, which will mean even fewer jobs. Combined with the rise in the number of people entering the workforce due to population growth, automation threatens to make it impossible to provide employment to everyone who wants a job. While technological advances have historically impacted workers who work primarily with their hands or do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge to enter into their industry, new technologies may affect even highly skilled and specialized workers whose work is solely intellectual. Even certain healthcare professionals, like [therapists](URL may share a similar fate due to advances in AI. If a therapy bot can offer services that are indistinguishable from a human therapist at a fraction of the cost and without the need to travel to an office or schedule an appointment, how long can this remain a viable profession for thousands of people? This begs the very blunt question: If these new technologies eliminate the need for tens of millions of jobs and there is no new industry to serve as a refuge, what is everyone going to do? **The Impact on Mental Health** While this is no doubt a fecund discussion, as this process will demand a restructuring and rethinking of how current economic, management, and political systems are organized, these potential changes present dozens of significant problems from the perspective of public health, especially mental health. Many of them have already materialized. I will focus only on two for now, as they both stem from the high likelihood that traditional employment will continue to be thought of as a necessary part of adulthood, even if traditional jobs may not be available to all adults. As work becomes scarcer, competition for available positions will become more aggressive. Those who manage to keep their positions may increasingly seek to prove themselves to be indispensable to their superiors, which could lead to an acceleration of the existing culture of instant accessibility wherein workers are always available via email or phone  even if compensation is still modeled on a 40-hour workweek. In an organization with leadership willing to exploit this vulnerability, they could tacitly demand workers perform duties beyond their contractual tasks, a phenomenon that has been described as [compulsory citizenship behavior](URL Even today, there is already worry that the erosion of the distinction between work and leisure times due to social media, work emails, and other duties is leaving individuals in near perpetual state of stress that can have a wide array of negative health outcomes. The proverbial giving 110% here takes on a sinister meaning, as it implies that one is expected to give more than what is possible to their job and that anything less is a shortcoming that is grounds for their termination. Apart from being an oppressive practice that seems ethically dubious, evidence suggests that such a demanding environment negatively impacts worker engagement and performance, and that [organization-wide productivity](URL may suffer as a consequence if such attitudes are made endemic due to toxic leadership. Conversely, many may experience another form of[ anxiety](URL should they continue to find it difficult to find steady work. Worse, some may fall into despair if they lack certain resources or abilities. Even if there is the implementation of a universal basic income to prevent the worst aspects of long-term unemployment or underemployment, there will likely be continued expectations and social pressure to have a job. Those who cannot meet those expectations will likely feel deeply humiliated, lonely, and resentful, and will likely experience many of the [well-documented](URL physical and mental health problems associated with [worklessness](URL (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, anxiety, and depression). **The Role of Mental Health Professionals** Such a paradigm shift has already begun and will likely accelerate during and following the coronavirus-related recession. One can be hopeful that these are temporary problems that will eventually be resolved by intensive reforms and changes in policy, but they are clear and present challenges that will not go away on their own for the foreseeable future. We need to acknowledge that these changes are happening and that the resultant stressors are having an impact on people from virtually all walks of life. For those of us who work as mental health professionals, we will have to become more attuned to these global phenomena to better understand our patients and their struggles. We will need to better empathize with the anxieties of those who feel as though they are only as secure as the caprices of their employers, as well as the anger of those who feel as though they have been cast by the wayside or lack a purpose. We must recognize the material circumstances that are shaping our patients conditions if we are to properly treat them."

25,vulnerability,mentalhealth,What causes this behavior ?,2,ghzwyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ghzwyb/what_causes_this_behavior/,2020-05-12 10:13:38," I just ended a 10 month relationship with this girl because of many reasons. First off we got together in July of 2019. She seemed soooooo in love with me. Wanted me to spend every waking moment with her. Im 25 by the way and she is 19 and Im sure her age plays a big factor into this. Anyway, she had an ex in jail and when he got out in October she cheated on me by going to see him, continued to lie about it, and kept seeing both of us at the same time. Eventually I walked away, of course things with him didnt work out, and 2 weeks later she wanted me back. I felt she had a mistake and took her back. Everything was good until February, but then one night she snuck off with him and I threatened to break up with her. She came clean about everything after I found hard evidence on her phone that she cheated in October, said she had cheated on all her boyfriends, and I thought accepting her for the mistakes she has made and explaining to her why she cheats (low self-esteem, fear of vulnerability) etc. would help her change. And she did begin to change. I saw more empathy, compassion, and remorse from her than I ever did in the last few months. She was loyal for the last few months too because she was literally always with me. However, I got mad because she lied a few nights ago about her and her friend going to buy weed from this dude. I wasnt even mad that they did it, but that she lied about it. She denied, got mad and broke up with me because I got mad and seemed like I didnt want to be with her anymore and then I figured out she went to go see him that night. After this, I couldnt take it anymore. She didnt really want to break up but the fact she went to go see him was too disrespectful. I love this girl more than anything in the world, but I couldnt let myself continue to be disrespected. I broke up with her, told her to seek therapy because she has some massive self-esteem issues, and that Id still always be there to support her. She cried, thanked me for everything and that she was sorry for everything she has done. However, I just tried to check up on her to make sure she is okay and she accused me of not caring about her because if I did I wouldnt have left her, which I can now see is manipulation to make me feel guilty and take her back. Also, she is projecting her guilt on to me. This is so sad to watch because I realize this seems to be a massive case of low self worth and thats why she not only needs me, but also needs to keep stringing along the other guy for additional attention. Do you guys believe this is low self worth, and if so why? Supposedly she has tried to commit suicide twice in her life. Heres some additional insight. The first relationship she ever got in, she was cheated on. The second relationship, she was cheated on and physically abused. Thats when she started cheating on that boyfriend with the guy who was in jail, who sexually assaulted her the first time they had sex. She said she used to be a good person, but saw no point in it after all the abuse and became selfish. Can abuse really do this to you? Instead of becoming a better example than these people, she became just like them. In addition, she took everything as a personal attack it seemed like, which is another reason why I believe she has massive insecurity issues. If I accidentally interrupted her, shed get mad for hours. If I went upstairs to talk to my parents for a little bit while she was sleeping, she would get mad and think I didnt want to spend time with her. If I called another girl by a nickname, she would get pissed off. Its like she internalized everything as a sign that I didnt respect her or love her. I love this girl with all my heart and its sad to see her be so insecure and also continue to not take full responsibility for her actions, which would actually help her grow and be a better person. I will always love her, but I realize I have to love her from a distance. What causes her to be this way and will she ever change?"
26,vulnerability,mentalhealth,To Speak or Not To Speak Coming From a Filipino American,1,gio7x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gio7x3/to_speak_or_not_to_speak_coming_from_a_filipino/,2020-05-13 10:35:41,"So on social media, sometimes I express my opinions on some things. I try to do it less. But the other day, I was really shocked to hear all these horrible, negative comments of people from the Philippines, in response to Filipino actors and actresses expressing their vulnerability and worry for losing work. You see I am a Filipino American, born and raised in America . . . I felt really terrible for how people were acting, because I have had depression and anxiety ever since I was young, and was told when I was young to never go to counseling, because it's only for crazy people. But going to counseling was what my whole family needed (not just me, but only I took initiative to go) . . . Anyways, Filipinos talked $#%@ about the actors and actresses feeling terrible for not having work, saying things like you are rich! Why are acting like a baby? You are complaining like a child. I no longer have respect for you. Think about the Filipinos who suffer more than you. Compared to them, you don't have much to worry about. Sure, they might not have much to worry about, because they still have a lot of money, but a lot of these actors were once really poor. Also during COVID-19, I feel like no matter what social status you are, to lose work in general, is very devastating. The future is very concerning for everyone no matter who they are. I know that if my family lost their jobs, we'd feel terrible too! Everyone would be. When I first started taking counseling, despite my family's negativity about it, as I was figuring out my life, my counselors told me that some cultures have more stigma and make getting help hard due to shame. I only felt it within my own family, but from how Filipinos reacted to Filipino actors' and actresses' feelings of losing their jobs, I understand how Filipinos still need to progress in decreasing the stigma of mental health issues, and it makes me sad to the point where I shared how I felt on my social media. My uncle discussed the issue with my mom, and my mom talked about it with me. I told her my opinions, she agreed, but disagreed with me sharing how I felt on social media. She was like, why? I hate when people talk about their opinions on social media. What if you get bullied, and get affected? I told her, I know people will have their opinions, but I'd rather say something, provide awareness and open people's minds. If people don't like what I say, they can just move on or hide my post, like I had to do with relatives who laughed and belittled the actors who just wanted a release and open up. Sure, there the actors' production company might have done some wrong, but the actors work and who they are are separate from the wrong doing of their company. They are not defined by their company. Like I don't want to be defined by my family's wrongdoings. I am a bit different. I am my own person. Also, I know that in Korea, some talent agencies there have had their own share of unfairness. But the singers, and dancers who work for them are separate from them as well. We are not entirely defined by where we're from. After my mom talked to me about how she doesn't agree with me expressing my own opinion on social media, I asked myself is me doing that so wrong? Should I be speechless when I took initiative to seek counseling on my own and more? But then I think about how I am not alone. I am not the only one."

28,vulnerability,mentalhealth,How do I stop being so fake?,1,gp35g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gp35g3/how_do_i_stop_being_so_fake/,2020-05-23 21:12:06," This is going to be pretty long, tl;dr version at the bottom. Last night my SO confronted me about the fact that I tend to be... inauthentic at times. He said that I'm almost always overly pleasant and accommodating towards him, until something he does or says suddenly irritates me and I ""let the mask slip"" (not his exact words) and scoff/snap at him. He also said that I seem to have one set of opinions around him, and then I say completely different things when I'm around other people. It makes him feel like I'm not really being genuine, like he doesn't know what he can and can't say because he doesn't know what my reactions will be, and it makes him wonder who I really am if I can't be honest with him. It was so crushing for me to hear. The worst thing about it is that I realized it's actually true. I do put on an act when I interact with others. Sometimes I don't even realise I'm doing it. I've just thought of it as me hiding my awkwardness and trying to be ""normal"", as well as avoiding conflict. I haven't thought of my behaviour as being dishonest, just as being ""nice"". But this behaviour is ruining my relationships. I feel like I've always struggled with forming a closer bond with people. Despite being introverted and feeling shy/awkward I've learned to socialize pretty well with people on a superficial level, and I've been told that people perceive me as funny, kind, confident, etc, but I feel like it's an act. I even resent people for thinking I'm strong and not realizing that I'm really an insecure person. I don't connect with anyone on a deeper level, mostly because I can't bring myself to be truly open and personal. I'm constantly terrified of being rejected/found out for who I really am, or being criticised in any way. I have ridiculously high expectations of both myself and others. In my mind I judge people who want sympathy or display their vulnerability, but secretly I'm jealous that they are ""allowed"" to be vulnerable when I feel like I'm not. It irritates me that people are flawed, despite me also being flawed. I feel like a lot of my issues stem from being bullied as a child, and also my relationship with my mom. Growing up I felt like she was emotionally distant and never happy with anything I did, so I stopped sharing stuff with her and pretty much closed up. When I became an adult she suddenly wanted a close mother-daughter relationship, but I felt like I didn't know how to be who she wanted because of her constant jabs and criticisms. I tried to get along with her by never challenging her and agreeing to everything she said, but she instantly picked up on it and told me how unnatural and fake I was being. It was stressful for me to not know how to behave ""naturally"" around her. If I -didn't- put on an act, our interactions always lead to huge fights, because of her judgemental way of talking about me or other people and me calling her out on it. I broke off contact with her for a couple of years; nowadays we have an arrangement where I call her every other week. We've gone back to strictly pleasantries. I feel like it's exhausting to keep it up, but she seems to prefer this over open fighting or no contact. As of now, I don't have a single friend that I can truly talk to and be honest with (aside from my SO - despite what I wrote in this post, we've both become so much better at communicating, and I truly value our relationship). I'm not close to anyone in my family. Regardless of what social environment I'm in (work, school, extracurricular activities), I feel so lonely. I feel out of place everywhere, and like I'm just guessing how people want me to act so that they won't reject me. I don't want to live like this. I want to be able to be myself and to form meaningful connections to people. Has anyone had similar experiences? What can I do to stop being like this? I tried reaching out to a therapist once in my late teens, but it left me feeling humiliated and ashamed, and I never went back. Tl;dr: My SO called me out for being inauthentic. I'm afraid of people getting close and finding out who I really am, so I put on a fake persona where I'm overly accommodating and nice, but distant. Inside I'm super judgemental towards myself and others. I feel so incredibly lonely all the time, but I'm afraid I'll lose everything I am if I open myself up to others and stop holding myself to an impossibly high standard. (Please don't be too hard on me, I feel so nervous and ashamed for even writing this and admitting my huge flaws.)"

I just really needed to get something off my chest, that i've been thinking about for a really long time. It's sort of a mindset that i am stuck in, and cant seem to get rid off, no matter how hard i try. I really just want to talk to someone about it, and maybe get some advice. My problem is that i generally can't be serious about anything at all. That's kind of broad, so i'll try to explain the best i can, what i am going through. I think my problen is, that i cant show any sort of vulnerability to anyone. I have a bunch of really great friends, but i can't ever recall a time, that i have had a deep personal conversation with any of them. And it shows. I'm the friend that someone goes to, to have a laugh and a good time, but never to ask advice in personal matters. And i totally understand it, cause i can't ever be serious about that type of stuff. It's like theres something inherently wrong with my ability to let go off my feelings, and share them with others. I realize it might seem like an easy problem to solve, but i generally feel like it's a major violation of my personal boundaries to try and let go, and really say what i am feeling, or be sympathetic to what someone else is feeling. It makes me extremely uncomfortable, to be put in a situation like that. The thing is, that it doesn't even pose a massive problem in my daily life. My friends just perceive me as being a little mysterious, and theyre alright with the fact, that i can't seem to talk about personal stuff. On the other hand, it poses a huge problem in my dating life. I am completely convinced that a relationship relies on the ability of both parts to show their real feelings, and be honest to each other, and i really am not able to do that. As soon as things get intimate, both in a physical and emotional sense, i get so wildly uncomfortable, that things start to go wrong. I think this contributes a big part to the fact, that i can't ever get in a serious relationship, and end up hurting the people that actually like me. And that's not what i want to do, it just sort of happens by it self. I think that is my best go at explaining what i am going through. I hope that whoever sees this has some insights, or maybe has gone through something similar themselves, and can tell me how to proceed, and become better."

Thinking about it makes my whole body feel numb and it takes me a while to find ways to distract myself and make myself forget about it, but I know I never fully will. I didnt always send pictures (sometimes would just straight up sext through story/describing sex acts), only did so and video chatted without showing my face a couple of times. I oftentimes avoided showing my face like the plague but when I first started I would do it sometimes. I look different now because I used to be a lot chubbier but theres still an obvious resemblance. Im moving into a stage in my life where I want to grow and improve and be better but I feel like this drags me down and holds me back so much. The fact that I cant take back my actions kills me. I have deleted all emails, kik and Snapchat accounts that I would do this with because Id never use my personal since I was trying to avoid being identified as much as possible, but with the way the internet and social media work now a days Im so scared that Ill be found by one of these men that took advantage of my vulnerability and it will destroy my life. My hope is that none of them kept the pictures, but you never truly know. I feel so stupid and scared and I dont know how to make myself feel better. Ive tried talking to my friends about this but none of them ever did things like this so they cant relate/dont know how to make me feel better. I feel so so so dumb and scared. Has anyone here done anything similar and felt the same way? How did you deal with it?"
33,vulnerability,mentalhealth,"My long, rambling post about why we get suicidal thoughts. (CW: suicidal thoughts)",2,fw3hbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fw3hbg/my_long_rambling_post_about_why_we_get_suicidal/,2020-04-07 03:56:36,"**(Im not a mental health professional.)** After doing research and self-reflection over the years, Ive developed my own understanding of why the fuck our brains give us fucked up suicidal thoughts. So basically, this is my interpretation. **When do suicidal thoughts occur?** First, theres some kind of trigger (external or internal). For example, I may feel overwhelming loneliness. The feeling of loneliness is the trigger. Then, the brain (limbic system, specifically) reacts with Fuck, this is so painful. Ive activated fight or flight mode bc this feeling is so painful, we must be in DANGER. Then, the anxiety and depression kicks in. Something to note is how the limbic system doesnt take any time to identify why the trigger caused distress and what actual emotion you are experiencing. The brain basically just detects a vague negative feeling, and then freaks the fuck out. It basically overreacts without even trying to understand the source of the problem. Its lame. **Why do we have suicidal thoughts?** Ive often wondered, why the hell would humans be evolved to have suicidal thoughts? It doesnt make sense because our brains should be focused on helping us SURVIVE. Suicidal thoughts obviously dont promote survival. The only logical answer to this question is that the limbic system is well-intentioned but dumb as fuck. The limbic system is overreacting and putting you in fight or flight mode. Its actually trying to help you by doing this. Its detecting danger and discomfort. The brain thinks what is the easiest way to get rid of this pain?. When the negative emotions are so strong, suicidal thoughts emerge because its the only solution that the limbic system can think of. I believe this is a normal response to deep emotional pain. So, I think the brain ultimately wants you to survive, but its accustomed to overreacting to negative feelings/triggers. The brain wants you to survive but it also wants you to not experience pain. When you go into fight or flight mode, the focus is on ending the pain even if that means ending your life. Its quite ironic because the part of the brain focused on survival is telling you to kill yourself. (My sense of humor might be terrible but I think this irony and the misguidedness of the brain is hilarious.) **What is the point of understanding the brains reaction?** I think understanding this can help you be more compassionate toward yourself. Its not your fault youre experiencing suicidal thoughts. I actually think its quite normal to have suicidal thoughts, but that doesnt mean you have to cling to them or act on them. Its just your brains normal reaction to emotional pain. **We should be compassionate toward our silly, well-intentioned brains.** Although I describe the brains overreaction as dumb as fuck, I shouldnt be so derogatory. We should be compassionate toward our limbic systems. Even though the brain is sometimes horribly mistaken by suggesting suicide, the brain is ultimately trying to help. Ive heard suggestions for thinking of the limbic system as a child that doesnt know any better. NOTE: I suppose this may all sound like a bummer. The bright side is that through neuroplasticity, we can consciously change the way our limbic system reacts to certain triggers. If you arent happy with how your brain reacts to some things, you do have the ability to change it. It takes time, effort and repetition but it is possible. **Suggestions for responding to suicidal thoughts:** (IM NOT A MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST. THIS IS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AS A FELLOW DEPRESSED PERSON.) When youre in an overwhelming trance trickled with suicidal thoughts, the main thing to do is to SLOW DOWN and calm the nervous system. The key is to get out of fight or flight mode. I prefer taking deep breaths and/or listening to calming binaural beats. There are also grounding techniques that may help. Find what works for you. **Look Inward to understand yourself more.** \*\*\*\*DISCLAIMER: Please note that if youre struggling A LOT, you may not have the energy to dig deeper into your feelings. Thats okay. If you are responding to **trauma**, investigating your emotions may not help. Trauma is complicated so I recommend seeking trauma-informed resources/counseling. Whether or not your experience is trauma-related, If the idea of looking inward is too overwhelming, you should just focus on calming your nervous system. (Then, perhaps distract yourself with positive activities/media until your mood improves.) Anyway, If you have the mental energy, you can investigate what led to your suicidal thoughts by doing the following. Think about what triggered all this in the first place. Identify the emotion. Write it down. Identify any external events that pushed you into a negative mood. I think its important to name the negative emotions you feel. We are so used to saying I feel like shit or Im depressed, but that is so vague. I think our brains think that if we identify our actual emotions, the pain will get worse. That is not true. When we slow down, identify our emotions and allow ourselves to feel those emotions, its a bit easier. For example, I may realize that the insanely uncomfortable feeling that led to my suicidal thoughts was related to vulnerability. I find that when I pinpoint the uncomfortable, triggering feeling as vulnerability, then I can do research or talk to my therapist about the specific challenges of vulnerability. If I dont pinpoint the problem, then the problem is vague and it feels more overwhelming, mysterious and scary. In my experience, I felt much more hopeless before I understood everything I wrote above. I think understanding yourself and m human biology in general, can help mitigate the scariness of suicidal thoughts. Its easy to think that your brain is against you but when you understand the response, its easy to see that the brain is trying to help in a terribly misguided way. I hope this helps at least one person. I wish I knew this stuff when I was an extremely depressed teenager. I still struggle with suicidal thoughts especially during this quarantine. I dont have everything figured out. All I can say is that understanding why suicidal thoughts generally occur can make the experience less scary."

We play games every night and he's my best friend. The only one in fact. What makes me so uncertain is because he never asks if I'm ok. I don't *really* hide that I'm depressed. But I don't say it either. It's kind of me just being dead silent when we play games, barely laugh at jokes and just exist. But he sometimes crack a dumb joke that just makes me laugh and he brings the mood back up ~~until he goes to bed and I'm just sat alone again~~. And I don't know what to make of it. I'm terrified what will happen if I open up. If he just says ""well this is awkward, I don't really care"", how do I just transition from my position of vulnerability to just being casual friends again? I guess I'm just scared if my best friend doesn't think I'm his either. I've recently got an appointment with a psychiatrist, but Covid19 is blocking my appointment so here I am asking you guys if my best friend is someone I can confide in, or not."
35,vulnerability,mentalhealth,U don't know if my what I'm telling myself is real anymore,1,g25tuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/g25tuk/u_dont_know_if_my_what_im_telling_myself_is_real/,2020-04-16 11:56:25,"(im indulging myself in a nice long story of my (relatively short) life so far, to skip it's the next paragraph for the bulk of my story) I've been struggling with undiagnosed (by my most likely terrible choice) mental health issues for roughly 2-3 years now and this last year I've had frequent thoughts and fantasies about suicide. I feel guilty because in my eyes they seem so unjustified, I manage to be in a neutral mood most of the time, I can usually enjoy myself in the company of others and the life I have is one I'm extremely thankful for. The only problems I have that I know for a fact change my mental state are physical problems including, like chronic fatigue, chronic pain and frequent injury due to scoliosis and hypermobility and weakened joints,tendons and ligaments. Due to these I often reserve myself from doing activities I've loved since I was still chewing pencils in school learning about multiplication, such as Competing in track and field events and now even simpler things like going for a jog daily. Starting with feelings of boredom and disinterest in my hobbies and social interaction it slowly spread and mutated, boredom becoming apathy and disinterest in socialising becoming complete emotional isolation from all my 'friends and most of my loved ones'. It stayed like this for months until eventually I started to wonder if life was worth living. At this point I'm time it was about 2 years ago just at the start of Fall, I started to hurt myself but I never felt like I needed to. I kept doing this until eventual I thought about how it would impact my family, and just like that I stopped. Being around other people in my life who had openly talked about similar experiences to what I was having I felt a small dagger of guilt press itself into my stomach as I thought about how often they deeply struggled with soul crushing relapses. For the other people around me, it seemed to haunt them like an inescapable burden, yet I almost wasn't affected by my decision to stop. I felt/feel like a fraud, telling myself I did it to feel better but yet being able to get clean with almost no difficulty. It wasn't right and I feel like an attention seeking poser when I think back on it. I hid it and I only opened up to people who reciprocated the circumstances and yet I feel like my ""faking"" the need for it was nothing more than an insult to everybody else who truly struggles with staying clean and safe. Ever since then I began to think about suicide as well. The greatest mistake of my life was the first time I seriously considered it. Except the only thought I had on it was how people would react. Convincing myself I was going to do it because I would be better off and not because I wanted to see how people would act. After once again talking to the people around me about it and having them tell me to take care of myself and that I'm loved. I made a pathetic half hearted attempt to kill myself. Only to very predictably survive and once again have people support me in my state of ' vulnerability '. During the time I felt as if it was all very real, I'd never blatantly fake something just for attention. But looking back I feel so ashamed that I worried people around me who have struggles much worse than I do and worried them over me when they could have been focusing on helping themselves. I leeched off of their empathy for me and stopped them from doing what they needed to do to be better. Since then there's been a dagger of guilt stabbed in me, slowly being pressed deeper into my body. Since then I've gone through cycling waves of, feeling bored but fine most of the time and only sad/happy or anything other than disinterested about 10% of the time shifting into weeks and months of almost complete apathy in the company of others and sadness so bad it sends crippling waves of pain pulsing through my chest whenever I'm left alone with my own thoughts. But because of the way I used these issues in the past as a guise to let myself be convinced I was deserving of the attention, time and care given to me by people much more deserving than me. I can't trust myself that these feelings are real. I don't trust myself to not do this purely to get some sort of sick gratification from people worrying about my own safety and health. The last 6 months I've been in a state of constant sadness whenever I stop moving (figuratively and literally). With pain so bad sometimes it almost paralyzes me wherever I am, with the feeling of my insides being rotted away by guilt and pain from these episodes. Suicidal thoughts became more and more frequent until now I can't go half a day without vividly imagining killing myself. Despite everything I still have the same thoughts as I used to. Every time I think if dying my initial thought is of how would people around me react, what would they all do. Then of course my thoughts flit away to how it will make my sadness go away. I can't trust myself enough to know whether all of this is real or if my mind forcing me to suffer just so I can stay relevant and significant to the other people around me and I guess myself. This is all I think about anymore and I can't believe in my own thoughts because I know how much they lie to me and persuade me things are different to how they actually are. I don't know if this pain is real or just a sick excuse for me to continue and validate my reason to share my 'struggling' with people close to me to feel important and cared for. I don't know what to believe. I can't trust what my mind is telling me I'm really feeling. Maybe this is payback for all of the worry and effort I stole from people who needed it for themselves. Karma fulfilling the issues and pain I convinced myself I had and now I'm getting a taste of properly. I don't know what to believe. I just feel so guilty that for so long I relied on people who were fighting so hard to keep themselves going, just to indulge whatever disgusting subconscious need I had to get from their attention and worry. I'm not sure what I expect from this post, and I don't know what I really want from it either. But please respond. At the very least I need to know whether or not I really am leeching off of others. Based on what I've said please tell me if I'm as bad a person I think. I feel so guilty about making my problems out to be bad enough that I got others in worse positions than me to give me empathy and support I needed only to gratify myself by capitalising on such horrible things as committing suicide. I'm suffering so badly now. I haven't slept more than 3 hours in over a week because of my thoughts. I don't know if my pain is real anymore"

The raw vulnerability of presenting such a thing to the world borders upon the unbearable. Yet I persist, not because I think the poem itself is worth sharing, but because its worth comes by the way of example. I hope that it will inspire people to release their inner demons, and to push through that inner voice that fears the words that are being put on the page. Write, and write, and write some more. Write until it is all gone. Until you are empty. Then you will be free to be filled with beauty and love and life.

Do I want to sober up, Or do I want to die? Blank memories. Pain. Watching his hand touch up my thigh. I couldnt say no, I couldnt flee, Nothing I tried Broke his hold of me.

Deep down I am really sensitive, anxious, timid, and someone who wants to be vulnerable and open. But at some point in my childhood in changed. I began to become very accusatory, insecure, and generally using toxic behaviors cover up all this vulnerability. As a child I use to cry a lot, think a lot, and act very shy. I was just a more quiet and and scared person but I also had this confidence and positivity underneath when I felt safe. So the bottom line is, I dont understand why I still continue to be negative, and harsh all in an effort to hide how o really feel. I had a hard dad and most of my family bicker a lot and on top of that I had a lot of people push me as an outcast when I was young. My guess right now is Ive just been kinda beat down when I was young so I use this as a unhealthy defense mechanism because every time I was vulnerable people shamed me for it because I am suppose to be a manly dude. I am 18 year old semi bulky guy so I think a lot of people were caught off guard with me being so soft ina accordance to my appearance. But I dont know, its really ruins my state of mind and if anyone has any input I would greatly appreciate it. Tl:dr: I often end up using toxic behaviors to cover up vulnerabilities. Even though I recognize they are toxic and want to express my real self underneath the bad behaviors. Asking for help on what this could be and how to change it."

Thats where 1) I started realizing life isnt fair and more importantly 2) I had a suuuuuper toxic codependent friendship that, when I ended it, caused more lasting emotional trauma than literally any other event in my 24 years of life including the death of family members and pets that have died in my lap. Basically it just made me realize how easy it was for me to give every little piece of myself to someone without even thinking twice about it. And i decided to knock that shit right off. Ive had several therapists since then and have always been very upfront about my trauma and issues and mental illnesses and such and they always ask if I want to work on emotional vulnerability and Im like nope! Sure dont! Like I know its because its a shitty coping mechanism but I feel safer this way? I used to be too open and it hurt me a lot multiple times and now, unless I was already close with them before, I dont wanna risk that shit with anyone else. Im aware itll be hard for me to have a long term romantic relationship or develop more deep and meaningful friendships but like..... I usually feel just fine with that because at least I wont have to endure more trauma? Like I can make friends and such I just dont get super vulnerable with anyone anymore no matter how long I know them. Its too easy to see myself falling into a codependent relationship again and this time not being able to get out of it. Idk Im just not concerned about it and honestly I like the safety that I feel by not letting anyone close to me who wasnt already close before all that shit happened that messed up my emotions real good. (That shit HURTED and sometimes I still cry about that one friend legit 7-8 years later out of the blue for no reason at least twice a year) I guess TLDR is I had some fucked up friendships and one VERY codependent friendship that absolutely destroyed me emotionally for months and now, 7-8 years later, I refuse to let people close to me anymore and I dont WANT to fix that despite people telling me I should. Is that wrong? Weird? Should I actually try to be vulnerable with people like I used to be?"

He's always dealt with some degree of depression, so I always knew the issue was there. He did seem to get better when we first started dating, and everything went so great on our last two years of high school. Maybe that's just how it seemed to me, who knows, but he did seem to be genuinely happier. We were compatible on every single level, emotional, physical, and he was (and still is) my best friend in the entire world, which is why our current situation feels so much worse. I've always been a highly sexual person, and those first two years were great for me: lots of experimenting and talking comfortably about sex and just being very compatible sexually. The first year of uni was rough. I knew it was going to be different than high school, and we would see each other less, but I thought we could work it out. We started having less sex, which I just brushed off as uni stress, seeing each other less, having our own lives. But it just got less and less, to the point where I can count on my fingers how many times we had sex the whole year. We almost broke up at some point, but I decided to be patient and try to support him through whatever issues he was going through. I chose to believe that patience will be rewarded eventually, and things would get back to normal. It's been almost a year and a half since I gave him another chance, and it's been eight months since we last had sex. This year we are living together, and I thought it might improve things, but it just didn't. I feel like a huge part of our relationship has been lost. He is still my best friend, and I would be devastated to lose him from my life, but it just feels like I am missing something. I am often thinking about this, and I am often crying by myself about it. In the past I would often try to initiate things, but I have been rejected so many times that now I am too afraid to even think of proposing anything. I am dealing with lots of stress and anxiety issues myself due to uni and other issues that I won't get into, and this is just one of the things that affects me greatly. I see a lot of my friends just living their love life not perfectly, but happily, and it just makes me sad thinking I could be so much happier if I wasn't in this relationship. It feels selfish to say it but I guess deep inside that is how I feel. We have talked about this issue a few times, and it always went the same: him saying he will try to get better, and get some therapy and meds for his depression, and then... Nothing happening. Next year, I am doing a year abroad away from our uni, and that would mean long distance relationship. I don't know if I want that. With my current mental state, I am not sure I can maintain a long distance relationship. If I knew i would come back after a year to a perfectly fine relationship, I wouldn't doubt myself. But right now it would just be a one year of commitment for long distance, which I view as stressful and mentally straining as it is, and then me coming back to the uncertainty if my relationship will ever be fine again. I have been patient for a year and a half and nothing improved, not even one bit. I have carried a lot of emotional burden in our relationship, and I slowly feel like I am crumbling apart, as the moment when I have to choose between a long distance relationship and a break up approaches. I am worried that breaking up with him would make me lose him out of my life completely, and I am not ready for that. I am worried about him, since if he is depressed, us breaking up would do much worse. I have only one person in my life that knows about our situation, and even she doesn't know the full extent of it as I have always struggled with talking about my feelings and showing vulnerability to other people. I just don't know how to deal with this anymore, and every day just feels like I am getting closer to my limit. I am sorry if any of my words make me sound like an awful girlfriend, but whoever reads this, thank you for listening."

There's always other people that give you validation, why do I matter?"" And things of that nature. I've always had a few issues with relationships and vulnerability nothing that's ever really been major. But this has been a rather recent development and I can't seem to shake that feeling.

Ex: I know that I should be feeling sad and hurting, but I no longer can have actual feeling of hurt and sadness. Back story- I was in a abusive marriage. So I have lived though the physical pain of hurting and being sad. When I left that marriage I felt like a weight was lifted and never wanted to let myself feel that way again. To me, at the time, being strong meant not crying. Not letting mental emotions overcome me physically. Letting yourself be that vulnerable was a weakness. I mentally detached myself from the emotions of hurt and sadness. I never shed a tear after I left that marriage and here I am, 7 years later. *i went to about a year of therapy just In case I had any hidden PTSD or depression* Today- I dont cry. I havent in over 7 years. I dont feel heartbreak or pain when a good relationship ends. I know I should have that gut feeling of hurt or cry... but I dont. And now I WANT to have those emotions again. . I can feel happy. I can express and feel joy. I can feel anger. But actual sadness and hurt dont register anymore. You know that heartache feeling? The guy feeling when you are truly hurt? The physical and emotional pain of heartache? Recently I ended a relationship that was a dream cone true but distance and future endeavors would not allow it to work out. In my head, I know I should be sad. I want to have that good cry. That feeling of hurt. It sounds weird, but I feel like Im missing out on a basic human response. This has been a problem with every relationship Ive had since ending my marriage. Now, I know WHY I cant feel this emotion. I have spoken to my therapist and of course I know this is a type of PTSD and a type of repression. I do visualization practices. I meditate. And I do several things that were recommended. But she (therapist) says the big battle will be finding someone that I can be vulnerable with that will help unlock these emotions. Has anyone else had this issue? Its so strange to me after YEARS of being proud of being emotionless and strong that I would actually long for the ability to truly cry. I just want to know that Im not the only person with this problem and know what are some good techniques that you found that helped you reconnect those emotions and vulnerability."

Need an ear, some love, and advice on inpatient care if possible.",1,fgkz02,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fgkz02/overwhelmed_need_an_ear_some_love_and_advice_on/,2020-03-11 07:59:35,"Hey y'all. Writing this to get some stuff off my chest cause I'm not 100% sure who I can talk to around me who will understand. Bear with me. I am feeling very scared and overwhelmed and exhausted. For context: I have anxiety and depression, as well as undiagnosed/unofficial OCD since childhood. I (25F) have had an *extremely* trying past 12 months. I am coming up on a year anniversary of a very frightening health scare- I was sick from about the first week of March until about mid-May; I was hospitalized for the entire last week of April with severe symptoms for what is presumed to be an autoimmune condition. But even now, practically a year later, I have no definitive answer or diagnosis which makes it frustrating since I've had a few mini-flare ups throughout the year. It was a deeply traumatizing experience. My now-fiance and I took a break around the summer time; we hit a rough patch in our relationship in about June and had to give ourselves some space. Fixable problems, thankfully, in what has otherwise been a very rewarding almost 6-year relationship. We made the decision in early January to get engaged. We have made incredible progress as a couple, but it has take a lot of work on both of our parts. My relationship is a highlight in my life rn, but it has taken a lot of energy to get to this point. In November, we had to make the decision to terminate a viable pregnancy, due to my previous health scare and our uncertainty about my body's ability to carry it, as well as our current financial predicament. We both wanted to bring the pregnancy to term very badly, but mutually agreed that this wasn't the right time. It broke my heart as well as my fiance's. I don't even have words for that hurt. A little less than two weeks ago, my mother passed away after an extended battle with cancer. My sibling and I were very well prepared; she was sick for years, and thankfully she had a life insurance policy. She did not want a funeral or any type of service; direct cremation, as our family was just her, my sibling, and myself. I took a two week hiatus from both of my jobs (I am a working artist with two day jobs) and am about halfway through. It feels like I will not have sufficient time to rest and mourn. None of this feels like it's enough. I am fortunate for the relationships in my life that bring me immense joy; my fiance, my sibling, and a wonderful bunch of devoted long time friends as well as the local artistic and organizing community. But, I struggle with vulnerability. I am someone that folks look to for wisdom and answers, stability and reassurance. I am happy for fulfill those roles in my communities, but struggle with receiving that help. And now, especially in the wake of a very trying and heartbreaking 3 weeks, I am so totally overwhelmed with anxiety about COVID-19 and feel very deeply embarrassed to admit that to the folks around me, for whatever reason. I am young and relatively healthy aside from the mystery illness I got last year, but not sure to what extent I may be immunocompromised. I live in a major metro area in the US, where public transport is a factor of every day life. My fiance does custodial work for the public transport system, specifically on the line taken every day by the patient first diagnosed with COVID-19 in our area. Because I've been off from work, I've pretty much just been in my home; but am terrified for when the time comes for me to go back to my routine. I don't want to, but I am poor and cannot afford to not work. Thankfully I no longer work in food service, but I do customer service work in one of the busiest places in my city with lots of tourist interaction. I just feel so angry, and so sad, and so scared. My personal art and activism work focuses on the climate crisis and its effect on marginalized communities; I feel like spend so much time staring down the barrel of a gun. My heart hurts. My brain is in a fog. I'm so tired all the time. It feels like I can't catch a fucking break. And that feels selfish to say. I've been feeling like I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I really need therapy, a counselor, or something; someone equipped and trained to help me. I'm about to lose my health insurance coverage (my estranged father's) and am in the process of switching over to my fiance's health insurance, so I can't look for one right now. I have also had a deeply racist, deeply unhelpful experience with one therapist and was ghosted by another in about 2017. I haven't had professional care since, and as much as I know I need it I also find it hard to trust practitioners. I am seriously considering checking myself into some impatient care, but I don't know if my symptoms would be deemed worthy of admission and if I'll be turned away. Anyone have experience with this? Any words of advice? I'm sorry this is so long. I could just use some love and kind words if you have them to spare, as well as any advice you can give. TL;DR: I am normally a very strong person whose emotional wherewithal is dwindling. I need advice on admitting myself to inpatient care, whether or not that's a good idea, and whether it actually has the potential to be helpful."
45,vulnerability,mentalhealth,My trip to my Gynecologist triggered me...and not exactly how you think!,1,fhcskj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fhcskj/my_trip_to_my_gynecologist_triggered_meand_not/,2020-03-12 18:50:10,"Trigger warnings: Descriptions of past sexual abuse Mention of sexual Assault Descriptions of Anxiety Descriptions of Depression Descriptions of BDSM Descriptions of Nudity Read with caution Yesterday I had my ""yearly"" trip to see my Gynecologist. The day leading up to this was filled with anxiety. I found my head swirling with thoughts about how the visit would go. I was worried about if the interactions with the doctor would push me into a dissassociative state or if I would be able to come out fairly unscathed. Then there was having to have the conversation with my doctor about getting STI testing for EVERYTHING because 1...I like to be proactive with my sexual health and regularly get tested, and 2...roughly six months ago I was sexually assulted and I had not been tested since that had happened. Now some may be wondering why I put off testing for so long, or why I didnt go to hospital and get checked out right away. Well there are many reasons. I am a trans man who had just gotten sexually assulted, I was unemployed, struggling with my mental health to a point where I barely left home before it happened, and I had no health insurence and in my state of mind could only focus on the potential bill that could come with getting tested when I didnt even have enough money at the time to feed myself regularly. To say I was struggling would be an understatement. And if you have worked in the healthcare industry or had a potential exposure before you know that it can take up to 6 month before certain things show up. Hopefully I will have my results in the next two days. So getting ready for the appointment I did everything I could to destress and take my mind off of it. I had to fight the urge for days before that to call and cancel my appointment. And when I went to set my alarms to get up to go I allowed only enough time for myself to wake-up, shower, and go to the appointment. I knew if I had any time that morning to think about it I would find a reason to not go. So yesterday my alarm went off and after a quick shower I made it just in time for my appointment and after a brief 3 min wait I was being taken back to the room. If you have ever been to a Gynecologist I am sure that you know the drill. The nurse will talk to you and give you a gown and a sheet. If you are lucky and go to a Gynecologist like mine then they are made of actual cloth but if you are unlucky you get the horrible paper gown and paper sheet. Then you strip down and put on the gown and cover yourself with the sheet. Then the doctor comes in, checks your brest for lumps, feels your abdomen, and then starts the process of the pap smear. I will not go into much detail here because it sucks for all of us who are born with a vagina. The cold speculum, the scrapping, the general vulnerability. But this is not the part that triggered me. Now I am not your average person with average experiences. I am heavily involved in my local bdsm community. And being involved in this community and going to parties has over time made me extremely comfortable with nudity. I will walk through a room of 50+ complete strangers in nothing but my underwear. I will stand proudly naked in front of these same people to do a scene and not even bat an eyelash. But laying back on that table with a doctor peeking under a sheet makes me feel incredibly more vulnerable than standing naked in front of strangers. When I was younger I was sexually abused by a family member. And I think that my discomfort with this setup starts there. The abuse was never out in the open like standing naked in front of a crowd. No. It was sneaky and quiet. It was done under covers with them peaking and me just trying to hide my shame at the time. I was so convinced that it was something I deserved. I now know that I was wrong. But the point is that the way the doctor carefully works under the sheet to perform the task does not sit well with me. It is triggering and makes me extremely uncomfortable. If the sheet had not been there I could have mentally processed it as a medical procedure instead of it relating to bad past memories. Next year I will talk to my doctor about the ability to forego the stupid sheet. Im not really sure if that would weird him oit but oh well...I ha e to take care of me."

My girlfriend ( were both 16) self-harms pretty regularly and she hasnt clearly told me why. Being the only one that knows about it, not only am I really worried about her but I feel the responsibility to save her from this. I actually had been suffering from self-harm due to self-hatred and obsession until recently, so I understand why she would have the urge to cut herself but the reasoning is still unknown to me since she hasnt given me an explanation and I know she doesnt hate herself. Whenever I open up the topic she gets really uncomfortable and pushes me away by saying that the situation is only about her and is really insignificant, that she knows it will be over when she grows older. She acts like she doesnt care about anything people say to her and does not like to display sadness. Ive told her that it is okay to show vulnerability and Ill always be there for her, yet she still hasnt opened up to me for months and it concerns me that Im the only one that knows about this. Ive sorta threatened to tell other people but it didnt feel healthy so I let that go. Ive also suggested therapy but she says its not necessary. I cant think of any way to let her open up to me, and Im really worried about her. What should I do? Thank you so much for your attention and have a great day!"

This paranoia results in me not trusting people. Im in a relationship but have this feeling like Im being cheated on. Heres why: She wanted to get back on a dating site (its where we met) but only because of this promotional offer and said we could take the promotional money and have a nice date with it. I was hesitant but ultimately said ok. She said to set my parameters to a certain range so I could find her and then wed have a quick back and forth then set up a date to make it look believable so if the app needed to verify. So we did that and never heard any response from the app. After a week or so I asked if we could delete it. She said ok and then had trouble deleting it. She wasnt sure if it could be deleted while on pause and so it took me showing her how to do it before she could delete it. She is a tech savvy person so this doesnt make sense. Also it took me asking more than once. She didnt want to delete it initially because we hadnt heard back from the site about the promotion. Also, a family member of mine had surgery and I wasnt feeling good to go out and do stuff. I wanted to stay in. She went to a party a friend of hers threw and said she wouldnt be there long. Said she picked up wine called Mnage a trios and said she would FaceTime me later. I never heard from her, fell asleep, and woke up to a text saying she lost track of time. Mnage a trios makes me suspicious because she used to date a girl, early in our relationship she seemingly out of nowhere asked how I felt about threesomes, and so this just feels way too coincidental. Shes going on a climbing trip in a few weeks with 2 guys and one of the guys girlfriends. Due to the type of climbing it is I wouldnt be able to participate since thats not my skill set. When were together and when we talk shes very comforting and sweet and assured me to trust her. She says she loves me. Shes very nice and she knows Ive had bad relationships in the past but that I need to trust her. She says I can lean on her. I feel like I can but my past makes that hard sometimes. I have felt rushed to make big life decisions with her (weve been together little over a month but were both older so maybe later in life relationships move quicker?) and I have pushed back saying its hard for me to make those decisions and I feel pressured. She backs off and says she doesnt want to make me feel pressured. I dont know, sorry if this is all over the place but I just feel like Im being super paranoid but I also feel like I have cause for concern. Am I just being too paranoid or is my emotional/mental health vulnerability being taken advantage of?"

Their instagram consists of sunglasses and selfies, the whole world could be falling apart, but they always find a nice picturesque spot for a quick photoshoot. Fear or the slightest some level of emotional vulnerability is blocked out. They could be in quarantine, but still make an effort to find a lock-in possibly open to sneak in and quickly get out with several cans of beer. And then you have others, who are unafraid to write down their emotions on social media, even if it means being exposed to strangers. They slip in some subtle warnings, criticism, political commentary, concern for people from another corner of the world and signs of distress and, occasionally, some nice photos. I fall more into the second category, but I have a hard time getting into the minds of the first ones. What is it like NOT to care?

I could always feel what other people feel. The worst part is that I get connected to people and they connect to me. For example, I wanted to drink something but I didnt say anything (I didnt even look at that bottle) and that guy handed me a bottle of water. Some time later I wanted to hug him, but he hugged me first. I also remember we sat at his place in silence. He didnt seem sad. And at that exact moment I thought how beautiful it could be to see a man crying. Beautiful- because he trusts you so much he can show you his vulnerability. And at this moment he started to tell me about his father and how he abused his mother. And then he started to cry. I was really shocked because how could this be possible? And its always like that with dudes who I really like and they like me. But the thing is I met someone who i connected to on a very weird level. Whenever Im happy hes anxious. Whenever hes happy Im anxious. And the worst part is, the happier he is, the worse my anxiety gets. Its so scary. I dont want to depend on that persons feelings! How do I get out? I tried dating some people but they dont really attract me I dont like them and the dont like me. How do I disconnect?"

Rest assured I have no desire to die, but this is a daily thing and I want it to stop, and don't know how to convince myself. Everything is a debate or an argument for me, including when my opponent is myself, and I don't have sufficient counterpoints to win. I won't blame you for skimming, and I've provided a **TL;DR** near the end. I think it started when I met one of my friends. He used to be abusive (he isn't anymore and feels endlessly remorseful about who he used to be and has improved, he isn't a concern currently, so for now I'll be talking about what he did in his old state that is now gone.) Before that point, I remember being very open, expressive, and loved what I made. Which, for reference, is art, writing, and characters. To all of my friends, I was still emotionally open and would make comments about how much I loved/valued them, would comfort and support them, etc. I really looked up to my abusive friend specifically, because he seemed very 'cool.' Collected, alluringly distant, and an amazing sense of humor. So I ended up becoming very attached to him. However, he was remarkably judgmental of my interests and would frequently shame them and me, for example putting down my preference of drawing animals instead of humans, putting down my non-human characters as inferior to his, dismissing the games I liked, etc. But still I think I was fairly happy and open, just not so much with my interests, which was fine at the time; his personality otherwise was enough to outweigh that caveat. Well, one day he suddenly logged off of our primary platform. Me, bubbly and unaware and wanting to hang out with my best of friends, as well as figuring it was a joke of sorts since our friend group would sometimes tease each other by blocking or leaving and then coming back I messaged him on another platform, playfully teasing him while expressing my fondness for his company. His reply was seething, declaring me annoying and instructing me to not bother him anymore. Not just for that message, but in general. I know and acknowledge that this is a fairly minor thing that *really* shouldn't have had much of an impact, but regardless of how unreasonable or disproportionate my reaction was, it happened. Being directly told that I was unbearably annoying by someone I looked up to as much as I did, in a moment where I was completely vulnerable and expressing nothing but my affection and appreciation for them, wounded me and made me completely shut down and change as a person. I would hide everything about myself, from my feelings to my interests, to make everything all about him. Whatever he was interested in would dictate the current topic, and my interests (that I was open about) could only be related to his, because I could be confident that they didn't bore or annoy him. I stopped showing him my art and characters out of internal shame, and would change or deflect the subject ifever he brought them up. I would never initiate conversation with him and would instead wait for him to come to me, out of fear of annoying him and losing his friendship. It all became a mask of sorts that I had to don around him and the other people in that friend group. What further exacerbated this problem, is before him I had another childhood friend who I often talked to and had known for several years. She had her issues as well as I, but we were open with each other. Around the time I met the abusive friend, she had to cut contact for months due to an array of troubles at home. So with the loss of the one friend I could be myself around, I had to wear the mask almost all of the time; there *were* no other friends to get a break with, or talk to. Over time I got more comfortable in the mask than outside of it; being secretive, aloof, and mocking the concept of expressing affection was becoming second nature. So much so that when my childhood friend *did* finally get to contact me again, I had changed too much, and we couldn't relate anymore. Where we used to be happy, bubbly, and open with each other, I now had the ingrained instinct to be distant and dismissive. We've never had a significant conversation since before she left. Years of upholding this attitude passed. I'd say it became first nature. I found that being distant protected not only my interests and feelings, but everything. As long as I was numb and unfeeling, as long as I never acknowledged emotion, I would never be hurt. I learned to divert any thoughts of sadness or other negativity to the point where they never appeared to begin with. To my friends and to myself, I had become the cool, collected, amusing, and alluringly distant friend who never lost control, had a great sense of humor, and never bothered anyone. And thus was the reputation I had to maintain, I decided. To admit anything else would be taken as weakness. But a lot of time has passed, and I've come to notice some things and changes. Where this was originally a mask that I could take off and relax from, it seems to have become stuck, so to say. Even anonymously, even among people who have no idea who I am or was, the defenses I've built for someone who's no longer a concern remained. I have new friends, now. The formerly abusive one is the only one who stayed with me out of that old friend group, and he's changed. Even he has discarded his cool facade in favor of opening up to me about all of his troubles, spending long nights talking and crying to me about everything, being completely vulnerable. But even seeing this display of full and complete trust in me to not judge him or strike when he was weak was not enough for me to lower my own defenses. I simply can not fathom the idea of trusting someone else to offer this same service to me that I did to him, and I can not bring myself to be openly supportive or emotional, even when it's absolutely needed. One night, I thought he had taken his own life. I cried to myself in secrecy, *but even that was not enough for me to say something supportive or show emotion to him*, which I did berate myself plenty for. The eternal suspicion and defensiveness affects everything that I say and think. I'm always worried that I'm being played for a fool, lured into a false sense of security or safety just to be suddenly wounded. And in a way, my mind felt justified in it's caution, because he *didn't* kill himself, as he revealed a few days later. *If I would have dropped the defenses and shown vulnerability then, I would have been made a fool of*, my mind decided, despite how absolutely stupid and selfish that is. My new friends are a stark contrast to myself and the old friend. They're open about their troubles and their support and their emotions and their interests. They show off their creations confidently, and what they make is so amazing and inspirational to me. They're fun and caring, and don't judge me beyond a little playful teasing, which we all do to each other in good fun. But even then, knowing this, even knowing that they admire and appreciate what I do show, even knowing they care about me as a person, I still can not be wholly open, either with my feelings or with my interests. I would never say what I just said about them to them directly. To do so would be making myself vulnerable, and I can't bear the thought of being wounded again. I have to nearly force myself to show off anything I'm invested in, whether it's media or what I've made. And when I do show it, I still have to act dismissive and distant from it, out of fear of them thinking what I love (and by extension, me) is stupid, worthless, or otherwise not up to their standards. Furthermore, I still can't offer my friends emotional support. Albeit weathered, the defenses and worries remain, and over time have even festered into all new creatures. Recently, three of my friends met up together. As other than this all of our connections are online, this knocked out three people I often spoke to as they were naturally more occupied with enjoying each other's company for the duration of their visit, leaving me with an unusual amount of alone time to think. From this experience I've discovered a few things. * I rely very heavily on my friends, which conflicts with the aloof attitude that suggests otherwise. * This is because I evidently require at least daily social interaction with someone in order to distract myself from my own mind. I think this is due to a formed habit/reliance from usually talking to someone for lengthy periods every day (between having a sizable friend group and most of them, and myself, enjoying very long VCs.) * When given too much time to think and nothing to think about, I will turn on myself. Unless expressed or released in some way, these thoughts will persist undeterred and distract me from all other tasks. As I mentioned, I used to be very good at diverting negative thoughts. It became so normal that it was no longer a conscious effort. I think either the 'dam' has broken, or I've simply fallen out of practice, because I can not seem to shelf the negative, paranoid thoughts that are now plaguing me. In fact, they seem to be becoming more aggressive, coming right back the moment I'm alone and not occupied by a task that requires **all** of my focus. Now not only am I assaulted by fears about what could happen ifever I was vulnerable around anyone, regardless of how unfounded, but by fears of being left behind. Because of all of my issues, my mind's newest worry is that I'm perceived as an extremely dispensable person. I don't show any of what I'm invested in, I don't initiate conversations, and I don't make super personal connections, and I'm just not very interesting all-around compared to some of my friends. The biggest thing I provide is humor, jokes, entertainment, and distractions. My mind is trying to convince me that now that my friends are starting to meet with each other and are extremely happy with each other, I will ultimately be deemed boring and repetitive, and left behind by all of them. Being left alone means alone with my mind, which is a thought that sickens me, as it would mean a constant battering of paranoid thoughts without distraction unless I can re-train myself to divert them. These two worries conflict; the fear of being left behind and dismissed, and the fear of forming attachments and being hurt again, and the constant internal argument between them is wearing me down. I know that being hurt is a part of life, but I'm terrified of it. I desperately long to lower the defenses, stop worrying, enjoy what I love openly and happily, and trust my friends; it's all the most appealing thing I could think of. But the fear of someone I admire, including my friends, dismissing it as worthless, or hurting me when I open up to them again, shatters me instantly. I've posted a piece my writing before- a very, very personal, emotional piece that I was even proud of- and had an idol of mine just *jokingly tease* that it gave them secondhand embarrassment, and even that *still* destroyed me all over again. I'm extremely frail but have the reputation and front of being tough, and I don't know what to do. I just want to be able to relax, trust, and truly enjoy what I make, but I'm always stopped by my own paranoia. I've started entering a loop of deciding what I make is never good enough for me to show off, and I just keep scrapping and remaking it. I can't even *force* myself to begin to extend beyond or open up my defenses; I've tried when I'm anonymous and have no risk to my existing connections or persona, and even then, I just can't, no matter how much I want to. I don't know how to do anything without feeling unbearably awkward, embarrassed, or uncomfortable. **Tl;DR**: Way too overly worried about being ridiculed, which prevents me from being confident and comfortable in what I make, as well as paranoid about being hurt for being vulnerable, despite both of these fears being unnecessary in my current surroundings. No idea how to get over them and move on. Frustrated, tired, sad. Any input is welcome. Some notes: * Seeking any professional help is out of the question. Other my own obvious unwillingness to be vulnerable, I'm trapped with very unsupportive parents who are entirely in control of my situation for reasons I don't want to get into. Any solutions or advice should ideally be things I can do on my own. * ""Just do it, it'll be fine"" is an appealing thought, and one that I've tried. The fear physically overwhelms me, and I stop and retract into the tried-and-true safety net. I know that I shouldn't, but knowing it and doing it are two separate things, apparently. This also goes for things like ""just break through and talk to your friends."" * ""Just do what you like and don't worry about what others say"" is also an appealing thought. That's what was going through my head when I put my heart and soul into that written piece and had it be insulted by someone I idolized. This is all-around a difficult thing for me to do, it seems, as this is the approach I've tried and failed several times. I see what my friends make and can't help but find it so much more interesting and better-made than my own crafts, thus the shame and paranoia comes back, and I go back into the safety net. * ""Your new friends will definitely not act like the old one."" I know. I believe it. But again, the fear never completely leaves, and if I try to put all of my trust in them, it will overwhelm me and pull me back again. * ""Talk to the one who originally hurt you."" It was *so* long ago, and he already feels bad about who he used to be and what he's done, I don't want to make him feel even more guilty by opening up about how he seems to have caused all of this to his longest, closest friend. He's diagnosed with mental illnesses and suicidal tendencies, so I don't think this is a productive venture. * ""This is all incredibly minor and it's dumb that you're worked up over it."" I know, and I've tried to tell myself that, too. Mind can't seem to trump matter here, which is part of where my annoyance and frustration comes from, since I can usually logic my way out of issues like this. Even now as I force myself to post this, I find I'm bracing for someone to say I'm stupid, haha. I may indeed be stupid, but I'm in this situation regardless and also getting desperate. This is the only way I can think of to get some external input to perhaps sway the argument and ground my mind."

The human brain can come back from most anything with the right support system and treatment, but how do you change a personality? Being tossed from one lap to another, to people who didnt love me in homes that didnt want me taught me that theres no such thing as safety, shelter or consistency. Ive moved 25 times in 27 years, never staying anywhere for more than three years at a time. Ive had so many guardians that I cant even put a name or face to most of them. I only had two or three years with both parents in the picture at the same time, but I cant remember that period at all. In the few years that I was in my parents custody, I was abused, neglected and taken advantage of. In terms of friends, no one sticks around for very long. I used to blame myself Im the common denominator, after all. Now, Im not so sure. I still feel 15, incapable of forming attachments with the knowledge that, one day, they will be gone. I try to enjoy them while they last, but theres this constant feeling of, is this it? Is it over? Home to home, program to program, school to school. Nothing is consistent. How can you call it a personality disorder when its a learned behavior? Am I introverted, antisocial and prone to mood swings due to a chemical misbalance, or was I just raised to keep problems to myself in lieu of a beating, screamed at, or face having to be moved again? Am I afraid of intimacy and vulnerability because I have a diagnosis, or is it due to growing up alone with company and isolation being used as a weapon to manipulate? Am I quick to give up on people because Im toxic and black-and-white thinking, or have I just learned that when people are hurt or upset, run and hide before they can hurt you back? I know there is something very wrong with me. Healthy minds dont think the way I do. But Im trying. Im working my treatment and taking care of myself to the best of my ability. But not matter how much I work on my mental health.. you cant really change a personality, at least not to the measures it would take for me to be in a normal place socially. Its too late for that shit. I just wish that people would understand that while, yes, I do struggle with my mental health, I also just wasnt raised around people, or to be a person. I dont know how. Im sorry."

There are several different types or categories in the spectrum of emotional abuse. These include: intimidation and threats, excessive criticism, undermining, emotional blackmail, and economic abuse. &amp;#x200B; **Effects** There are various effects of emotional abuse, depending on the duration, severity and vulnerability of the victim. * Fear * Anxiety * Depression * Long-term emotional abuse can have long term debilitating effects on a persons sense of self and integrity. * Research shows that emotional abuse can sometimes be a precursor to other forms of abuse such as physical abuse. * Higher than average rates of alexithymia, which is difficulty identifying and processing their own emotions. * Marital and relationship dissatisfaction. &amp;#x200B; **Tip 1: Self-compassion** Self-compassion is when we extend compassion to ourselves regarding feelings of inadequacy, failure, or suffering. Kirstin Neff, associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin's department of educational psychology, believes self-compassion has three main components: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. * **Self-kindness**: Self-compassion entails being warm towards oneself when encountering pain and personal shortcomings, rather than ignoring them or hurting oneself with self-criticism. * **Common** **humanity**: Self-compassion also involves recognizing that suffering and personal failure is part of the shared human experience. * **Mindfulness**: Self-compassion requires taking a balanced approach to one's negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated. Negative thoughts and emotions are observed with openness, so that they are held in mindful awareness. Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, receptive mind state in which individuals observe their thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or deny them. Conversely, mindfulness requires that one not be ""over-identified"" with mental or emotional phenomena, so that one suffers aversive reactions. This latter type of response involves narrowly focusing and ruminating on one's negative emotions. If you are being hard on yourself, or you believe that you dont deserve compassion and forgiveness, then a good tip is to imagine you are caring for a close friend, family member, or other loved one. &amp;#x200B;  For the full version of this post, which includes more tips, and some inspirational quotes, go here: [How to heal from emotional abuse](URL"

It's like I have no one to actually discuss with. Especially with my particular personality. I can't talk with my parents because my father is sort of a manly guy, from a country where men don't talk about their feelings much, our relationship is more like two male coworkers than father and son, we talk about sports and current events and sometimes my university work. I've been much closer to my Mum but whenever I used to tell her about how I'm feeling she would end up making me feel guilty, she'd end up crying and saying I'm scaring her when I told her I was feeling suicidal so I just pretended I was okay. I can't talk to my younger sisters as although the one closest to me is quite mature. I feel as their older brother I need to be more protective and not show them how damaged I'm feeling, I need to be stronger. I can't talk to my friends about it cause I feel so ashamed I don't know why. It took me a year to even tell one of my closest friends anything that was up with me at all. I feel as the sort of ""cocky funny guy"" of the group, showing vulnerability will just make them think less of me. I even can't even muster up the courage to commit to any of help I need to recieve, such as therapy, I thought my friends would find out so I stopped going, I've been to many mental health helplines and online outlets and I always give a fake name cause I don't want it to be traced back to me. I have made multiple posts on this very subreddit but I always delete them after a few days. I can't help it but Idk why, I'm so goddamn ashamed of how I feel Anyone else feel this way as well?

I took stimulants (adderall, ritalin, Vyvanse) to combat the ""ADHD"" but none of them helped. They all made me feel emotionally good, jittery but never focused. I realized that the diagnosis was wrong. I took what was prescribed and occasionally took more because of my cognitive issues (easily distracted, forgetful, emotionally unstable). Now my brain is complete shit to the point where I can't read a sentence without getting confused or rereading it 10 times. I took Prozac and it made my depression significantly worse. It made me sleepy almost all day. I'm taking Zoloft now but they're also making me extremely tired. The anxiety is minimized but my depression seems worse on antidepressants. My mood swings are intense. I go from having suicidal thoughts to happiness in minutes or hours. It fluctuates constantly throughout a day, but my baseline is depressed. I have a lot of internal anger at the world and myself. I think people are not genuine and do things because it's the right thing to do. I never believe what anyone tells me. I feel jealous and sadness at everyone doing significantly better than me. I also feel jealous of people having better childhoods than me, or having supportive homes, or just being normal. Sometimes, when I get a pinch of validation I think I'm the shit and feel better than everyone else. When I get slight criticism I shut down completely and have a hard time letting go of what caused me to feel this way. My thinking can be black and white because of my mood swings. I have a boyfriend, and he does everything he can to show me his affection and love, but sometimes I don't believe him at all. I have these weird thoughts that he doesn't love me. He's embarrassed by me and only loves me because I was the first girl to reciprocate feelings for him. I avoid him most of the time and act passive. I hate that I act this way because I really am in love with him. Sometimes showing affection and expressing that vulnerability is difficult for me. Sometimes I am extremely in love with him. Other times I question everything about us. I isolate myself socially and avoid people all the time. I never speak to anyone in class because I feel weird. My thoughts, actions, and behaviors don't feel like me. Sometimes they feel foreign to me, like my body is on autopilot and I do things automatically without being aware of it. I act differently with different people because of my fluctuating self-esteem/idenity. I catch myself mirroring other people's traits because I don't know what normal is. I understand it's not normal. I always feel like people can see through me. This is amplified when I become mute. My thoughts sometimes feel blocked. This makes me anxious, which is when I become extremely timid. I rarely say a word when I get like this. I feel awkward and my social anxiety amplifies. Nothing is spontaneous. I have to think about everything hard before I do, think or behave a certain way, and even when I do, it feels ""not me."". I have a hard time making eye contact. Before it was never a problem because I wasn't aware of it. Now I just stay in my dorm most of the time and never socialize. I feel high all the time, but the kind of high where you feel high but don't feel any pleasure. Everything is just hazy all the time, 24/7. I forget everything easily. I have absolutely no friends. I feel empty and lonely being in college. I feel stupid. I know this isn't me, but is it? This is more of a rant. I did seek out medical advice. I'm just waiting for the appointment. Has anyone experienced this? I don't wanna flunk ANOTHER semester of college (first year) and be lonely. This feels different than anxiety and depression. Any advice/tips/experiences with types of therapies/medications? Thank you for anyone that read this."
58,vulnerability,mentalhealth,A letter to everyone who's afraid,1,f3b15v,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/f3b15v/a_letter_to_everyone_whos_afraid/,2020-02-14 01:49:12,"Dear stranger, When was the last time you actually told someone how you were doing, when they asked you? I mean a proper descriptive answer, not in a meme or an emoji. We both know those are just cop outs. I mean sharing an actual feeling  something youre afraid of, something youre proud of. its been a really long time since I shared a feeling, so here goes. When I look back at my life in 2017, I remember feeling weak. Whether it was work, or big life decisions, or even the humdrum daily chores, I just never seemed to have sufficient energy. I had no idea why. I used to wake up for work feeling tired. While showering a haphazard list of things to do for the day used to weigh me down one by one faster than the water itself. I got stressed out every time my Uber encountered a teeny bit of traffic, or got a pick-up on pool, which was pretty much everyday. By the time I even started work, I felt defeated by life. Back then, I did not articulate it like this, it all just felt fuzzy. It is easy to get carried away and bogged down with a simple google search on not feeling okay. It is easy to read up on a host of diseases and disorders and find patterns and similarities to your own life. And thats exactly what I did. There is a much simpler explanation of how I felt about all this, all of 2017  I lived in constant fear. * Fear of being late * Fear of being unworthy of love * Fear of failure at work, and making mistakes * Fear of dissent from coworkers * Fear of being alone * Fear of traffic Theres a lot more to this list, both big and tiny. The bottomline is, every day I was engulfed by fear. It was the very thing I breathed, and it was choking me in a way that would put Delhis air to shame. In what little I have understood about life, there is nothing, nothing that makes you weaker than being possessed by fear. I dont mean the kind of fear you feel before a big meeting, or when you see a lizard. I mean the kind that is your reality everyday. I find it easier to understand it fundamentally than words like stress or anxiety  which are rooted in fear themselves. I found this perspective useful, because with fear I understand what I need to do  face it. What the fuck does one do about stress and anxiety anyway? If a batsman in cricket is afraid of bouncers, what can he/she do? Play in a country where bouncers are illegal? Request bowlers to be kind to him and consider it good sportsmanship? No, there is no running away. Every time this batsman will walk out, every time a fast bowler runs toward him, the bouncer will be his worst fear. There is nothing unnatural about this. All players have weaknesses as all people do. Nobody is fearless by default -what separates one from another is whether they run towards it or away. So what does a good player do? He practises. He choses to get peppered with fast bouncers everyday. In the games, maybe he will get hit in the head the first ten times. Maybe next twenty times he gets caught out. But sooner or later, when he has faced those bouncers enough, the fear will subside. Instead of being filled with dread, he will actually wait and see what kind of ball he is facing, and play them better as well. Therea a story I love about Cristiano Ronaldo. He once lost at Table Tennis to Rio Ferdinand, and was quite upset. In fact he was so upset that he got his cousin to buy him a table, practised for two weeks at home, then came back and beat Rio in front of everyone. I hit rock bottom a year ago, and didnt really think I would ever come back from that. I thought Id just be a vegetable for the rest of my life. I didnt want to get up from bed, or even smile. Both confidence and motivation were non existent. It still gives me shivers to recall those days. But Im still here. I have found strength that I never believed I had, and am a very different man compared to 2017 &amp; 2018. And that is not something you just buy from Amazon. When you stop blaming the world for your mood/condition, you start taking responsibility. When you take responsibility, you start taking actions. I recognised my demons and resolved to face them in any way I could. I am still afraid of a great many things, but that doesnt get in the way of life nowadays. Of course, it all may come crashing down tomorrow and I might hit a new rock bottom  but Im really proud to have made it this far. So if youre feeling inexplicably low, try writing down some of your fears connected to this feeling. You dont need to ask anyone whether you need meditation, whether you need therapy/counselling, whether you need a self-help book. If you think something will help tackle even one item in your list, just go for it. If it helps, great. If it doesnt, you can strike it off the list. I find it calming to realise that we will never run out of things to try. And make no mistake, doing things is you waging war on your demons. It is not a matter of finding the perfect weapon, it is a matter of you choosing to attack. There would be many people who would say writing this was a bad idea, and how projecting such vulnerability damages my image. Dont let these people come in the way of you and your feelings. We are not the images we post or the shoes we wear. This naked vulnerability is what connects us all. This is who we are. Of course, you dont need to post it publicly either  but this is who I am."

Just a word of caution: Many of these mental health apps have dodgy privacy policies and are usually founded by people that have no business running a healthcare business let alone a vulnerable space like mental health. They have very cynical views or privacy laws and everything is a monetizable activity even sharing your innermost feelings that you might not even share with your family. Caveat Emptor!"

I don't know what's wrong with me but even in some of my relationships I just wouldn't care about the girl. I don't know it not like I feel emotionless its more like I feel as if I'm never trying to achieve anything and am satisfied with whatever I have even when I shouldn't be. to be clear I don't wanna hear the same everything will get better or put yourself out there I've made efforts and it's just never simple with people humans we have to overcomplicate things with meaningless gestures and bald-faced lies. You're brought up as a child believing in absolutes when in the real world there are no absolutes left is right and right is left what's the point in living a sitcom life where the situations are not easily fixable and there is no sense of truth to one's character. I lie to everyone like its a game of poker and even, in the end, I'm not willing to show who I am not because of the fear and vulnerability but of the realization that I don't really care about everyone even if I present myself as a clown so people won't know that I only act as the clown so they can't see me for my true role an observer of people. I don't want to sound as if I'm psychotic because I'm not it's just I'm very sparing in my own connection with emotions towards others.

Im currently suffering from insomnia (never thought that would happen) searching my soul to finally turn my brain off and sleep.

64,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Sometimes I wonder if the abuse was in my head,1,fcpmfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fcpmfm/sometimes_i_wonder_if_the_abuse_was_in_my_head/,2020-03-03 16:05:04,"Every single day, after class, I would sit on the bed in my dorm room and attempt to do my homework. It was hard to focus. I would start to get anxious because I knew that being alone in my room meant one of two things; that he would be coming over soon or that he was mad at me. I dont know which one terrified me more. It was my first semester of college, and I was supposed to be having the adventure of a lifetime. I was studying abroad, as a first semester freshman: a challenge only about four percent of American college students take on. While I had my whole life and endless possibilities in front of me, sometimes I struggled because it felt like I lost everything. I grew up on the same street as my entire family. I went to a high school that fostered the growth of community. My nearly three-year-long relationship ended days before I hopped on the transatlantic flight to Europe. No matter where you go to college, in America or abroad, the first few weeks are all about meeting people. I introduced myself to many people and I befriended my roommates, a couple of girls from orientation, and my neighbors. He lived in the apartment next door: room 104. We had some mutual friends who introduced us, and from the moment I met him, I found him ignorant and insulting. He told me that studying abroad for your first semester was a waste of time. He talked about how he got exceptionally high SAT scores. He went on and on about how he got into Cornell, but in spite of all of his bragging and criticism, the fact was that we had ended up in the same place. At the end of our conversation I figured I would never have to see him again, but before I left, he asked, hey, can I have your snapchat? You know, just in case we never see each other again. Reluctantly I gave it to him. I mean, what was the harm in giving a neighbor my snapchat? In fact, it made me feel wanted: a feeling I had been craving since my break-up. He started snapchatting me constantly. I had never been one to keep up snapchat streaks or even use snapchat as a primary method of communication, but his messages were frequent. My first few weeks in Rome were filled with small adventures. I adjusted to the culture, the food, my new surroundings, and my newfound freedoms. On one particular alcohol-filled evening, I received a message from him saying are you drunk? and I, oblivious, replied, yeah. Within seconds he responded, can I come over? This was my very first red flag, and while his comment definitely sobered me up and spooked me, I ignored it and decided to move on. My closest friends told me to stay away from him. They had valid points, but I didnt listen. Looking back, I should have done something then. There was a thought in the back of my head saying that I should report him or at least confront him, but I did nothing. The second red flag was when he started sending me pornographic videos and sexual memes. This sign was much more vibrant. I walked into my apartment asking, What is the actual definition of sexual harassment? and of course, with this kind of question, my roommates begged for a reason as to why I was pondering on this. My roommates, being much more outspoken, talked to him and when confronted, he chalked it all off to be some sort of joke that I was too immature to understand. This was the first time he belittled me and humiliated me in front of my peers. Still, I did nothing. Every day after my classes I would wait. He would either be sitting in my bed, waiting for me to get home, or would walk into my room. I never argued with him about being there, but I never invited him over. I was scared to tell him to leave because I did not want to face rejection again. I appreciated the attention, and although I never asked for it or implied that I wanted it, I didnt push him away. Things escalated quickly. I can remember exactly where the physical part of the relationship started. It began on the night the Red Sox won the World Series. I stayed awake to watch the game even though my time zone was six hours ahead, and he stayed up with me. I fell asleep on the couch, and even though I had told him countless times I did not want a relationship or hookup, once I fell asleep, he kissed me. I can see how he may have seen this as a romantic gesture, but the next day, the boys from the room next door started asking me about it. So, we heard that you guys kissed. I explained the situation, and when I told my friends, they found it as creepy as I did. I knew it was wrong, but I just wanted to pretend it didn\&amp;#39;t happen. I had expressed plenty of times that I still did not want a relationship, and I thought he understood that. He should have understood that. After the unconscious kiss, he started to physically take advantage of me more and more. Seeing how I did nothing when he targeted me emotionally, and not confronting him when he was doing something physically, as small as it was, he encroached more and more into my comfort zone. He started kissing me more frequently, but only when I was drunk. At this point in the semester, I was in the guilt phase of grief, and as a coping mechanism, I was going out to the bars several times a week. Whenever I would go out to drink, I would come home and he would be waiting there, in the apartment, either talking to my roommates or waiting on my bed. He started to put them under a spell, and they began encouraging us to be together. I can still remember them winking at me and leaving the room, leaving him and I together. I remember trying to communicate the dread with my eyes and hoping they would help me. One time, I was lying in my bed, head spinning because I had pushed my alcohol limits, and I remember him standing in my doorway. I slightly opened my eyes and saw the shadow of the closing door. I didnt realize he was actually in the room until he started climbing on top of me. I was barely conscious, but he was kissing me, grabbing me. He whispered in my ear, we should do this again when youre sober. Many times, I told him I wasnt interested, and then when I was drunk, we would make out again and things would get confusing. I tried giving the excuse that I had not moved on from my last boyfriend, which was true, but he never seemed to care. Multiple times I tried to end it, whatever IT was, but he would always come back, sitting in my room, refusing to take no for an answer. This should have been my warning sign, foreshadowing the things that were to come if I didnt put an end to it. This should have put me over the edge. I should have seen how the word no did not register in his mind. If I could go back in time, I would shake myself and scream, Snap out of it! Even though I knew that everything happening was wrong, and he was awful for me, I still did not want to have those lonely feelings that come in the period of time after a break-up, so I did nothing. In that moment, I figured that being loved by a selfish, hateful, pathological liar was better than not being loved at all. I gave him that consent: the consent to love me. I think that is the true danger of being in love. Once you fall in love once, you are addicted. You crave the feeling of being held, sought, or wanted. You want someone to want you. Even when you dont want them back, it is hard to tell them no, because you are grasping on to those old feelings of being in love and being loved. Little did I know, that this feeling, the feeling of running from grief, was only delaying my true pain for later. Another big red flag moment, as I am now going to call them, was the first time he ever made me touch him. He was lying in my bed, even after I had repeatedly asked him not to. The thing about him, if you had not picked up on it already, is that he is a pathological liar. He ropes you in, sharing something personal or making you feel like your opinion mattered and would be accepted. Then, he would either be a hypocrite and do the opposite of what you asked, or he would manipulate your words. As many times as I had asked him to get out of my bed, he would make me feel guilty about it. In the end, I didnt want to fight, so I would just give in and let him stay. Anyways, as I was leaving, and he jumped up and held me back. You cant leave until you finish me. At first, I thought he was joking, so I laughed and reached for the door handle, but he pulled me back. Im not joking. I have loads of stories, many similar to the previous one, that send shivers up my spine every time I tell them or think about them. But the one story that will always stand out to me is when we went to Paris. Because of recent political turmoil in France, my parents didnt want me going to Paris by myself, so I started looking for someone, anyone, to go with me. The only person available on such short notice was him. So, we booked our trip and even though I had expressed that this was not a romantic trip at all, we flew into the City of Love. Things were going great up until dinner. I have not mentioned this yet, but he doesnt drink. Im not saying this in a critical way, Im just saying this to highlight my feelings of surprise when he ordered us a bottle of nice Chardonnay at dinner. We each had a glass and after he had finished his, he announced to me that he did not like wine, and since the bottle couldnt be taken to-go, I should drink as much of it as I could. I did not finish the entire bottle, but for a lightweight, I did drink a large portion of it, and started feeling the effects on the drive back to the hostel. In my woozy state, he guided me into the elevator. I was certain he was taking me back to our room that we were sharing with two other strangers, but suddenly we were on the abandoned rooftop floor, and I was being pushed against the wall. He was kissing me, grabbing me, hurting me, and I was confused. The room was dizzy, and my eyes searched to find one thing to focus on. My brain was not processing what was happening. I started moving my arms, waving, hoping someone could see. I am a strong girl, physically, and I would like to say emotionally- though after reading this story you may not believe I am the latter- but in my drunk state, I could not find the strength to fight, so my body shut down. No, I said, but he kept going. He had me pinned. This was the moment that the whole semester had accumulated into. Everything that had happened between him and I before this had led to this moment, here, on the rooftop of the hostel in Paris, France. I had done nothing to stop him previously, and now it was too late. I had done nothing before. We always here the phrase, fight or flight. In reality, we either fight, flight, or freeze. My body knew I couldnt fight him off, I couldnt run, so I froze. I couldnt breathe, I couldnt see, I lacked all control. I felt nothing as his body pushed on mine. It feels like youre nothing. The next morning, I wouldnt, I couldnt, make eye contact with him. He asked me if I remembered anything from the previous night. No, I had too much wine and blacked out. Thats a shame; we had a really nice conversation. Months later, when we got back to Boston, we grew distant. There was one final encounter where I yelled at him, but not for the reasons you might be thinking. No, I did not yell at him for the sexual harassment messages and photos he had sent me earlier last semester or taking advantage of my vulnerability when I was drunk. I did not even yell at him for the incident in Paris. I yelled at him because he had stopped being my friend. All along, this is what I had wanted from him: to be someone to lean on. When he realized that this was all I wanted, and that he couldnt force his way onto me forever, he left. All of the fears I had been running from, the fear of rejection, of not being loved, of being alone, were all rushing in on me. This was the moment I realized how huge of a mistake I had made. I tried to dodge the grieving process by letting this man take advantage of me in my vulnerable state, and now I was feeling all of the natural emotions in an elevated platform. Once we had separated, and I had actually distanced myself from him, that is when the aftershock started to kick in. It began with the panic attacks. There were always triggers. They would mostly happen while I was alone in my room, but sometimes it would happen in the most inconvenient locations. It happened in the silent section of the library, when I saw one of his friends from home who also goes to our school. I had another episode when I was refereeing a volleyball match and the player looked just like him. How embarrassing it is to have a panic attack on my first day of my new refereeing job and have to lie to my new coworkers, saying that my panic attack, which symptoms include sweating and shortness of breath, was just an asthma attack. After the panic attacks started happening, I started getting nightmares. I kept having dreams that I was back on that abandoned rooftop floor in Paris. In my dreams, there was always a dizzy perspective and they always included me trying to get eye contact with the video camera. In some dreams I was paralyzed, trying to push back. Sometimes I would try to scream but have no voice. All of the dreams varied, but one thing was always certain- I couldnt break free. Another time I had a dream that I was lying on my old dorm room bed, and he was on top of me. I would try to wrestle him off, but I was pinned. When I would wake up, I always found myself in a sweat, tangled in my sheets. I booked an appointment with the University Health and Counseling Services. The closest appointment they had was in three weeks, so I scheduled it and waited while my panic attacks and nightmares persisted. Hours before my appointment with a counselor, they called me saying they would have to reschedule until next week, so I waited again. When I finally did get to meet with a counselor, I was excited to finally be able to have a full hour to talk with someone about everything. I was hopeful that I would receive coping mechanisms to try on my own. I sat down in the comfy chair in the counselors office and she handed me a clipboard. Sign this please, to prove you were here. I signed the paper, and then I began my story. As I told the woman about everything that had been happening to me, the events, the panic attacks, the restless nights, the terrifying dreams, she interrupted me. But wouldnt you say that all of this happened because you chose it? No, I mean, I guess, but- Youre looking at things from your point of view. You chose to engage with him. You chose to go to Paris. You chose to let him into your life. You cant blame him. I was confused. I hadnt even been in the room for ten minutes and I already felt belittled. I was being put back into the box that he had put me in. I was being blamed. In this counselors eyes, I was the villain of my own story. To her, I allowed all of this to happen. To her, I was overreacting, and this was all my fault. To her, and to the rest of the world, this all happened because I did nothing. Growing up, I always thought of myself as a strong woman, and even now, after all of this, I still believe that. We are always told that sexual assaults happen to girls who walk down dark alleys or wear revealing clothing. We are always taught that sexual assaults are violent and are done by people we dont know. The truth is, for a time I did care about him. After the breakup I went through before I left for Italy, I actually thought that if I ever wanted to have someone love me again, this was the price I was going to have to pay."

Im currently laying next to my sleeping gf and I feel like I cant even talk to her at all (when shes awake just in case yall thought I was stupider than I am) about how I feel because she'll think less of me, no matter how open minded she claims to be she'll think of me as lesser for showing vulnerability anymore than I do, and for all I know that lack of patience is justified. I hate this feeling of ""oh shit I need to get all of these things done!"" (writing resumes, finding better jobs, finding that last class for spring that will let me get financial aid and fulfill major reqs, stop staying over at my gf's so much and confront my home with my dad, get enough money to pay for my own phone, etc) when Im supposed to be asleep. Then in my head theres someone telling me how Im complaining over nothing and Im just overreacting because im a pussy or that Im lucky i get to worry about half of those things. Then i feel upset because I feel that for all the things my parents did, they never prepared me to be my own person or do what I want to do, and now I dont even have a feeling of want to do anything. These feelings anger me because I wanted to be an NYPD cadet, and them having a problem with me seeing a therapist in the past year makes me feel so useless. I figure maybe I can apply to be in the national guard as theyre always recruiting at my campus I just want to stop being a useless, talentless, low on the food chain, piece of shit. I could really care less what the job is if it can give me something more than what my life is with better pay and maybe even benefits. Seriously has me in a state of shock, once my parents got divorced they stopped giving a shit about me because I distanced myself from them for my own well being, my dad just gets drunk and gets bitter and goes on about how I dont appreciate him, looking at me like Im a fucking skidmark, meanwhile I have fucking classmates my age who own multiple boats and cars, already got married, and have fucking kids who get to have undivorced grandparents. Sure whatever I dont know the rest of the stories and theres undoubtedly something going on to make me more wrong and be reason for me to be more appreciative of my life, but I need to remind myself that I need to make my life better and nobody I know now wants to/ is going to help me do that, not my bickering parents or my siblings who are already figuring their lives out, not my gf since I might as well be dead to her when I enlist, and not my therapy group since Im not going to be able to have that. Nobody else got me those perfect grades busting their asses like I did, even if theyre just useless fucking numbers I know I can do the same on my bio and organic chem classes, because being a fuckup is not an option, and Once I get my degree, then what? Likely a life of underemployment and more of this feeling that keeps me awake, maybe by then Ill have the shit I was never taught figured out. Fuckit man idk anymore I have work at 6am with an hour commute so I gotta be up in 5 hours. And just in case I ever get looked up and this comes up im not suicidal or any of that shit, but it would be dope to not have to worry about any of this overrated shit."
66,vulnerability,mentalhealth,"Best friend is trying to kill himself, I have no idea what to do",1,eot57i,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eot57i/best_friend_is_trying_to_kill_himself_i_have_no/,2020-01-15 09:58:44,"One of my best friends has been really going through it ever since he went to college. Here is some information to take into account. \-Has been dating an amazing girl who is super wholesome, wonderful, smart, and comes from a loving family for about 4 years. \-He is near genius \-He comes from a family who couldn't provide the most amazing upbringing, his mom got deported to the UK when he was in elementary school, and his father was never there for emotional support. Once he got to college, he started gaining random obsessions, it started with running, he was running 80+ miles a week and basically destroying himself over this new obsession. He said he would hate himself if he didn't run. He was training for a marathon with his girlfriend, working 20+ hour weeks, and getting straight A's in university (studying computer engineering) - he would set the curve on plenty of exams. He then stopped running and gained a new addiction that was binging and purging. He (out of nowhere) started caring about his physique which was so unlike him, he always made it seem like he didn't care about what others thought of him. This became very extreme and he then became vegan (another obsession). A little bit down the road, he started cutting himself and burning himself. (I only learned of all of these issues once he returned to my home town during a break.) I asked him how his semester was and he started laughing really loud and said its been horrible i've been cutting myself nonstop and binging and purging and he showed me. I was extremely surprised because all of these issues seemed nothing like him. Of course I asked why and told him to stop, and everything that a good friend would do. He went back to school started seeing a therapist and continued to have a hard time. He started drinking a lot. (he has addiction in his genes). This continued for a long time never getting better. He broke up with his girlfriend in the beginning of his third year in college because he needed a change in his life so he wouldn't kill himself. He attempted to kill himself about 5 weeks ago and lived. He went on a 5150 hold. I helped him through this time and offered for him to stay at my place closer to our hometown.... He dropped the semester at his school and lived with me for about a week and I would look after him and try to help him obtain a new appreciation of life by having fun with me. He would break down quite a bit but he didn't want to kill himself during this period of time which was good. I finished my quarter in college and we went back to our hometown together. He started buying xanax and adderall and taking those a lot. I would always tell him not to. (a lot of the time he would take them and not tell me because he cares of my opinion a ton, in his suicide note I was one of the 4 people he addressed). New years eve I take him to a couple of parties and stuff and monitor his drinking, I also made sure he never binged (I had to take plates away from him) because he would hate himself the next day if I didn't. We go to some parties and then he goes into a girls car to hook up with her. Me and my other friends are ready to leave around 1am and we look for him and find him extremely intoxicated. Apparently he snuck more alcohol into his system when he was with this girl and took a decent amount of xanax earlier that day. He could barely speak so I took him to the hospital. I waited in the room with him for several hours and he looked really bad. The doctor asked for all of his information so I gave it to them. They asked who his emergency contact is and he just looked at me. So I am now his emergency contact even though his father is in town. He is so scared about his father knowing of all of his issues. He tells me I wouldn't understand. He says his father uses people's vulnerability against them which I wasn't surprised to hear, however I believe that if his father knew of the severity of this situation, all he would want to do is help and support. That morning once he got released, I drove him to my place and he said he was done with substances for at least 2 weeks. I was so glad. That night he did xanax and drank alcohol, and he did the next day. He is not pleasant to be around anymore and just uses me. He says that he appreciates my relationship with him and he will try to buy me things, I appreciate the gesture, but he can't buy me. About 10 days later (now) he is on his fourth day of aggressively binging and purging and cutting all over his body. He has panic attacks. He contacts every person in his contact list every night talking about his struggles, and they all come to me and ask wtf is going on with him. THE FINAL STRAW My girlfriend and I (2 years 7 months) broke up (on good terms) this Christmas Eve (\~2 weeks ago) he hit her up and they have hung out 3 times since her and I broke up. He tried to make a move on her and she deflected and left. She drove home and cried the whole way home apparently because she felt violated. I haven't brought this up to him yet because I care about his safety and don't want him to kill himself because of this but I am still infuriated. My whole family is worried about me because of this situation between my him and I, I have extended myself to him so many times. His insurance sucks and he can't get in-patient care. He gets mad at me when I say he should tell his dad. At this point in my life, I don't even care if I am friends with him, I know I could have been considered an enabler in the past, I just want him to be safe and better. He said if I told his father that he would never speak to me ever again and hate me forever. Im okay with that, its better than the current situation. But what if he kills himself because I tell his dad? What do I do? He is really harming me mentally. I can take a lot but I also have stuff going on in my life, I can't bear this weight anymore. Please help."

I don't know where else to ask, so I was hoping that one of you guys can either point me in the right direction. Maybe you know what feeling I am dealing with or what issue I am dealing with. I do see a therapist for other stuff but unless you feel what I am feeling, it's hard to relate. &amp;#x200B; Basically, my entire life feels fake. Everything, from friends, from work, from going to the gym, from playing video games, from playing sports, from my relationships, everything is fake. I don't feel a lot of emotions and I feel like a zombie most of the time. My emotions are muted and it seems like my life is just going through the motions. Every once in awhile, however, I do feel something else. I will feel this sense of despair, loneliness, a yearning for something, and vulnerability. This emotion that I feel (not sure what it's called) is probably the realest emotion I ever feel. When I feel this, I feel real and alive. Obviously it also feels shitty, and so when that emotion really hits me hard, I have a tendency to shutdown by mindlessly playing video games or something. But the thing is, I've felt this emotion my entire life. And while sometimes it causes me to shutdown, it's also the realest emotion I can ever feel and so I'm not exactly in a hurry to get rid of it, because I feel alive. Unfortunately, it can prohibit me from being productive, and, not knowing what to do with that emotion and not know what I can do to make myself feel better, I just go about my normal life. I do homework, read, go to the gym, hang out with friends, eat, etc... basically go about a ""normal"" life. But everthing I do, hanging out with friends, going to shows, etc...always has this fakeness to it. It all feels like a huge distraction and hence my entire life feels fake. &amp;#x200B; So what is going on? When i feel that emotion, what should I do? How do I feel better when I am feeling that way? Heck, what is it that I am feeling? I have never been able to find someone else the feels the same way I do."
68,vulnerability,mentalhealth,I talked to someone,1,ewka55,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ewka55/i_talked_to_someone/,2020-01-31 17:38:51,"Not very long ago I made a post here venting my frustrations and anxieties while at work. I wanted to confide in my boss, as he's a very important person to me. Today I did just that. It started with me just asking if it's noticeable that I can be moody from time to time, to which he did. I have had this conversation in my head a thousand times but as soon as he acknowledged that he has noticed something bugging me, I could barely formulate a sentence. He was patient with me and I managed to explain to him that I'm unhappy. Not with him, or work, or anyone else, but with myself and my feelings. It was absolutely one of the most difficult things I've done for myself. He waited and let me figure out what exactly I needed to say. I couldnt leave anything out because I knew when I came home I would be thinking about the things that I wish I'd said. Initially I'd just wanted to let him know that I have problems with depression, and that I hoped my mood lately hasnt been taken personally by him and anyone else I work with. I asked him what he knew or understood about depression, so I wouldn't feel like I was just being crazy. I didnt expect to tell him so much but once I started to explain my basic experiences, his willingness to understand and learn why someone can feel this way allowed me to open up more. I spent so much time weighing the thought to speak to him. I know if I kept on like this I might do something rash at work, and let my frustrations with myself get the best of me. I've already been struggling so bad this week and there aren't enough places to hide. I also knew if I told him, there would be no more hiding. If there is something wrong, he knows now. And if it turned out he wasn't capable of understanding, I might have alienated him even more. My rational mind knew he wasn't that kind of person though. I feel the oddest sense of relief and pain. The whole conversation felt like a dream. I suffer from feeling like I take life for granted, but right now I feel so fucking fortunate and lucky to have a friend like him. I am not fixed, and I'm honestly very embarrassed, but I was met with a genuine enough interaction that I didn't feel hate and frustration towards myself. He said I was considerate to come forward with this, and I believe him. So.. He knows now, and I feel this weird sense of vulnerability, but talking doesn't seem so frightening anymore. It really felt like a step in the right direction. I'm not sure how or when I'll seek professional help, but I have the support of my workplace at least, and I feel like it's a little less impossible now"

I have no fucking idea. This isnt just a panic attack. here's my best explanation. It's a feeling. Like a physical feeling. It's old. I remember first feeling it when I was sitting down on a church pew in a dress. Its...a feeling of discomfort. Theres not really easy warning signs. It happens when I'm around my family members and when I was forced to go to church as a kid. Vulnerability, fear, disgust with my own body. Suddenly my veins are alive and squirming and I want to rip my skin apart until I dont exist. Suddenly I'm hyper aware of...well. I'm hyper aware of my vagina. Literally. And my breasts. I'm scared someone is going to touch them. Or my mind is convinced that my family members are aware of the fact that I have genitals. Abd they'll touch them. Its remedied by running away and curling up in a tight ball and taking violent deep breaths in order to curb a severe panic attack. And in my head I'm saying ""I hate you. I hate you, body. I hate you."" My family members have never touched me. I was sexually assaulted by a random person when I was 14 but this feeling is younger than that. I don't remember anything traumatizing that started this. But it screws with me so bad that I sleep all day and avoid life. Anyone else or am I crazy?"

And here's the reason. I usually seem stable. I can function in my day to day life, and I don't feel my emotions really that strongly in my ""normal"" mindset. But if something unfortunate happens, or out of nowhere: I get intense, deep emotional ""attacks"" which are very hard to control. The emotions hit all at once, all my anxieties, insecurities, doubts, everything hits. My mind bounces on and on to new things to think about, to the point where I'm not sure what I am thinking about. The emotional outbursts are strong, and may seem very strong to others, so I hide them to myself. I usually get out of that hole by making a diary or figuring out my thoughts. Then my mind snaps back on the ""normal"" mode, and I forgot I ever felt pain. Like... I remember I was suffering during that episode, I might know what I was worried about, but I don't remember the feeling. I just live in this state, where I get sudden outbursts of emotions. I have always been emotionally the same. Not feeling much strong emotions, so I sometimes sabotage myself to feel strong emotions, to feel full. When I do, it's unbearable and I want to be ""stable"" again. Rarely there is any middle ground. So whenever I feel strong emotions, my mind eventually forgets them. I was apparently bullied in elementary school and came home crying often. I remember nothing about that. I can't describe my feelings after they happen, because I feel detached from them. For a long time now, I have been trying to figure out what the hell this is. I don't think I have BPD though. I don't lash out, and I definietly don't sabotage myself enough to cause damage. Sometimes in unbearable emotional pain I might bite myself, but that's it. It's just me switching between emotional stability and extreme pain and vulnerability. It's at the point where I can't tell what is exactlty wrong. I need someone to remind me what I felt, what is wrong and sometimes even remind me of who I am. It affects my perception of myself: I don't know myself. If I had to describe myself, I wouldn't honestly know, other than what I hear from others. So, can you help me? Do you have any similiar experiences, or any idea what this might be? Is this emotional numbness? Because I have been trying to figure this out for SO long, and I never seem to get any of it."
71,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Controversial Theory for Cluster B. Can any other clusters relate at all?,1,e95a1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/e95a1x/controversial_theory_for_cluster_b_can_any_other/,2019-12-11 21:12:12," Posted this in a few other places, interested to see what everyone thinks! TL;DR - I wonder if Cluster B Personality Disorders are all the same disorder, on a spectrum. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I advocate for mental illness, especially Personality Disorders. In advocating, I have talked to so many people with Cluster B Personality Disorders, and was shocked to find so many similarities in our behaviors--even when it doesn't appear to be the same on the surface. I have honestly not encountered anyone with HPD, so, I can't speak for them. I wonder if Cluster B Personality Disorders are all the same disorder that just exists on a spectrum. BPD, NPD, ASPD can all have antisocial or pro-social behaviors, they all can have high or low functioning sufferers, all can have classic or quiet symptoms, can all have vulnerability vs. grandiosity. We can all be victims or abusers, all have object permanence issues, we all seem to have an underlying trust issue, etc. For instance, most of us have issues with identifying what we are feeling, or if we are feeling anything at all. Borderlines are known for feeling such intense feelings, but there are also times when we feel absolutely nothing at all. Narcissists seem like they could go either way, be very emotional or not be emotional at all and seems like even the same person can be both. People with ASPD are also capable of feeling emotions, but not very intense, and sometimes, I think they have the same problem where they are ""feeling"" something, but can't identify it, and don't consider it an emotion or feeling. We all seem to get the edgy feelings inside us that we don't know how to identify, don't know what causes it, and we all know that we can do certain things to kind of make those feelings go away. Borderlines seem to attention-seek (which is sometimes a form of manipulation). Narcissists seem to manipulate. ASPD seems to manipulate. But it seems like some people with ASPD and NPD attention-seek through their manipulation. I think that a friend that I have with ASPD trolls online to get ""stimulation"" as he puts it, to fill that edgy feeling. I think that is almost a form of attention-seeking? I think all of us feel nothing because during childhood development none of learned to identify what those feelings were. We feel sensations instead of emotions, but have no idea those sensations are actually caused by chemical releases and causing emotions. We feel an ""sensation,"" sometimes the edginess, and we behave in a way to make that sensation go away. We never learned appropriate coping skills as kids, and never learned to identify what those feelings were to fix them anyways, so we act impulsively, without regard to others, because we just need that feeling to go away. All three PDs have the impulsive element. I think Borderline attention-seeking could be considered manipulative because we want superficial attention in those moments. We just want people to tell us they love us and they are there for us, and we move on because that shitty feeling goes away. That seems kind of manipulative. We are using people's compassion and empathy to make ourselves feel better. Because we never actually fixed the underlying problem that we were attention-seeking about, we continue to attention-seek. That's why that is such a repeated behavior. When we get real help for certain problems, we don't have attention-seeking problems in those areas. Cluster B's, I learned recently, are all known for our object permanence issues. When people aren't a constant in our lives, we tend to forget about them and our feelings for them lessen. When they show back up, it's like they never left, we feel the same way we did about them previously, positive or negative. We seem to all have underlying trust issues, which honestly seem to be what gets in our way of getting better. We can't trust anyone enough to tell them what we are actually thinking and feeling because it's so out there, or fucked up, or whatever, so we don't process that thought, and it never goes away. We never deal with it. I admitted a lot of things to my Favorite Person/partner (FP) recently, a lot about shitty behaviors I have had, and it gave me a tremendous amount of closure. He is the person I trust the most, but I still have trust issues around him. I trust him with my life, I know he would never do anything to hurt me, he is neurotypical, but I don't think I could ever just... trust him, even though I say I do. I also feel comfortable and trust him enough to ask questions about what is normal. I asked him, ""Is it normal to just not feel an emotion all the time?"" I assumed other people just always feel something, but apparently, they don't. Lol. Good to know. I asked him, do you always feel love for me? And he said he always loves me, but it's not a constant feeling. It's only when he thinks of me, or when something reminds him of me, or when I am around. I continued to ask him questions, and I figured out that my emotions, though seemingly limited and intense, aren't that irregular. Like, feeling nothing is normal. Feeling empty is not. I think the feeling empty is when there is an emotion or feeling there that we can't identify and don't know how to fix, and it's confusing for us to deal with. I think all disorders experience this on some level, but Borderlines are hard on themselves, so I think we feel empty, because we think really hard about it and dwell on it. Some NPD and ASPD folks do too, but seemingly not as much, but the ones that do seem to have feelings comparable to emptiness. Insightful and self-aware people with ASPD even seem to in their own way. Pro-social, high functioning NPD and ASPD is known for being charming and intelligent and being able to lure people in so they can manipulate them. Well, manipulation in someone with a PD is a survival mechanism from childhood development, so? Borderlines don't get the same distinction because we are vilified the same way as NPD and ASPD, but when we are in a positive, stable mood, we are very likable. We are usually all very good at making friends, we just can't keep them. Can't maintain the friendships. NPD and ASPD are labelled as calculating, but you would be about a symptom that you developed during childhood? You'd be an expert by now. You are very good at what you do. So are Borderlines. We are also good at luring people in and making feel bad for us and emotionally manipulating them to get what we want. We don't do it to be mean, we do it because we need something and don't know how to ask for it. I think NPD and ASPD is the same, but less empathy development, so it comes off as malicious. Being charming and calculated doesn't fit the victim role that Borderlines tend to take on in life, so, we don't get that distinction. I think that's interesting. Especially because I have been told by multiple people, ""Well, yeah, if you're a hot girl with childhood sexual abuse, you are probably Borderline."" Misconception, but... still, perceived to be the hot girl who can lure people in. I think that there *is* a spectrum, and there *is* different presentation, and all the genders *do* present differently, so it makes it look vastly different, but it's really not. We all do similar things for similar reasons. They just present differently. Also, you might say, well, there are certainly people out there who don't feel like I do? Who don't value the same things I do? Well, were the same things emphasized during childhood? In the same ways? Probably not. But I'm sure your disorder relates more with the people in your disorder who did. Especially the people in your category of your disorder. People who didn't have any emphasis on empathy during their childhood wouldn't have any. If they didn't have emotional development, they *would* feel less than those who did. The areas of the brain grow as be learn empathy and emotion. I reckon that we have the same disorder with different development of brain structure do to learning and experience. Some of us are very confident, some of us are not. Probably something to do with how we were treated during childhood, and then maybe even eventually how we were treated during adulthood and when we were testing boundaries, we developed new ""survival mechanisms"" that started to work in our new environment. All our behaviors are there because they work. The ones from our old environment that stopped working, we stopped doing because they didn't get reinforced. I think we are always testing boundaries because we don't always know what is acceptable, and new things wind up working. All of our behaviors have been continuously reinforced by society, even unknowingly. This isn't an excuse. We do have control over our behaviors to a point. I think we *do* loose control when we are unstable because we have poor impulse control and we can't identify what is going on because things happen a lot faster when we are escalated. But, when we are stable, we *are* able to realize what we are doing and how it affects ourselves and others. Gaining insight helps in those moments. We can't control our personality, but we can control our behaviors. I am mostly asking this because I want to raise points about trends in our behavior that mental health care professionals haven't noticed yet, to encourage research. *This* is an exceedingly long post, but it mostly made additional points. If you want to see more of what I am figuring out, then read [this](URL It's *very* long. This specific theory on Cluster B PDs is at the end. Can any of you relate to this? Or add to it? Can any cluster A's or C's relate at all?"
72,vulnerability,mentalhealth,My peculiar mental state [nsfw] long post,1,ec7wup,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ec7wup/my_peculiar_mental_state_nsfw_long_post/,2019-12-18 15:50:48,"So, first off i don't have a diagnosis on anything and i don't have people i can talk to, which i will explain later. The story near the end will becone sexual, with some explicit detail (nothing violent and only what is needed to explain my mental state tho). For context, I am an 18 year old male who currently lives in university residence away from my family. The main problems will be later in the story, but i need help in identifying what is happening to me, why and what i can do to get it out of my head. This is gonna be slightly autobiographical because this is built up of a lot of things. -Prologue (i swear this will become relevant when i adreess the problems. So i grew up in a christian home, with a loving family. I went to church every sunday where i lewrned things like: don't kill, steal and the gays are wrong, but love the sinner and hate the sin. And when i was in grade school, i was the kid who preached religion to the other kids, because i thought it would help them. This led other kids to avoiding me and i spent a lot of time alone and with very few friends. But time went on and i got older and the messages in church changed. I learned 3 bs things that would later fuck me up: 1) All sin is equally bad (being rude is apparently just as bad as murder or rape) 2) You can sin accidentally. 3) Even wanting or thinking of doing something is just as bad as actually doing it. This led to mr hating my thoughts and hating myself for my mistakes, because every accident was apparently just as bad as me raping someone, so i hated myself just as much as i would hate an actual rapist. But it wasn't just me. I hated everyone for every mistake they made. Thankfully, i never did any self harm, but i did do lots of mental torture on myself. Then, when I was 14 i stopped believing it all. But i couldn't tell my parents. And i couldn't accept that. So i was an atheist in denial for 6 months. And after that, i lied about not believing it for another 6 months, until i finally told my mother. They accepted it and i was finally able to get out of that mental state, but the damage to myself and others has already been done. I found myself alone and with a new disposition that made me want to help people. I would go into something with the intent of being a good person, but in the end nearly everybody left me. I began to feel alone mentally and later developed some body issues, mostly due to my massive acne scars all over my shoulders (this will come back, i swear). I also found that I was bisexual, which confused my christian knee-jerk reactions that i still hadn't been able to unlearn. -6 months ago (the meat of the story): So, i found some friends and things went well (i'm being a wedding photographer for one of them later this week!) And the way we would hang out is through playing D&amp;D at my house. And one of the guys needed a ride home, which i would provide. And to pass the time we would play truth or dare. We discovered that we were both bisexual and that we both found the other attractive, so when i drove him home one night, we hooked up. -The sexual part (this will get slightly graphic, but what we did impacted my psychology so it needs to be included). The impacts on my psyche also involve sex, so beware of that too. We both tentatively stripped and when he saw my shoulders, he didn't care and it didn't bother him. This made me feel more open in a way that i hadn't ever been. People weren't usually this open or accepting of me, so i started to think of this encounter as a way to fix my loneliness issues. Bad idea. But this feeling of openness got even stronger when he touched me first. We ended up touching each other. Still, i found that i was braver and i went down on him. It was a profoundly neutral experience in terms of the physical aspect, but the emotional one was good, i felt like i was helping him and, as usual i liked helping people. But he was having a hard time keeping an errection, which dissheartened me. To get a break, i asked him to go down on me, which it was immediately clear that he didn't enjoy and he used lots of teeth, which really fucking hurts. Still, i went back down on him and tried everything i could, hell i tried harder than i did on most exams. But nothing worked. He didn't do much at all for me, and couldn't keep it up for me, despite my efforts. We ended the encounter with no success. Then, a couple of days later he confessed to me that he wasn't bisexual and that he was straight. (He didn't lie to me, he just did some soul searching and realized it wasn't for him). But the damage was done. I had used that encounter to allow myself to be vulnearable and it went so poorly that he became straight. My vulnerability hurt me a lot, but it didn't hit me right away. I am still good friends with the guy and we hang out regularily. -4 months ago: The snapback: So at this point i had rescently moved into the university and for once, i had friends. It was great and it was nice to finally have a feeling of connection. Then, at a uni social event, a girl i had never met used a new friend (i didn't see her a lot, she was only in one of my classes, but she was nice to me). She used that friend to text flirtatious things to me and eventually asked to have sex. I declined, as I had never met the girl and was a little creeped out. But then, i had to leave the room fast because i began crying uncontrollably for reasons i still don't understand. But some of my other friends tracked me down and made me feel better, so the issue went away for a while. -2 months ago: Girlfriend? So a girl i was friends with became close and we started having mutual feelings. She almost asked me out and i came so close to saying yes. But the next day, i became terrified and ended the whole thing. The girl was understanding -- too understanding. Her roomate told me that she was ""heartbroken"" but never told me. She's still probing me for interest, i think she hopes i'll change my mind (i probably won't, i'm not really into her anymore). Still, around this this time, i began flashing back to the sexual encounter with the guy. They always made me unhappy, but they went away fast. -Present: the problem: The flashbacks are overpowering. The sexual encounter dominates my thoughts in an unhappy way. If i experience any sexual arrousal, it twists into memmories of that night, which i'd already considered to be a mistake. The psychological effects of it already lost me a girlfriend and caused a panic attack even at the proposition of sex. If i even think about sex it becomes a memmory. The flashbacks are so frequent that it's impairing my happiness. I'm already confused about my bisexuality, i've begun to cut it off and try to train it out just so the memmories stop. And i can't talk to my homophibic family about it, because they would kill me if i even became sexual with anybody, much less another guy. I'm becoming angry with my friends and some of my old self loathing is coming back (thankfully not much yet, but i don't want that to come back). If anybody has any tips as to what this is, why it's happening and how to make it stop, please tell me, the memmories are unhappy and constant. Should i talk to the guy about it? Would that even help? He got a gf rescently and i wonder if that's been the trigger..."

I noticed something was up when he said he loved me but would regularly ignore when I would cry myself to sleep because Id feel neglected. He now lives with me and I cannot get him to leave but I dont want him to get hurt. I broke up with him, hes still living in my house. When I try to carry on with my life he does just enough to make me feel too strongly towards him to make him leave. Ive found some of his history. Grew up in a severely abusive household. Extremely manipulative using partners long term, in atypical ways. For affection, belonging and financial gain. Impulsive with fits of rage and violence. Criminal record and activity since early childhood. Depression. Reoccurring cheating. ADHD. Mood swings. Lying and little to no remorse. I want to help him but he wont accept that anything is wrong. I have tried communicating with him about various things on multiple occasions but he dismisses me or tries to convince me Im stupid. I need him to leave, however the way Ive seen him these days is extremely concerning. I fear that if I tell him to leave he may lose control as he does not deal well with any form of vulnerability. I suffer from PTSD. Im awaiting a psychiatric assessment. He has found my triggers and uses them to get anything and everything he could possibly want from me. Im not sure if he is aware of this or doing subconsciously. I dont know what to do. What would be the least provoking way to remove him from my home or help him see that he needs to make changes for things to work if he is even capable? I live in Ontario."

Extremely important. Important enough that I believe every Human being should focus on maximizing small victories and healthy pleasure in their lives. So, I'm gonna come right out and say it. I live with major depression. (**WARNING BLOCK OF TEXT IN BOUND FEEL FREE TO SKIM ONCE YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.... I KINDA RAMBLE ABOUT MY CURRENT LIFE AND THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO GET ME GOING TL:DR AT THE BOTTOM**) She (trust me, naming your pains really helps) comes and goes as she pleases, but generally she tends to follow a pattern of intensity depending on how healthy I am in mind and body. Even at this point in my life, at this point where I would consider the past two months of it to have been the most liberating and self-awareness-boosting months of my entire lifetime, ~~(no fucking joke! I just had to edit all of this grammar down to really drive home the point I'm trying to make when i say~~ **~~LIBERATING~~**~~)~~ I **STILL** experience bouts of horrible depression. The type of depressions that numb the human in me down to a resentful and violent-minded ball of fire while ripping my body of so much of its energy that not even the fucking adrenaline can fuel me enough to move a god damn muscle. Like, scary type, ready to kill something type, like myself or a relationship or a state of mind or an entire day or sometimes even other beings type depression. Horrible stuff, and I wish it upon ABSOLUTELY nobody at this point in time. As such, I actually couldn't see *anybody* that I know personally benefiting from some of the more sinister aspects of depression, such as: |*Psychological*|*Physical*|*Both, at the same. time.*| |:-|:-|:-| |*Extended periods of hopelessness*|*Body fatigue so overwhelming it puts athletes' recovery periods to SHAME*|*Suicidal ideation* (feeling suicide physically is NOT fun)| |*Delusions*|*Entirely absent appetite*|*Persistent, intense rage.* This wreaks absolute havoc on the body. Both during and after.| |*Anhedonia*, which is the mental state where ""interest in anything, even that which you've previously loved"" is difficult if not impossible.|*Thick grease from not showering*|*Loss of interest in human connection*. Without our brothers touch we really struggle to thrive, imo.| |\^ This is a main reason that *Joy can feel impossible*|*Shocking fluctuations in weight*|*Loss of empathy towards yourself and others.* Really turns ya sour.| At the moment I run cross country and sprint for my school. I train individual muscles whenever I feel like I can. Weather permitting I practice and engage in tennis. I have cycled 50 miles, albeit before I ever experienced my devil-degree depression, with very very little rest to the point where my legs gave out on me. Whenever I lift weights or use my body I go all out. I'm no stranger to intense exercise so while I might not have been worked at a slave camp or anything, I certainly have put myself through some incredibly painful workouts. Considering, I believe exercise to be overwhelmingly beneficial for a variety of core reasons; one of the most important of which being that Humans **NEED** *some* degree of pain and suffering. I'm largely pacifistic overall but I think every human needs to hurt in order to heal. I also try my hardest to speak as much of my experience as possible when attempting to spread knowledge. I feel like experience is what teaches us the most. So, when I speak my ""sermons"" as I've been calling them lately, I always try and add in some stories and real world examples from my past. Piggy backing off of that, I've done exercise to the extent that I have been taught that there is no pain we can inflict upon ourselves during consensual, healthy exercise that can ever outmatch the physical pain, exhaustion, misery, and even suicide that we as human beings can sense on our skin and in our muscles -- from a depression or not. I might not have cracked rocks or mined ore for a whole day, but I understand nearly puking and nearly blacking out from exhaustion; Intense exhaustion, slow burning exhaustion. All of our suffering (and joy!) is totally real and totally tangible. It's also real to believe that you aren't depressed when you are. We can reach a certain point in our misery that we finally lose the last part of ourselves that cares for the Human in us. Once we reach this point I believe that it becomes very hard to feel empathy for ourselves. It becomes very hard to ever speak nicely about what we do. Or create. Or even what we think. It becomes very very very difficult to wake up, eat food, *exercise??? exercise while depressed??* (that shit seems impossible when im depressed like god cant someone just carry me to the fridge for..... haha nevermind too depressed to eat) It's not always possible to be functional during depression, either. Humanity boasts about the resilience of himself but **beneath his pride is hidden the importance of being weak.** Of being a sniveling, disgusting mess, screaming on the couch after breaking a glass or something. Like sometimes we just got so much shit in our heads that something so stupid and minor as dropping glass in our home can send us off the deep end. As such, we might be resilient in the marathon but god DAMN those blisters hurt!!!! We're pussies short term! We're weak, mushy, clumsy, and erect sacks of meat and meat-juice (blood). Of course words are gonna hurt us, our bodies are made for brain function for Christ's sakes.... As such, people can, but ***definitely*** shouldn't be able to make you *believe that you're* useless and sub-human/lesser. It's not fair to those of us who already hold that belief anyways. It's not fair to those of us who suffer, and it's not fair to themselves. Why are they okay with degrading their own sense of worth like that? Making someone's misery worse? And then watching their reaction to you, either ignoring it or missing it entirely, then living life after???? Like nothing ever happened?????????Who ever asks to hurt more? Is that even? Morally acceptable? Uh, duh? Why do I even have to ask myself this question???? No it's not fucking morally acceptable. Feeling that way is just part of the human experience, but if you regularly define your worth based on the negativity of others you're bound to succeed. Succeed how, might you ask? Well let me tell ya! **Humans love negativity!!!!!!** So much so that we can focus on it so regularly that it becomes all we talk about. So much so that the news is all about death and all of the wrongs in this world that would take hundreds of people collaborating all at once in a single group to fix. So much so that gossip even has its own dialects. So much so that there isn't a single school or a single workplace on this planet that doesn't have a human in it that bullies others. Or even *themselves*. Ever think about that? We bully ourselves all the time. Check the definition: `v. seek to harm, intimidate, or coerce (someone perceived as vulnerable)` Must I say any more? I personally don't believe we allow ourselves to be as open, compassionate, loving, understanding, considerate, gracious, honest, and/or trusting as we should be (if we care about mental health, of course! ) I have done further thinking in the past on all of these verbs **and** the subject in which all of these verbs rest under, and it is **vulnerability**. As such, I have come to the resting belief that vulnerability is one of the most important pains we must experience based off of the benefits we gain in the face of the negatives. It even seems too good to be true, as with due time it becomes second nature. It becomes necessity. A sometimes painful necessity. When interacting with truly kind people, though, I believe that vulnerability will be reciprocated and accepted. I believe everyone deserves some vulnerability in their life. I also just so happen believe that the root of vulnerability could, when involved and utilized in appropriate ways, potentially be able to create the solution to any problem we're having in this world. **And the root of vulnerability is** ***love.*** So, once you really get thinking about it, depression doesn't have to be a disease. The word disorder has already gained so much hate and controversy that it's not even worth calling it one anymore. The word **disorder** is defined in **psychology** as **a condition or state of mind that inhibits smooth functioning in every day life.** I think we have to find another word to describe this. I think we need to find a better way to communicate our pains to eachother, including those who don't suffer like we do. While we all may get depressed as human beings as it's part of life, the ""disorder"" part of MDD (major depressive disorder) comes into play when our suffering is so harsh throughout the day that we begin to lose functionality in ourselves long after we've already lost uninhibited functioning in society. I absolutely believe that there are Humans out there, myself included, who are much much more sensitive both emotionally and physically than many others are. This makes a perfect environment for pain. Add on some curious genetics and you have a recipe for Major Depression. It's this major depression that, when left unchecked, will undoubtedly knock us off our feet. If we don't realize our mistakes by then, well, best of luck to you. You'll be soon on a train to nowhere, my friend. **The horrid, absolutely revolting darkness that is inherent in all of life, Humanity especially,** ***has no bounds*** So, then, after all this, please answer me this question: If society can consider perpetual versions of Inherently Human Psychological States *(depression, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, obsessive compulsion, delusion, psychosis, etc.)* deemed inherently negative *(You know, like when people say stuff along the lines of ""How could anyone alive* ***possibly*** *benefit from something like* ***that****????)* can be considered a disorder, then **maybe its our** ***collective society*** **that's the diseased one**. Just think about it for a second. I'm not accusing anyone of anything nor am I proposing any solutions to any deep-rooted problems that exist here in our society. Society is necessary, I believe that with my whole heart and mind. Logic and emotion tells me so. But nowadays, it's pretty fucking hard to be spiritually healthy in this country; America. Let me break it down some. Some spiritual necessities, in my opinion, are.... &amp;#x200B; |Mind|Body|Spirit| |:-|:-|:-| |*Meditation*|*Meditation*|*Meditation*| |*Vulnerability*. It's soul food, and love is very important. It's how we connect with other human beings and other beings, like animals. Life is the most important thing on this planet, am I wrong?|*Raw foods*. Not many cans, cut back on packaging. Always read ingredients/nutrition facts so you know what's in what's going into your body.|*Gratitude.* To be thankful boosts our morale and teaches us what truly matters in life. We always learn as we go, and we should be thankful that we can learn in the first place.| |*Introspection/Reflection.* It's how we gain empathy, learn to solve problems, and connect with the world. Oh, and it makes us better.|*Sleep.* I say this as I write on a computer at 2:49 for the third hour straight now. We underestimate so strongly the importance of sleep on our body, mind, and spirit. If anything were to be listed under an ""All of the above"" category, it would be sleep. I'm just up so late because I'm editing this to a degree I deem comprehensive and cohesive. I want to make sense, all of this means a lot to me. Oh, and I've read this entire thing aloud to myself, as well.|*Reading, and any art consumption for that matter.* Think about it. Another human being just like yourself took their sweet time to express themselves in *language with grammar* that they have passion for, then re-read it multiple times so they could edit it for human consumption. Sounds like a recipe for purity to me!!| And some reasons it's so damn difficult to do these things could be..... &amp;#x200B; |*Inhibitor*|*Opinion*| |:-|:-| |Money|I feel like money plays a huge role in spirituality and overall human health for plenty of reasons. Pure foods are much more expensive than processed garbage I wouldn't even want to see a squirrel eating. Consumerism and capitalism sure can work together in curious ways.| |Culture|I feel like spirituality is highly misunderstood in today's world society. I'm just recently budding into my own skin but what I know for sure about spirituality is that it has *little to do with religion.* What I thought spirituality used to be for years and years was absolutely shattered once I began to experience and have faith in the largely hidden powers of this Universe. Without curiosity the Universe will never let you in, and without faith you will never come through to the other side. This is a very pseudo-scientific concept, and this society conditions us to stick to the facts. Science and research can't even *touch* certain things. Just look at the history of entheogenic compounds like True Psychedelics (LSD *(lysergic acid diethylamide)*, Magic Mushrooms *(A metabolite of psylocibin called Psylocin),* DMT *(*Any *Dimethyl Tryptamine),* San Pedro *(Mescaline, which is extracted from a certain cactus)* and so on.) These gained traction in the 40's when Albert Hoffman accidentally tried LSD in his lab after synthesizing it 15 years prior. He was simply searching for a respiratory stimulant and was granted something he believed to be truly magical. Not long afterwards the CIA began experimenting on us, some with the knowledge of it and some without, in order to see if LSD could be used for mind control. Funny enough it had the exact opposite effect. Soon after the exponential growth of love and true freedom took place in this country it was then shut down and labeled Schedule I. Only just now are we coming around to allowing *researchers* to take a look at it. *I firmly believe that we as Humanity should be legally and ethically encouraged to indulge our curiosity in a safe manner, regardless of what is considered ethical.*| It's expensive, its pseudoscientific, it's highly emotional, it's intense, it's culturally unacceptable; it's against most if not all of the models created by whoeverthefuckrunssociety that have been placed upon us in order to.......... In order to what? What is the purpose of the way this world is organized? Is it for the gain of the Collective Human or is it for the gain of the Individual? Okay, I'm getting exhausted here. I need to circle back to depression. I could go on and on with details and stories about how psychologically miserable and tortured I have been for quite a hefty length. I have suffered through so many different varieties of mental affliction that by this point I can no longer even *hope* to keep track of all of it. My memories will come in as they choose and I guess just have to live accordingly. I want to be open to my pains because they are what will ultimately aid me in my years years years long journey to becoming the truest version of myself I can be. As such, I can only summarize my suffering as such: I have suffered mental pains harsh and intense enough to bring myself and anybody not on God damned heroin down to their knees. I wear my struggles as a badge of honor because it's toughened me up into the individual I am today. They've also pounded me to a mush, making me the most soft and loving I have ever been in my entire life. Not even as a child have I loved like this. What I don't do, though, is brag about them. Thank you for reading, and thank you for sorting by new. I appreciate all of you, *especially* those who choose to leave a comment! ;) &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR - Feeling depressed and useless is just part of the human experience, but if you regularly define your worth based on the negativity of others you're bound to succeed. This is an oxymoron and I know that it is. It's a success because if you're looking for negativity you're ALWAYS going to find it. Why is this? Well, I say it in my little essay here but it's pretty simple.** ***Humans love negativity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***"

Thank you to those who have tried to help me recently. I do appreciate it. The thing is though, unless I speak up in real life to someone, can any of this really get better? It just isn't the same as posting on reddit. After every post I make, I just think of how much more beneficial it would be to reach out to someone I actually know. That's where I would really be able to take action to fix this. At the same time, I do know why I come on here. I come on here because it's not as scary. Everyone has been kind and supportive. In the real world it might not always be that way. In the real world, opening up shows vulnerability. By opening up to someone in person, their judgement actually matters to you. Whereas on here, if someone says something rude or disapproving you don't actually know them and chances are you won't come in contact with them again, so it doesn't impact you as much. I don't reach out in person because I'm afraid to bother or annoy anyone. I'm too afraid of judgement. I'm too afraid of making things awkward. Certain people in my life have an idea of what's going on, but they don't know the whole truth. They think I'm doing better than I really am. It'll probably stay that way for a while due to all of those reasons above as to why I don't speak up in person. Once again, I do appreciate those of you who have helped. Thank you"

But life threw me an unexpected turn. After college my mental health suddenly declined. Anxiety turned into phobia. Depression turned into despair. Frustration turned into rage. Irritability became wild mood swings I went from being a happy, social person, full of life and humor, to someone who desperately wanted to avoid the world and couldnt tolerate its onslaught of stimulation and slights. **\*\*\*Welcome to the Circle\*\*\* is my story** and the multitude of lessons Ive learned along the way. Through 27 accessible, intimate, and insightful essays, poems, lists, and practical guides, I will share what I went through in a way that can reach the reader at the core.

It is full of useful advice about how to navigate mental illness in all its difficulty and unpredictability, either for you or for the ones you love. **Mental illness is not a dead end; it can be a powerful beginning.** In the 7 years since I was hospitalized, I found effective treatment with both therapy and medications. I reconnected with family and friends around the globe. I started a successful global initiative for Wikipedia. I met my strong, brilliant, and beautiful wife. I became a loving stepfather. Along the way I learned and practiced how to help others find their own way into recovery. **My mission is to impact each person** who has personally experienced or witnessed the struggle of mental illness. To end the stigma and shame that prevents people from getting the help they need. To show that recovery is possible, that mental illness can be survived, and that it can be transformed into a dynamic and thriving new chapter of life. **Your support will help share this message with the world**, so that you can grow, and so that you can better understand and help others along your path.

78,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Three Things I Am Grateful For,1,dv2fdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dv2fdc/three_things_i_am_grateful_for/,2019-11-12 12:11:30,"Hi r/mentalhealth, About ten months ago, my mental health hit the lowest point I've ever experienced. After dropping out of school, isolating myself from my friends, and convincing myself that there was something wrong with me, I considered killing myself. I thought about jumping off a nearby bridge, running in front of a car on a busy road, or just slitting my wrists in my bathroom in the middle of the night. I can't begin to explain how scared I was of my own mind. And then, somehow, I managed to lock myself in the bathroom and write [this post](URL It was the most honest and vulnerable piece I had ever written. Today has been a rough day for me, but I want to you to know that things are so much better than they were that night. I've been exercising. I switched to a new program that fits with the way I learn, and I feel incredibly rewarded to be working as a tutor at my school. The most important change I made was integrating self-care into the parts of my life that were causing me anxiety. For me, that meant choosing projects that had real personal value to me. It meant socializing earlier in the day because when my sleep schedules goes, the rest comes with it. It meant being honest with myself about my limitations and planning to accommodate them instead of hurting myself to try and overcome them. But, as I said before, today has been difficult. I overslept despite going to bed early. I socialized but it felt draining where it usually feels energizing. And I can feel the creeping whispers in my mind trying to convince me that I'm an imposter. So I thought about that post I made and how important it was for me at such a low point. And I think if I can write about some things I am grateful for, then maybe I will feel a bit differently about my day: 1. The first thing that I am grateful for is my mother. Our relationship has been very rocky at times, but she has always found it in her heart to love me. I am a member of the LGBTQ+ community and she comes from a very conservative, religious background. Where other members of my family have completely alienated me, she welcomed my partner into her life with open arms. I love her (even on the days when I hate her). Recently, she found out that I was struggling with money. A few days after she found out, she called me out of the blue to say that she had saved a fund for me and was transferring everything into my account that week. I didn't know the money existed and it lifted a massive weight from my shoulders. My mother has been my hero during some of my most trying times. Today, I am grateful for her. 2. The second thing I am grateful for is my partner. Our relationship is beautiful because of how imperfect it is. Our apartment is almost never clean and our bed is almost never made. But when I'm not around him, I never worry that he's not there. What I love the most about him is that he fits into my life like a puzzle piece. He snaps into place with the pieces around him. But there's an open end for more pieces to attach. It's never been a question about whether or not he fits - it's a question of what the rest of the puzzle will look like. He doesn't know this, but I'm planning to propose this summer. He is the person who loves me when I need help loving myself and I am a stronger person because of him. Today, I am grateful for him. 3. The third thing I am grateful for is myself. Ten months ago, I truly thought my life was going to end. I equated the process of recovery with work that I was afraid of failing. Instead, my recovery has been full of failure, but is always moving forward. Being healthy has meant not being afraid to be silly, saying the wrong things sometimes, and taking responsibility for mistakes instead of being afraid of them. The person who decided to cry it out and write about why I should survive is my hero and that piece of writing was my superpower that night. Today, I am grateful for me. I considered deleting my previous post on multiple occasions. The vulnerability I showed is something that I am terrified of others seeing. But I think loving myself needs to include the worst days with the best. I found strength in the absolute worst time that night. And tonight I pulled from that strength. Thank you, r/mentalhealth, for being such a supportive, amazing community. Just by being a place for me to vent, you have been the catalyst for the best changes I've ever made to my life. You are, without a doubt, the fourth thing I am grateful for. Today, I am grateful for you."

Like my muscles are tense but they aren't and back massages make it worse. It's not my actual body but a sensation that my mind seems to create and it's unbearable like I constantly tensing and twisting my back and reaching round as if there was something there. Sometimes it feels like a pit or void in my spine or an intense sense of vulnerability.

However, I have my days when I get down and sad. These occur during colder, overcast days. It's probably SAD. Seasonal affective disorder affects a lot of people. Talk about it. Talk about your feelings. You'd be surprised who else feels similar to you. Vulnerability and honesty are so vital to taking care of my mental health. It's hard. It really is. I grew up to be strong and not cry. I was the ""smart kid"" and people believe in my abilities. I work hard for my recognition. I'm blessed to have that support. But I too feel weak and sad sometimes. It's really ok to feel that way. Validate what your feeling and don't just brush it off. Allow yourself to feel. It's so weird to talk about this but even if your type is ESTJ, you are allowed to feel. Please take some time to reflect, talk, discuss, and share. Bring awareness to mental illness, so you can take appropriate steps to take care of your mental health. You deserve it, honey."

Because I don't know what meds to take, and I just want a pill to fix it. Fix it fix it fix it. And I'm so sick of feeling BROKEN. So, I've started a spoken true story documenting my mental health and road to Making Magicopia - the magical, positive life coping skills I need. Two months ago, I had a traumatic regression that had me unsafe to drive. I couldn't recognize my own face, and I couldn't use my own name. I woke my daughter up in the middle of the night, crying out into my phone and raging at Lyn Manuel Miranda for making Hamilton and ignoring the traumatized little sister in that story. Oh my fellow mental health ""maniacs"" - it was the most inflammation I've had in my life. It weren't for my dog and my munchkin, I don't know if I would still be here. But, here I am. And this is me - telling my true story. I started recording stuff ages ago... and some of it is so raw and real that it's hard to deal with the vulnerability of sharing it. But that's what I need to do. Because... I'm hoping it might help someone else feel a little less alone in the dark, and add some light sometimes - too.

I'm documenting my process - and starting in the messy middle. Since I had a traumatic childhood abuse regression memory snap in September, combined with an abrupt layoff and a lot of magical adventures - I've been really exploring my neurodiversity and trying to ""fix it."" This is me, and this is really happening. [Episode 2: Blizzards in the Dark - Mental Health and Suicide Prevention](URL Last night I woke up in the deep dark, curled up in my bed with my kid and my dog.

I raged recordings into my phone, got into fights with Siri and got help from friends and family to hold me through the storm. Now, I'm Making Magicopia - a new mindset to find the magical life coping skills that keep me alive, help me out of depression and teach me how to deal with my neurodiversity. I'm documenting my journey through the messy middle, a sandwich of shit and sparkles and striving and struggles. I'll offer you my inspirations, talk to other folks about their differences, and share a whole lot of resources. Wrap up if you're cold, and take a listen. **Thank you.**"
83,vulnerability,mentalhealth,I Cant Remember Whats Wrong With Me,1,e3c73k,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/e3c73k/i_cant_remember_whats_wrong_with_me/,2019-11-29 19:44:24,"I dont really have a place where I feel comfortable talking about my problems. Usually when I try opening up to my friends and show vulnerability, I dont get a sense of empathy or care back. I dont want to talk to my parents because I dont want them to worry about me. My mom especially gets judgmental when I seem to be living the way she wishes I wouldnt. She never really showed empathy when she saw my vulnerability. My dad hasnt really shown an ability to understand either. Both of them grew up in abusive households, drank, did drugs, and left Poland at a young age without both parents. Once they had me, they cut smoking and drinking cold turkey. Since my birth, I grew up with both parents and soon to have a brother. My parents also converted from Catholic to Christian and claim it saved their life. I agree with them, and am religious as well. Im not gifted with good skin or physique, but I am smart and average looking. My family mocked me for being skinny all through my upbringing but it never bothered me. Around 6th grade was when my friend started to asses me and humiliated me for being skinny, squeezing my wrists and all. I became unhealthily self conscious about my size. I walked the halls with my head down, unhappy, unable to look people in the eye. Anyone could intimidated me. As I joined my first soccer team, weakness and humility surrounded me and spread to every waking moment. I remember feeling my first chronic anxiety surge. It was a summer day and me and my neighbors were out playing with the hoses. For some reason, I felt a tremendous amount of guilt and anxiety about using up my parents water. Im wasting it, all my parents hard work, this is going to cost a lot of money, theyll get mad, I dont... I had these manic attacks every time I got the flu. It felt like a video, with the screen focused and tracking the persons face at a very close distance, but the surrounding area around the face felt far away. This, along with shouts that feel loud and elevated, but at a hushed tone, beds feeling like their tilting my feet over my head, feelings in my fingers that I can only describe as a living numbness, terrorized me all throughout my childhood and even now. Scarily, the only things I can fully remember are these episodes. My mom called them hallucinations. Made no big deal of them. My dad, pissed off because he had to clean vomit, missing sleep. My feelings of panic werent validated. I excelled in classes. Though I felt terribly physically, I relentlessly loved learning. Soon, the only thing I had left would succumb to insecurity. I stopped feeling confident in my answers and closed up. I didnt know how to show emotion. Awkward, shy, anxious, unhappy, I plateaued hard. I stopped caring for soccer, parents forcing me, knowing well I hated it but not caring or wanting to understand why. They told me if I stopped I would get unhealthy and fat. I could only wish at the time. Now it was around 7th grade. 3 full years of low self esteem, inability to communicate, anxious thoughts, hopelessness. 8th grade and freshman year would be the climax, so far. I had no will to do anything. Spending time only either with the same handful of friends or playing Videogames, I isolated myself more and more. I became lonely and far more miserable than I could think I could get. When I thought it couldnt get worse, I got the worst case of bacne. God even took my torso away from me. Until the ending of 2018, the absolute juiciest girl from elementary hit me up. With a few new friends in freshman year, my skin clearing, I started to climb up. I never felt a care and desire to make someone else feel happy and cared for until I talked to her. (I was a real duckin simp, and Im not happy with that reality). But she was the first person I ever opened up about my scars to. And she accepted them. I felt like I mattered for once. It was inexplicable. I exploded with emotion and creativity. I let aside my weights. I was able to make everyone laugh, felt connected to the people around me. But most importantly of all, that girl accepted me. One day in January of 2019, I went full simp and walked through a blizzard to get that bitch some Dunkin duckin donuts. I got her special gifts and an inside joke for Valentines Day. When I delivered her gifts, she didnt invite me inside, but we talked in the front door doorway. She then had a dance at her school and she took me. But I started to have my doubts. She started to almost drift away from me. I was not relationship material, and I didnt know how to start one, either. It mightve been my fault. During the dance I switched back to my darkness. I froze up, didnt know what to say or how to act. That night, when I was in her parents car, on the silent drive to my house, I felt the rope that seemingly tied us together give way. Every time I started to think about her I would scream in my head, smack my head, run around, hyper focus on something else, anything to stop thinking about anything to do with her. I was slipping. Soon I wasnt really able to be present in reality. I cant remember the ending of freshman year. I cant remember anything I did this summer. Hell, I cant remember what I did today, or any day. I cant concentrate. My train of thought is like a 60 ton locomotive going 60 miles per hour. I mentally cannot get my brain to stop and think backwards. Im truly scared. All I can do is be here, and be in the future. But all is not lost. I no longer feel sad, because I dont know what to be sad about. Im filled to the brink, and spilling over with anxiety, though. But guess what? I think my brain actually broke. Im scared. But now, whenever Im getting those manic attacks after waking up in a cold sweat, I use my double edged sword to hyper focus and distract myself from them. But id much rather be able to appreciate a nice day I had once in a while. Now I feel comfortable with myself. Skins still bad, still skinny. But guess what? Fuck anybody who tries to make me feel bad about myself. Screw you too, mom. I dont want to go to college and get in debt so you can prove to your mom that youre not a disappointment. So, please, give your take on my situation. Any recommendations, comments, help, realty checks. Thanks"

And I probably am, somewhat, so I apologize in advance for how annoying this might sound and am prepared and eager to read any comments about the arrogance and potential danger of feeling uniquely any one way. I worry about this a lot and do usually try to combat these feelings when I feel them arising in myself. Right now, obviously, I'm not doing that. If it seems indulgent, I suppose it is.* My friends were all going around the room today sharing first impressions of each other. When it got to me I was struck by something a lot of them seemed to say about me. Apparently, I have a very ""fascinating"" and ""chaotic"" personality. My friend said when she first met me and got to know me it was like ""1000 different puzzle pieces she was trying to fit them all together""; when she said that, the others all enthusiastically agreed in unison. Then my other friend said her first impression of me was that she could never follow, or predict, what I was about to say, or the way one comment would lead to another and that my intensity and vulnerability fascinated her but also made her uncomfortable. Another said she thought I was the most chaotic and ""layered"" person she knew. Another said there was something ""un-tranquil"" about me. Finally, my ex-boyfriend said I was one of the only people he could not fit into a box/type (he has aspergers). I've heard things like this my I thought I usually came across like a sweet, smart, very socially anxious people pleaser and not much more. It's true, I do have a totally crazy side, but I don't EVER deliberately create chaos or drama (I hate conflict, in fact!). I'm pretty much never angry or deliberately hurtful (to others). It's funny, I'm not mysterious at all, either. I am talkative to a fault and wear my heart on sleeve. And I'm almost always in the dependent, adoring, submissive position. I do act in self-destructive ways. I am also hyper aware of everything going on inside me (and outside me) so that I'm almost always feeling dozens of completely completely conflicting emotions at once, but doesn't everyone do that? This almost sounds like I'm bragging. I'm definitely not. I'm genuinely curious about this, and also the origin of this kind of fundamental extra-chaotic way of being and relating. I wonder if anyone here can relate and if they think it's possibly related to a very difficult and unpredictable childhood, or more biological processes, like temperament and even mental illness? I mean they all intersect but I was wondering what popped into your head. It's almost seems like a kind of borderline personality disorder but without the anger and constant interpersonal conflict, like it has more to do with cognition or something?"

Now I can slightly feel, but my immediate response to most situations is to repress my feelings and appear and feel indifferent.

I have trouble trusting mental health professionals but I've been forcing myself to go to my appointments so I can get better. At our last meeting, he told me to read a certain book before we meet again: *Man's Search for Meaning.* If you haven't heard of it, I'll save you a google search and tell you it's about a psychiatrist's experience as a prisoner in a nazi concentration camp during WW2. My doctor told me he wants to hear my thoughts on the book once I finish it. I want to know why he would want me to read it. Have I been complaining too much, and this is his way of reminding me others have had it worse? Does he want me to answer something specific? Is this a test to see if I'll answer my true thoughts or what I think he wants to hear? If there is meaning in suffering, should I suffer more? Am I allowed to relate to the author? Would relating be the wrong answer because his suffering was both physical and psychological and also objectively *so much worse*? In that case, should I not take away anything from the book at all? This feels like a test. I don't want him to write down rude things about me, they find professional words to call you a loser and they joke about it with each other and they never let you see your file. I asked to see mine once and they sent me to the room that was supposedly the file office but it was entirely empty. Somehow I have taken offense to my doctor asking me to read a book. If I let on that I've been offended, though, that would be the wrong answer too. Oh my god, I could use some advice at this point. I'm so anxious about this and I feel like everyone is out to get me.

Again, for the millionth time, it is OKAY that you are a victim or villain to yourself, and it is okay to want to stay as comfortable as you can in an already uncomfortable situation. But when even a whisper of that voice inevitably cries out for help, I would suggest you heed its advice. And remember... ...the door to get better is ALWAYS open, when you are ready. #dontquit #keepgoing #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth  "
89,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Is there a name for being defensive/secretive of my inner self to others/extreme difficulty being vulnerable?,1,d7k5to,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/d7k5to/is_there_a_name_for_being_defensivesecretive_of/,2019-09-22 11:56:24,"I feel like I keep so much of myself and my thoughts hidden from others. Today I was thinking about how proud I am of my self confidence growth and how I genuinely really like (dare I say love...idk) who I am. Ive been pondering relationship troubles recently because Im at a pretty good spot mentally aside from anxiety, but I still dont feel mentally/emotionally ready for a relationship. Thinking about myself had me wondering if I could love myself if I was another person and then seriously questioning how another person could ever be in love with me. Its not that I think that Im too repulsive to be loved, Im just a bit disgusted by the thought of somebody being capable to love the same parts of me that I love about myself because I dont share those parts with others very often. It led to this final conclusion that I wrote down to tell a counselor once I actually make that appointment The reason why I cant picture somebody ever loving me even when I dont have low self-esteem is because I cant fathom letting somebody get to know me well enough to be in love with me Are there any topics related to this? Articles or general descriptors that could lead me to articles? Is this common? I dont know why Im like this, but Ive always had such a struggle with vulnerability."

""Not only is she smart, she's pretty too. She's going to be beautifulshe'll probably be a doctor or a lawyer, and she'll be able to find a successful husband with no problem."" &amp;#x200B; They told me I was going to beautiful, as though they had seen whatever future lay ahead of me, and I, nave as I was, believed them. I trusted that by the time I was sixteen, I would be perfect. I wished for sensual feminine curves, paired with the grown-up version of the rosy, childlike demeanor I was convinced I had. &amp;#x200B; Now I wish I never grew up. &amp;#x200B; When I was eleven, I had suddenly ballooned up. Nobody warned us of the other changes that would occur during pubertythey only told us that breasts would just magically sprout of our chests and we'd start bleeding out of an orifice we never even knew existed. We were never told about weight gain, or sudden cravings, or acne. I started binge-eatingI'd take snacks to my room after my mom had gone to bed, and stuff the wrappers in a handbag I kept in my closet. Over the course of a year, I had gained 26 pounds. I was no longer the wide-eyed child that was looked upon with affection, I was suddenly the girl who wore the same size of clothes as her mom. Of course, the bullying started. It hurt so much back then. I felt embarrassed for feeling pretty, and, being religious back then, started to wonder if I was being punished for being egoistic. My cousins started pointing out the fact that I had gotten ugly, the boy I liked was suddenly grossed out by me, and the loving gazes stopped coming. The only thing that was constant was the fact that I was a smart kid. &amp;#x200B; Come junior high school, I continued to gain weight. I was overweight, and I started getting acne all over my face. I couldn't care less about my calorie intake, or washing my face, so my state continued to worsen. When I got braces at thirteen, I was told I had an underbite. Now I understood why I was told I had a moon-shaped facemy lower jaw jutted forward, my chin was aligned with my upper lip. Living in a country with, frankly, less-than-competent orthodontists, my braces couldn't fix my underbite. I was 5'0, weighed 140 pounds, and had an underbite. I suddenly understood why nobody liked me romanticallyI was ugly. &amp;#x200B; I had all sorts of blemishes on my oddly-shaped face, my hair was a constant mess, and I was fat. I started becoming more extroverted as a strange way of coping. I forced a ""loud"" personality to make up for the fact that I was less than attractive, but I always took a step back when I realized that I wasn't comfortable being that kind of person. For a while, I was glad just being the way I wassure, I wasn't much to look at, but my grades were good, and my friendships were alright. &amp;#x200B; Then I actually turned sixteen. One day I woke up and realized that, half a life ago, I envisioned myself as someone beautiful. I looked at the mirror and that wasn't what I saw. I started picking at minor detailsmy skin was bumpy, my nose was dotted with blackheads, there were acne scars on my chin that just wouldn't go away. Then, it got worseI didn't like my feet, I didn't like my knees. My armpits were too dark, my bellybutton too deep, my lips too small. I used to look at my face with a twisted sense of satisfaction, now all I felt was sadness. I started skipping meals to restrict my food intake, only to binge afterwards. The cycle continued. My friendships got worse, my grades started to decline. My relationship with my mom started getting bad. I started cutting myselfmy thighs were constant targets. I couldn't possibly wear anything long-sleeved in this country. &amp;#x200B; On my seventeenth birthday, I had to celebrate it alone, in a coffee shop where my only company was a tired-looking barista and a sweaty, middle-aged jogger reading the morning papers. I convinced myself I was happy. I was not. &amp;#x200B; Now I'm eighteen. A decade after I first started thinking about how beautiful I'd be in my teenage years, a lot of things have remained unchangedI continue to read voraciously, and there are times when I still want to be left alone. The difference is that people have now substituted the word ""pretty"" for ""smart"". Don't get me wrong, I appreciate being called smart, and I love my college major with an all-consuming passion, but it's, well, different. If anything, my obsession with my flaws has worsened. I once had an uncle approach me and tell me I had nothing left to me but my brains, and another walk up to me just to ask, ""How come you've gotten ugly after starting college?"" Those are the little remarks that eat at me. I feel bad for doing this, but I occasionally make subtle comments on my appearance, hoping that someone would retort and say, ""Oh no, you're not ugly!"" When someone doesn't, I feel terrible. When someone does, I think they're lying. Being called ""average"" is my temporary happy pill, hearing comments about my skin or body kills me. &amp;#x200B; I've had a bad relationship with food for a long time, but my disordered eating habits have actually taken effect this year. I went from weighing 144 pounds to 127, and this, to me, felt amazing. I knew I was killing myself slowly by starving myself to the point of exhaustion, but fuck did it feel satisfying. It never felt enough though. I now live in fear of a full, healthy meal, and I spend an abnormal amount of time looking at photographs of myself wondering why I've grown up so wrong. Recently, it's come to a point when I'd arrive at my dorm, see myself in the mirror, and just start crying. I'd catch my reflection in glass windows and my day would be over. Someone made a comment about my hair looking dead, so I cut it, and now people comment on how I look like someone's mom. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I surround myself with pretty things, secretly hoping that in doing so, I'd catch the pretty virus too. I started wearing makeup, but eventually stopped when someone joked about how it was terrible. I've received comments on how small my boobs were, or how flat my butt was, but the ones that put me through a lot were always the little remarks about my body weight. There are days when I feel embarrassed to be alive. &amp;#x200B; I want to be beautiful again. I want people to look at me affectionately, and as selfish as this sounds, with a sense of envy. I want to be able to experience the thrill of romance at least once in my life. I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror and be happyor at the very least, okaywith what I see. There are days when it's easier. There's something beautiful in the way my friends laugh over the smallest things, something so endearing in the way my dog licks my fingers to wake me up, and something so exciting about riding a bus with the windows rolled down on a Saturday morning. And yet it's always the brief moments of loneliness and vulnerability that just kill me inside. &amp;#x200B; I don't know how to stop being so obsessed with my own flaws. I don't know why I find it easier to love and accept other people than it is to treat myself with the same amount of kindness and respect."
91,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Today I was told I couldnt get any help because no doctors in my region see people under 18. I dont know what to do anymore.,2,dachrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dachrh/today_i_was_told_i_couldnt_get_any_help_because/,2019-09-28 16:31:44,"In June my family doctor diagnosed me with severe depression. He referred me to the mental health unit in the local hospital and prescribed me antidepressants for the mean time. After not receiving a call for 2 months I assumed that either the doctor had forgotten to send the referral. So I went to see him and he checked if he had sent it and he did in June. He told me that it might be because Im under 18 and they dont usually take patients of that age. I was told to come back if I didnt hear anything for a month. Last week I get a phone call from the hospital asking if I was able to come in for an assessment today. I go in for the assessment and she notices that my file says that Im 17, she said that because Im 17 the hospital wont let me see a psychiatrist there and that I would have to go to childrens services. She did the assessment anyways and put me on the wait list (1 year average wait time) and then the computer gave out some score that showed my vulnerability. I think it was a score out of 8 or something like that. I scored a 6, which meant that they should consider hospitalization, but yet again, I cant because Im 17. She apologizes profusely and gives me the number for children services. I call them and they tell me that they wont take me either because Im over 16. ????? So essentially anyone in my region that is suffering from mental health issues and is 16 or 17 literally have 0 options for help. The final thing that I tried was the Canadian Mental Health Association, i went there and begged them to find literally any psychiatrist. They told me that there are no private psychiatrists in the region and that they only had two. For one of them I needed to have a case with them (idk what that means) and the other one flies in from Ottawa once every 3 months, but he only stays for 2 days so its unlikely that they can fit me in. I dont know what to do anymore. Theres no hope for finding any help. Over the past weeks my depression and suicidal thoughts have ramped up significantly for some reason. I honestly just dont know what to do."

93,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Psychiatrist told me to stop using weed due to psychosis but I worry about underlying problems,3,coqqk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/coqqk7/psychiatrist_told_me_to_stop_using_weed_due_to/,2019-08-11 11:40:43,"I've been using weed for about a year now every couple weeks, with consistent dosage and strain (edibles), but for some reason I have been getting worse lately. I have been becoming increasingly more paranoid, have more auditory hallucinations, and am having delusions while high. I kind of thought this was normal for the ""high experience"" but now I'm not so sure. When I'm sober I have these symptoms sometimes, but they usually aren't strong enough for me to act on or believe in them. Recently, they've been getting stronger. I talked to my psychiatrist about it because last time I got high I believed I was dead. I don't want to get into detail because it is really distressing. I believed this for about a day, but it keeps coming up while sober. My psychiatrist told me to stop using weed, which was a shock to me for some reason. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, I thought he would tell me to use less or to switch strains or something. I've spoken to doctors about psychosis before (before I started using weed), but they never really took it seriously because I had enough insight to know things were not true/real. He mentioned that because of my family history I could have a vulnerability to psychosis. I'm on antipsychotics (3+ years), but I thought these were just for my treatment-resistant depression. I haven't been diagnosed with anything related to psychosis (to my knowledge), but now I'm really worried. Is the weed the cause of all these troubles, or do I have an underlying problem that weed exasperates? Does anybody else have similar experiences?"

The following February he lost his job because he got caught nicking a protein bar. This put a lot of stress on our relationship, but we dealt with it and we've got to a place where we are stronger than we were before. My mum's fiance's dad died and before we could even put him in the ground we found out that my mum's fiance has cancer. She's going through a lot right now and I want to talk to her about my struggles, but I don't feel it's my place, not when she's going through so much and especially because we found out that my older sister was sexually assaulted and was dealing with really bad anxiety and depression and self-harm. My partner found a new job pretty soon and we continued shopping for houses. The job he got was salaried and a position in management so it was a very good job. We found a house that we liked and we put an offer in. It was accepted and I started to feel a little bit better, but then he lost his job again. This time it wasn't because he nicked something or because he did something stupid. It was because his manager was going to be losing their assistant store manager and they needed him to pick all the information and work up quicker than they expected. He wasn't performing like they wanted, and because he was still in his probation period they just let him go. This put a lot more strain on us but I didn't blame him because it wasn't his fault. He's got another job. I work in retail and so does my partner. We worked at the same place. Until he lost his job. You know what it's like at work, nothing stays secret for long and I am someone who cares about what people think of me. Everyone started talking and it really got to me. The day he handed in his resignation (because they let him do that instead of firing him so he wouldn't have a bad record) I didn't go into work. I just couldn't face them. I came back and everyone was asking me how he was and if everything was okay and it was getting to me. My good work friend was telling me how people I thought were my friends were talking about me and my partner behind my back. Eventually it subsided and it wasn't hot gossip anymore. I live in a smallish town and when they found out that he had been let go from his second job the rumours started again. I found out that someone I have known for 4 + years was talking about my partner with a manager saying ""have you heard that _______ has lost his job, he probably lost it from nicking again."" I'm stressing because I'm afraid this label is going to follow my partner around for the rest of his life. This woman that I had known for 4 + years that I thought was my friend has been going around to our local shops and telling them the reason why my partner lost his job in the first place. Last year I stopped smoking. It's been about 10 to 11 months now and I'm glad that I did, but I used smoking as a crutch and not just a crutch but also I would smoke when I was bored and I get bored a lot. Since then instead of smoking I now eat and I have put on about 20 kilos. I've always struggled with my weight and I've always been extremely self-conscious about my weight throughout my life and now it's just even worse. I am 5 ft 5 with change, and last time I checked 92.3 kilos. Most of my fat goes to my stomach and when I stand and look at myself in the mirror naked I hate what I see. So I tried to diet, and I do good. I start to lose weight and then I self sabotage. I don't know why I just do. It doesn't help that me and my partner don't have as much sex as we used to. Sex is just not as important to him as it is to me. None of my old clothes fit. My jeans don't fit. I just wear leggings and T-shirts. I've got a double chin now. It's small, but everytime I look at it I feel disgusted with myself. I just want to be different, but I just don't have the motivation and I know that's an excuse and I try to change it, but it just doesn't happen. I know that's on me though. These have just been stressor to me, but it's not the worst part. The worst part is my mind. My brain. It calls me nasty things and makes me doubt myself all the time. I get dark thoughts very often. Examples: what would happen if I died? Would my family miss me? Would they cry? Image if the car just crashed right now. Imagine if someone drove off the road and drove straight into me. Imagine if someone left a bomb at my place of work and it exploded. My mind calls me ugly and manipulative, a cry baby, attention seeker. And I believe it. I second guess the way I feel all the time. I always think ""do I actually feel this way or do I just want attention"". This is my fault though because I have done it in the past and now I don't know if my emotions are real or fake because I want attention. No, I know they're real, but I always second guess myself. I'm sad more than I'm happy and I feel like a burden on my partner. He is always there for me. He always hugs me and holds me and comforts me. He can tell when something is wrong without me saying. I feel blessed to have him. And he has me. If you ask anyone about me they say that I'm an extrovert, that I'm always smiley and bubbly and happy and lovely. And I can be these things, just not often anymore. Most days I get up and I think to myself great I have to go into work and pretend. I have to put on that mask and act like the happy bubbly person everyone expects me to be. But I just can't do it anymore. recently when I'm at work I have at least 5+ people ask me ""are you ok? You just don't seem like your normal smiley self today."" And I pretend and say yeah I'm fine and each time I have to say that I feel like I'm losing a piece of myself. The other day at work my back was hurting so I took 2 Anadin (painkillers). I waited 20 mins and it hadn't kicked in yet. I knew I should wait longer, but I took 2 more and then fantasized about taking the whole packet. I don't want to die. I just want to hurt myself. I had made a promise to my partner that if I got any dark thoughts or if I thought about wanting to hurt myself that I would let him know. After I had thoughts about taking the painkillers, I felt so ashamed I wasn't going to tell him. But I've never been good at keeping something that's on my mind away from him and I told him and I broke down crying and begged for his forgiveness and said that I'm so sorry and that I don't want die. And he forgave me and held me and comforted me while I cried. I have hurt myself before. I'm not someone who could cut myself, so I pinch myself really hard on my shoulders and my thigh's. I get scars that will fade with time. When I have the scars I like seeing them, but if I forget to cover them and my family or my partner see and mention them I get really embarrassed and feel ashamed. My partner knows what they are and I've promised him that I wouldn't do it, but I break that promise sometimes when I feel really bad. My family they don't know what they are and when they see them, I lie and say that I scratch myself really bad in my sleep. That's what they think they are. I don't do it often and I haven't done it recently. Sometimes I choke myself or hold my breath until it hurts. I say that I want to be able to talk to my family, but really I dont. I don't feel comfortable talking to any of them, even my best friends. The only person I feel comfortable talking to is my partner because I feel ok being vulnerable around him. Everyone else thinks I'm strong and dependable and I'm the person they come to when they need help and because they think I am that way, I feel like I have to be that way. I feel like I can't show vulnerability or sadness, but lately I haven't been able to keep the mask on. I feel so much more panic and anxiousness then I used to. I feel like I'm on the verge of having a minor panic attack often. Something happens and I feel the panic and worry clutch my chest and my breathing feels tight and tingly. Sometimes I get really dizzy and feel like I'm gonna pass out. I've been good at controlling my breathing when that happens, or when I feel like I'm gonna cry. I feel like I get upset or snappy more often then I used to and I feel sorry for my partner. I went to work the other day and I broke down. I told one of the personnel manager's everything. Even that I've hurt myself and then I nearly had a panic attack. She made me ring the doctors office infront of her and book an appointment for that day. Then I went home. I went to the doctors and was signed off work for a week, my partner even called into work and stayed with me even though he had just started a new job. I felt so drained. I had told multiple people about my life and struggles. It felt good but I also felt panic and I still do. That manager at work now knows everything. She knows I hurt myself. And I regret talking her so bad. My partner doesn't because he's says I would have gone home and then went to work the next day and still wouldn't have seen a doctor, which I can get. I went back to the doctor after the week because I wasn't ready to go back to work, and the doctor signed me off until the end of this month, she put me on antidepressants and referred me to go counselling. But I don't want to. I want to get better, but I just don't have the energy or courage to tell more people about my problems. Its a small town, what if it's someone I know or if I see them around. I already feel like I've made myself too vulnerable. But the closer I get to the end of the month and i haven't done anything the more tense and panicky I feel. I'm fucked."

My good work friend was telling me how people I thought were my friends were talking about me and my partner behind my back. Eventually it subsided and it wasn't hot gossip anymore. I live in a smallish town and when they found out that he had been let go from his second job the rumours started again. I found out that someone I have known for 4 + years was talking about my partner with a manager saying ""have you heard that _______ has lost his job, he probably lost it from nicking again."" I'm stressing because I'm afraid this label is going to follow my partner around for the rest of his life. This woman that I had known for 4 + years that I thought was my friend has been going around to our local shops and telling them the reason why my partner lost his job in the first place. Last year I stopped smoking. It's been about 10 to 11 months now and I'm glad that I did, but I used smoking as a crutch and not just a crutch but also I would smoke when I was bored and I get bored a lot. Since then instead of smoking I now eat and I have put on about 20 kilos. I've always struggled with my weight and I've always been extremely self-conscious about my weight throughout my life and now it's just even worse. I am 5 ft 5 with change, and last time I checked 92.3 kilos. Most of my fat goes to my stomach and when I stand and look at myself in the mirror naked I hate what I see. So I tried to diet, and I do good. I start to lose weight and then I self sabotage. I don't know why I just do. It doesn't help that me and my partner don't have as much sex as we used to. Sex is just not as important to him as it is to me. None of my old clothes fit. My jeans don't fit. I just wear leggings and T-shirts. I've got a double chin now. It's small, but everytime I look at it I feel disgusted with myself. I just want to be different, but I just don't have the motivation and I know that's an excuse and I try to change it, but it just doesn't happen. I know that's on me though. These have just been stressor to me, but it's not the worst part. The worst part is my mind. My brain. It calls me nasty things and makes me doubt myself all the time. I get dark thoughts very often. Examples: what would happen if I died? Would my family miss me? Would they cry? Image if the car just crashed right now. Imagine if someone drove off the road and drove straight into me. Imagine if someone left a bomb at my place of work and it exploded. My mind calls me ugly and manipulative, a cry baby, attention seeker. And I believe it. I second guess the way I feel all the time. I always think ""do I actually feel this way or do I just want attention"". This is my fault though because I have done it in the past and now I don't know if my emotions are real or fake because I want attention. No, I know they're real, but I always second guess myself. I'm sad more than I'm happy and I feel like a burden on my partner. He is always there for me. He always hugs me and holds me and comforts me. He can tell when something is wrong without me saying. I feel blessed to have him. And he has me. If you ask anyone about me they say that I'm an extrovert, that I'm always smiley and bubbly and happy and lovely. And I can be these things, just not often anymore. Most days I get up and I think to myself great I have to go into work and pretend. I have to put on that mask and act like the happy bubbly person everyone expects me to be. But I just can't do it anymore. recently when I'm at work I have at least 5+ people ask me ""are you ok? You just don't seem like your normal smiley self today."" And I pretend and say yeah I'm fine and each time I have to say that I feel like I'm losing a piece of myself. The other day at work my back was hurting so I took 2 Anadin (painkillers). I waited 20 mins and it hadn't kicked in yet. I knew I should wait longer, but I took 2 more and then fantasized about taking the whole packet. I don't want to die. I just want to hurt myself. I had made a promise to my partner that if I got any dark thoughts or if I thought about wanting to hurt myself that I would let him know. After I had thoughts about taking the painkillers, I felt so ashamed I wasn't going to tell him. But I've never been good at keeping something that's on my mind away from him and I told him and I broke down crying and begged for his forgiveness and said that I'm so sorry and that I don't want die. And he forgave me and held me and comforted me while I cried. I have hurt myself before. I'm not someone who could cut myself, so I pinch myself really hard on my shoulders and my thigh's. I get scars that will fade with time. When I have the scars I like seeing them, but if I forget to cover them and my family or my partner see and mention them I get really embarrassed and feel ashamed. My partner knows what they are and I've promised him that I wouldn't do it, but I break that promise sometimes when I feel really bad. My family they don't know what they are and when they see them, I lie and say that I scratch myself really bad in my sleep. That's what they think they are. I don't do it often and I haven't done it recently. Sometimes I choke myself or hold my breath until it hurts. I say that I want to be able to talk to my family, but really I dont. I don't feel comfortable talking to any of them, even my best friends. The only person I feel comfortable talking to is my partner because I feel ok being vulnerable around him. Everyone else thinks I'm strong and dependable and I'm the person they come to when they need help and because they think I am that way, I feel like I have to be that way. I feel like I can't show vulnerability or sadness, but lately I haven't been able to keep the mask on. I feel so much more panic and anxiousness then I used to. I feel like I'm on the verge of having a minor panic attack often. Something happens and I feel the panic and worry clutch my chest and my breathing feels tight and tingly. Sometimes I get really dizzy and feel like I'm gonna pass out. I've been good at controlling my breathing when that happens, or when I feel like I'm gonna cry. I feel like I get upset or snappy more often then I used to and I feel sorry for my partner. I went to work the other day and I broke down. I told one of the personnel manager's everything. Even that I've hurt myself and then I nearly had a panic attack. She made me ring the doctors office infront of her and book an appointment for that day. Then I went home. I went to the doctors and was signed off work for a week, my partner even called into work and stayed with me even though he had just started a new job. I felt so drained. I had told multiple people about my life and struggles. It felt good but I also felt panic and I still do. That manager at work now knows everything. She knows I hurt myself. And I regret talking her so bad. My partner doesn't because he's says I would have gone home and then went to work the next day and still wouldn't have seen a doctor, which I can get. I went back to the doctor after the week because I wasn't ready to go back to work, and the doctor signed me off until the end of this month, she put me on antidepressants and referred me to go counselling. But I don't want to. I want to get better, but I just don't have the energy or courage to tell more people about my problems. Its a small town, what if it's someone I know or if I see them around. I already feel like I've made myself too vulnerable. But the closer I get to the end of the month and i haven't done anything the more tense and panicky I feel."
96,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Sleep and Mental health,1,csemf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/csemf7/sleep_and_mental_health/,2019-08-19 19:18:33," Sleep and mental health are closely connected. Sleep deprivation affects your psychological state and mental health. And those with mental health problems are more likely to have insomnia or other sleep disorders. Americans are notoriously sleep deprived, but those with psychiatric conditions are even more likely to be yawning or groggy during the day. Chronic sleep problems affect 50% to 80% of patients in a typical psychiatric practice, compared with 10% to 18% of adults in the general U.S. population. Sleep problems are particularly common in patients with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Traditionally, clinicians treating patients with psychiatric disorders have viewed insomnia and other sleep disorders as symptoms. But studies in both adults and children suggest that sleep problems may raise risk for, and even directly contribute to, the development of some psychiatric disorders. This research has clinical application, because treating a sleep disorder may also help alleviate symptoms of a co-occurring mental health problem. The brain basis of a mutual relationship between sleep and mental health is not yet completely understood. But neuroimaging and neurochemistry studies suggest that a good night's sleep helps foster both mental and emotional resilience, while chronic sleep deprivation sets the stage for negative thinking and emotional vulnerability.

97,vulnerability,mentalhealth,"Im in love with my therapist (&amp; have openly discussed the feelings with him in therapy, re: transference), how do I find a healthy outlet for these emotions in order to process and manage them in a productive way?",1,cu1412,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cu1412/im_in_love_with_my_therapist_have_openly/,2019-08-23 04:01:37,"[Preface: if youre looking for a TL;DR, probably just disregard this post. I feel like its important to read the entire post in order to provide valid advice &amp; opinions.] I've been seeing my current therapist weekly for just over three months. He incorporates narrative, cognitive behavioural, emotion focused, and existential therapies in his practice and I will say that he does (as a conscious choice) sometimes share things about himself/his life experiences when they're relevant in order to make me feel less alone and more understood. In my previous experiences with therapy (I've been in therapy on and off for the last 15 years and throughout that time, I've seen four different counselors/therapists/psychologists specializing in different areas) the therapist has been much more of a ""blank slate"". That being said, I have never gotten more out of therapy than what I'm getting now. His approach has felt tailor made for me and I've experienced more insights and growth over the last three months than any other period of time in my life. I can certainly acknowledge that, as his gentle guidance and unique perspective have deeply impacted my mental health in a really positive way, allowing me to feel like I'm blossoming into the most authentic version of myself, I've attached a lot of really positive emotion to him. There is a deep gratitude there, and I do believe that we've created a very special and beautiful therapeutic space. I've done a lot of reading about transference, and I've addressed, with him, the feelings I'm having for him. He's handled it all with a lot of grace and has been really good about being neutral; obviously not giving in in any visible way to counter-transference, while somehow managing to not leave me feeling rejected. We've discussed that the feelings (including sexual attraction) are there for me, and made it clear that we both intend to behave ethically. I have a very deep respect for him, can see the potential he has to transform lives, and I would never desire to do anything that would jeopardize his career. For me, in regards to transference, the sense that my formative years lacked something critical in terms of parental love and approval doesn't really ring true or resonate. I'll add that he and I are only a few years apart in age, and from the very beginning I found him physically attractive. This might be delusional of me, because I can acknowledge that there are likely a lot of subconscious factors at work here, but I genuinely just feel like if I'd met him as a person in normal life, I would have fallen in love with him. We have a very similar sense of humor, he's obviously deeply compassionate with a very high emotional IQ, he's intelligent, constantly striving to grow and better himself; he values family, sees the beauty in humanity, is curious, and thoughtful, and (this sounds woo-woo-ey and I'm generally very analytical and science minded buuut) just has a general vibe that I find both incredibly compelling and comforting. He's obviously made me feel safe and I've trusted him with my vulnerability in a way that I've not done before with anyone else, and I totally understand that this fact alone is probably playing very heavily into the things I'm feeling. OKAY, so all of that being said, I just don't know what to do with these feelings. I don't think that they're getting in the way of my ability to thrive in therapy (I've basically been checking in with myself before each appointment and making a conscious effort to continue to be completely open and honest, even when it's ugly and shameful and embarrassing--I think that the problem, in regards to therapy, would arise when/if I started only trying to put my best foot forward in a misguided attempt to ""win him over"" or impress him). That being said, I feel this deep love for him that I'm not sure how to process in a healthy way. I've been really conscious of my desire to shower him with praise and gratitude and really made an effort to keep that reigned in, but it leaves me with no where to put these strong emotions I'm feeling. I'm wondering, other than journaling them out, are there other healthy ways that I can and should be processing these romantic feelings?"
98,vulnerability,mentalhealth,A cathartic tale: Shes stuck,1,cxpkhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cxpkhj/a_cathartic_tale_shes_stuck/,2019-08-31 10:53:41,"This is not for the faint of heart, but I believe the struggle of being 20 years old and dealing with traumatic experiences is, unfortunately, common. No matter what someones background may be or where they hail from, traumatic disorders can and will affect all of us if we are unfortunate enough to be put through the ringer. To give some context: I grew up up as the the eldest of 3 kids (2 little brothers), to a man who had severe mood swings and an unfortunate bought of bad luck with his self owned business, and a Portuguese mother whose own severe traumatic experiences in Portugal of extreme poverty and parental physical abuse, (it was so extreme that if she talked back, her parents would hog tie her and put her under the bed she shared with her 9 other siblings for days with no food or water) resulted in her turning to alcoholism. My parents absolutely hated each other, then and now, but still live together to this day. Life was, and still is, always an extreme, and unfortunately the bad memories still outweigh the good. CPS was constantly in my house and at school, nights were spent trying to break up my parents from fighting and trying to kill each other (while also shielding my brothers from it), my mom constantly putting our lives in danger when she would drive intoxicated with her small kids in the car, and almost everyone in the neighborhood refused to let their kids come to my house because the cops had been seen there multiple times. I had always been confused as a kid and pre-teen, why my reactions to situations were so severe. If someone made fun of me, it felt like the absolute end of the world. If I felt that someone didnt like me, than that would be the only thing on my mind for the rest of the day. If one of my friends didnt want to be my friend anymore, I would want to die (Id sleep with a knife under my pillow as a 12 year old). I even developed a horrible habit of lying to make my life seem amazing and to make people stay in my life and feel bad for me. I was a joyful and high energy kid, but in these moments of vulnerability, I would shut down and transform into this completely different person. The only comparison I could make is as if I i was in the backseat of my own car with no seatbelt, while someone I dont know is driving the car as recklessly as possible; all I can do is hold on for dear life and hope that Ill make it past the next cliff. I did finally get my answer as to why I was so extreme, but it was a revelation that would forever change my life. I was laying down with my cousin in her bed when I was in 7th grade, it was around 3 in the morning when she rolled over and asked me if I remembered the night that my family friend dylan, who was 5 years my senior, made out with us and made us strip for him, we were 7 at the time. The moment she uttered that sentence, the floodgates opened to reveal 2 years of traumatic sexual abuse, from when I was 6-8. Done by the hands of both Dylan and his older sister Amanda, who happened to be my babysitter. My babysitter had coerced me into performing sexual acts on her, after she had found out what her brother had been doing to me for the past year, and threatened to tell my parents that I was a slut and what I had been doing with her brother (as if the whole situation was my fault. It was after this repressed memory case to light, that I continued to hold my silence for 4 more years. When I finally had the courage to tell my two best friends, they didnt believe me and so I was silent once more. My high school years were filled with depression, bad skin, a tough girl persona that I put on at my Catholic high school, my mom being picked up by ICE and held in a detention center for 7 months, my dad throwing me across the room and trying to beat me for saying that he never helped me with anything, a suicide attempt that was thwarted by my mother, plenty of weed and my saving grace: soccer. When I finally embarked to college I had to ditch my life long dream of becoming an investigative journalist because they didnt have my major at the school I had decided to play soccer at as a last minute decision (the school I originally committed to was a D1 college but unfortunately politics got in the way and I lost my scholarship there so that they could give it to a different girl on my travel team). I was stuck in upstate NY on an awful team, my roommates was a compulsive liar (I had kicked that habit with sheer will about 2 years before my freshman year of college) from California, I lost my drive for my future career path, and I still hadnt told my family about what had happened. It wasnt until I was in a emotionally abusive relationship that lasted less than 2 months and than raped by my exs roommate (who was also dating my roommate...irony) after I had gotten intoxicated two nights after my ex and I broke up, that I hit my breaking point. I called my mom at 3 in the morning and cried to her about what had happened as a child and what had just happened at college, she than told my father and the secret was out... but nothing really changed. I ended up going to title 9 after finally telling my roommate what happened (she came with me to the office to reveal that he had been physically abusing her) and the guy who raped me was kicked out, my mom was arrested again that year, and my father went completely broke. However I continued my bad habits and stayed in college till halfway through my sophomore year. My father told me to drop out because the college I was in was 56,000 a year, he needed financial help at home, and I had just gotten kicked off my soccer team for a whole bunch of bullshit that I wont get into right now. That February I left, and decided I would work on my mental health and actually go see a therapist consistently. It has helped immensely to talk to a third party about the traumatic events that have happened in my life. Nothing prepared me, however, when my therapist diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder. I had heard of the illness but it was usually under the context of someone bashing those who have this mental illness with phrases like: never trust them theyre or crazy or my favorite if your friend or significant other have BPD, than run because they never change. I was scared and I still am. Its only been 7 months since I left college and I have been a nanny for two boys who have autism, which I find a very gratifying thing to do. Why do I write this long dragged out sob story as my first post on reddit? Last week, I woke up by myself in Jamaica hospital because my now acquaintance left me on a train by myself when I found out the hard way that medication doesnt mix well with alcohol (I didnt even make it to the concert we were going to); I walked out 5 minutes after walking up and trekked it go Jamaica train station thinking about absolutely nothing, the experience of waking up in an unfamiliar place hadnt even rattled me. Ironically, today I was cleaning actually shit off the chair from the three year old and watched as he looked at me straight in the eyes and dumped his bowl of pasta on his lap. All this anger and sadness finally came to an explosive climax as I proceeded to sob silently while cleaning feces. I thought to myself is this really all Im meant for? To clean up after peoples messes for the rest of my life? Thus the cycle continues: Im a 20 year old college dropout, my 18 year old brother just left for college, my 17 year old brother just left for England to pursue a two year professional soccer contract for a team thats just below champions league, I dont have soccer anymore, the drive that I once had to leave my impact on this world is all but snuffed out. Im left to waste away in a house where I still have to take care of two full grown adults, expecting to come home from a full day of work (usually 9-9) to my mother passed out in the back room with a can of beer next to her and have to take extra caution to avoid my father when hes in a bad mood so that he doesnt trigger me into having a break down by screaming in my face for 5 minutes. Amanda is an elementary school teacher and recently got engaged to her long time boyfriend of 7 years, dylan has a well paying job and a pretty girlfriend... and thats the irony of it all My point in sharing my story isnt about wanting sympathy. Its the fact that therere millions of kids who share the same fate as I do: to deteriorate under the pressure of silence. The prolonged period of silence that I suffered through is what has lead me way past the breaking point to a place where all emotions and thoughts are just white noise. I can only hope that you will share your own stories and spread the awareness of the turmoil children in our society are facing as the world continues to get smaller. I will continue to fight to regain my sense of self and the freedom I so desperately desire. I will try my best to break the chains my environment has put me in because I know I was meant to shine in this world full of unpolished gems. However, if I am to suffer continuously at the hands of fate while the people who wronged me continue to live their lives in blissful ignorance, do I even have the right to keep fighting against the inevitable?"

I (25f) am diagnosed with a few conditions that can make my life challenging (I would rather not go into detail but feel free to PM me if my exact diagnoses are important). I have depressive episodes that are debilitating and can be really isolating. I have a group of friends that has known each other for over a decade. All of them know that I do struggle, mainly because of a hospitalization a few years ago. No one knows the severity of things and, to be fair, I can be selective about which details I will share with people in fear that I will scare them away. However, I am very open about the fact that I am having a hard time and never shy away from this conversation. Discussing mental health is extremely liberating for me and I wish I had more opportunities to have these conversations. I have realized that no one asks how Im doing. Fair enough, I understand people are busy and life is hard. Everyone has their own struggle. People will ask generic questions about life, relating to careers or relationships etc but it seems like no one wants to talk about mental illness. I understand this, since it can be a depressing subject and people dont know what to say. I decided a while ago that Im the one that needs to start the conversations and to expect people to call me and ask hey, hows your mental illness treating ya? would be unrealistic. At the same time, something just feels so wrong in my situation. Even when I do initiate the conversation, my friends just dont want to go there. I am not bringing these things up at inappropriate times. My breaking point was yesterday when I was texting a friend about a major life change relating to her career and giving her advice. She was grateful for my help and then asked me how my job (or lack thereof) was going. I had just left a therapy appointment and decided that for once I would be vulnerable and not mask my suffering. I opened up and told her that Im on a break from work because of my deteriorating mental health but ended my response with reassurance that I am finding a new psychiatrist, etc. No response. This is a person who is glued to their phone 24/7. It has been almost a day now. Do people not realize the PAINFUL vulnerability required to share these things? How much it hurts to think you are somehow burdening the people in your life and that you should just keep all your issues to yourself? I am hyper sensitive and cant tell if Im being crazy here. It doesnt seem fair (yes, I know life isnt fair) to be the kind of friend who stays on the phone for hours talking about an ex boyfriend or whatever issue is going on when there is no reciprocation when it comes to your own struggles. It all feels so superficial. Do any of you feel the same way and how do you cope with it? Sometimes I want to abandon my friends altogether but I know that will hurt me in the end. I know my friends are good people who love me but are they actually good friends if I havent had real support from them in over 5 years? Am I supposed to lock them in a room with me and beg them to listen to me and let them know whats going on? How do I deal with this? My judgement is clouded so it would mean the world to me if I could get some perspective on this. Thanks for reading."

I didn't go to bed happy and wake up suicidal. It was the result of years of pushing problems to the back of my mind. When those problems reared their head, which they often did, I doused them in alcohol. Over the years, this began to take its toll. It was like a poison slowly seeping into my bloodstream gradually making me ill. The straw that broke me was a series of problems in quick succession; a couple of deaths in the family, I lost my job and as a result, I was convinced I was going to lose my house. I was broke and broken. I hadn't developed the emotional strength to deal with anything due to using alcohol to hide. Without alcohol to guard me against the problems I had tried to ignore. They were back in full force. Rampant in my mind. I could think of nothing else and was brought to my knees like the elephant as the tranquillizer finally takes hold; I only wanted to sleep. It seemed like my only option to escape these thoughts. I couldn't sleep. All I could do was think. Think about how fucked I was. How I was never going to escape. I felt like I was trapped in a well. A dark, cold well. There was a light at the top of the well but it got dimmer over time. I was alone, except for a disembodied voice that would constantly spew negativity. ""You're worthless,"" ""You'll die here,"" ""You've got nobody,"" ""Nobody loves you,"" ""You should be ashamed to feel like this,"" ""You are a failure,"" ""You're not a man"". This carried on for months. For months I would lay in bed trying to escape the barrage of negativity that was now the soundtrack to my life. Until eventually, it changed to ""You may as well kill yourself."" I felt like I had two options left in the end; Suicide or help. As a man the thought of asking for help made me feel like a failure. I had spent my life working in a male-dominated engineering environment. Any sign of vulnerability was exploited. So admitting to having depression and needing help felt like a fate worse than death. I would rather die with my pride intact than admit to being weak. What a fucking joke right rather be dead than appear weak but hey that's how I felt. So I began planning how I was going to do it. I began tying up any loose ends and started devising a way to strangle myself. One day I was laying in bed and my mobile phone began to ring. As usual, I disregarded it with the thought ""It will only be my mum. No one else cares about me,"" and then I don't know where from a thought; ""At least you have that."" I was so overwhelmed I answered the phone and spewed the words ""I need help,"" into the receiver. I have come to learn everybody has somebody and nobody has nobody. You've just got to reach out. I made an appointment with the doctor and when it was time made my way there. Every step I took was like wearing concrete boots. The thoughts ""Worthless, useless, pointless, weak, coward, failure, not a man,"" constantly spiralling through my mind as the tears coated my face and made my way there. I was so ashamed. I was so fucking embarrassed to need help. I walked into the Doctors office and told him about the situation. Well, I more like blurted out that if shit didn't change I was going to kill myself. He offered me anti-depressants which I declined and he set up a counselling session. The counselling sessions taught me that the disembodied voice that was giving me shit all the time was actually my own thoughts. It was rampant. So, I used mindfulness meditation to face my thoughts. It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. I also learned to deal with things when they arise instead of letting them build up and then spilling over. I implore anyone who feels like this to reach out for help. Being a man I know how hard it is to reach out. To not want to appear weak. But my life has improved no end since that time.

102,vulnerability,mentalhealth,My family has lost faith in me and it is discouraging to me in my pursuit for success while struggling with long-standing mental health issues.,2,ccu3au,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ccu3au/my_family_has_lost_faith_in_me_and_it_is/,2019-07-14 06:32:00,"Hi, I'm here because I need to place to vent and receive some emotional support despite all of you not knowing me. That said, I've recognized that there seems to be a genuine sense of community here after seeing some redditors actually offer caring and supportive answers to posts. As a heads-up, this is going to be a long post. &amp;#x200B; Some background info about me: I'm a 22 yr old male with mental health issues (frankly, I don't exactly know what I suffer from- most doctors have diagnosed me with OCD since I was 8 yrs old, another with psychotic depression, recently; I think its the former due to my obsession to detail and organization and the litany of continuous, intrusive thoughts). I've been on many medications ranging from antipsychotics to stimulants and antidepressants (currently, on a three-pill cocktail- olanzapine, clonazepam, and adderall). &amp;#x200B; My mental health began seriously interfering in my life in my early teen years when my symptoms were at its worst with extremely irrational obsessions/fears and compulsions. Because of this interference, some aspects of my life degraded especially on an academic level-its always been a roller-coaster, a continuous cycle always reaching a high and then dropping to a low. At its worst, I dropped out of high school because I was flunking my junior year (reflecting back upon it, I was moderately depressed), earned my GED and applied to a community college several months later. Fast-forward to my sophomore year of college (Spring 2016), I begin, again, failing classes due to my depression and other external factors (my dad coming out of prison and having very few people to support him while he was reintroduced to society). &amp;#x200B; After that semester in which I failed a few classes, I decided to take some time off and try to get my symptoms in order- this, unfortunately, ended up being for a little over two years. My father was no longer in the equation, so to speak- he and I had a falling out and so did my mom (but while he was in prison). This is nothing unusual, my family is more than somewhat dysfunctional. During that time, however, I worked somewhat due to the financial constraints that my mom had after the federal government seized almost all of our assets, several lawyers taking advantage of our naivete, and some family members also taking advantage of our trust and vulnerability. That said, I did not contribute much to paying for expenses instead opting to save for a car of my own (of which savings eventually I gave to my mom so she could buy herself a relatively new car after I having used hers to work) and then wasting my future earnings ""living it up"" with my childhood friend on food and weed (I'm not proud of my lack of financial support- I've already been chastised enough because of it). &amp;#x200B; As I approached the beginning of 2018, I decided it was time that I had to get my ""sh\*t"" together and register for classes I previously failed for spring semester. Finally, I was beginning to have some stability family-wise and financially, having finally moved out of the room my mom, brother and I were sharing in the my grandfather's home. My parents' reunion I did not approve of because I don't like my father very much- I have lots of bad memories of him since he was a terrible husband to my mom and wasn't the greatest father either. Despite this, he denies culpability and tries to cover up most of his errors and shortcomings with the life he gave us with his dirty money which, according to him, he said he attained for us and that the only thing he learned in life as a kid was crime. Aside from being an aggressive, violent, sexist, ignorant, and inconsiderate individual and ,not to mention, unfaithful husband (he brags to me about his sexual conquests while having been married), he refuses to take responsibility for his actions and tries to pin it on others. Anyways, I digress, I succeeded as a student this time, being a ""top student"" in my accounting class- admired by most in my class for my strong grasp on accounting concepts and principles and eventually becoming a teacher's pet (tbh, it felt good to finally be in a situation such as that one) but, as I mentioned before, my life usually follows the path of a roller-coaster- reaching highs and lows. My symptoms were coming back in full force (possibly, exacerbated due to my excessive smoking) and again I had to take a hiatus albeit, a short one. That's when I decided it was time to get back on meds because my symptoms were close to unbearable- I was suffering from especially strong delusions (non-bizarre) and obsessions, anxiety, depression, and severe insomnia (I was getting around 4-5 hours of sleep a night-I was taking 2-3 extra strength OTC sleeping pills a night to get by while I waited for my psych appointment). That's when I decided to get back on meds after not being on them since my sophomore year in high school (which I took in an on-and-off fashion so I didn't benefit from the full effects). &amp;#x200B; Since then, I have taken one or two classes per semester as I near my completion of A.A. in Accounting as a 22 year old (as pathetic as that sounds). I still haven't found a definite solution to my mental health problems (medication-wise) and have worked intermittently. My parents have lost most of their faith in me as I lag behind academically and financially in comparison to my peers. They think I should settle for $20/hr 9-5 job (not that there is anything wrong with that but I aspire for more). &amp;#x200B; Nevertheless, I've decided to take some charge of my life and I've begun planning my future (of which my meticulous and organized nature serves me well, lol) and I'm determined to finish my B.S. in Finance at 25 (through online classes at an accelerated pace), earn a CFA credential, and set up a couple of businesses in which industries-with the help of some family and friends- I've ""dipped my toes into"" so that I can finally be financially independent. That said, it would be nice that the people closest to me (my immediate family- I have no friends and I'm not on speaking terms with most of my relatives- some people might think this has to do with my personality but believe my family is truly a ""piece of work"", I'm not the only one like this) would still believe in me and offer support but, unfortunately, they don't."
103,vulnerability,mentalhealth,In need of guidance - depression,2,cdqchi,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cdqchi/in_need_of_guidance_depression/,2019-07-16 11:17:30,"I think my depression has come back with a vengeance. In the past I went to therapy but it was unsuccessful, and I later tried two additional therapists. Some days I think I'm ok; I think I have it together and I always get what I need to done. I always deliver. But I think I need someone to tell me I'm not ok and I need help. I spend my days alone, talking with no one but my parents and sister (and it's usually less ""talking"", more them criticizing me or barking orders). I feel empty, lost, and suicidal. My long distance boyfriend has been my sole saving grace. I just feel at the end of my rope. I can barely get out of bed; I dread waking up. I look like shit. I can't look at myself in the mirror, and I've thrown myself into baking in an act of desperation (though I'm enjoying it). My dog doesn't even like me; when I sit next to her, she gets up and goes to the other couch. As a small example of what living at home is like, today my younger sister mocked me for having ""no friends"". Another is my parents life philosophy that a life well-lived is a life of work. If you're happy though, you're not working hard enough, and you're not supposed to be happy. Basically, life is supposed to suck, get used to it. I feel like, why do I bother anymore? &amp;#x200B; My dramatic decline I think has also been triggered by: * The instability of my chronic illness (cystic fibrosis) * Loss of my single passion * Got a dream job which turned out to be an absolute nightmare where I was overworked, lied to, verbally abused, deprived of food, etc. * Beginning to resent my major * Finding out that I can't ever really leave my country even though I hate it here (due to my health condition) * Losing all direction and vision for my future, now having to reexamine my career options and realizing I will never be as financially successful as my parents * Back in February escaped my ex who abused me sexually, emotionally, verbally, mentally for roughly 2 years * Living with my formerly abusive mother who I'm still afraid of (but cannot leave for a long list of reasons) &amp;#x200B; The problem is, I don't want to spend money. Additionally, I don't want to tell my parents I need help because they'll read it as a kind of vulnerability and weakness, and they'll take advantage of that later. I am also chronically ill and have taken a large amount of pills my whole life; I don't want to add to the pile. And most of all, I don't want to be hospitalized or put in a psych ward. All in all, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place."

In real life though, whenever I tell someone about how I'm really feeling, like the deepest parts of my mind, I end up disliking them for a while. Even if the person was supportive or understanding, I will literally be repulsed by them and try to ignore them afterwards for a few weeks. Even when I was seeing a psychologist at university, I had to postpone my appointments as I just couldn't deal with seeing her and knowing she knew my vulnerability and seen me at my weakest. Does anyone else ever feel that way and/or know why I might be feeling like that? Is it common? I think it's because of how guarded I am with my ""truth"" as I work hard to hide it.. it can make seeking help difficult as well."

Now I know of my mistakes and not what to do, it didn't recover my mental health. After 2015 I've seen myself increasingly drift away from people I used to be friends with. Leading up to now, it's a total mess. Now 22 years old I'm completely hesitant to make interactions with anyone, without showing any vulnerability. I stay in my house for weeks on end unless I want go with my mom somewhere, addicted to masturbation, and even pushing away hobbies like playing video games.

Rant ahead. I am older than my partner by three years (we got together early and hastily), in a different stage of life, including as concerns mental health, and we are just very different in general. I think he is really special and I love him, but our relationship is definitely not ""nourishing"" us. He and I both struggle with anxiety and depression. I now understand that, combined with a belated formative stage in life and some other factors such as emotionally unintelligent parents, his is more severe. Also more social anxiety than (for me) generalized anxiety. Like any couple, it's not our only incompatibility. I run hot (temper-wise), he considers visible vulnerability or negativity (e.g. anxiety, anger, overt disappointment, confrontation) a big sin and therefore projects it onto others, which is easy to do to me because I'm already very expressive. I'm very verbal, he's not so much, I have a motormouth, he has an overactive mental filter and seems not to be able to recognize and appreciate and express his own thoughts/feelings. But the biggest kicker is the mental health thing. Because I have already spent 8 years or so battling those problems, and I developed them in my own context, and probably owing to some accidental order in which I tried different things and went through different life shit, I am having a bit of a breakthrough before one seems on the horizon for him. He is trying to graduate university and differentiate from his parents and build some basis for intimacy with me, and (especially for a depressed person) that's so much at once. By contrast, I'm (gratefully!) past some of that stuff and not putting out fires in my life anymore. I'm enjoying my solitude, my work, my home life, my hygiene routine, my self-organization habits and tools, my friends, the cycles of the months and weeks, and my husband even though he is clearly not getting as much out of it all. Even though I know that, I get frustrated and resentful with him sometimes. I feel like he's not trying hard enough. I know how much depressed people get told that and tell themselves that and how unhelpful that is, so I don't say it. But he does nothing. He tried medicating (2 different SSRIs at different times for anxiety and depression and Adderall, Vyvanse, and Dexedrine for ADHD) and that didn't work, he tried CBT and the results were mixed, he tried naturopathy with one naturopath, and the results were minimal. He has a bunch of health issues that aren't simple to treat. So for almost a year he's really done nothing for himself, his quality of life, his happiness, me, our relationship, or his future regardless of what it involves. He has a videogame addiction that he seems to have substituted or significantly offloaded from a porn addiction. He is always down on himself - not out loud, but once in a while he reveals that he always experiences that. His fears and insecurities manifest in reality, as anyone who has dealt with this knows is bound to happen. I have tried different ways to support him, comfort him, or inspire him, but the only sustainable change is probably to be what I want to be, so that he sees that he can be whoever he wants to be. Which I'm doing. I work out 5x a week, give it my all at work, use positive self-talk, journal like a machine, overcome fears to continue to be an active friend and partner, etc etc all this stuff that seemed impossible when I was 23. I'm not a perfect partner. But I feel limited in my development in that area by his current inertia. It also hurts that he doesn't celebrate my growth or even just day-to-day happiness with me. I feel like it would spill over to him because I'd feel so good and validated, so I'd feel no restraints from pouring out my love back to him! I know he knows this, deep down. I know this isn't ""about"" me (although I don't think that's a thing in close relationships though btw, I think everything's about both people, and not necessarily in a pressure or ""obligation"" kind of way). I know it's hard to celebrate someone else when you are busy hating yourself. But it still feels lonely. I guess my only two real qualms with our relationship are: (1) would he stand a better chance of overcoming this stuff and finding himself if we broke up? My gut feeling, his claims, and the therapist's reassurances are all abstract - what would happen if it was tested in real life is concrete. (2) how long can I be lonely in this relationship, even with all of the less profound Joy's we do share, before it threatens all these mental health gains I've bled/sweated/teared for? I know none of you can answer this for me. We have gone to couples' counseling and our therapist considers him an enigma who must be deeply repressed as a result of the parenting thing. She thinks he holds many secrets from everyone, maybe including himself. She also thinks I have much better self-discipline, am harder-working, and am an ""A+ student"" (not since middle school but thanks girl!) - she thinks part of that is just age, and he's bound to grow out of some of his current inhibitions soonish. I think all of that is true. But I also think he just needs to get in touch with his feelings and desires and challenge himself, a LITTLE bit, every single day, and it will help him assert his own identity, and that can ultimately only be good for everyone. But all our mental health/self-discovery journeys are ultimately our own. No matter how hard I try, I may not end up being the most key person in his recovery/next stage of personal development, and I accept that. All I can do is my best. One last vent: I really don't want to not be there for him when that day comes, because I could have really used him here when it came for me."

I put in my time, suffered enough and now I was done, I graduated from vulnerability, right? Unbelievably wrong... To this day I find it incredibly difficult to express myself even to people closest to me. All the words in the world and nothing comes to me when I have an opportunity to say something. In the rare occasion that I do, I immediately judge what I say. Nothing I say comes without an explanation and immediate regret for exposing my feelings. Ashamed to feel the way I feel. Now, I realize theres a whole mess of issues that I now have to confront. I am grateful, however, that I came to this realization today. I interact with so many people and I often notice how much they share without hesitation. No judgment on my part - the exact opposite in fact - I listen with admiration and compassion, hoping one day I can do the same even on a small scale. Today I know why this is - that period in my life was incredible scarring (figuratively &amp; literally) that Ive only defined vulnerability by what Ive been through. The most extreme version Ive experienced. Today I know my next step is to reframe what is vulnerability to me and move forward with the new scalability factor.

Arguments in favour include: \- the correlation in time between the two \- increased cannabis consumption leading to increased psychosis rates \- THC directly affecting important areas in the brain &amp;#x200B; Arguments against: There is no bulletproof evidence that cannabis does cause psychosis. Furthermore, a recent study suggested a genetic predisposition for developing psychosis. The most plausible counterargument to a potential correlation is that a shared vulnerability (think chicken and egg) links cannabis use and onset of psychosis."

Also, if youre not in a place to be reading depressive thoughts right now maybe stop reading. The last thing I want is to be pass on negative thoughts. Cold. Alone. Hopeless. These along with many other negative words float around in my head and knock on the doors I wish to keep closed. Its hard to act like Im a normal and healthy person. It drains me immensely to interact with people whom I know nothing about and will never know me and what goes on in my head, what Ive experienced. Every day the past haunts me and the future scares me. I live alone and I suffer alone, even though I know many people struggle with what I do. But we all have our own version of depression, anxiety or whatever else. We all have unknowables about ourselves. I wish I could get a real glimpse into peoples feelings sometimes in order to have real conversation but it pains me knowing the burdens we all walk with in life. I know these burdens too well. They creep in and pollute my mind when Im at my lowest. Real conversation is so rare, but I accept the reason for that. Having conversations like that is extremely emotionally draining because of the vulnerability you bring unto yourself. Im not really the type of person to talk about my feelings, even with close friends. I have a fear, irrational or not, that they will see me differently and refuse to be honest with me. I dont think Ive ever talked about my life with anyone and its hard to pinpoint why. I guess its just my nature, or how I was raised. Its so hard to overcome that though and to expose yourself to people. Im the type of person where I have a need to hear honest thoughts, as I can immediately tell when someone says or does something disingenuous. Im oftentimes surrounded by people who supposedly love me, but Im still stuck in my own mind coming to conclusions about their intentions that could very well be delusional. Delusional. This word shakes me to my core. How can you truly know of the things that you think are correct? I am fairly confident in my perceptions of physical reality but the realm of emotions escapes my grasp much of the time. Maybe some sort of undiagnosed disorder. I come off as cold and unfeeling because I internalize everything, but within my mind a gust of emotions blows. Before a couple weeks ago, I had never lashed out, spoken my mind to anyone other than my family. Doing so, even just for a minute of speaking the slightest bit of truth to my closest friend, brought me to tears. When Im inebriated and enjoying myself and I hear something that, for lack of a better word, triggers me, I completely shut down. I dont speak a word and retreat into the dark corner in my mind I know all too well. I dont speak my mind, Im just not that kind of person right now. Besides, sometimes the settings which house whatever triggered you are the worst settings for emotionally charged conversation. At least thats what I tell myself. I am currently in that dark corner and its the darkest its ever been. Its at times like these I wish I had someone to talk to. Maybe a therapist is in order. But money wont allow it at this time. For now I wait to go to sleep again and dream whatever my mind decides worth dreaming. Hopefully tomorrow will be brighter. Thank you for reading, Much love infinistar11"
119,vulnerability,mentalhealth,I think Im destroying my relationship with my almost constant need for reassurance,25,b0v6il,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/b0v6il/i_think_im_destroying_my_relationship_with_my/,2019-03-14 14:01:40,"Im not sure if this is the right place to post. I grew up in an abusive household where emotions and vulnerability were definitely weaponized. My boyfriend had a very stable and loving home. I get... weird. I have moments of insecurity, of being certain hes cheating or unhappy or going to leave me. I have moments of desperation where Im so scared I want to throw everything away. I try to carry most of this on my own but sometimes I try to talk to him and he doesnt understand it. He can be very kind but he cant help me feel more secure. And then I get more afraid that because he knows Im broken that itll turn him off and hell find someone who isnt as fucked in the head. I almost feel like I should be dating someone else because there isnt an understanding there. He will never understand what this kind of low self esteem bullshit feels like. So hell never really understand what to say to help me feel comfortable. Or maybe I need help? This post has gotten a very manic feel to it so Ill end it here. "
120,vulnerability,mentalhealth,B is for Bipolar Disorder,6,baoca9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/baoca9/b_is_for_bipolar_disorder/,2019-04-08 12:32:03,"I am participating in the A to Z blog challenge and I am writing posts to spread awareness around mental health, mental illness, symptoms and related topics. The posts are for those who have no clue about a certain condition, those that try to find information about it, and those that maybe need to read something where they can relate and feel more understood. I wrote a post on Bipolar Disorder which I thought some of you might find interesting or relatable. You can find the original post here: [URL &amp;#x200B; Some Facts Bipolar Disorder is a brain disorder and chronic mental illness that is known for extreme shifts in mood, energy levels and ability to function on a day to day basis. The disorder is marked by episodes of depression, mania or hypomania, stable episodes and mixed episodes. While depression equals a low mood and energy levels, in a manic or hypomanic episode, the person displays high levels of energy and elevated mood. Despite the general conception that people with bipolar disorder are on either one or the other side of the pendulum, many experience long periods of stability without any symptoms. And there are also episodes where both symptoms of depression and mania are present, those are called mixed episodes. The important marker for bipolar disorder is that the depressive, manic and mixed episodes are several days long (the exact time period descriptive of a bipolar episode can differ from country to country) and constant. This is what makes bipolar disorder very different from Borderline Personality Disorder. Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and ADHD, conditions it often gets confused with. There are two main types of Bipolar Disorder. Bipolar Disorder Type 1 is diagnosed when someone had at least one manic episode. Bipolar Disorder Type 2 is diagnosed when someone had at least one hypomanic (but not manic) episode and one depressive episode. The main difference between mania and hypomania is that in mania, psychosis is present, in hypomania, there is no psychosis. There is also cyclothemic disorder, with less severe symptoms, but is still on the bipolar spectrum. Bipolar Disorder is quite a devastating diagnosis because it is a life-long illness and if it is left untreated, it will only get worse with time. There are actually studies showing that the grey brain matter decreases in patients who have untreated bipolar disorder, something that eventually leads to dementia. Bipolar Disorder is one of the mental illnesses with the highest risk for suciide, about 25 times higher than the general population. And about half of the people who suffer from bipolar disorder engage in self-harm. Having bipolar disorder gives you a much higher risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiac illnesses. Bipolar Disorder is one of the mental illnesses that have been known about the longest, and has been studied extensively. It is a mostly genetic illness, but just because someone has inherited the vulnerability to develop, doesnt mean that they will get it. The theory is that circumstances often trigger a first bipolar episode, and an bipolar episode can only happen if someone has the genetic predisposition for it. Brain-scans can actually show the differences between someone with bipolar disorder, and someone without it. ## Mania and Hypomania Most people imagine mania to be a fun ride with lots of energy, productivity and creativity. And it might have those symptoms. But in general, it does not feel like the positive adventure it often is portrayed as. Mania feels like your brain has turned into a squirrel on cocaine. It is like you are on a motorway and your car is going faster than everyone elses, but you are stuck behind them and cant drive past them. It is like your body is tired but your brain is on a 24 hour IV of coffee. It is running, running, running, in circles, in squares, triangles, and whenever you try to explain those figures in your mind to someone else, the questions they ask you, make no sense! Because it is all so clear! Mania is unfocused productivity, or obsesssive work without any actual goal. It is an incredibly overwhelming lust for life, sex, adventure, but nothing, absolutely nothing can meet the needs that you have. You need more, more more! Mania is your worst nightmare having turned into a Tim Burton movie and you are in it, dancing with elves and skeletons alike. It is the best feeling in the world, but the most pressured and unsatisfactory experience you can imagine. You feel music, but no one else can. You think in ways that no one can follow. It is lonely, it is crazy and it makes you forget everything that usually matters. The decisions you make are impulsive and solely focused on meeting those strong needs and urges that you experience. So you ruin your life, but you dont realize that while you are doing it, you just need to have sex with that one person, you just need to buy that car, you just need to move to that country. Until it all poofs and you crash into depression. The symptoms of hypomania and mania are pretty much the same, but mania is a more severe form of an elevated mood episode and has the additional symptom of psychosis. Some symptoms of mania and hypomania are: elevated mood, racing thoughts, lack of a need for sleep (being okay with just 3 or 4 hours of sleep a night), hypsersexuality, impulsive behaviour when it comes to drugs, sex and money spending, impulsive life decisions, delusion of grandeur, over-confidence, pbssessive and goal-focused behaviour, paranoia, pressured speech, irritabillity, heightened senses, anger, psychosis, being suddenly very social, restlessness, anxiety, reckless behaviour, not being able to acknowledge the episode and more. Mania and hypomania can be dangerous, especially when there are signs of psychosis. The lack of sleep, the reckless impulsive behaviour and the physical restlessness can have serious effects on the physical health of the individual as well. But most importantly, people ruin their lives without realizing it. The decisions that we make during a manic or hypomanic episode is something that we have to deal with later: the debt, the pregnancies or STDs, the relationships we ruined, our lives that we have changed. So being in a manic or hypomanic episode does not sound as fun anymore, does it? ## Bipolar Depression Bipolar depression has very similar symptoms to clinical depression but there is something different about it. The difference lies in the hopelessness of forever being stuck in that cycle of madness that is bipolar disorder. In building sandcastles by beautiful beaches, knowing that the next wave is going to crush them all over again. In the shame about the things that you have done during a manic episode. In feeling the difference between mania and depression. It is very common to crash into depression after a manic or hypomanic episode. The brain just goes into overload and boom, the rollercoaster goes down again. You suddenly are out of energy. You have no motivation. Your relationships change because you are not the fun and sex loving friend anymore. You are lost, confused, ashamed, hopeless, drained, oh so very drained. Your brain is suddenly in snail mode, you can not think the way you used to think anymore. Your projects die out, you cant leave the bed anymore, showers seem like climbing a mountain and you stop caring. All you want is for it all to end. But you dont have the energy to end it. So all you do is walk through that molasses of your broken mind, crying, hating yourself and knowing that you will never be okay. As beforementioned, the symptoms of bipolar depression are very similar to those of clinical depression, and they include: a feeling of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, shame and guilt, anxiety, lack of energy and motivation, negative thinking, sucidal thoughts and behaviour, self-harm, lack of apetite or overeating, tiredness and fatigue, physical pain, indifference, loss of interest in the things you usually enjoy, and more. ## Mixed Episode Mixed episodes are usually not much talked about, which I find surprising, as they are the most dangerous episodes with a higher risk of suicide attempts and self-harm. In mixed episodes someone is presenting both the symptoms of depression and mania. That sounds confusing, right? Well, it for sure is! A mixed episode is like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum. One minute you are stuck in the biggest despair you have ever experienced, but the next moment you start laughing out of nowhere. You want to have sex with your enemy while watching the world you have set on fire, burn. You can go be both suicidal and hypersexual at the same time. You want to die and you have the energy to go through with it. Mixed episodes are chaotic, dangerous and can ruin lives just as much as depression and mania can. Some of the symptoms of mixed episodes are: agitation, anxiety, suicidality, restlessness, pressured speech, impulsive behaviour, self-harm, hopelessness, high levels of energy, lack of sleep, indifference, quick mood changes, reckless behaviour and more. A mixed episode can be more on the manic side or the depressive side, depending on which symptoms appear stronger. ## Treatment There is no cure for bipolar disorder but there are a lot of different treatment options. Most professionals would suggest taking Lithium, antipsychotics or other mood stabilizing medications. While those medications work for some, for others they mean terrible side-effects. There is no miracle drug but there are options that are worthy considering, especially if psychosis is one of the symptoms you are experiencing. There are also other ways to make sure that you have better control over your bipolar episodes, a mood tracker or mood journal might make a difference. That way you can prepare for whatever comes when there is an onset of an episode. You can focus on having strict routines, enough sleep, exercise and live as healthily as possible. Another important factor is to have a strong support system that you can turn to when you feel like things are getting out of control. If you feel like you or someone you care about suffers from Bipolar Disorder, I would strongly urge you to seek professional help to get a proper diagnosis. Self-diagnosing is dangerous, and Bipolar Disorder has many overlapping symptoms with other mental health conditions."
121,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Emotional needs are not being met,1,apumbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/apumbc/emotional_needs_are_not_being_met/,2019-02-13 02:45:27,"So I've just finished my session with my counsellor and it's been established I'm really struggling with meeting my emotional needs. I'm craving an emotional connection with someone, I recently went through a trauma, which triggered past traumas... I'm the type of person who does not seem weak, or vulnerable but there is a softer side to me, I wish I could be vulnerable and just let that side through for a moment I'm a mum and student and rarely have that time to just BE. and I have nobody to just BE with. I recently slept with an ex but he has basically no emotional capacity and understanding and is a control freak and very detrimental to my mental wellbeing. I don't care about him but being how I am atm I could very easily find myself latching onto that because of needing these needs to be met... Luckily I'm very self aware and can notice these things but I'm still concerned it'll happen if i don't tackle this issue. How do people meet their emotional needs without putting themselves in vulnerable positions that people can abuse? My counsellor suggested peer groups but I really don't know if that'll help the vulnerability aspect of it. I just want to connect with someone and have them love my broken ass  Sad times, any advice would be appreciated and sorry if this just sounds like I'm rambling, I don't really have people in my life I can share these things with to this extent and I'm hoping I'll find more understanding here.

122,vulnerability,mentalhealth,My ideas of the sad person,1,atkhfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/atkhfr/my_ideas_of_the_sad_person/,2019-02-23 04:43:09,"I do not live the life of a depressed or associate with the typically sad person. Understanding the feelings, solidifying the experiences or attempting to vicaroiusly interpret their lives is all very difficult for me. Helping someone help themselves or helping someone want to help themselves in the first place or even get them to want help. I do not know. I do not know why my attempts have been incapacitated, my gentle hand slapped away like an buzzing wasp, my cries of empathy silenced like a phone on silent, a sense of uselessness and helplessness has taken over my being and I cannot easily visualize a timely, favorable solution. I want to articulate my current thoughts as well as hear the thoughts of others more wise than me. The sad person will favor depression over happiness, sadness over joy, and pain over comfort because underlying problems have not been forgiven. Abuse suffered in the past may destroy all feelings of happiness and security. Torment becomes the normal and everything seems hopeless causing death to be, although permanent solution, a blissful vacation from the pain. When in this state of seemingly perpetual pain, a coping mechanism of apathy takes hold, a desire to escape circumstances dries out will the last of tears and the seeds of the biggest problem, low self-esteem take semi-permanent root. Sad person may not even of suffered from abuse but still prefers the sad life personified in loneliness. Whether from abuse or failed relationships for some reason sad person feels alone. This can be purposeful but hardly ever desirable. Deep down every person longs for human connection, only too often it is disturbed, misconstrued, and manipulated by pungent fiends poisoning the vulnerable for selfish desire. Bad relationships all around him, sometimes not even being his own, set poor examples and influence the ideas of what a good relationship means, giving way to a more favorable existence in loneliness. A hedgehog who loves connection but only hurts himself and arguably more importantly hurts others. The sad person is often lonely and has low self-esteem so what purpose is it to get close to people when you will only become a burden. Sad person will wrongly interprets the avoidance of vulnerability and lack of openness as healthy and superior to the possibility of opening up and getting hurt. If the event of a relationship occurs, sad person automatically places himself in a lower standing than the other recipient which makes sad person content with being used or mistreated. The sad person can keep up this superficial relationship in the following ways: He does not open up, he can please his own selfish and confused desires, he can artificially fill the void of loneliness with a connection, or experiment with others emotions. Unfortunately, the sad person may be so lonely that he needs the negative attention of being depressed. He will play sad music, (simp songs are welcome to be recommended) eat himself to the point of self-loathing, post on social media and worst of all use others. This is where it may get personal for me and now that I have had time to realize my past actions I am sincere in saying I am not proud and rather disappointed I acted this way. Many times throughout my I played the apologetic victim. Although I took some measure of personal responsibility it was for my own convenience, never being sincere enough to makeup for my wrong doings. In this victimhood state I merited negative attention. By exaggerating my emotional turmoil , prolonging and perpetuating my problems, I essentially created an artificial system in which being sad would provide more attention to myself and affirmation to my ego. Going back to the sad person, (Although these tendencies do not cease to arise, I have become more conscious of it and try actively to fight back) craves this negative attention because that is the only way he will feel valuable. Fishing for compliments and degrading himself will often warrant arguments and words of affirmation from the person the sad person decided to use. Finally, the sad person does not want help. He chooses to be sad as a person chooses to be scared at a horror film. Where he goes wrong is life is not a horror film. There are always the absolutes of uncertainty in life where emotions can flare and life can go wrong. Moderation of emotions is essential. One cannot go about a healthy life feelings only anger or only joy. Balance as show in the movie inside out, gives a decent explanation of what I am trying to convey. Emotions come and go therefore not being consistent paradigms in which our lives should flow. In order to live a meaningful life everyone must find healthy and sustainable coping devices to enable them to survive the menacing yet opportunity rich variability in life. If not the sad person will decide that their life is a horror movie or a tragedy and never pick themselves up out of the pit of loneliness and despair. As humans we all have chains. Some chains we will be able to escape ourselves, in fact most chains were locked by the very person they imprison. What the sad person and many persons fail to realize is people may not have the same chains as us or even the identical chains can be unlocked by others, by friends, and by family. They may have the key you yourself do not hold. "
123,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Is there some sort of syndrome or term for this? Also a long personal vent and some background. Very personal.,1,au1zy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/au1zy4/is_there_some_sort_of_syndrome_or_term_for_this/,2019-02-24 11:12:41,"Before I start because I think it matters, here are my current diagnoses: Schizoaffective- Bipolar type, OCD, general anxiety. These diagnoses could already have an influence on what i'm about to discuss, so I found it important to point those out. I have a chronic tendency to see the darkest part of everything in an obsessive way. I would definitely say that it has to do with the O of OCD, honestly. I'm just wondering if there could be any chance this specific realm of thought has a title. If it does, I could look into it and learn how to cope. Anyway, I seem to obsessively focus on really horrible sides of everything and lately the few things that gave me light are... crumbling and becoming as dark, if not darker, than everything else. It's breaking my heart. I'm smothering hope and purity with the knowledge that it is only a thin veil over horror and the disturbing. I feel like I carry the weight of the suffering world on my shoulders, and I cannot be happy without that weight getting heavier. They're horribly obsessive thoughts of death, disease, loss of purity &amp; happiness, disturbing things, horribly sad things. It never stops. I feel like it is my autopilot to the extent that every single thought I have is tainted by some sort of darkness. I feel like i'm living in a Stephen King novel; all of the uncomfortable subjects that come through in his books are my waking life. It is exhausting. I cant just ride in the car with someone I love and enjoy the moment. My mind has to conjure up all these horrifically sad things and insights that most people do not dwell upon very long at all. I'm not the type of person to sit in the back of a high school classroom reading HP Lovecraft and saying, ""If you dont suffer and realize how dark reality is, you're retarded."" I want more than anything to experience untainted joy.( It is why I love children so much and want to have a child of my own. Even if it's for just a few years, they're untainted. They're pure, happy, adorable, and they have so much love. I think that is a reason parents love their children so. They are a light of hope in a world with none. Delusional as that might be.) I cant think of anything that is unstained by bad thoughts. Nothing in my life is unstained with one of my series of obsessive thoughts. Whether it be loving on my dog only to obsess over her death, playing with a little cousin only to acknowledge his vulnerability that could stain him forever if not handled, or trying to speak to my senile grandfather but only being able to carry the weight of his suffering. My grandparents were one of those few things that brought me unrequited light. The stains my mind put on them were insignificant beneath their rays of love. Now, god, that is the most stained part of my life. My grandfather- I hate to admit it- is becoming my obsessive thoughts incarnate when before he was a ray of sun. Lewy body dementia and PTSD. He says these wildly dark things that blow my mind. They're like hes saying the intrusive thoughts I cant get rid of, but they're coming from my ray of light. It has put the hugest damper on my obsessions like no one can believe. What he says sometimes can be horrific, and it's really like all my dark thoughts are coming from the mouth that used to (still sometimes does) bring me pure love and happiness. I suppose being upset by things like this is totally normal but *not to my extent.* It is all I fucking think about, man. I mean *all* I think about. I cannot stress that enough. It's not like I get depressed for weeks and then finally come out of it. It's not like I get sad then can go do something to help it. It's not like I think and worry at times and just let it fester in the background. It is *always there* always with me. These obsessive thoughts that totally stain all happiness. I'm so obsessive I am following the career path to be a funeral director. I spend my free time writing horror and tragedies. All I can read and enjoy are horror, tragedies, and sad poetry. My paintings are dark, too. I hobby with taxidermy, bone collection, and in general art made from death, and it is... the only fucking thing that makes it stop. Working with death is the most therapeutic thing for me. It is exposure to some form of darkness, taking control of it, and living physically with it. It's part of my intrusive thoughts but instead i'm choosing to exist with it and even have artistic intimacy with it. But still, all my existence feels dark. I say dark not like a batman character who wants to look cool. I seriously think ""darkness"" is the worst fucking feeling on the planet that totally trumps anything else. I cant find any other word for it, really, other than the made up word ""Disturbia"" which I use to define the state of living in darkness. It's my existence and I seem to live in it alone. No matter the happy environment around me, there is something fucked up about it. I have been like this my whole life only for it to get worse. I value and love my life, especially my family. Amazingly supportive, open minded, and so fucking loving. Sometimes I cry because how much I love them. So nothing has caused this, but it is how I have always existed. Ever since young childhood, I have been really aware of morality, vulnerability, and suffering. My dad has a severe seizure disorder that I grew up with. I would *never* tell him this but one of my earliest memories is asking my mom why my dad sometimes makes noises. She explained of course. But I saw my father, who as a child is supposed to be your god. ""Mother is god to the eyes of children"" and so is father. My god lost 15 years of his life from falling down. And I grew up watching him in these vulnerable states of no control. I dont know if you've ever seen someone have a bad seizure, but it is horribly disturbing especially for a child when it is there dad. It stuck with me. Something about that experience exposed me to vulnerability and mortality way too young. When I was 8, he had a grand-mal seizure, and I was the one who called the ambulance. That night at the hospital I cried and felt so much emotion for him that it was beyond my comprehension. The sounds of him in the emergency room were traumatic and I remember going into a room with all my family where my uncle lead a prayer. For some reason at that moment, I stopped feeling for a long time. The weight was too much. I was an apathetic depressed preteen until I was hospitalized at 14 where during my stay, my guard of apathy *shattered.* In a group therapy session, these other girls were sharing traumas and emotions. When they got to me, I looked at the counselor, tried to speak, and all that came out was crying that couldnt stop. I was crying for them and everyone in the world. Since then the heavy empathy of my childhood came rushing back no matter how hard I told it to fuck off. Unless I feel nothing, I am feeling everything. And the worst of it is that it is all tainted in darkness whether it be in small levels or huge levels. My brain finds some sort of sadness to throw onto happiness. Hell, I just remembered: When I was a little kid, my grandma would say goodbye like ""See you later alligator"" and I would reply ""After while crocodile."" This is probably the more adolescent version of my intrusive thoughts of dying and suffering, but, I stopped saying goodbye like that because... one day I imagined us saying that to each other on her deathbed before she died. I was at least 8 or 9. And I was thinking like that. A happy communication between me and someone I love became about watching them die. It never stops. It's so fucking chronic there has to be other people who experience this and there has to be a title for it."
124,vulnerability,mentalhealth,This helped me today.

If I forget this feeling, I still know that I have planted this seed in my brain which can eventually grow, even if I cant see it on some days. &amp;#x200B;  Today I learned about the strategy of so what?. When I really worry about something, I should try to ask myself so what? a couple of times. Example: What if I go back into my work field again only to have another stress breakdown?  so what?  Then I would have gotten nowhere  so what?  Then I would have to find another career path  so what?  Hmmmm.. then I would be able to leave this work field with good conscience because I gave it a good try and learned it was not for me. &amp;#x200B;  I dont have to feel swallowed by life and work (probably bad translation). To some degree, I can dictate my life instead of letting life/surroundings/others dictate me. It is okay and even necessary to say no sometimes, to set boundaries, to ask for another way of doing things, to ask for help, to make mistakes, and to take care of myself. &amp;#x200B;  I should set lower and shorter expectations for myself and not obsess so much about a distant future. I should not worry so much about making the right choice in life and doing everything perfectly right now. Everyone makes mistakes and learns along the way. I have worried so much that I might someday need to turn my life in a different direction than the one I am going now  but if that happens - so what? I have been so afraid of making a wrong choice and locking myself into a situation forever, but I realize that I always have the ability to evolve into a new direction if I no longer find happiness in something that previously made me happy. And if I find myself in that situation, it doesnt mean that past me made a huge mistake, it just means I am evolving into a new person. This can of course be very scary because it is new territory, but I need to remember that I will eventually learn something about myself and become a better version of myself if I just dare to walk into that scary territory and let myself lean into the vulnerability and insecurity. &amp;#x200B;  Today I thought: I am so thankful to have had this breakdown, so I got the chance to learn about myself. This is a complete shift of mind for me and it took me by surprise. It is also completely understandable, that I did not think of this before on my darkest days, but I am so glad that this suddenly popped into my mind. &amp;#x200B;  I obviously know that I will not feel this inspired and happy all the time. Bad days are totally okay and necessary. But I am writing this so I can read this on a bad day and remember that this thought-seed of hope has been planted in my head. I will know that it IS possible to feel joy and inspiration as I do right now, even if it seems impossible sometimes. &amp;#x200B; If you feel anxious about reading this, that is absolutely okay and you dont need to take any advice from me. Okay, maybe just take this one advice: If you are in a bad place right now, hug your blanket and dont be hard on yourself. It is okay to be where you are at right now &lt;3 "

In 7th grade I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and moderate Depression. I feel so fake. I mean, when I laugh, I'm truly laughing and feel happy in that moment, but almost all the other times, there's always a sense of...dissociation, I guess? Like there's cracks in the wall where my true self can seep through, but I still keep up a persona. This person I've created and shown to the world is tough and cynical and doesn't like people. She doesn't like hugs or romantic movies and books and hates dresses. That's just not true. I'm not very tough at all. I'm really sensitive, and am easily hurt by people even when they don't mean any harm. I'll feel horrible if I hurt someone because that's the last thing I want to do, normally. Even through my skewed vision of myself I can see that I'm very caring person. I love hugs. Especially my mom's. I'm actually a romantic at heart, but no one would ever believe me if I told them. Part of me likes watching and reading romances, but at the same time that and people around me being in relationships makes me sad. I love the idea of true love and soulmates and stuff, but I'm terrified of rejection and vulnerability. Here's an example: I'm 18, about to turn 19, and I had my first ""real"" date a few months ago. For some dumb reason, I thought I was ready for a relationship. We met on Tinder and we go to the same college, and he was perfectly fine. But, he kissed me at the end of the date. Nothing crazy, it only lasted about 3 seconds. But once it was over I remember scrambling out of his hug and into my residence hall, impatiently waiting for the elevator to take me to my room. I was high on adrenaline, and texted my mom and a friend that I had just kissed a guy, and then it started to sink in. *I just kissed a guy. Oh my god, I just kissed a guy.* Granted, he kissed me, but I could've pulled away. I should've pulled away. I broke down. Thank god my roommate wasn't there. I was frantically texting my mom while crying. This going to sound stupid as hell, but I felt...dirty, in a way. I'm not exactly sure why. There's was nothing really dirty about it, but even thinking back gives me the same feeling. I was freaking out. I'm surprised I didn't have a panic attack. I had become vulnerable in front of someone. It makes it worse because I barely knew him, and also, I think part of me wanted time to build up the wall for him that I had already shown to everyone else. Needless to say, we didn't have a 2nd date. I'm so terrified to destroy that wall. That effing wall that I despise but also don't tear down. I'm petrified to get into a relationship and one day my boyfriend wakes up and realizes that the girl he's dating is fake and ugly. I'm scared to be vulnerable in front of others because I think they'll use it against me. I don't want to continue to be fake, but at this point, if I start being true to myself, everyone around me is going to question me. I'm just scared."

Short story is that I have a problem with action and PvP strategy games; they make me feel extremely stressed, and I can't calm down even after I've stopped playing them. Here's an example: I played a game called Town of Salem. It's basically a strategy game where you have to convince others. I played the first round, and I started feeling stressed. Then, I stupidly played 4 more rounds while under stress. That night I couldn't fall asleep, and, in the next evening, I called an ambulance for a wide range of terrifying mental symptoms including high body temperature (or a sense of it), dizziness, and others. I self-signed myself into a psych unit that evening. They gave me a diazepam shot, and almost instantly I felt better. Why can't I calm down? What is this strange stress vulnerability symptom of my illness?"

This model, supported by recent findings from neuroscience and molecular genetics, suggests that the biological determinants conferring risk for psychopathology interact with protective cognitive factors to enhance creative ideation. Elements of shared vulnerability include cognitive disinhibition (which allows more stimuli into conscious awareness), an attentional style driven by novelty salience, and neural hyperconnectivity that may increase associations among disparate stimuli. These vulnerabilities interact with superior meta-cognitive protective factors, such as high IQ, increased working memory capacity, and enhanced cognitive flexibility, to enlarge the range and depth of stimuli available in conscious awareness to be manipulated and combined to form novel and original ideas."" &amp;#x200B; what do y'all think about the connection between art and mental illness? is it a harmful myth? does it ring true in your experience?

At the time I was going to college in Nashville and since then have moved back to California to live with my parents. I am on medication that has really helped regulate me. I did an out patient program for two weeks then transferred over to seeing just a therapist. The problem is that I have some trust and vulnerability issues. I dont like talking to anyone about my problems. I had a 40 minute session today and sat silently for 20 of them until my therapist started talk. I have a hard time expressing what I need and how I feel. I feel like seeing some one is a waste of both of our time and money. What are your thoughts?
130,vulnerability,mentalhealth,"Thinking of you, PD",1,a77by9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/a77by9/thinking_of_you_pd/,2018-12-18 14:41:07,"It broke my heart to read Pete Davidsons message about his suicidal ideation. I find him to be a very real person in the midst of the fabricated reality that is the entertainment industry and his honesty about how his life is tormented with Borderline Personality Disorder and suicidal ideation is a reality that I have close experience in, given my education and work history in the mental health field. It is evident that Pete is trying his best to cope with his breakup while juggling his daily battle in feeling uncomfortable in his own skin. By sharing his struggle with BPD, he is demonstrating enormous courage by revealing his humanity on a very public platform- a vulnerability thats too often ridiculed by criticisms despite his noble efforts of trying to help others. Obviously, helping others and spreading joy through laughter gives him a sense of purpose by helping him cope with not wanting to be on this earth- an earth that has lately been invalidating and capitalizing on his very real and very raw suffering. I hurt when I read his message because anyone with true empathy and compassion can feel his hurt in the way he wrote it- and its something I can relate to in my own ways. I commend the bravery, honesty, and respect that he shows himself in what he needs to do in order to feel okay (deleting his IG, posting his feelings, etc). And for Ariana- Im extremely disappointed in her actions. Im aware that Im just an outsider to this entire situation and of course, not completely informed of all the details, but the authenticity of Petes cry for help cannot be ignored and its transparent that he is truly in pieces. He is trying to help himself by setting clear boundaries with Ariana by directly telling her she is not healthy for his life. But upon hearing about his post, she shows up uninvited anyways, serving as a sadistic reminder of his pain, all while simultaneously tweeting about her new songs release and cracking an ill-mannered joke: perverting care and concern into persistent, twisted darkness by fueling the fire of media frenzy, like throwing bloody meat into a shark tank. Did she really think her actions were truly going to help him? Ariana- I understand that writing songs is your own way of coping with life, however, I found your response to Petes message extremely disrespectful, inconsiderate, and completely lacking in class. If you truly care for Pete in the way you claim, please try to be more mindful of your public impact by listening to his request for relief by respecting his boundaries. So Pete, if you read this somehow, please know that I am praying for your healing and peace. Its wildly unfair and disgusting that your suffering is under the pop culture microscope for the sake of others entertainment and amusement. You may be a comedian but your feelings dont deserve to be violated in this way. Pete- Your life is precious. You make others smile and laugh and forget their own worries. You take shitty circumstances and cleverly craft them into something that brings hope back into this ever-darkening world. Also, you have made impactful strides in the likes of mental health advocacy- a realm I am personally passionate about- and Im so proud of you. Please know that you are seen and supported. You are heard. Not heard for a script or press release or publicity statement but heard as a humble human being who needs some light during this overwhelming darkness that can be so invasive. Your spirit is brave and worthy of happiness. I sincerely hope you find that happiness. You truly deserve comfort, peace, and healing. "
131,vulnerability,mentalhealth,[BADLY NEED ADVICE!] Trying to peacefully co-exist with someone who is VERY difficult and toxic due to undiagnosed mental illness,1,a7cesm,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/a7cesm/badly_need_advice_trying_to_peacefully_coexist/,2018-12-19 03:11:20,"I KNOW THIS IS LONG, PLEEEEEEASE STAY WITH ME! I \*REALLY, REALLY\* need sound advice. Alright, I'm often guilty of rambling when trying to get a situation across, as well as taking forever to get to the point. So I will try to describe my problem in the shortest, most to-the-point way I can. Forgive me! lol. Also, if anybody knows of another sub that I could post in as well that could help me out with this, please do let me know. It'd be much appreciated! Myself and my husband are currently living with his (step) dad. We \*need\* to make this work for about the next 5-6 months. FIL is a VERY difficult person to deal with, I see classic signs of sociopath and paranoid behavior. It is IMPOSSIBLE to appease him, he says extremely hurtful things, completely refuses to feel or show empathy for anybody or anything else besides himself. His view of the world is generally very warped, and it's just impossible to reason with him. He projects his own character flaws onto others as he's definitely in denial about his own self identity and traits, and is very paranoid that everyone else is trying to 'take what's his', and that everyone is out to screw him. He needs to be in control of every situation. If he helps someone else, he is NOT doing it out of the kindness of his heart. Whatever he knows someone needs help with, he will dangle it before this person like a carrot in front of a horse. If you want it, you have to jump through hoops for him... and once you've jumped through those hoops there are 10 more hoops, and then 20. He will NEVER let you forget that he helped you, either. He thrives on drama and shit talking (this is a 65 year old man). He was an addict until about 20 years ago (along with husband's mother, God rest her soul)... and my husband did suffer A LOT of trauma as a child due to their ripping and running, in and out of jail, drug dealing (shoot outs, home invasions, overdoses, police raids) in the house when hubby was a toddler all the way up until he moved out on his own at 17. Now, he (husband) is actually one of the most emotionally balanced people I've ever met, but of course he's going to have some issues due to the trauma he went through. He is definitely not someone who dwells on the past or holds grudges, but sometimes when certain issues that stem from childhood shine through, his stepdad will ask him 'why the hell do you have (this) issue or (that) hangup?' If he mentions anything at all about growing up around the things he did, his stepdad gets VERY VERY defensive, tries to tell him that he made all that stuff up in his head and that it didn't happen, that he's delusional. He (FIL) will cheat and steal from a vulnerable person (ie, his current wife, who he convinced to sign anything she owned of value (cars, an RV she saved her whole life to buy) over to him, and took it out from underneath her, selling them, etc. He thinks everyone is trying to steal from him, but really HE is the person who tries to steal from those who are vulnerable. He thinks everyone is lying to him even when there is no reason or sign that this person is lying, but HE is the one who will sit there and honestly believe his lies. He thrives on putting others down, it's like he enjoys it. During the day when hubby is at work, he (FIL) will hold me conversation hostage and say VERY hurtful things to me about my husband (either complete lies, or little tiny quirks that are blown way out of proportion just to have something negative to say). When hubby comes in from work at night, he does the SAME thing to him except he rips me apart. But of course, when he is confronted about any drama he starts, he will either A) put on the lovable act and claim that 'he didn't mean anything by it, it's just a misunderstanding,' or 'I would NEVER say/do that!' or he will B) get SUPER defensive, 'how you DARE say that about me!!,' 'GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!', and starts a bigger shit storm. SO, I've concluded that he's NOT going to change his ways, I'm NOT going to get him to change, nobody is. It's also not at all productive to call him out on his lies, shit talking, drama, etc because it either gets denied straight out, or a huge huge fight is started. My question is HOW can I deal with him and co-exist \*peacefully\*? I understand that he's going be a shit talker, and I need to learn to let things go in one ear and out the other, though it still hurts hearing someone talk behind my back loud and clear in the next room and not be able to defend myself. I DEFINITELY have a lot of motivation to get our life back to where we need to be so we're able to move out of here ASAP. We have NO choice until at least Spring but to live here. I have a high anxiety level as it is, and hearing him threaten that he's going to kick us out (although he never follows through with any plans, or threats), my anxiety just goes through the roof, I can't deal with uneasiness like this. I'm walking on eggshells 24/7, because it's THAT bad. Something as simple as making a cup of coffee gets torn apart, analyzed, and is used as a topic of shit talking to someone else later on in the day. Things that are totally innocent. I've learned to never show a vulnerability to him, never really tell him what's on my mind, or let him help me ANY more than I \*absolutely\* need (ie, letting us live here for a few months, NOTHING MORE). Something as simple as him offering and buying someone lunch, will later turn into ""So &amp; so was begging me to buy them lunch because they're so terrible with money. Can you believe it? Yea, they ordered a slice of pizza. Can you imagine? Why are they so broke that they can't afford to buy a slice of pizza?!"" when he insisted upon buying that slice of pizza. &amp;#x200B; Is there ANY way to keep the conversation neutral with him?"
132,vulnerability,mentalhealth,I'm paying for therapy out-of-pocket so that my parents don't find out.

And if you haven't guessed it already by the way I'm phrasing all this: the reasons I'm going to therapy include my parentsand obviously, I care about hiding my therapy from them enough to go to pretty great lengths. Such as paying the bill out-of-pocket every week rather than filing for reimbursement (which they'd see every week and ask about). I spent the past couple hours researching Medicaid, thinking I'd sign up for that rather than having to tell my parents and asking for their money. That's when I knew this was getting a little out of hand. I started posting on a couple forums like, ""Heyhere's my situationI'm actually not *impoverished* at all, I just happen to qualify for Medicaid because I live minimalistically and work part-time and am young (but am super privileged/educated/etc), so it feels unethical to sign upWhat do you think?"" And everyone's basically like ""YOU are the SCUM of the EARTH that EVERY politician is using as their bad example!!"" Lol. So I guess I'm wondering for you guys' advice or similar experiences (first post here btw). It's really kinda dumbI *chose* my minimal lifestyle so I could work less and have more time for my art and wellbeing, but now that I've started going to therapy, it pretty much puts me back at square 1 in terms of my expenses and hours worked per week (that is, when I pay out-of-pocket rather than tell my parents). I guess I should also talk to my therapist about this, duh. I mean, the broader takeaway is that I have huge issues with feeling dependent on my parents in any way and also have hidden literally years and years of my 'true' self from them (misery, loneliness, vulnerability, gender/sexuality things they never knew about, existential crises they never heard of, etc), so feel *super* uncomfortable at the thought of them knowing. Because I've hidden everything so well, they'd be *so* confused. Like, the one or two times I've tried to bring up past events that've affected me much differently than I let on at the time, my mom laughed and was confused and jokingly mentioned going to therapy about it. Lol. Not knowing that yes, I *am*, actually, going to therapy about thatrip. Anyway. What do think?"

I inserted a link to the video if you care to watch. As a-lot of young adults in this day I suffer from anxiety(aswell as some seasonal depression). I dont like to tell people because Ive been from a young age that mental illness is equivalent to being weak. This, especially in the black community, is a huge problem. Mental illness is hidden and thought of as a phase that if ignored it will go away. Thats simply just not the truth. Vulnerability is something that Ive struggled with for a very long time. A-lot of times I put up a front so that people dont know to much. But after catching this while filming and editing and what not. I realized its a perfect representation of what anxiety can look like. Dont be afraid to ask for help because the first step to getting better is talking about and addressing the problem. Dont be afraid or feel weak when it comes to mental illness you are not less than because of it. Feel free to message me and talk to me if you need to.

I'm currently on a mental health program that connected me to some amazing therapists, whom I trust very much and have been helping me immensely since we started working together. I also have been going to group therapy sessions, where I've been able to open up a little bit with other people. Throughout my whole life I've been the type of person who doesn't share much about my problems, even with close friends. It's gone so bad that I haven't been reaching out to my friends at all. My goal at the moment is to learn how to rely on other people more, and not feel like a burden while doing so. But my problem is that this fear of vulnerability I have is physically paralyzing. I had a group session yesterday where I didn't share much at all, but in my head I had so much to talk about. Even when I WANT to do it, it's almost like my mouth isn't connected to my brain and won't move. The worst way this has manifested was during a crisis in which I was feeling so depressed and anxious, that I was basically stuck in my bed for days, barely moving at all, and dissociating away. Does anyone goes through something similar? I'm going to bring this up with my therapist but I want to hear from other people too. Any advice on how to cope with this would be awesome. Cheers!"

Due to a protracted career transition and resulting GAD/depression, I attended a group therapy offered by a hospital early this year. I asked a CBT question the way I would have in any classroom setting, but was repeatedly put down in the next couple of months by counselor S (RSW) when she was not able to answer my question. She berated other patients as well. My family doctor learnt about my experience and requested the hospital assign another counselor to me for 1:1 sessions. So I went to see counselor Y (RSW) for the first time this past Oct. There are a number of things that make me dread of seeing her again. 1. At the beginning of the session, she asked about the incident with counselor S and responded ""She (Y) is the team lead. Thanks for the feedback."" During the session, I talked about traumatic life experience and my vulnerability. At the end of the session, she made a comment in high pitch voice ""regarding S, I was not there. I don't know what took place. Counseling is not about knowledge, it is about relationship."" I felt betrayed, angry, and fearful that I was speechless. 2. When I talked about traumatic life experience, I mentioned that I had come to realization about human nature that made me stronger. She said ""I am not being judgmental. I am several years older than you."" and then she went on preaching her personal worldview and values. I found her condescending and controlling, and myself feeling more inadequate. I will have another appointment at the beginning of Jan, with her and the psychotherapist at the clinics to finalize the assessment and treatment plan. Then I will be supposed to see her 1:1 for 12 sessions. There are limited counseling alternatives covered by OHIP. What should I do? "
140,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Lesson learned: Do not show vulnerability to anyone but a paid professional. Everyone else will eventually use your weaknesses against you.,1,a3lxog,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/a3lxog/lesson_learned_do_not_show_vulnerability_to/,2018-12-06 18:55:23,"Don't do it. Trust me. Every day I hear comments from people I have trusted, who use what I have told them to further prove whatever negative point they have against me. I overshare, so it's really all my fault. Still. Some examples: \- Telling a coworker I trusted about being abused as a child (because they were, too and they brought it up first). Few weeks later, he brought up the fact that I was abused as the reason why I am ""oversensitive about everything"" in the middle of an argument with other coworkers involved. \- Admitting to a coworker that I am very sensitive about certain topics (he was involved in the argument mentioned previously). Telling the same coworker that I struggle to approach some people and some people find it hard to approach me because I don't understand social queues (I did frankly as him and someone else what I should do to come off as more friendly). Few weeks later, he brings up a topic I have an opinion on that he doesn't agree with. He uses the fact that I'm hard to approach and clueless about social skills, to justify not wanting to talk with me, after getting angry at me for having a different opinion than his. \- Telling a coworker that I have depression (because she had it too, allegedly and she brought it up). I also once told her that I feel like many people dislike me in the office. Today, I was dealing with a very upsetting situation and I couldn't focus on anything but what was going on. Coworker lets me know that she will leave the company. I wished her luck and good success in her future plans. She got mad at me for not being more inquisitive about her decision, and used my depression and the fact that I feel isolated (her words: ""Everyone is against you"") as a reason why I'm not nice for not being more excited and curious about her life. I'm only gonna mention those since I think those coworkers won't see this so sorta anonymous, but it happens at home too, and in my relationship too. All the time. So please, save yourself. Don't bother sharing anything with anyone. They will eventually use it against you. Keep it all for yourself, share with random strangers on the internet you won't ever engage in a conversation with, or talk to a paid professional. Have a good night. "
141,vulnerability,mentalhealth,I wish I didn't hurt people because people hurt me.

I haven't decided on wether this will be a throwaway account but depending on the responses I'll get, I'll decide eventually. I hate being vulnerable and this will probably be the odd ball of all my posts but I've been around reddit and it's... one of the more understanding communities about mental health to say the least. Before I start this post, I'm gonna just put this out here right now; I am only here to vent and ask for other people's support. I'm not in danger and I'm not being harmed. I just... really need other people's opinions on what I'm about to say. Another thing I wanna say: I do talk about my **suicide attempts** and sometimes about **child abuse/sexual abuse** *(not incest but it is cocsa... kinda)* and **guilt tripping/manipulation.** If you are sensitive to that, please don't read this. I don't know you but I care about your mental health and I don't want you to worry about me if it will strain you. You're not my therapists, you're all individuals with their own problems and their own lives. Alright, let's give some context. I'm not really an average 16 year old guy but to be honest, no one is really ""average"". In the span of three months I've been hospitalized inpatient and outpatient, I got diagnosed with four different illnesses, and I'm taking three types of medications. It's the first time I ever felt like I got the care and help I needed for myself in such a long time. Not to go into detail but I've been traumatized by my father and I've had depression since I was 10. 10. I remember being a fourth grader and crying in a closet and trying to choke myself out of consciousness. I remember shoplifting food and clothes because he would never buy me anything or if he did he would make me feel guilty or unworthy of what I got. I remember getting yelled at for crying because he hurt me and he would drag me to my room and slam the door which made me cry harder. That's how badly I was broken at the time. I felt like things continuously got worse when I hit the big double digits. I met my now ex boyfriend (who used to be my ex girlfriend but he's transgender so I thought I was still ""straight"".) and to make things easier let's call him ""Squirrelly."" Squirrelly didn't hesitate showing me pornographic material and it was already bad with my parents constantly fighting and exposing me to enough content already that looking at it made me... completely different in such a deranged way. Eventually, I would send them back to him and I would get extremely creepy with him. Telling Squirrelly to kiss me, to touch me, showing him porn I've written, and he felt pressured to be in a relationship with me. When he broke up with me because he couldn't handle it, I lost it. I'm not going to lie, I abused him, and this abuse made him victim #1. I would yell at Squirrelly, I would out him to his mom who was transphobic, I made everyone turn his back against him and when the same things happened to me, I lashed out at him specifically. Squirrelly now lives much farther away from me in Ohio and while I've apologized and we used to be friends, he's doing his own thing now. And I'm proud of him. I thought this was just a huge disaster and it would be a one time thing. It didn't stop there. I wish it did. A few years later in middle school, I came out of the closet as bisexual and my parents... really didn't understand me at all. So I went to a LGBT group therapy with their consent. And I met my sexual abuser there. I don't even want to give him a name. He doesn't deserve anything. I was 13 and he was 17 and he made me do so much disgusting shit for him that I'm not even going to say what he did for your sanity and mine. I thought I was mature and I got completely attached to him. It took me so long to even realize what happened was abuse. It was... a really dark time for me. I didn't know how to express my feelings so I kept breaking down in the group and I made everyone very uncomfortable. Slowly people have stopped coming until one guy was left. And then the group was shut down. I think I became even worse than when I was with my ex boyfriend. I should have gotten a therapist, I should have told someone, I should have told anyone. It bottled up in me and I kept up with it so much that I felt like I got a huge crack in this bottle of a body of mine. Whenever I got too overfilled, I flooded everyone with my emotions. But that would happen at the worst time. Which with my luck... was a few months away. I met my victim #2 on an NSFW tag of a popular video game that year. Let's call him ""Wolfy"". He was ten years older than me and he was married but I became instantly attached to him. I would talk to Wolfy daily using the anonymous setting for asks, send him NSFW asks, I would constantly talk about him with my friends and add him as a subject to my daily life. It was a matter of months until I had a full blown obsession with him. I knew it wasn't right. I knew but I kept going anyways because for the first time after my sexual abuse and being rejected by the rest of the group, I felt like I met someone who truly understood and liked me, despite knowing nothing about me. Eventually, I was honest with myself and I confessed to Wolfy that I was a minor and I'd stay away from his NSFW content and I thought he was going to yell at me or call me disgusting or tell me to fuck off but he was... strangely understanding and he thanked me for being so honest. I wish Wolfy was mean to me. I wish he could have just confronted me saying what I did was horrible and he never wanted me to be around him again. It would have been much easier. I kept talking to him not using anonymous and eventually, he got fed up. He was very annoyed with me and he would go offline to just avoid talking to me. I eventually got the hint and left the website later after I got into other drama. 2016 was a really hard year for me mentally. I was... a horrible person as an understatement. All of my past friends left me because I constantly suicide baited, made every topic depressing, manipulated, guilt tripped, had a victim complex, and I said I would ""reflect"" and ""change myself"" when in reality I just moved to Twitter and stopped showing my horrible traits upfront until it's too late for them. It's so funny, I know why I'm like this but I don't know why I never get help for myself and finally stop myself for once. We're halfway now, if you're still reading this... thank you. If you hate me, I understand and I'm genuinely not mad at you. Now this is the part of the story where I'm... extremely depressed to say and the reason I made this post in the first place. I met victim #3. And this hurts me to say next because this used to be an actual nickname for him. Let's call him ""Sharky."" And this was the part I knew I had to get my shit together. After I hurt him, I never wanted to hurt anyone else and I seeked immediate help. I want Sharky to be the last victim from me. I wish I could apologize to him, I wish I could just give him everything he wanted, I wish I could just erase every pain he's been through, from me and his other problems. But life doesn't work like that. If a time machine existed, I'd erase his trauma and then mine and make sure we never cross paths. Later, I'd help to erase everyone else's trauma. I don't know. I feel like I'm such a horrible person but for some reason, I do things out of the sole goodness left in my heart. I do favors for people without them asking, I buy people gifts because I love them, I support them when I'm able to, I try to be a good person whenever I can. But I was never truly a ""good person."" I was a bad person with a mask, a mask that was supposed to stay on my face forever. He was... the kindest and most affectionate person I ever knew and he helped me with so much in my life. He helped me become more comfortable with myself, he loved me when my parents couldn't, he let me vent about my problems, and he did a horrible mistake. He fell in love with me and asked me out and eventually I fell in love with him. Everyday I regret doing what I did to him. We dated for a year and a month and during that we were both in our own personal hell. My mom's been slowly developing a personality disorder and she replaced my Dad a few months after he abandoned us. She yelled at me, insulted me, threatened me, she hurt me. So. Fucking. Much. I felt like everyday I was in hell. With my school life and my home life stressing me the fuck out, I unloaded a lot onto Sharky. He was an excellent boyfriend. He went through the same things as me so he gave me a lot of coping mechanisms and tried to help me as much as he could. I wish I listened to him. I wish I could have done a lot of things but that's one good thing about confrontation and bad experiences like this. I know what to do now. Like Victim #1 and Victim #2, we were also extremely sexual towards each other. It was extremely consensual at first, knowing we were both sexual abuse victims, we didn't try to hurt one another. And it was an amazing first few months. Because of what we did, we were both very confident and trustful with each other and our relationship was at it's prime. That was until the new year started. January and February were extremely hard months for him as he was constantly suicidal due to his friends being toxic, him not having good coping skills, and simply struggling to stay alive. I was extremely anxious and I developed a lot of paranoia around my electronics (we had a long distance relationship, me living somewhere with PST and him CST.) thinking if I left them alone or turned them off, something bad would happen to be or him. I felt like I had to save him every time he wanted to kill myself and I strained myself so much over this. Do not get me wrong, I am not blaming him for being suicidal. He had a very hard life and he understood why I worried so much about him. It's what I did afterwards. Due to me almost losing him several times, I would set notifications on his social media for him and stalk every post, trying to 'save' him when he talked about being suicidal and he got fed up with that. It lasted for months until he lashed out at me and refused to post anything on social media until I finally turned it off. I feel like that was the start of something horrible. I got extremely possessive of him and I would be extremely toxic to him to the point it started affecting him mentally. I would guilt trip, manipulate, develop a victim complex, and even suicide baited him when I was in extreme emotional distress. He couldn't take it anymore, of course. Eventually due to the stress, he needed an escape but it was hard for him since that he felt obligated to call me everyday. He slowly started to fall out of love with me and he fell in love with someone else. A month or two after that, he broke up with me. But he did foreshadow it. Saying we really need to talk about our future and talking about how I've been emotionally straining him and we need to take a break or to stop doing things for a while. I was... devastated. I couldn't comprehend why someone who was so attached to me and so in love with me could just... stop loving me like that. I've developed extremely bad abandonment issues due to my past and it's still affecting me heavily in my life today. I recreated the nightmare that happened with Squirrelly to Sharky. And I... I fucking hate myself for saying this but I abused him. And the worst part is, I'm aware of knowing when I do shitty stuff, and it's the truth but... I felt completely blind because I truly thought I ""changed"" from 2016. Our friendship got worse within the span of when we broke up to now. From saying he didn't want to be best friends with me anymore and then friends with me and now he absolutely despises me and I know and understand why. I hurt him so badly when he left because I was struck with jealousy and hatred and I had so much negative emotions corrupting me and I kept exploding and lashing out at everyone I came across. I told everyone about everything and word goes fast. He found out eventually and he got mad at me for holding so many things and secrets and lies from him. Then he opened my eyes. And this was the part I'm very scared of admitting. I pressured him into sex for months and the worst part is I didn't even know. I thought it was consensual all the time but I started adding the puzzle pieces together and I came to the conclusion that after all the time I emotionally drained him, he started becoming afraid of telling the truth to me in order to not hurt me. He's been wanting to get away from me for months. He's been wanting to just be happy again. He's been wanting to me around me... but the person he knew, his boyfriend who was sweet and shy and even innocent at times, not his friend who constantly made him feel like shit because he did things that made him happy and I didn't approve of it. When I found out, I felt myself go numb and when I finally felt something I couldn't stop crying. It felt like hours. Our relationship rotted away. It wasn't healthy. I'm not healthy. I'm very happy Sharky's away from me to be honest. One day I'd love to come talk to him one day but that's not going to happen for a long time. I'm respecting his last wishes which was to leave him and his friends alone. I'm going to be honest with you, I love him so much. Even now. It hurts but I do respect him a lot and I haven't been on any of his social media and I finally removed his contact from my phone. I think even when I eventually get all the help I need and I never go back to doing what I did, I'm still going to leave him alone. I don't want to hurt him again, I don't want to hurt anyone that comes my way ever again. He deserves the best in his life. Even if I contributed to his worst. Now what's happening? Well. It's been... around a week since he left along with his friends and their confrontations telling me that I need help, to never come back to them until I've actually changed, to never come back in general, and just... a lot of fuck offs and shut ups. I haven't changed at all but I did take measures to get help. I'm going to therapy again for two times a week. I have a journal I write all my vents in and I think it's honestly such a good idea since it gives me a release and it helps me improve my writing and my drawing. Whenever I'm in emotional distress or an argument, I either take a break for a few minutes or just let them be angry. I also try to notice bad habits of myself like taking people's weaknesses and using them for an advantage or telling them I'll kill myself if they leave or because they pissed me off and my therapist is going to help me with them. I don't vent to my friends or family anymore, only therapists and psychiatrists since they're trained to handle a lot of vulnerability and my friends are people with normal lives. I'm also trying to focus on my mental health and physical health while also distracting myself and getting back into the hobbies I dropped when I got extremely depressed. I also try to actually listen to people with coping skills or things that can actually help me. Like seriously, I used to cope with a lot of self depricating humor and ""trauma edits"" (pictures that vague about childhood trauma) and it barely helped me. I'm still the same person I was in 2016. But that doesn't mean I'm completely hopeless. I know I can be a better person but I need to actually jumpstart and do what I need to do to become someone who's benign. And like the title of this post said, I know why I hurt people. Because when I was younger, people hurt me in similar ways and I never recovered from that truly despite being in a therapist's office for four years now??? That doesn't mean that what my Dad did, what He did, or what anyone who abandoned, left, neglected, insulted, threatened, hurt, etc. me did will affect me in my present and future. Like don't get me wrong I have very bad PTSD and I have nightmares and flashbacks constantly but the first thing I have to do is drop my grudges and actually let myself forgive people. Which is why with my Mom, I'm going to go back to my home country for a while and finally... forgive my Dad for what he did. We actually talked a while back and while I was scared... I felt hopeful for the future. I felt like if I could be able to drop what my Dad did, I can truly be unstoppable. I can truly move on and let myself heal from the scars that have been afflicted on me. For my mom, she's also getting help for her disorder and I've been really happy with her and she's been really happy with me. Yeah, we still get in fights but she's said she's proud of me a lot from how much I've grown. I don't understand but I appreciate it nonetheless. For me going back to my country, it can either be a month from two years. To be honest, I don't mind the two years anymore (despite being at a risk to get put to death) but it's most likely just going to be a month. If I don't come back to post on this account after January, I'm either: 1. Still in the Country 2. Dead (From Youtube Crimes). Hopefully after that, I can finally become a good person without wearing a mask to hide anything. I want to be the opposite of who I am now. Someone who's honest, safe, healthy, I want to get help and I'm on a pretty good roll. I really like my new therapist now. I'll try to write down my progress in my vent journal. The year did end on a bad note but years can have bad ends but good starts and good middles. That's how it is sometimes. Sharky, Wolfy, Squirrelly, if you're reading this somehow and you think it's about you, I'm so, so sorry about hurting you. I would absolutely give you guys a more indepth apology but I want to wait until I actually do change. There's not a lot an apology can do if the problem is still happening. It might take months or even years but... I'll truly be able to face you guys when I finally become the better person I'm working on becoming to be. And to anyone who's reading this that's sympathizing with me/relating with me, please know it's never too late to become a better person. I mean, it might seem like it if you think your friends are never going to come back or you did a mistake you can never be forgiven from but even if you won't be accepted or forgiven from, you can still save yourself from hurting other people and it doesn't matter what they think. Change yourself and become a better person because YOU want to. YOU want to be a better person. YOU never want to hurt anyone else ever again. YOU want to see yourself improve. YOU want your life to be happy and successful. If YOU want to be a better person, find a support system, get some help, learn about coping skills, it's never too late. I'm a sexually abusive creep who seriously needs social skills class and more hugs from his parents but I believe in myself and I believe in you. It's going to take a while but just because you've been making mistakes for the 1/5th of your life, doesn't mean you can't fix them and redeem yourself for the rest. Listen to me, we're going to be okay. If you want, you can even message me if I'm stable enough and I can help with whatever you want! Coping skills? Got em. Need someone to listen? I'm here. Need to get away with murder? Ehh, wrong subreddit... I think I'm done writing here. I'm really sorry if this was all way too long and confusing. I know you barely know me but it's okay to have whatever opinion you have about me. Wether you hate me or you think I'm inspirational or ""Jesus Christ this kid really needs help"", I wanted to confess what's been going on and I want to reach for support from an online community and see their opinion for the last time before I focus solely on my therapist and psychiatrist and also myself! Thank you so much if you're actually reading this until the end. I'm going to assume only five people or less will probably care about this but... it's okay. At least I can have five people or less's feedback. Have a good morning/afternoon/night, stay safe, and remember if someone out there doesn't love you, I do. I love you and I think you're doing the best you can do. See you later."

Yeah. About that... You love her hypomania, her kinky sex and high sex drive, her willingness to do whatever, her fun impulsiveness. Her eating disorder makes her body look good and her personality disorder makes her treat you like a god. Her anxiety is cute, you want to hold her when she is sad and vulnerable, you want to protect her from the demons in her head so you can feel like a hero. You want her to need you. I get why you want that! Its fine to like to feel needed and like youre helping someone. But you dont like it when her problems stop being cute. When she cant hold down a job, doesnt leave her house for days, when her hair is a mess and her eyes have giant bags under them and she hasnt showered in almost a week. It annoys you when she doesnt want to talk to anyone, her emotions are irrational and childish and she just feels too much. Sometimes she hates you. You have tried everything you can think of for the past week but she isnt fine yet. It turns out her depression and anxiety arent cute and dont go away with a hug. Her eating habits are terrible and you finally realize that bulimia and anorexia arent cute either. The sexual abuse she was a victim of for years as a child has more consequences than being kinky and letting you get off whenever you want. She has nightmares, flashbacks, trust and intimacy issues and her triggers are everywhere. Why is she still hurting herself and why does she want to die, youre here, is that not enough for her? Even though she tries her best to be what you want she cant live up to it. You dont want a mentally ill girl. You want a manic pixie dream girl who only pays attention to you but isnt clingy, who wants to please you (and only you), who is impulsive in a fun way only and who doesnt have any strong negative traits or behaviours as a result of their mental illness. Good luck finding her, if I were you Id start in the young adult section at the library. ^^^^^- Look, Im not saying were bad people for being mentally ill (because were not) or that youre bad people for liking these things. But mental illness isnt a cute quirk or personality trait. And the disorders are attached to a human person with their own personality, thoughts, memories and experiences. They arent a DIY project for you to make the perfect person out of. You can definitely date mentally ill people. You can be there during recovery, relapses and more recovery. You can be support. But you cannot cure them and magically fix their issues, their illnesses are called illnesses for a reason and you need to realize that. Also, I think I need to say this so yeah, obviously its not anyone elses responsibility to deal with someones mental issues. If youre treated badly by a significant other, even if theyre doing it as a result of an illness, its not okay and you dont deserve that. It might be more difficult for some people to not do bad things but thats not an excuse. Mental illnesses affect us but they dont mean we cant or shouldnt be expected to treat people right. Mental illness is a part of life. And sure, its good if you can love someone else not despite their issues but including them. But you need to understand what it is and get that romanticized verion out of your head. And please dont go around saying you love broken girls. It just makes you sound like an idiot or someone whos into vulnerability and apathy because it lets you do whatever unethical shit you want. Its not cool. Thanks."

My son tried to commit suicide yesterday. His mother found him in his room with a cord wrapped around his neck. He was choking himself. Thankfully he wasn't hanging from anywhere. 911 was called and they took him to the hospital. Thankfully, he is okay. I am hurt and angry. I am afraid. He said he didn't want to live anymore because his girlfriend broke up with him. Or attempted to rather. He basically pulled the ""if you break up with me I will kill myself"" line. She ended up coming to the hospital to be by his side. He is currently on a 72 hour hold and we hope he makes the most of his time there. He is on medication for his depression and anxiety. He needs to see a therapist, but how do you get an 18 year old to realize they need help and to get the most out of that help, they need to be willing to open up. Opening up means vulnerability. Opening up means trusting the person, and he has a lot of trust issues. I have been a part of his life for the last 3 years. Before I came along their lives were chaotic and in upheaval all the time. Now with me, they have a calm, peaceful and more importantly, stable life to be a part of. This kid has tested me beyond what I have ever been tested. But I haven't gone anywhere. I have been in the picture, maintaining that stability. I love him like he is my own son. I am just at a loss as to what I should do. I am doing my best to be supportive, to be there. But I can't stand by and watch him break. How can I get him to realize his life is important, that he matters? That he needs to think about himself &amp; not rely on a woman to make him happy? He has stated that he isn't happy without her. Why should she be guilted into staying? That isn't fair to her either. Again, I just needed to vent, so thank you for reading."
145,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Told my best friend not to talk to me until he is stable...,1,9g1p6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9g1p6i/told_my_best_friend_not_to_talk_to_me_until_he_is/,2018-09-16 00:06:00,"I'm stressing over here. I want to know that I did the right thing, and if I didn't someone please set me straight. I'm kinda ADD, so I apologize in advance if this gets really wordy and ends up all over the place. I am going to summarize as best I can, and if you would like to know anything more in depth, just ask. I'm sorry that this will be so long and I want to thank anyone in advance who chooses to read this. I am a 39F, and my best friend is/was (?) 36M. We have known each other since we were kids (he was my little brother's friend). While in our 20s we owned a business together. We had a blowup and didn't speak for 10 years (there was a psychological trigger that spawned from his childhood) but we reconnected a couple years ago and have been very close. For the record, we are not sexually attracted to each other, and never have been. We text and talk on the phone daily. He is on Reddit and I hope he doesn't see this, as he is into psychology, but if he does see this, at least he will know my true feelings. He is a very intense person, he scores very high on tests regarding neuroticism and has very high anxiety. He enjoys smoking weed and opiates as well. For the last 15 years he has lived on the west coast on a large piece of property that is rather secluded from the rest of humanity. We are both from the midwest, where I still reside. He enjoys working remote (from home) IT jobs. He has admitted that he likes it that way so he can do what he wants (I think that means whatever drugs whenever he wants). The problem is, as you can imagine, he hasn't been very successful with these jobs. He is able to maintain his large property because his partners in a previous business bought him out (he couldn't get along with them... imagine that) and it made him rather wealthy. He wants nothing more in this life than to have a family - a two parent house hold with children. I believe he desperately wants this because he didn't have that stability growing up, as his father (who he describes as ""crazy"" \[I believe he's often homeless\]) was never around. He got married several years ago, it didn't last, and she left him, there were no kids. He has had other girlfriends, particularly two in the last year. They have both left him, one rather recently. The most recent one is in her 20s and has two young kids. He only wants to date young girls because he so desperately wants a family, that he feels that the ones in their 20s are his best chance (they're also on a different maturity level...... so to me that's a possible issue). He gets really intense about any opinion or belief he has, to the point where he starts yelling about such things, but he doesn't see himself as yelling. I believe he doesn't realize he is yelling because that is his baseline ""normal"". For me, I've learned to kind of ignore/blow off the yelling, because I know that's just how he is, but he seems to scare the girlfriends when this escalates and he's actually angry. I have explained to him that I have ended relationships with the snap of a finger when guys show me that side of them, because it's scary (my son's dad hit me one time, I left him immediately but have been scarred mentally since). He doesn't seem to understand how women can just walk out on him like they do. I don't understand how he doesn't understand that. He even literally feels that there should be ""laws"" or something about how if you're married (he wasn't married to the recent gf) that you can't just walk out and leave someone, that you should have to do counseling and etc. I think this stems from his wife walking out on him. He often refers to our grandparent's generation and how people ""made it work"". I am not exactly sure when he got married but I think it was like 5-6 years ago and it lasted maybe 1-2 years (he and I weren't really talking during this time). He has not gotten over the divorce and it seems to eat at his core. He seems to always blame women and society for the reasons why his relationships fail. I understand that 2018 isn't equivalent to a 1950s sitcom, but there is of course a difference between now and then. People and society as a whole IS much more degenerate than it was then - or at least it's more obvious. I try to explain to him that back in the 50s, they often ""made it work"" but that people were miserable because divorce was so frowned upon that they just suffered. \[Although I would love to be wrong about this, I know I am not. After all, I choose to not life my life with regrets - but there is one regret that I do have, which is that my son was raised without his father around and we struggled so much. My son is now 20 and doesn't like that I feel that sense of regret, but he didn't grow up in a two parent household in the suburbs with a stay at home mom like I did - so he doesn't know any different.\] Anyway, let's talk about drug use... Aside from his high neuroticism, anxiety and ADD, he has another issue that is caused by marijuana use (it is self diagnosed but I believe it to be 100% accurate because based on his symptoms, he absolutely meets the criteria) which is Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome. I won't go into the details of the syndrome, as you can look it up yourself, but basically CBD builds up in the system and you start having the opposite effect that you'd want from marijuana, meaning, when you smoke because of your anxiety, your anxiety actually just gets worse, and then you smoke more to fix that increased anxiety and well, you can imagine how out of control this cycle can get. He also suffers from some chronic pain issues, namely his hands (he works in IT and types a lot) and a somewhat recent knee injury. He doesn't have insurance and hasn't because he can't keep a stable job and he has too many assets for medicaid. Because of this, he chooses to self medicate for pain with opiates. He doesn't care what kind of opiates, just anything he can get his hands on. He also loves stimulant ADD meds because he's able to focus (I totally understand that, because I've taken them before and do occasionally when I really need to focus, and yes I have a legit script in my name). Anyway, around the time the girlfriend situation was getting bad I believe his drug use was ramping up. Since I live 1700 miles away from him, I don't really know what drugs he does on a daily basis, as he doesn't really like to admit how often he takes drugs other than weed but I know him well enough to know. I know for sure that he was smoking more weed, as that he will admit. He did admit to taking his dog's trazadone prescription in order to try and sleep - as he will often go days without sleeping. One day, a few weeks ago, his once best friend (who is in the midwest where I am) died of a possibly heroin overdose. Around that same time, his girlfriend broke it off with him. He was so upset when his friend died that I think he was so anxious and tuned up that he probably scared her off - he was so upset that she left him at such a time of vulnerability, and I feel bad for him that that happened, but I can't help but wonder if his manic behavior sky rocketed and she just couldn't take it anymore. So he came to town for the funeral (a couple weeks ago) and stayed with me for a couple days, and his mom for a couple days. He didn't sleep at all during the days he was at my house, and then when he stayed with him mom he didn't sleep there either. He went back to the west coast and seemed to start losing his mind (not sure how else to put it). He waited for me to get off work every day so he could call and vent about things. I would take his calls and answer his texts (as best I could while at work) because I wanted to be supportive because I knew how upset he was. He constantly obsessed over women and how they are the ones who cause the problems and how society encourages this behavior out of women and the overall degeneracy in society these days. For the last couple months, and especially over the last month, I have begged him to seek professional help for his mental health. His excuse was always ""I don't have insurance"" even though he has plenty of money and has no problem spending it on stuff that provides instant gratification. About a week ago he decided he could no longer stay living out there on his secluded property out west, and that he was going to take his dog and some clothes and head east to stay with his mom for a while (his mom is married, she's super awesome, and she's a therapist). He had made a couple comments to me about how he just wants to jump off a bridge, and etc. I would reassure him that life will get better, and he'd assure me that he knew it would as well. It is important to note that part of leaving his property behind, he also decided to stop smoking weed. He knew that the cannabis hyperemesis was becoming detrimental to his mental and physical health, so he quit smoking the day he left town. He said he wanted to get clean and get his head straight. Good! I should also note that I was a light marijuana user (just at night after work, and a little on the weekends) and I told him that I'd quit when he did. I began using it for GI pain relief when I had an acute illness last fall, and I started using it more frequently than I wanted to. I had begun taking sublingual CBD oil which seemed to keep the medicinal effect going, without the high. So I quit when he quit. Cool. I have a medical license in my state, I am not a doctor or a therapist, but I do hold a license and I had to go through a lot of training for it - which included it being driven in my head that I have a duty to report threats of suicide, etc. I did not make the choice to report because I knew that he really did not want to die, that he just needed to get out of there and get around some family and friends in real life (vs phone and texts). So, he gets to his mom's, just a couple days ago. He was still so manic, and hadn't slept in days. He drove 1700 miles to here in two days, and only got a hotel once, where he wasn't even able to sleep. He told me the other day that he had been taking the dog's trazadone to sleep (even though he still doesn't sleep), despite assuring me in the past weeks that he'd only use it occasionally. He also said he was taking ritalin during the day. Not sure whose ritalin script he has, but he isn't under the care of a doctor, so it's not his. On Thursday (two days ago), I told him that for someone who says they're ""clean"" - he sure doesn't sound ""clean"" to me. I told him he really needs to truly get clean and get his head clear. I encouraged him to seek out a doctor and just pay the damn office fee (he can afford to fly her for a funeral, fly back, and then drive across country, so why can't he afford a couple office visits?). He realized that I was right, and he called around to find an affordable doctor office. He called one free clinic that apparently wasn't taking new patients, he told me this and was disappointed. I told him to keep looking or just go to his mom's doctor and pay the fee. So he tells me later in the day that he got an appointment with another free clinic on Saturday (today). Awesome! Well, oddly I didn't hear from him on Thursday night. To be honest, he had been giving me so much anxiety with his problems that I didn't reach out to him either - I was happy to have a break. I figured he was spending time with his mom, and hopefully she was helping him by letting him talk and vent to her. I was wrong... Yesterday morning he told me that he ended up getting detained because he told the first clinic that he called that he was suicidal. At some point between that phone call and after he made the 2nd where he made his Saturday appointment, the police came. He texted me on my way to work yesterday morning saying that he was detained because he was suicidal and he was FURIOUS. He said they eventually let him go because he had the Saturday appointment, after all, he was calling because he wanted help, which the ER staff and police realized once they looked into it, but everyone involved followed proper protocol because they had to. He was angry texting me about how absolutely absurd the whole thing was and how none of it should have ever happened and he was never going to pay the bill for whatever services were rendered because the whole thing was bullshit and etc. You get the idea. This triggered me, as I had been struggling with the fact that he had mentioned suicide to me and I chose not to report. Again, I did not believe he wanted to do it, which is why I didn't say anything. Some of you may be upset at me for this, but I still believe that I did the right thing and aside from his mother, I know him better than anyone else. I told him that he is absolutely responsible for that bill, and the police and everyone involved did the right thing and that \*I\* should have also reported him. I don't work in the medical field anymore, but I still carry a license. - he didn't know that, and I don't think he understood that mandatory reporting is a thing that exists. Anyway, he got extremely angry with me for ""siding with the police"" and I was extremely angry back at him because not only did I put myself at risk but not reporting him myself, but I also 100% understand and agree with the people who did report and detain him! I reminded him that my ex (who he knew) was suicidal once and I got him involuntarily committed and put on a 72 hour hold so I take these things very seriously. I told him I knew he didn't want to kill himself which is why I didn't report, but legally I should have so he should be glad that I didn't, and instead I tried to talk him through things and encouraged him to seek help - which he did! All of this was now making me incredibly anxious, and angry, so among other things (such as you need to get off all drugs and quit blaming women and everyone else for his problems), I told him to not speak to me again until he got stabilized, and then I stopped responding and I didn't read his responses until this morning. His responses included telling me not to worry, that he won't contact me again as well as saying that he appreciated me being a good listener and etc, and that he won't contact me again until he is stabilized. I had so much anxiety all day yesterday, not to mention the recent anxiety he has caused me with all of his problems. I don't want to abandon him like his girlfriends seem to, but I just can't take it anymore and my mental health is also important. This morning I'm having mixed feelings. I feel like I should respond to him and tell him that all I wanted to ever do is be supportive and help, but I just can't take it anymore, and that I have my own issues and his are starting to make me feel worse. I don't know what I really expect by way of responses on this, and maybe I'm just writing it as a type of therapy for myself. &amp;#x200B; Thoughts, Redditors? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

[Watson K](URL [Nasca C](URL [Aasly L](URL [McEwen B](URL [Rasgon N](URL ### [Author information](URL ### Abstract Depressive disorders constitute a set of debilitating diseases with psychological, societal, economic and humanitarian consequences for millions of people worldwide. Scientists are beginning to understand the reciprocal communication between the brain and the rest of the body in the etiology of these diseases. In particular, scientists have noted a connection between depressive disorders, which are primarily seen as brain-based, and, insulin resistance (IR), a modifiable metabolic inflammatory state that is typically seen as peripheral. We highlight evidence showing how treating IR, with drugs or behavioral interventions, may ameliorate or possibly prevent, depressive disorders and their long-term consequences at various stages of the life course. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Metabolic Impairment as Risk Factors for Neurodegenerative Disorders.' **Highlights** - IR is a pathological proinflammatory state underlying neuropsychiatric and somatic diseases - IR is part of a cascade of allostatic load, which is mediated in the periphery and CNS - PPAR-  receptors, glutamate, cortisol are among mediators of peripheral and central crosstalk underlying IR #### KEYWORDS: Acetyl-L-Carnitine; Allostatic load; Depression; Inflammation; Insulin resistance; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PMID: [29180223](URL DOI: [10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.11.038](URL [URL [URL 1. Introduction Over 500 million people suffer from psychiatric disorders worldwide, and this burden continues to grow leading to profound psychological, societal, economic and humanitarian consequences (WHO) [1]. Much effort is aimed at uncovering the causes of these disorders and developing new strategies for treatment and prevention. In this review, we underscore the importance of recognizing the reciprocal communication between the brain and the rest of the body, both in terms of the genesis of depressive disorders (DD) and their course. A key concept in the interface between the brain and the rest of the body is the role of psychosocial and physical stress in triggering and exacerbating these illnesses. Stressful experiences can precipitate major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar illness, anxiety disorders, and major depression [2]. Stressful experiences early in life and throughout the life course, as well as health-damaging behaviors increase risk for type 2 diabetes (DM2) as well as depression. Depressive disorders and diabetes, in turn, increase the vulnerability to dementia [3], exemplifying the life-long impact of stress and the ongoing interplay between peripheral and central mechanisms that conspire to create multiple chronic disorders in a single individual. Of note, an increasing number of studies support insulin resistance (IR) as a common culprit underlying these growing and devastating diseases and making it important to understand the mechanisms for development of IR. IR is a modifiable metabolic pro-inflammatory state that occurs in approximately one-third of otherwise apparently healthy individuals. We discuss the linkage between depressive disorders, which are primarily seen as brain-based, and, IR, a pathophysiological condition that is typically seen as peripheral. We also highlight evidence showing how using our understanding of this relationship can lead to the development of pharmacological and behavioral interventions that ameliorate IR and treat or possibly prevent its long-term consequences including depressive disorders. Below, we ask: (1) what are the biological underpinnings of the bidirectional interaction between IR and DD? And (2) can we define molecular targets in this bidirectional interaction that might be relevant for treating depressive disorders? 13 pages of pdf [URL In sum, the convergence of evidence from cell biological studies, animal studies and early analyses of human clinical data leads to the hypothesis that insulin resistance is a key component in the treatment of depressive disorders. Addressing this may include acceleration of remission, prevention of relapse, and/or mitigation against the emergence of treatment resistance. This hypothesis deserves direct testing to more precisely identify the population of patients that would profit most from such interventions, explore the possible use of such an approach in conjunction with other treatment modalities, and identify the optimal timing to ensure maximal effectiveness."

As some sort of coping mechanism. First I enjoyed being independent and listened to others instead of talking about myself and my problems. But now I am at I point where I feel trapped in my on mind and want to embrace the idea of vulnerability. A few very unpleasant things happened to me in the last time and even though I felt way more stressed, depressed, exhausted etc. I am unable to process these things (even though it doesnt fit my personality at all). Instead I find myself as a bystander to my sadness (+ton of other unpleasant feelings) and experience intrusive thoughts and social insecurity etc. but am unable to decode my problems/the cause. I havent cried in like 2 years and distract myself so much. For example, I feel how I automatically change my attitude when surrounded by people, turning into a way more loud, insensitive person. So, here I am now, wanting to express and experience my true emotions to move on, or at least have a decent cry... But sadly I am suppressing all of that, unable to say whats original problem and what is only due to my coping mechanism. I started talking about my feelings, writing down whats going on in me or changing my mindset, but experienced no breakthrough, even though I assume there are extremely strong emotions on the way. It is just so weird that I feel some things so strongly while shutting out way more important/intense things. And the fact that I realise my behaviour but am unable to change it, or the fact that I never broke my role, bursting into tears while under too pressure or whatever, makes me think the mechanism sits extremely deep in my personality. (Not a native speaker, but I tried my best) Thanks for taking the time to read through this :)"
149,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Anger and Repressing Emotions,1,9cfotm,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9cfotm/anger_and_repressing_emotions/,2018-09-03 07:26:45,"I was having a conversation on a different sub, with someone extolling the virtues of toughening up, bottling ones emotions, and not crying like a little bitch. I suggested that everyone is entitled to feel and express their emotions (in a healthy, well-regulated way), and he responded by asking what about the right not to feel ones emotions? My response to his question ended up being a lot more in depth (and personal) than I expected, and I thought it might fit well here. My Comment: Barring those with atypical neurology, I dont think its really possible to not feel ones emotions. In my experience, attempting to avoid difficult emotions tends to result in one of, or a combination of, a couple different outcomes: A) The unwanted emotion is processed as a different emotion that feels safer/more secure (eg. leaving late for work and feeling worried/guilty about it, becomes anger at the other commuters around you for making you late). B) The unwanted emotion is stuffed down and ignored. At least in my experience, this tactic tends to result in the repressed feelings bubbling up in unexpected (and sometimes, seemingly unconnected) ways at some later point in time. Both of these strategies, at least for me, provide a short term sense of safety/comfort, but impair my ability to truly experience my life, and grow through painful experiences. Im not trying to preach. Just offering a different perspective that you may find helpful. I used to feel that in order to navigate the world with a sense of safety, I needed to project an image of invulnerability, even to myself. I spent a lot of time angry and irritable, because Id convinced myself that vulnerability was weak, and that carrying around a toxic load of aggression and cynicism was better than being, being-perceived-as, or feeling weak. I stubbornly held onto that belief, that gut feeling, that I needed a shell of toughness to navigate the world, even as it led me to behave in ways that, at core, I really didnt like. Though I didnt realize it, I was effectively utilizing anger and emotional repression to mood-alter, just as an alcoholic would utilize alcohol. My fear of re-examining the defensive strategies that had allowed me to navigate an abusive childhood, resulted in me damaging important friendships, and nearly cost me my relationship with my fiance. Perhaps just as bad, it stripped me of compassion and love for myself. A couple of years ago, after a rage-fueled, totally unnecessary, shouting match with my fiance and a couple of our close friends, I finally realized that my approach wasnt working. I got back into therapy, and began the difficult work of training myself to rely on healthier coping skills. It hasnt been an easy journey, by any means, but my life is 1000% happier now, then it has ever been before. Obviously, everyone is different, and your mileage may vary, but I thought Id share my experience. "

I've struggled for a while now with feelings of alienation from other people which can feel very lonely. I've always had friends but of late I feel like I'm struggling to relate to anyone. When this happens with things I see as being really simple, obvious ways of thinking, I feel like I'm living on a different planet to everyone else. The feelings are triggered by something relatively small, like most recently asking a flatmate to clean up the dishes politely (a guy I've known for years) only to be met with hostility, being told I'm 'nuts' and basically upsetting the 'relaxed' atmosphere of the house I live in by bringing it up in the first place. What's worse is that my other friends who live with me, whilst agreeing with me, won't ever stand up for me for fear of rocking the boat, making me feel isolated. This is not the first household this has happened in. The battle is usually others making me feel less secure, less together, less cool or whatever - over tiny everyday issues that I see as common sense. I feel like a pretty together adult, but that others try to belittle me for showing vulnerability. I don't need any reassurances here over this petty argument, but the feelings that arise from these issues are more concerning for me. The stress that such a seemingly small incident causes me is huge and makes me feel incompatible to be anyone else's flatmate, partner, friend and so on. I feel like I have a problem with everyone I know that makes it hard for me to find at least one person I can truly relate to. I guess I just need to know that there are people out there that feel like this too and would like to ask how people get through feeling like this. Sometimes I feel like throwing out everyone I know and starting again. This is quite a rambling example, but the gist is that when I feel this way, I don't know who to call on, and that feels lonely. I have friends, but it feels like no one gets it when I need to talk. Does that mean I don't have friends? Or is it just a feeling that people have? Any advice, story sharing, words of comfort, would very much appreciated. Thanks x"

It requires trust, honesty, and vulnerability or else it wont work. Actually, its a step beyond the basic concept idea of openness. Its an intense self-examination. A continuum of emotional mapping and paying attention to the hows and whys, and understanding the root of my reactions. The gravity of what I deal with on a daily basis is too much for my loved ones to handle. I am terrified (and so are they) at what I am capable of so I wouldnt dare put this emotional weight on their shoulders. I have a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist; luckily, they are both located in the same office. I see the doctor once per month for my prescription refills, and I have forty-five-minute sessions with my therapist every two weeks. Technically, it should be weekly; however, I can only withstand so much emotional anguish at a time. The patient-therapist relationship is very intimate. I am extremely guarded and wary of people in general; if your energy is off, its not going to work. Previous therapists have been calloused or only saw me as a patient, not a human being. And one even made a rape joke. Yes, a male medical professional thought it was appropriate to joke about rape in a therapy session. Naturally, I never went back. You see, my problem is two-fold. I am bipolar one, and I also suffer from emotional PTSD; along with significant trust issues. So I am as fucked up as it gets. Although simple in theory, I hate talking about myself and reliving the past, however, I know its a necessary step in my life. Being this open and allowing others into my space is very hard for me. It took me awhile to find the right fit. Leon, my therapist, knows me very well. From our first session, there was something different about him. I knew he meant me no harm. He is very patient with me and sympathetic to my trust issues, and the long list of my other problems. He understands why I am hesitant in discussing certain matters and knows when to call me out on my bullshit. Both he and my doctor are very straightforward. Which is both a positive and negative experience. The negativity has nothing to do with them directly. Its just that being exposed ignites so many emotional reactions. Sometimes its too much, and it triggers my other side. The week leading up to Memorial Day Weekend, my doctor was overbooked. He asked if I wouldnt mind seeing the nurse practitioner. I was hesitant at first, only because I didnt know this person. Newness in that intimate setting makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. I knew there would be a bit of awkwardness as I warmed up to her. But what I was not expecting, was a nasty bitch with a shitty attitude. When I entered her office, she didnt look me in the eye and coldly asked me to verify my last name and date of birth. I was taken aback by her demeanor and that introduction. I have gone to the same facility for almost five years, and on this day, I had a double session with both the doctor and my therapist. I was already checked in by the reception and had just left my therapists office so I was put off by her line of questioning. I think interrogation was more like it. She also demanded that I confirm how long Ive been on my medications and other facts that were listed in my file. It was sitting before her and had she bothered to have read it, she would have known my medical history. I have a photographic memory; however, I cant recall all of the medications I have been prescribed or offer exact dates of my hospital stays. Some of that I have blocked out, purposely, and other shit I dont fucking remember. With each silly question, I felt myself slowly unravel. Finally reaching my limit, I stopped this woman midsentence, saying that I didnt like her energy and advised her that we should not continue. Rather than defuse the situation, she, it seemed was keen on breaking me, and I am sad to report that it did not end well for her. I lost my patience, zipped up my ethnic suit and popped offat the fucking psychiatrists office. The doctor had to come in and referee as my rage was becoming uncontrollable. I was very close to punching her in the face. That definitely was not a high moment in my life. However, I have no regrets. Her energy provoked the situation. Once you take me there, you have pushed me past my grace and patience. I dont hear anything youre saying. I am either counting in my head or depending upon the severity of the circumstances, contemplating if the felony would be worth it. Thankfully, I am not *there* often. Anyways  getting back on topic. Even though I am left feeling like shit and emotionally raw immediately afterward, I know therapy is crucial to my well-being. There is no cure for my condition, but treatment offers me a small bit of reprieve. Its a safe place of open discussion, without judgment. Also, its a test of my wills. Leon helps me to weed through what is real versus what solely exists in my head. Another downside to therapy is that my doctors office is only one subway stop away from my office. Leaving me little to no recovery time. Its quite challenging getting back into the headspace to deal with my coworkers. More often than not I am pinching myself on the train in an attempt to keep the tears from falling. At times even taking Xanax to numb my nerves so I can finish out the workday. It would be easy just to give up and let my worst side get the best of me. I am bipolar, boo hoo. But, fuck that! I am not a victim, and I refuse to live that way. Or subject others to my manic antics. Early on after my diagnosis, I assumed that mental disorders were something you could just shake off or take a pill. I didnt pursue the right treatment measures, and I found myself in a dangerous place, more often that Id like to admit. I ignored the warning signs, and that left me institutionalized on several occasions. It wasnt until the last stint that I realized that I needed to take hold of myself and find a healthier way of coping. Drinking heavily and smoking lots of weed, both of which I still do but now in moderation, is not a smart approach to living with a mental disorder. Nor is just taking a pill. Therapy, along with medication, is a permanent part of my lifestyle. Even when I dont want to go, I know I have to. I feel it is my responsibility to protect myself from self-harm and also not to be a threat to others. My greatest fear is suffering an unrecoverable breakdown. I came very close to not coming back to myself, and that was terrifying. With therapy, I have learned how to recognize my warning signs better. Its also bittersweet as I have to deal with the reality of there being no cure. And there is a large part of my personality, along with the associating behaviors, that I cannot control. I still have low days, and my emotions are consistently up and down. But I take comfort in knowing that I am making the right decisions for my mental well-being. If you are suffering from any mental anguish, I encourage you to get help sooner, rather than later. [The National Alliance of Mental Illness](URL is a great resource. I have reached out to them in the past, and it opened my eyes to the various resources, and people who can offer assistance. Also, dont be afraid of therapy or admitting you need help sorting out your thoughts. Think of it as a great conversation, and that is something that we can all benefit from; mental health issues or not."

I then noticed myself resting, and realized my brain is now actively incorporating the temporary thought on its own. This awareness would take over my everyday brain activity, even sleep. I now only half-sleep, in 90-minute fragments, and as through my suspicion, that was for the duration of when I first tried force-incorporating in sleep. It maybe similar to daytime parahypnagogia. I tho, am in need of help undoing this. I have been prescribed klonopin, abdin, benadryl; have tried chamomile, lavender, lemon balm, sleep restriction; also, olanzapine and risperidone (both supposedly for pseudoinsomnia). None produced an effect. This temporary thought alters perception, that's why I'm sure I'm under it non-stop.&gt;&gt;&gt; A background of my condition: You know characters in war movies, -who are in their social contexts with values/feelings. In the scenarios, the collective or the masses seemingly fail to grasp these values. And despite all the efforts of the character, the values are still ""defied"", which sets the character in a trap of either insanity or suicide. -Because ""nothing makes sense anymore."" That's kind of like my case but it happened in a regular, more psychosocial exchange. Brief flashback: there was an event I played in, a non-dramatized, simple setting; the people there just ""did not respond psychosocially to me."" The escalated feelings I got from it equated to cynical, fatal, and impossible. Emotions? My body was pressed to a manic confusion, interminably trying to peak to what I can no longer bear. Being incapable to ever cope, I crumbled into inauthenticity and vulnerability. It's like my emphatic cognition was challenged as well as was in complex with psychosocial common sense. I can no longer form affective memories and creative narrative about life or have real feelings. I still function; it's just that, ""I"" didn't feel like the me (maybe because all of my personal and emotional functions are overridden). I have dull, colorless visual scope and persistent psychogenic fever. Lastly, I'm hyperaroused when it comes to the event (maybe because people did not respond psychosocially and I got to color it with abuse instead) Perhaps my condition can be easily misunderstood as emotional trauma. But there is nothing to move on from or scars to be healed. The resolution I got, a talk, organically fixed me, and at an instant. The person said they did respond, and their explanation made psychosocial sense. That solved everything; it was just for a second(10 months) I thought I wasn't living in this psychosocial common sense way of the life but in miserably disillusioned sell-out one The talk's explanation immediately prompted an alternative, normal memory of the event. Even then, I was still augmented to the dull ""I"" because perhaps included in the ""fixing"" are some 'senses'. The liveliness, color of my visual scope would return and only that, and only for some time for such reasons. This means only sleep can lay the equation to the ""fix."" It did; I got my full brain functions during sleep but was followed immediately by sleep paralysis. The problem is that I can no longer fully, properly sleep. I knew that thinking back to the talk would reactivate the color of my visual scope so I force-synthesized my thinking to a consolidating sleep, -against the natural way of it going away. I succeeded up to the beginning part of stage 2 sleep (I, maybe, lost consciousness at first but after, I found that my thinking is now autonomous). The consequence is I have colored/lively visual scope 24/7. In addition, I can now only sleep at night in the likes of daytime parahypnagogia and pseudoinsomnia: half-awake sleep in 90-minutes-each fragments. And no full, proper sleep, no getting back of full brain functions."

She was laughing about doing that to humiliate me just bc. We actually did stay friends after but that was her taking advantage of my vulnerability more to carry on setting me up. Her and her brother tried setting me up to have sex with someone they knew without telling me anything (I didnt but it was still embarrassing). She did a whole bunch of horrible things while telling me she was my only true friend and its very hard to live with. People around her knew what she was doing but they didnt warn me, they let her. She even made out I was the nasty one to justify why she was trying so hard to destroy me. She saw me go downhill and carried on trying to make me get worse."
157,vulnerability,mentalhealth,What is the point in life?,8,8u17hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/8u17hy/what_is_the_point_in_life/,2018-06-27 02:04:03,"I always hear people talking about their mental health like its the problem and although I agree that we all suffer with our mental health it is not because of our mental health that we suffer. Of course it is down to our life experiences and how they impact on us as individuals. I dont hear enough people actually talking through their struggles, because they are ashamed or scared to do that. Vulnerability is a scary place for all of us because it leaves us with nowhere to hide. I think there is simply enough to be scared of in the way the world is right now and that should not include being open about what is troubling you or to speak out. As for me there are so many things going on in my life and so much that has happened that has affected me in a big way and these things will continue to do that. Consciously knowing that I will never be able to change these things is hard. I really struggle to swallow the idea that aspects of my life and aspects of myself that I hate will always be that way, like forever and have always been that way for me. When I am in the mist of these curve balls that life throws, like when these things are actually going on in that moment, I can find them overwhelming. Sometimes while in that moment not even aware that whatever is happening is affecting me in that way. It wasnt until it happens again that I become more aware of how it is impacting on me. I always feel like I am forever walking a fine line from pushing myself forward to pushing myself over the edge and that for me is the worst place to be. It can come over me suddenly and it doesnt matter where I am, sometimes I dont even expect it coming but all of a sudden this feeling takes me, To a place where I dont want to be and I will be kept there while im immersed in the feeling. I worry so much about people that dont for themselves and make absolutely no conscious or physical effort to change. No matter how hard I try to convince myself that theyre adults, their issues are not yours and they should look after themselves they dont and mean while in the back of my mind all i can hear is what if what if and I am absolutely powerless to change that. It is so draining and It is a feeling I am so desperate to shake but am some what unable. People say to me youre doing well and you should be proud of yourself proud of myself for what? Surviving? I should be proud of myself for something many people will never have to deal with in their whole life. Its crazy! As although I have had this feeling inside my soul for the entirety of my time on this earth, its still an alien to me. Its,what fuels every fist i throw at the wall, why I scream in my car when I am alone, when I come in from work and want nothing more than to sink into the ground. I wish that I could feel proud for my actual achievements and I dont want my existance on this earth to be classed as one of them, because it isnt I didn't just one day wake up and behave this way, this isn't because of my mind pulling me down, this is because of what is going on around me.

158,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Please reassure me that I'm not psychotic.,1,8wgxx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/8wgxx0/please_reassure_me_that_im_not_psychotic/,2018-07-06 13:51:42,"Inb4 ""only a qualified mental health professional can diagnose you."" I'm fairly sure I'm not, but it's nagging at me. Also this is throwaway IN CASE THEY'RE WATCHING (by which I mean a few people know my main username and I don't want them to come across this if they randomly get bored and stalk my history). So basically, one of my paternal uncles suffer from schizoaffective disorder, and an uncle on my mother's side suffers from. . . something that involves paranoia and social isolation. An aunt on my mother's side also suffers from something that involves paranoia and social isolation. So basically, I definitely feel as though there's a chance as though I may have the genetic vulnerability towards developing a psychotic-type illness, if not schizophrenia proper. Anyway, onto my 'delusions and hallucinations.' Basically, I've always suffered from extreme anxiety and depression. In the past year and a half, though, the anxiety has gotten worse to the point where I think it might legitimately qualify as psychosis, although I'm not rightly sure. These anxious/delusional thoughts have mainly involved fears for my health: 1) Health: Over the past year and a half, I've been to the ER four times for health concerns that ended up being literally nothing. Basically, I'll experience a symptom (let's say ""pain in left shoulder"") and then google it. Google inevitably tells me it's a possible symptom of a heart attack. While this is highly unlikely (I'm 26, and in generally good health) I'll google something like ""heart attack at 25"" and ""can you be having a heart attack with no chest pain."" Google directs me to articles about people who have had heart attacks with no warning signs, and about how ""silent heart attacks"" are more common in women. And, typically, these articles warn you that if you're having signs of a heart attack, you should go to the ER immediately. I'll hem and haw for awhile, try to talk myself down, etc. But it's the sort of thing where a false negative (I.E, not going to the ER when you should) has much more dire consequences than a false positive (I.E., going to the ER when it's nothing.) So I'll go to the ER, feel stupid as the doctor asks me to assess my pain level (""Maybe like three? I don't know, it's so subjective!""). After a few hours, I'll be sent home. Fortunately, I've gotten better at talking myself down from these delusions, but they still come. I've been worried about gallstones, and a hiatal hernia, and at one point was worried my esophagus had ruptured (thanks to googling ""sudden sore throat""). Right now I have a bad headache, and have been having eyeball spasms, and this morning got a nosebleed-- basically, I constantly notice symptoms and then convince myself it means I'm going to die. It's exhausing, and legitimately makes me feel insane. I think I have had mild hallucinations, though. Like, I almost felt like my teeth were hot (like, internally; I don't know if I convinced myself I felt it or if I was actually hallucinating), and I subsequently had the fleeting worry that they would explode. Fortunately, almost as quickly this occurred to me, I realized that this was impossible and was able to not stress about it. The feeling of 'hot teeth' also went away quickly, but I have no idea what caused it. Also, I've noticed that while lying in bed and staring at the roof, it starts to kind of look like I'm looking at it through moving water. This happens at the end of the day when I'm tired, so maybe it's a fatigue thing. I am fairly sure I'm not becoming psychotic/schizophrenic, but basically I was reassuring that I'm just an extremely anxious person (and yes, I know I should get help regardless of whether I'm psychotic or not. I've been on medications before and they haven't been worth the side-effects). But yeah, I feel like I'm going insane a lot of the time. "

Sometimes it's hard to balance vulnerability, confidentiality, and boundaries. As someone who has worked closely with mental health professionals for my whole career, I have to admit that I have struggled with my own mental health and with accessing sufficient services. I have been with different doctors in different cities and have reached out for counselling and tried all the fitness and vitamins and praying and yoga and what have you. And what I have learned is when you feel like some thing is wrong, and you can't figure out what.. You start to just feel like it's you. And the hardest thing can be separating the you from the mental health problem, if you don't know what it is. And that's when things are the hardest. I am finally making progress and am learning more about what makes me tick. I don't feel ready to share my diagnosis with the world but I want anyone reading this who feels like giving up because they have been fighting on their own for so long... please keep fighting.

I'm a long timer lurker and first time poster! After hearing about Anthony Bourdain and other famous people I realized mental health impacts everyone. I have been diagnosed with Dissociative PTSD and I have been in counseling 3 times a week for the last two months. A little about me i'm 35 Hispanic and I was diagnosed with PTSD in my first session of therapy. By my third session I was diagnosed with dissociative PTSD. It was hard to hear about my diagnosis, but at least I knew I wasn't crazy. So many people think mental health means you're crazy and people that don't support you distance themselves. I felt it was such a big need that I took two months of leave without pay (LWOP). Along with two months of LWOP I decided to see my therapist 3 times a week. It has been the hardest two months in my life and I have seen and done some good and bad shit in my life. Each one of us will go through this moment different times in our life. Some of us may understand and move past it, but some may be so consumed with mental health that we can't heal. Unfortunately, I hated when people told me what I needed to do to get better. This is MY journey, NOT YOURS. So, I say to you, this is your journey, no one else, but you don't have to do it alone. What helped me through some trying times was r/GetMotivated. Music, Talking, sharing, texting, writing, and funny enough the gym. I'm almost 300 lbs and going to the gym I would hear a song and just start sobbing. I can look back and share it, but at that moment it was hard. As I sit here typing this I know it's hard to either reach out, share, or trust someone with this. It's easy to be anonymous and reach out because it's hard to be vulnerable, and trust me I hate vulnerability. Luckily, I have a great circle that has helped me through my tough times and I know some or most people don't have a good positive circle to help them. If you need someone to talk to, text, or just listen without judgment or advice please send me a DM or message me on KIK pinupslife. This can be the most terrifying or loneliest time of your life, but you don't have to do it alone. Reach out to me, to someone, but don't hold it in. "
162,vulnerability,mentalhealth,"On Depression,Suicide and Letting Go.",9,8qo579,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/8qo579/on_depressionsuicide_and_letting_go/,2018-06-13 10:33:59," Anthony Bourdain, Kate Spade, Keith Cobain- how could someone famous do that? The compulsion to suicide comes from within, and the death of the famous increases the compulsion. It bares the lie sold to us: material wealth does not equal happiness. Theodore Roosevelt said ""Black care rarely sits behind a rider whose pace is fast enough."" and promoted the ""strenuous life"" as an antidote while his brother drank himself to death. The four horsemen of suicide are depression, vulnerability, isolation and despair. Vulnerability in the face of failure at work, relationships, and money. Isolation from others fuels the urge""no one will miss me"". Despair at the unfairness of life chases the rider. Ultimately, the impulsive act boils down to one thing: they let go. The will to hold on is gone. The effort and strain becomes too much so they just let go. Suicide is an epidemic in America. According to the CDC suicide increased by 54% in the last decade, 50% die using a gun. Helping those who suffer is hard, because you don't know how to ease their pain and the victim feels the same way. Silence is deadly as each side struggles to deal with the demon in their midst. People are afraid to that ask someone about suicidal thoughts fearing it will drive them to the edge when in fact it will pull them back in relief. Drugs, therapy and physical activity can keep the black care at bay for only so long but depression is a liar and drains it's victim of the strength, clarity and desire to escape it's grasp. Seeking help is impossible when you feel nothing but desperation. Many have tried and tried and failed. Happiness is hard to maintain when it is fleeting and rare. When I do feel joy it's often accompanied by unease or I feel overwhelmed because I'm not used to it. The reverse is true for those who are generally happy and experience a blue funk. It feels unnatural. Depression is a palatable emotional pain, and as debilitating as physical pain. Even with painkillers, it's still there and there are side effects. Humans have a great capacity to endure enormous stress and trauma and come out the other side more or less intact- how I envy them. Ask a survivor of the holocaust, torture or prison. Then there are some who fold under a seemingly minor ailment or stress. Despite his luck and prosperity George Eastman, who started the Kodak Film Co. killed himself. Ernest Hemingway raced with death all his life and finally gave up. Survival is for the fittest regardless of their circumstances and everyone has a limit to their endurance. Adding to the horsemen is the current fashion of prejudice and intolerance feeding the isolation and despair. Messages of comfort and empathy are sadly missing. How can you help a loved one who suffers from depression? Be there when they are down and the weight of existence feels too heavy. Talk to them about the things they enjoy or interest them as a distraction from the howl of despair. Listen when they express their pain- it is a balm to their souls. Life can be hard, it's harder when one feels deserted, unloved, weak. Let's help each other to outrun black care. "

I had suicidal thoughts and hated everyone and everything. I switched schools and it got better, but I am still haunted almost 10 years later when I'm 19. Not directly, but the world is dark and shitty most days, and on the odd occasion I have good days. I had multiple therapists and stopped going to each one after one or two sessions each. I have therapy, it is degrading, dehumanizing, and embarrassing. I don't like pity. I don't like attention. For the past years I have hidden my problems and put on a facade and that's seemed to work for the most part. I don't like to talk to my friends about it because then they'll treat me differently. Some days I just want to be depressed, I will listen to sad music and think of dark memories until I am in the dark place I desire. Over the past years I have coped by distracting myself with video games, dark jokes, way too much candy, and a lot of NF music. I used to eat a 1kg tub of jujubes every night to feel better. Now I have an extremely dark sense of humour which reflects what I truly feel. I was doing better for a bit but now I'm back where I was before. I want to talk to someone but I don't care for people that sit there and pretend that everything is ok and that treat you like a child giving pointless advice. I care too much about what other people think. People will judge me if I tell them I'm struggling. I don't like vulnerability. I get it when others have struggles, no one's perfect. But its not ok when I have problems, I expect perfection and nothing less and I don't know how to convince myself that it's ok to make mistakes and be flawed. I have never attempted suicide but thoughts of it are a regular thing. I would describe exactly but I don't want to give anyone else ideas or get this post censored. What should I do? I need help but hate therapy and pity. PS. I'm sorry this is such a mess of random thoughts. I'm not great at writing, but I hope it's understandable."
166,vulnerability,mentalhealth,Finding Strength in Vulnerability,2,7uq48d,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7uq48d/finding_strength_in_vulnerability/,2018-02-02 20:06:23,"I originally wrote this as a post on my blog (amiablepotential.com), but I thought I'd post it here after I found this page. Through all the years that I've dealt with depression, I have too often let my pride stand in the way of getting help, but I also let it stand in the way of being empathetic with others. I hope this helps anyone struggling with the same things. When I find a song that I really like, I tend to put it on repeat. All day long. Ill listen to it in the car on the way to work and school. I put my headphones in and listen to it while walking from my car to my classes. Ive got it on while Im in the shower, while I do the dishesyou get the picture. (I do try to keep the volume low so my roommates dont hate me. So far, so good-as far I know.) Luckily, this only lasts a few days to a week, until I have to avoid the song for a while before putting it back into normal rotation. As I mentioned in last Saturdays post, the song of last week was Naked by James Arthur. For the first day or two, I listened superficially. The song has a melancholy but lovely melody and passionate vocals that compelled me to listen again and again. Then, one night I was tossing about, praying for sleep to grace me with its presence, and I turned it on hoping his soothing voice would lull me to sleep. Well, lets just say that it didnt help with the sleeping, but it did force me to listen more closely to the lyrics. These words hit me in particular: Im not gonna wait until youre done pretending you dont need anyone I used to be the person pretending that I didnt need anyone. Whether it stemmed from depression, anxiety, or general shyness and insecurity, I dont know, but for most of my life I kept people at a distance. I only let them see the shiny exterior (which one can only project for so long). I was so determined to prove I was fine on my own that I missed out on opportunities to get to know some great people. That all changed in college when I made friends with people who didnt take no for an answer. They just were my friends. January of 2016, when my mental health took a nose dive, I put up my usual barricades and tried to retreat into myself. I dont think that I will ever be able to fully express my gratitude for my friends at that time. I remember a particular day when my roommate refused to let me brood over my anxious and depressed state and coaxed me into talking about what was going on. At that point, I didnt understand that I was mentally ill. I figured that if I just plugged along, doing my best to take care of my physical health and trying to be happy, my problems would resolve themselves. I definitely didnt need any other human besides myself to fix my troubles. I was always more than happy to listen when others needed someone to talk to, but I didnt need anything from anyone. From that day on, I gradually began (with extensive help from my roommate) to see the value in sharing my feelings and experiences. At first, it was all for me. Keeping things bottled up only made me feel worse, so I learned to share with friends and family. Letting other people in on my mental state allowed my loved ones to direct me towards professional help and to provide the encouragement and emotional support that I needed on a day-to-day (lets be honest: minute-to-minute) basis. Over the next two years, I continued this dialogue. As my health improved, sharing went from emotionally vomiting to constructive conversations. I discovered that a number of people in my circle of friends had dealt with/still deal with similar struggles. The more I talked to others, the more I realized that I was not alone in my pain. Sometimes, I needed to listen, and other times I needed to talk. The more I talked, and the more I listened, the more I realized how pointless it was for me to keep people at a football fields length. I needed them, and they needed me. Pretending that I didnt need anyone only isolated me and allowed depression to fill my brain with its lies. I couldnt live off of keeping the depression at bay; I needed to fill my mind with truth, empathy, love, kindness, understanding. Getting half of you just aint enough We think that putting up walls shows our strength, but if we are strong we dont need the walls. It takes strength to be vulnerable, to shed our facades. Pretending that my life was perfect didnt make it so. Rather, it prevented me from being authentic with others. We don't need to tell every person who says hello about all our struggles, but we do have to let go of the need to appear perfectly put together. We all need at least one person in our lives who will listen to us and still love us even when we are a mess, even when we feel that we are worthless and useless. Otherwise, we are only playacting, only being half of who we are. I see a great example of this when I watch certain selfish dancers. By selfish, I mean they dance for themselves, sometimes because theyre so focused on being perfect that they forget to perform and sometimes because theyre cocky. My favorite dancers to watch are the ones that give their everything. In the moment, theyre sharing a piece of their soul with their audience. Im not gonna try til you decide youre ready to swallow all your pride. While I was in the process of finding a strength in vulnerability, I met a person who had more walls up than I did. I make no claims of being perfect in the situation, but at a certain point I could no longer deal with the fortress preventing me from seeing the real person. I couldnt wait around for someone who tried to overtly push me away yet subtly keep me around. My own personal progression required me to move on. Cant you see that Im naked Here on this blog, I am attempting to continue this journey of finding strength in vulnerability. In sharing my experiences, I find that I am able to make sense of and learn from them. I hope you find something valuable in them as well. Thank you for letting me share with you."

We stopped hanging out alltogether after he got a boyfriend and it wasn't until six months ago that I tried to get back in touch with him. It was going great but he didn't really have the time to meet and I was going through some rough moments and acted a bit pushy. I apologised and took some distance. So yesterday I checked out his twitter because he is always posting a lot of really thoughtful and useful articles about science. (He is a biologist) And he had decided to write about how he is dealing with a lot of anxiety and is going through a bad time mental health wise even though he is receiving professional health. And he wrote how he'd like to be able to talk about it and needs some help from his friend's who might want to listen to him. And I want to help. I really do, but I'm afraid it might come off as if I was taking advantage of his vulnerability and I don't want him to feel like that or hurt him in any way. Should I keep my distance or do you think I should reach out and tell him I'll be there id he needs my help?"

A way of me confirming I am happy with this now, helping me recover who I am, highlighting how it impacted my mental state. I wrote out a 3-page post over and over and yet feel the point was missing. So, I am trying again with a new approach. I hope everyone enjoys reading my post (as morbid as that sounds) and please, any questions, maybe thoughts on the below or even want to discuss your current/previous situations in relation to emotional/physical abuse please do so. Never be ashamed/sacred to speak out. We are all unique and beautiful.* Mother was an angry, manipulative, aggressive, violent and exceptionally unhappy woman. Long term bi-polar disorder mixed with a childhood she never speaks of, but small hints of violent/unhappy childhood given away in small doses over the course of my life. She was her own worst enemy and from a young age somewhat of an idol to myself. She never dealt with her emotions which is also something she taught me. Unhappy/worried? Get angry and violent. Sad or excited? Eat. Ignore the current state and use something else. The list is endless but teaching me not to deal with my emotions was the first stage, installing what she believed to be correct way to thank and act. She began to enforce rewards systems to control me, at times, through eating/food or gifts/money. I can recall one situation where I was accused of taking her credit card (I was 6 years old and before we had computers), the one she left in store, so decided to ransack my bedroom, destroying most of the gifts I got the Christmas. This resulted in being given a crumpled, unapologetic five-pound note. No sorry, nothing said, just the silence and dark stair. From a young age I was subjected to social seclusion, I was not allowed to hang out with any of the local kids in my town. Apparently, they were all bad children and believed I would be influenced by them resulting in becoming, well I am not to sure what she expected. The kids that I did hang about with ended up doing very well in life which is why I struggle to see her point of view. I was not allowed to out and play with the other local kids, I was to stay within the confines of my home creating both emotionally and physically unhealthy child (obese from a young age). I had to find happiness inside my own mind/imaginations. This resulted in being a very socially unaware child, not knowing how to deal with conversations, behaviours or social norms. All behaviours were learned from mother, which looking back was destined to be my ruin. By the time I had got to High School it became very apparent. Overwhelmed by different personalities, fear kicked in, so I did what I knew best. Anger and violence. I put up walls to everyone around me, being rejected to groups is not something I experienced. I was vulnerable, completely disconnected and alone. The irony was that in the run up to attending high school mother repeatedly told me you are going to get bullied to fuck, kids like you always get bullied. You will never make friends. She installed failure from the start. Her assumptions came to life, I did end up being bullied. So badly in fact even to this day thinking about how alone I was still brings a tear to my eye. So alone in the world, so lost without a single friend. I will talk about how that impacted me later in another post. I love my dad. Truly one of the strongest men I have ever met, who I hold in high regards, admire greatly and a man I aspire to be. I paint the picture of perfection, but I never always viewed or treated him in this way. My dad made many decisions, which in hindsight were the right decisions but they were the unpopular. This played into mothers hands, allowed her to bounce me off dad and into her arms, in a sense. Using her manipulative behaviours, she would play the popular vote which was the one any kid would favour. Do homework? you dont need to. Go for a walk? No, pointless. These sounds petty but I am trying ton condense and give you an idea. She wanted to be the favourite, part of something, use it (which she did) as a weapon against my dad. Threaten to leave know the kids would follow, highlight he would have no life without her and telling me my dad never cared about me, only money (although it worked I now am not sure what she meant by money). It was morbid and cruel. Cold hearted and disgusting, everything she is and consumed by her vulnerability. Her tactics worked, I ended up, for a period, hating my dad. Never wanted to be around him. I remember when he told me he had cancer (I was 8, I think) I acted in such disgusting manner. Told him he was a freak and to never come near me, I hate you anyway I screamed. I never did, I loved him but years of misguiding my thoughts and feelings led me to believe this was true. This was not the worst, the beating was. I remember he disagreed with me about something, I became engulfed by anger and beat him. Badly. Threw him to the ground and never stopped. Several broken bones, he lied to the doctor, he fell apparently. I regret nothing in life, never want to change anything but this I do. I would change this, even if it changed me slightly, I never have forgiven myself. Im sorry dad. Words I have yet to say to him, I will one day I just hope he knows this. I do not shy from admitting I have suffered from many health troubles, mother being a great influence negatively, both physical and mental, the latter being most prominent. By now you are getting an idea where from, but not just here I will add. My final memories in remembering some of the hate was from the last couple of years regarding my new career, psychiatric nursing. I remember when applying for the course she would mock me, publicly in front of friends and family how people like you could be a nurse, in that field. This was a constant, apparently, I was not good enough to be one, my flaws making me useless and nobody would hire or work with someone like me. Unfortunately for her, even though (I hate to admit) these words hurt, years of working on who I am, becoming self-aware, working on dealing with emotions and no longer living with her, allowed me to grow into the man I am today. Her attempts to break me down, play the sinner and saint failed. Trying to bully me, manipulate my dads advice of be who I want to be and get inside my head did not work. I am strong now, still to this day I work on my emotions, working on how I act in social situations. Working on who I am, along with help from councillors I have managed to overcome this situation with mother. I despise my mother for all the hate she installed, and I have no relationship with her anymore which has made me happier. I have the best relationship with my dad and I am living life, with all my flaws in the open. I may be vulnerable, scared at times but that makes me who I am, and to me that is something beautiful. "
170,vulnerability,mentalhealth,WEYOUI - a mixed-media project about living with mental illness,1,7g5o79,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7g5o79/weyoui_a_mixedmedia_project_about_living_with/,2017-11-29 04:15:21,"Hi there, reddit world. My name is Jacq, and I'm presently working on collecting portraits and written inspiration for a project that involves photography, written word, and music to portray a varied look at what living with mental illness can be like, and I would love your help in developing the project. Those whose contributions are utilized in the project will have the option of being credited in the final publication, according to their preference. Those who participate as a portrait subject (with myself as the photographer) will receive 2 edited photos of their choice from the shoot. So you know a bit about me: I'm currently a creative writing grad student at UW Bothell near Seattle, WA working on her thesis (this project). I myself suffer from depression, anxiety, and dermatillomania, and am currently working with doctors to obtain an accurate diagnosis, which I've never received, along with proper medication for what that diagnosis ends up being. Normalizing expression and cultivating both internal and societal acceptance of living with mental illness is one of the big driving forces in my work. Basically, I aim to create art that lets others know that they are not alone in their darkest hours and reveals to those who don't have the experience what those dark places feel like and how vital and human those who experience them still are. In this project, what I'm trying to represent are the ways in which suffering from mental illness can feel very much so, metaphorically, like a ghost trying to reach out and connect with the livingthat sense of detachment, of feeling like yourself but somehow very much not like yourself. I'm interested in capturing very honest and natural and unique expressions of what that means to different individuals. I've created a survey that I would be so grateful if you'd be willing to fill out. It can be as anonymous as you'd like, and it can be as in depth or as guarded as you'd like. And know that I will not share this information with anyone nor attribute it to your name/pseudonym/handle without your permission. You can fill out the survey here: URL I also collecting portraits of people of all ages, genders, creeds, sizes, shapes, colors, and backgrounds. I am not seeking models. I am seeking real people who have been touched by mental illness of some kind who are willing to be portrait subjects and are open to speaking with me about their experiences. If you are in the Pacific Northwest within reach of train or bus transit from Seattle, I would love to hear from you at the following link to work toward setting up a photoshoot: URL For those who suffer personally, I'd love to explore visually how that may feel to you. For those who have experience with loved ones who suffer, I'd love to explore what it may mean to be on the other end, trying to reach through to the other side to someone who is suffering. I'm very much so focused on these shoots being an exploration, a collaboration between the subjects and myself, a very relaxed and safe and comfortable improvisation more than a pose and point and click kind of thing. The key elements I'm looking for are sincerity and vulnerability and openness. The images themselves will be used in a sort of transparent digital collage alongside written word inspired by discussions or surveys and accompanying music to try to create an immersive environment that depicts the way in which suffering from mental illness of whatever kind can obstruct a realistic view of the world and create a barrier between connecting with others in a normal or healthy way. Thanks for reading through this giant wall of text. I look forward to reading surveys from some of you, and to possibly meeting a few of y'all for photoshoots as well.  Be well, Jacq"
171,vulnerability,mentalhealth,How I Feel - Part 4 - The Sexual Abuse,15,7gxn2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7gxn2a/how_i_feel_part_4_the_sexual_abuse/,2017-12-02 07:04:46,"Out of all the writings I have done, and will do, this part is the most difficult. The one that lays bare my soul, the true vulnerability I find hardest to talk about but today I break that. I may be using a throwaway account for the moment in order to hide who I really am but its the first step, preparing me to really come forward. For the moment I will keep my identity quiet. This had the most impact on my mental health I believe, the one that caused the most damage and took its toll on my mind. I think I was 6 when the sexual abuse started. Most people may jump to the conclusion that it was my dad or uncle but no, instead it was my half-sister. I dont really know how it started or the first instance, I repressed a lot of that but from as far back as I can remember it began by taking me into her room, she would undress me and begin the process of trying to, I guess sexually arouse me even though I had no idea what that was. I dont think I need to go into detail about what happened but once she gained an erection from me she would force myself inside her. I would be an object for use. She would tell me it was ok, that half sisters and brothers do it all the time. I know she did this to reassure herself, I never really knew what was happening. Or what was going on. I was 6. She was the adult in my eyes being 5-6 years older. This went on till I was about 8 or 9. She would always tell me to never tell mother and dad. Always saying that they would not love me anymore, using fear as a weapon to keep me quiet, threaten me that I would be sent away. And after some time it became the norm, I let it happen. Fear and shame did consume me and as I got older I think that is when I realised it was wrong but I did everything in my power to place this deep inside my mind into a location held far away. Unfortunately this was not deep enough. During the abuse in the early days I would go to a safe place, as such, let my mind wonder in another world. I dont know where this was but it helped. As it continued through the years I think I began to enjoy it in some way, not sexually but.. I dont know, something. I still felt great fear and shame but maybe feeling close to someone, being a part of something gave me enjoyment. I think that is why I felt so much guilt about it. I am still pondering this part. I always wonder maybe it is because I accepted my fate with this, it just became normal. I dont know when it stopped, I dont remember the last time she abused me but this is the morbid part. Or the part I dont understand. Everything went back to normal. I acted as though noting ever happened. She lived in the same house and I grew up into a teenager saying nothing. She moved out and then it was just me. Me and my broken self. The older I got the more aware I became of what happened to me, but thanks to that lovely perception of what a man is supposed to be I kept forcing it back into the darkness. Denying it, feeding it the hate, anger, shame and fear which made it grow. I always wondered why I was so explosive with my emotions, having to prove something, to be the man. I began to use drugs. I would steal my dads painkillers (until I was 19), smoke a lot of pot, use illegal class Bs and the newly loved legal highs in order to feel happy. Add in steroids to feel that real masculinity and you get the idea. Always using something to make me feel. I struggled with relationships, I could never get close to someone or really let them know who I am. I would withdraw and times and when things got too deep, brink of admitting how broken I felt, I would mess around with someone else, giving them a reason to hate. I always needed them to hate. I was very hypersexual. Using it as a way to feel again. I do think that the abuse has played a hand in this but I have yet to connect the dots and rationalise why and how. It was early 2017 when all this began to come back in flashbacks. The fucked up part of the flashbacks were that I would they would come to me then drift away into the darkness and automatically I would think that is going to kill me. It was like I already knew it was going to get worse and that I knew deep down I would kill myself in order to escape. Self-fulfilling prophecy you could say. Dreams would turn to nightmares and the shame came back with a vengeance, waking up overwhelmed with fear of people knowing who I truly am. I began to drink more, began to party again with old friends that included a lot of cocaine or MDMA, I just wanted it all to go away. This resulted in one night of heavily using cocaine, coming home to the beautiful woman I share a bed with and finally breaking down. For the first time in my life I showed someone who I really am and I was scared. I wish it had happened a more constructive way but either way I am glad. Because for the first time in my life I feel genuinely happy. Not faked, I opened myself up fully to someone and they embraced me. I felt loved. From that point everything started to get better. This year has thought me so much about myself and allowed me to become the man I always wanted to be, which is me. I recovered that idea of who I am. I am self aware and manage to deal with my emotions far better along with having the most wonderful and amazing woman help me along the way. Without her I dont think I would have been alive for much longer. I do owe my life to her. I dont talk to my half sister. I had began to drift away from communicating but now I have none at all and I am happy with that. I dont have to pretend that she took away my childhood, pretend everythings fine. She left me broken through many years, not allowing myself to be me. She asks my dad from time to time why not but he is happy with my response of not wanting to talk about it. Counselling has been the biggest help with not only finding the real me but also allowing me to come to terms with what has happened and how I can cope with this through he rest of my life. I will never forget what happened to me, but I can now manage it. What is wonderful is when I do talk about it I dont have that thought this is going to kill me. In fact I am content with that part of my life I can talk about it now. I know I did nothing wrong, I was so young and did not know better. I did not know what sex was. I think being able to finally accept that has also helped. In some ways saying no and telling mother or dad was not option. I was powerless and I have accepted that. I live my life a lot better now, I currently help people for a living and currently working on a degree that will allow me to work with young adults and children who may have suffered the same as I. I am working on being able to speak more openly about this but the impactions with family may cause this to be an issue. How do I feel about this all? Content now. For years I guess hate, resentment, shame, guilt and fear consumed me. I am genuinely happy, I feel things now. This was probably the hardest part of my life to get over but once it was done I felt like I can now really begin to live. I am 26 but I have many years ahead of me still to go. *As always, any questions please ask away, share your experiences or even just give some information on how you cope. I hope you enjoyed reading this (as morbid as it sounds) but this was the hardest to write, a step forward to finally making it public. I have quite a few things going on for the next couple of weeks so will be taking a break from writing. Expect the next part around the 15th. *"

It's life-threatening, but very curable and according to my specialist I've made the fastest recovery he's seen. However the whole process of diagnosis took a long time. I went for many tests and it left me feeling very vulnerable. Even though I am recovering, I still exhibit symptoms and it makes me really nervous. I spend at least an hour googling my symptoms a day and subsequently panicking. My thoughts race and I wonder if they made the right diagnosis. I can't seem to enjoy the victory of recovery without wondering if it's premature. I think I'm becoming a hypochondriac. How do I get past this? I keep spiraling into bouts of depression."

These things would range from not being allowed to watch Pokemon simply because it's derived from the word Pocket Monsters. To a conservative white lady with the fear of god in her, this is the work of the devil trying to infiltrate our lives and plant the seed of evil within us. This essentially meant we were excluded from this world wide, cultural phenomenon; not playing gameboy, not having the 'tazo's' you got in packs of chips, not watching it, etc. But this isn't really anything to hold a grudge over, although I'm sure there are quite a few people who would testify to the glory of Pokemon. But the the things that truly inhibited me (and my siblings) - and I struggle to exactly define it - was forcing her perspective of the world on us in a weird way. Obviously children learn from there parents in lots of ways, but this is where it feels weird. If i can put it this way... She would tell us about the world as she feared it, not necessarily as it was. By this i mean if i asked why should i brush my teeth (being a reluctant little kid) she would say something like, ""otherwise the other children won't want to be friends"". It's almost as if the whole world got described to us with a ""fear of my children being hurt"" filter on it. Which I came to understand as I got older, her just being protective over her children. But she could easily say its to keep your teeth from rotting or something like that, but it always came down to something with an element of fear for not being liked. And to her only the ideal is liked. This meant that when we presented an idea or a thought or an emotion to my mom, her response would be that of one that only considered how it will be perceived by the public and the public only accepts an idealized version of something. She would fail to tell us about the actual world in a way. She induced this always self conscious mentality into us, in the sense that our actions and reactions were determined by how it will be perceived. My brother, being a cool, nice guy rebel, would have a philosophy following something like ""People will judge you, so you might as well do what you want as long as it doesn't hurt other people"". This need to be perceived as ideal got turned on its head, resulting in my brother having a strong sense of being true to oneself and not some idea of ideal. My one sister acts in a very idealized way, as my mom would have it in some way. But she's very aware she only does this because of how we got raised. By knowing this she took control of it and didn't allow it to define her, she sort of went with it knowing who she really is. My other sister probably understood this effect my mother had the best. She is well aware of this aspect of the world, how something might be perceived and how it needs to be ideal or perceived as ideal. She also recognizes the source of this tendency, but she also incorporates it into how things are done. She has a strict schedule, good with money, always on time etc. She, just as all my siblings, are people of true substance. But I feel like I've lost a point of reference. This fear of not being perceived as ideal inhibited (and still does today) me from being myself. Myself being someone that might not agree with what someone said in a scenario, but fail to speak my mind because I'm afraid of how it might be perceived or that a person won't like me. So much so that I've been called a people pleaser quite often, or a social chameleon. And so i saw myself, not too long ago, as someone who is just a people pleaser. This thing my mom does resulted in me thinking I am this way because i had no true self confidence when I was younger, so might as well use it as a strength and relabel it in my brain as ""the ability to befriend people"". But this resulted in a ""nice guy but don't get me angry"" mentality, where this point of anger is always a hypothetical one. I justified my inactivity on a scenario by saying I was only inactive because the point at which I intervene has not yet been reached, but actually i was just scared to intervene. This made me a nice guy, by-stander. I felt disappointed in myself when someone says something i didn't agree with and i just kept quiet because I'm afraid I'm not portraying the ideal and therefore won't be liked. I couldn't stop seeing my self as someone who is just a nice guy, by-stander who is a people pleaser, and I saw this as a bad thing. I saw it as a bad thing because I knew I was doing it out of fear of not being liked and not wanting to show vulnerability. Over the next 3 years I would torture myself with this idea. Where this basic idea of I don't express myself because I fear not being liked ultimately turned into my believing I am a piece of shit that can not achieve anything. I do a lot of things in my own way, without care of how it will be perceived, but when it comes to social settings and interactions I fail to express myself to the point I sometimes wonder who I truly am. Its as if this one fear is controlling everything. I felt like a major disappointment because I could not get over this fear. Whenever a scenario presented itself, no matter how many pep talks I gave myself, I fail to express myself. This made me incredibly depressed and insecure; Not eating, not sleeping enough, sleeping too much, lost contact with 90% of friends, never wanted to go out, smoking excessively, not studying and failing a year. I felt like a loser in the truest sense of the word. I've come to realize how my mom truly works only in the last couple of months. From thinking this mother of mine is crazy and only imposes stuff based on fear to understanding she did it out of ""care"" even though it wasn't the best way. But what i learned most recently has me questioning a lot of things, but in some way it has liberated me. My mom started speaking of this intense and highly active ""battle"" of some sorts between her and a member of our extended family. Where its mostly psychological warfare; This other person who is spreading lies about her, impersonating her in the attempt defile her name all because this person is jealous. She exposed this new world to me and ever since, I have struggled to make sense of a lot of things I once thought I understood. This world she describes is one where she is the damsel in distress, under constant attack from an ""evil"". This was the ""evil"" she was trying to protect us from, this was why she is who she is. The part that gets me is that we (me and my siblings) have expressed our perceived hurt from her always wanting us to be ideal and her respond gets me. She says us being hurt is a result of this extended family member ruining her name, that this person infiltrated our subconscious by suggesting bad things about my mom to us. And the more we tell her our pain was caused by her not just accepting us, the more she says its because this person used cia-like tactics and much more sneakier ways to infiltrate our minds which results in us having pain/anger towards her. When we ask for evidence, there's a weird story that can confirmed sometimes but mostly she says there's no evidence because that's how they work, in the shadows. Now given this whole awakening to how spies and secret agents worked during WWII and the cold war, people became aware that its still possible today. So this thought of my mom's isn't found in complete fiction, but she has failed to provide evidence of most claims. If you've read this far, you'd be happy to know i've arrived at the point. My mother truly believes this, and if its not true, she is delusional. I am then a product of a crazy lady's fear induced method to raising children (how my father would probably describe her). If it is true, then she truly did try to protect us. I am then a product of a misunderstood lady who despite all odds protected us against a real ""evil"". Am I (and my siblings) using my mom as a scape goat for all these pains of mine? If what my mom says is true, I have been in the wrong for years. Thinking what i expressed earlier about how she induces a fearful mentality would be completely unfair of me. If it is not true, she is actually mad. She is then using this other person as a scape goat for our pains as she can not accept the reality we have presented her. This brings me to my final point. My mother believes this as the truth, nothing we say can prove her wrong as. If she believes this, how do I know what anyone believes in is worth believing. How can I tell someone if they're right or wrong? How can someone tell me if I'm right or wrong? Yes science accounts for a lot of the world, but not human consciousness. The state of the reality I'm confronted with seems to elude me, even though I know truth isn't necessarily singular which can result in different iterations of the concept of truth (essentially subjective interpretation). People say we act according to our own moral compass, that we do things we deem ""good"" for some subjective reason. If this compass of mine is based off a lie, how will I ever know how to trust my self and not doubt my own beliefs and sanity? PS: I saw Dan Harmon say he once just typed out all the shit that was bouncing around in his and found great relief doing so. This me basically doing the same, just getting it out."

I dont know how old I am exactly - less than 4 - its one of my earliest memories. We (myself, my parents, maybe my brother?) are at someone elses house. I dont remember if the house belongs to friends of my parents or parents of a kid (kids?) that Im supposed to be friends with. I dont recall other children, but there must have been some because I do remember a play room. The room is enormous and filled with toys. Lots of toys that I dont have. Im jealous and want to know why there are toys here that I dont have. And why do they get a room dedicated to all their toys? I just have a toy box that I have to lug out of the closet and pull into the living room. ..but ..it strikes me that out of all the cool toys in this room, they dont have my favorite action figure, and I like that action figure better than anything here. Plus, I forgot about the other box I have, full of legos. This room has a lot less legos, and I really like legos. Maybe its not so bad that I dont have all these toys, because this family doesnt have all the toys that I have either. I walk into the kitchen. My dad is sitting at the table talking with the parents of the house. What are they talking about? Adults are so smart. They always have new and interesting things to talk about. How do they do that? The only thing I ever have to talk about is what I want to be for Halloween. Whats up buddy? My dad calls out to me. Wheres mommy? I ask. Shes just trying to get some rest, buddy. Please dont bother her. . Sometime later Im in front of a door at the end of a hallway (Maybe it was immediately after my dad told me my mom was trying to sleep. Maybe I had gone back to the play room for a bit. I dont know - memories are tricky - they can get jumbled up and combined incorrectly with other memories - they can get overwritten with new memories that tell a better story of how youd like to think about yourself - ha, I probably wasnt quite so introspective at such a young age.. But I definitely remember this next part) I grab the doorknob and turn it slowly. The door isnt locked. Should I open it? Daddy said not to bother mommy. But mommy was sad earlier; I just want to tell her I love her. If she knows I love her maybe she can be happy. I push the door open slowly. The room is so dark. It shouldnt be this dark; the sun is still up outside. Is she there? Is this the right room? The room is so dark and I cant see everything. I can see a little though. The open door lets in a sliver of light from the hallway that exposes part of the bed a few feet away. I didnt see it at first, but shes there - a bump in the bed hidden under the covers. I can just make out the tippy-top of her jet black hair sneaking out from the thick comforter. I hesitate. Daddy said not to bother her because shes trying to get some rest. ..mommy.. I say softly. Hopefully I did right where she would hear me if she was awake, but not too loud that shell wake up if shes sleeping. She doesnt respond. Ill try just one more time. Mommy.. I love you. I say, just a little bit louder. Several moments of silence pass. And then.. No you dont. Go away. ------ Thats the only time I remember my mom telling me that I dont love her, but apparently it was a pretty regular occurrence. Im told that I would say I love you to my mom several times a day and she would always tell me that I was lying. She began suffering from a pretty severe prepartum depression while she was pregnant with my brother, and it went undiagnosed and untreated for over two years. My mom had always been shy and quiet and when she became even more reserved to hide her depression people didnt notice. My dad, a carpenter, worked all the time, coming home after everyone was asleep and leaving for the day before anyone woke up. He had noticed she was in a bad place, and thought it was because she was cooped up all day in a small dark condominium. He decided to build a huge house in the country with many windows to make her feel better. A grand Notebook-rivaling gesture when viewed from one angle. But, really, it was the trap that many men have fallen into of believing that the role of being a material provider is more important than physical and emotional presence. And my mom, unable to properly take care of herself, was left alone all day with two kids she didnt want. She tried to sleep away as much of her depression away as possible. There were often days where she wouldnt get out of bed at all. When she was up she was almost always filled with emotions that she didnt know how to cope with, and every time I saw her she was angry or sad I just wanted to let her know that I loved her. But every time I said the words I love you she rejected me. You see, in her unhealthy mental state she had come to believe that her two-year old son was, in her words, out to get her. She thought that I had this life mission of making her miserable. Every time I cried it was specifically to annoy her. Every time I acted out and sought attention it was just to enrage her. And every time I told her that I loved her I was clearly lying, and so she told me that I didnt love her. I think that fucked me up. Its hard to parse through this, because I dont remember most of it. Im going off of some things I sort of remember or vaguely knew to be true for a long time, but mostly from what my parents have told me when Ive tried to talk through this with them. And its weird to think about either of my parents during this time because theyre not the people that I know now or even the people that I have memories of. But that time in my life did happen, and two-year-old, three-year-old, four-year-old me had to figure out how to survive it. I dont think I fully understand the worldview and logic constructs I built up at that young age to deal with a reality where every time I tried to give my affection it was turned down. I know Im deeply uncomfortable with displaying affection and being vulnerable, but I dont know exactly why. Am I afraid of the pain of rejection? Do I feel like my affection is burdensome to others? Do I believe at some deep root level that Im incapable of love? Any reason I think of either strikes me as a common insecurity, and something that you just need to open yourself up to as a necessary part of the messy experience of human relationships. Or the reason strikes me as an outright falsehood that sounds absurd putting into explicit words. But I just cant seem to bring myself to do it. I wont be vulnerable or affectionate or encouraging or even friendly (Im usually nice because I dont like confrontation, but I consider that a different thing than friendliness). Every time Im presented with the opportunity its like some black box churns out a reason why this specific display of affection is inappropriate for that specific situation and I shut down the idea of expressing anything. Each individual time it always feels like the correct decision to make - to do or say nothing - to find a way out of whatever is making me uncomfortable. In that moment Im detached from the more logical side of me that knows I just need to get more exposure. I dont remember things I know - that by sheltering myself Im keeping my pattern of experiences with affection as this dark thing that doesnt actually reflect the real world - that I need to allow myself more exposure to vulnerability to introduce more positive experiences and brighten the average - that most people would appreciate if I offered some encouraging words - and most people would appreciate it if I offered more of myself in friendships - and I wont get rejected every time I assume I will and even when I do it might not be so bad. But every time that black box just goes to work on auto-pilot and suppresses whatever emotions it suppresses and gives me a reason that sounds logical at the time as to why not this time. I dont know; Im not really sure what the point of this post is. I guess I just wanted to share my story, and it was easiest to do that anonymously. Thanks for listening. "

If you dont know about Borderline Personality Disorder: Congratulations. In essence, BPD is a mood dis-regulation disorder in which a person, mostly women, cycles through mood instability, impulsive tendencies, self-destructive behavior, fleeting sense of self/self identity, and unstable interpersonal relationships. BPD is typically some kind of trauma-induced mental illness where the person irrationally fears abandonment and will do most things to avoid it. No Thats not true, I would literally do anything to avoid it and I have done things that I am not too proud of to avoid it. It is not quite like being Bi-Polar where a person might swing between manic episodes and periods of depression; I race through emotions at light speed through out the day, and honestly, its exhausting. There are no medications that truly alleviate symptoms and many mental health professionals dispute among themselves if it even really exists. It is notoriously difficult to diagnose and many professionals dont even want to put the diagnosis out there because BPD patients are considered too difficult to treat because of their fluid inconsistency. You can count on a Borderline to be unpredictable and most people eventually do not have good experiences with Borderlines. Suicidal idealization, self harm habits, impulsive behavior and the mood swings seem dramatic and alarming to more normal, better coping people. Borderlines come off as willfully manipulative, attention seeking and self centered individuals, ultimately resulting in the abandonment and rejection we fear the most. In actuality, Borderlines are often creative, intelligent, entertaining, passionate and inquisitive people. We just cant think and feel at the same time.

I grew up alongside 2 older sisters, which kind of made me an odd one out, and my mom always shared stories about her vulnerability growing up as a teenage girl in a poor part of South Africa. I eventually got into pornography, thanks to a really good feeling pre-mature orgasm, (In the middle of a church service mind you.) Which also went against my mothers wishes, and our very values as a family, but we were also slightly liberal with media so I could easily access it.

Sometimes I even fantasize about doing this. But I am also afraid to. It is a struggle for me every day just to try and use some facial expressions so I don't look like a stone-faced zombie, or ro add some vitality to my voice so I talk like a normal person at a normal volume instead of monotone muttering. I usually fail at even this. I try to smile and make eye contact throughout the day so people will not think I do not care. I have gotten better about these things than I used to be, but it is still a challenge some days. I often write, or you might call it journalling or something. I wrote in a notebook with a pencil about my thoughts abd feelings, or just what comes to my mind, especially when I am a little bit stoned. (or high, or whatever you want to call it. it's THC) sometimes I write heavy emotional stuff. I often take comfort in the fact that I am the only one who will be reading these words. I sometimes write in Japanese as well and take a similar comfort in knowing that even if someone did see it, they couldn't read the Japanese at least. not that anyone will be reading it, or would want to, but I guess it's just the thought. anyway, despite these thoughts, I also fantasize about showing some of it to someone, or someone reading it. a lot of what I wrote is nonsense or bullshit, but there is sometimes good stuff in there. back when I was unemployed for a long while and still living at my parents house I did this a lot more often than now. I have filled entire spiral bound notebooks. at least a couple by now, I think. I want to feel vulnerable and show my true self to someone, or someones, even over the internet. but I am afraid at the same time. I am afraid of feeling vulnerable even to my family. perhaps especially to my family. the few times I ever get close to vulnerability or true expression, to family or otherwise, is on the internet, or sms. text. written words seem to be the only way I am able to express myself. I am in a better place now, life-wise. I have a stable job and an apartment and I am alone at last. but I am still so very lonely, just as I have always been.

Recently, I've been doing a lot of self-discovery trying to find out what makes me tick and why I act the way I act. I have learnt a lot about myself in recent months and am very happy in the direction that I am going. I did although, come to the conclusion that I have been affected by something as a child that still impacts me to this day. I think that as a child I have been in situations where my whole class &amp; friends united and turned against me for having done something (memory is pretty vague or repressed at this point). This created a feeling of vulnerability and of weakness. It also created this idea that people were against me and that I was alone. Fast forward to today, well I am having trouble keeping relationships because I don't want to ask people to do too many things because I think that I may be a bother to them, I never feel wanted or appreciated and am always looking for other people to make plans with me for me to feel complete. If I don't see people for a day or two, I get very depressed and ""broken"". The way I see it, if I ask to see a friend too much, they may get annoyed at having to hang out with me that often. I always overthink and think that I may become annoying. Yet as soon as someone makes a plan with me I feel good for a few hours, then it's back to thinking that I am not enough. The thing is though, logically I know I am an extremely fun person to talk to and to be around. Yet I still feel this way. And also whenever I am in a situation where people are against me or where people seem to abandon me, there's this very unpleasant emotion inside of me that arises. It is like an inner abandoned child living inside of me. My question is, now that I am aware of this and of the cause of why I am feeling this way. What can I do to fix this? Is it fixable? Or will I be stuck to live with this my entire life? Thanks a lot!"

Also, for calling these people Apple and Citrus. Apple was introduced to me by Citrus in 2011. Citrus has a lot of power and influence and is a manipulative narcissist who is always aiding people in their own swift path to total personal annihilation on a big and often criminal scale. I knew Citrus because he liked my work and would propose dates etc. I did some work with Apple and he seemed like a really decent person. He was also successful and talented, one of the few people who managed to do well in a difficult field. Fast forward to a few weeks ago and Apple asked me for a drink. So we went out. I was ill and he looked after me, bringing me to the doctor's, getting me medicine, taking me to a hotel to sleep (not trying anything on me, although we kissed). In essence, I was moved by his openness, vulnerability and kindness. The next date was mentally unhinged. It was like he was cycling through all of these different characters on a level of instability like I've never seen (I've seen quite a lot). And it all went pretty disastrously. But in the time we spent together (2 days), I learned he'd been paying Citrus for work and the eve of the disaster he'd just come from a 4 hour meeting with Citrus. He then went driving cross country with one of Citrus' 'goonies', for lack of a better word. Apparently, Apple had cut off all ties to family and friends (saying he'd have them killed but was terrified of them because they kept trying to contact him) and business partners. The ONLY person he was now working with (paying to help him become a king) and spending time with, on an ongoing basis, was Citrus (and now his goony) because the only person he trusts is Citrus. Oh my goodness!! To be clear, Citrus is not a criminal but his favorite past time is rising people up for colossal falls. He knows how to play on people's vulnerabilities, loneliness, self doubt, aspiration and fear and then, destroy them. He finds it entertaining. Out of interest, I studied his activities over the years because I'd never seen anything like it before and I wanted to decode it. I only ever witnessed one off mental breakdowns but each person, with any longevity in his life, I've observed, at a distance, as their lives collapsed. I met up with Citrus to get more information and the inconsistencies in the story were a little ridiculous. So, I decided that it's most likely that Citrus realizes that Apple is suffering from Bi-polar disorder, possibly Schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder and has been simply taking money off of Apple (as Apple is very liberally giving it away, including maxing all his credit cards with enormous overdrafts - millions) and Citrus just recently managed to get a decent sum of money from 'unnamed friends', towards his work. Okay, so we have a man who is incredibly mentally unstable, who has access to a lot of money and a lifetime of trusted relationships (he's now burning up) and he trusts the only person he should NEVER trust. Unfortunately, I don't have much authority in the situation now and those reasons are complicated also. I asked Citrus to try and help him, as another human being, but Citrus seemed to get bristly that I care. And just told me to stay far, far away from Apple with such utterances as ""Ah, his ex-girlfriend, oh that poor, poor child, the horrible things that man has done to that poor child"" Any thoughts on what can be done and how I can help? Please note that this isn't a romantic interest but rather, that I'm a human being who sees another human being being demolished and I really don't want him to be destroyed. Many thanks!"

And I have pretty much always just kind of been a chameleon and talked like whoever was around me, parroting back things I've heard in other people's style with no more depth than, ""This happened and then this happened."" When I read about BPD, it describes my life the past few years so accurately that it's scary. The substance abuse, the vacillating between extremely high regard for my friends and almost hatred. Everyone in my family has pretty much the same behavior. I can go into more background if that would be beneficial, but I think that's enough to get the idea. I read some books, one about introversion, and one about shame and vulnerability by brene brown, and immediately when I finished those books, I felt like myself. I felt like I knew who I was for the first time in over a decade. These emotions came flooding in all at once, so sudden and powerful. It's pretty overwhelming. The good and the bad. Intense joy. Not so much depression anymore, but still a sense that I lack connection. But for the first time, maybe ever, I feel like I have an identity. And this has lasted consistently a few months now. My relationships with my other friends have improved, I feel more comfortable talking to people. I just feel like me. So, the relationship part. I obsessed over this one girl that I knew in high school. We were really close friends, but she had been in other relationships for most of the 8 years I've known her. I've never been in a proper relationship. After I got out of college, I moved to a different state and told her that I was in love with her before I moved. She was gracious and supportive but explained she didn't feel the same way. We stayed in touch on and off in different states, and in a few bouts of depression, I called her out of desperation and she calmed me down a few times, and then she came to visit me last year. I knew, the moment she told me she was coming, I knew I still wasn't mature enough to handle a visit from her. And I wasn't. I got obsessed again and got really depressed that I didn't know anyone else and that I still wasn't over her. So I told her I was still in love with her and said that I have no choice but not to talk to her ever again. Yeah I know, it's extreme. In the process, I was trying to explain that the things I say and do don't feel like the real me, and she thought I was saying that just so she'd like me more. She said she understood, but brushed it off thinking I was trying to change her mind about how she feels about me. I was really just trying to explain my perspective. I didn't really have the vocabulary at the time, nor the awareness to describe my emotions, so I didn't know how to explain that my personality wasn't just shyness, but a lack of identity. Where we left off at that point, she said why not take some time to figure things out and we'll be friends eventually. After this, and the timeline's a little hazy because I was drinking a lot, I started seeing a therapist who was just really not a good fit. I had a few other bouts of depression and sent this girl some pretty dark emails when I was drunk and put all of this negative shit on her about how much she hurt me. I don't know, it was messed up. Then called her again one more time when I was almost suicidal and she calmed me down again, and then I quit going to this therapist and started making lifestyle improvements. I should point out, she has her own problems, and I feel touchy about what I should say to her now. She's had a rough time of it herself and attempted suicide sometime after I moved. I feel so incredibly guilty and ashamed that I put all of this stuff on her when she had her own problems going on. That was so cruel of me. I sent her some emails a few weeks ago asking if I could start talking to her again and I apologized for the way I behaved last year. Unfortunately, this was all really poorly planned, and then I smoked some weed and got really paranoid that she took my emails negatively (I'll talk about the weed later, I think the short version is that I'm extremely cautious about how I use it and it feels 100% under control). And then I sent her a third email apologizing again. When I read these emails they sound really weird and manipulative to me, and I'm afraid she thinks I was apologizing just so I can start talking to her again. She hasnt replied. Honestly, I am thinking absolutely nothing romantic about this situation. I don't even think I'm mature enough for a relationship, I just want to talk to an old friend like I used to. My question is, do I explain to her that I was having identity issues and that I'm not anymore? Should I find a therapist to check myself here? I've been thinking about finding a therapist because there's a long road ahead. But honestly, it feels like I've got a handle on my emotions at this point and I can start to work on things by myself. I've already got this long email typed out explaining to this girl that when I told her I loved her, it was really a cry for help because I was so isolated. Explaining why I still want to talk to her. The reason I do want to talk to her is because she *is a good person*. I want to support her as a friend. She helped me down from the ledge, so to speak, and I want to say thank you somehow. But I can't do that if she still thinks I'm trying to make her fall in love with me or something. Is sending that email a bad idea? If you got an email basically saying, ""I wasn't actually attracted to you the way I thought I was, but you're a good person and you have the character and personality I wish I could have. I loved you because I thought you'd give me an identity,"" how would you react to that? Is that a creepy thing to hear? I have my motivations fully explained to myself, but I have no idea what is appropriate. I'm not hung up the way I used to be. I'm trying every avenue at my disposal to meet other people, I just want to talk to a cool person again. My theory is I got obsessed over her in the first place because she was the only person I've met who actually tried to get me to open up. She could tell there was a real me somewhere in there and I want to give her a chance to see that person. I just hate that I made so many mistakes getting to this point that she doesn't seem receptive to hearing from me. I would welcome any and all opinions. Thanks for taking the time to read this far. Tl;Dr - had identity issues. Don't anymore. Should I tell the girl I creeped out what was going on?"

It might be little uncomfortable to read :) +If this post doesn't fit here please leave a comment! It all started from last year. I was on the internet, I was visiting here and there. But then suddenly I witnessed something weird. So weird and creepy that made me almost cry. It was a video of me. Well, more sepcifically, a leaked [insert facepalm here] kind of video of me I took. My face was not on there but I immediately knew it was me. Yep. I was hacked. Without even knowing anything. And then my life has changed completely. I became extremely, EXTREMELY paranoid (mainly about cybersecurity stuff). And I mean REALLY paranoid. I started to doubt everything. I started making up weird irrational thoughts in my head to figure out what exactly caused this. I searched about all kinds of shits on google. THAT was nightmare. I was becoming more and more irrational and paranoid(and I am STILL quite paranoid. But I think it's becoming better) The thoughts I made up were so irrational that if I tell about them to other people they would ignore that. I didn't even watch Netflix. I didn't even take selfie or anything anymore.. well this is reasonable I guess. Now I don't even turn light on my room now(that is because I fear that there MIGHT be a sort of shady chip(I know. I know. Tech guys would laugh at me and I would laugh too.. Just if I were not this paranoid) on my lightbulb or whatever so I'd end up get hacked again. I use freaking candle at night now. And I use match to light them. Well some of you guys would say if you are that paranoid how tf you're on the interent. That's kinda right but hey, I'm telling you. All this is completely irrational and weird lol. I'm starting to doubt myself too. Like when I lock the door, I start to make up weird reasons in my head that the door wouldn't be properly locked(sorry, English is so difficult) even though it WOULD be properly locked. So I repeat the same thing several times just to literally convince myself about the fact that the goddamn door would be properly locked. I format my computer every day, and I factory resetted my phone over 50 times til now. I've spent 12 hours on that sort of stuff yesterday. Maybe it's just me being that kind of easily-being-paranoid person but I live like this anyway. I DO miss my old life when I didn't bothered with formatting computer for 12 hours a day.. but I just can't help with that. Anyway.. I think this is it. I just wanted to share my story.. Lol. I really hope you guys won't go through this nightmare."

I was supposed to be working with a partner my colleague and he was supposed to show me how things work and give me the guides. However I was just thrown to the wolves. With no guidance and no help. And I was told to just do everything and my colleague didn't do any work so it was all me. Past 1 month I've been getting scolded by my service delivery manager for everything, even when it's not my fault I'm still getting scolded. I.e. I'm doing work and I didn't see my phone of a message sent by my service delivery, and I got scolded for not looking at my phone for the message. When I'm literally sitting behind him and he knows I was super busy. My colleague has resigned. And Its not gonna be more hectic is just that past 1 month I've been getting too much scolding and I feel so scared to go to work. I feel so tired cause I've been working from 9am to 10pm almost daily. My main team with me main manager back in the main office that I belong to had told me to just hang in there for few more months. However my mentors at work has told me to ignore my service delivery managers scolding and just do my work as much as I can. And errors are very common in the IT industry. But i don't know how to deal with this scolding daily. I feel so hurt tired, exhausted. I cry every night before I go to bed. I've thought of resigning but my main manager has told me to just hang in there as he's finding a new partner for me to share the load with. Should I resign or just hang in there? I don't know how to deal with the constant scolding. I keep crying every night. I can't deal with it much more. I've thought of suicide a few times but I know that's not the option. Ikke my job but I don't know how to deal with the constant scolding. Please help me. Before my thoughts really bring me to the suicide route."

I have very bad imposter syndrome where I feel like Im not deserving to be in my major. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. I no longer take my meds because they just werent doing it for me anymore. Im doing well in all of my classes except for one. My professor is known for being harsh and he left an aggressive comment on one of my assignments. I showed it to many people that work in the field to get other opinions and they all agreed the response was very much out of line. Thats when I talked to one of the heads at my schools center for student success about it who later referred to me to the dean. I talked to the dean and he has 5-6 students that complain about my professor a year. I told the dean to take no action because Im afraid of retaliation. The intensity of the course and other things happening in my life made it difficult for me to do well. First off, I was getting cyber stalked by a guy I was seeing on this platform. Secondly, my grandpa from italy died and due to the coronavirus my family couldnt attend a funeral. There was no funeral for him sadly. I told none of my professors about my loss because I didnt want to seem like an over emotional female. I also feel like I only had one day to grieve because the next day I had to go to my work study job. On the bright side in my other Cybersecurity classes I have all As in them and I also have an A in my German class. I feel like if I dont pass the course Ill end up acting upon my thoughts which I dont want to do."

I have a little brother but the games he plays on his computer are noisy enough that I cant concentrate. I feel like I can't handle all of this stimuli.

However, someone told me that if I became a Nurse or worked in a medical office, then I would be a liability to the doctor. Afterwards, I tried to pursue somethng in computers, IT, and even cybersecurity but most of these careers require or may require a security clearance. I can not get a security clearance because I have a mental disorder. It was so challenging. Right now i am pursuing Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. Why? Because Business is the way dreams come true and Marketing is how you share those dreams. If you are in my position- constantly changing majors to find one that is hiring for related positions in your city. Just know there are so many others in your position. Also, this is something I wish I knew before I sought help for mental health. I wish I prayed to my higher power more because most of the people working in mental health can't be trusted. If you were sent to the hosptial a lot while being a student- you know that a lot of graduate schools look at that and don't care what your reason was. They only care about the bad grade or withdrawal. Just be careful out there everyone and Merry Christmas!"

I was always happy. After a year of not getting any job in the IT field I got a job as a security officer and i am unsatisfied in my life. I stopped my hobbies like programming and tech related things because it reminds me that after all of my effort i dont have any tech job which is all i want out of life.
