He'll chuckle, and stop after I even start trying, even if I'm trying to be sexy about it. He's danced with me maybe twice in a lot of years. He definitely won't dance together in public at my favorite live music place. My first boyfriend left me alone on the dance floor at our first dance, though he had danced with other girls before. He loterally said it would be weirs to dance wirh a short girl (ouch). Is this an attraction thing? A respect thing? Vulnerability? What is this?"

Recently its gotten kinda bad. I feel like I need therapy but I struggle with my ego. For the record, Im no genius and I know that but I have a big ego that I cant get past. I feel like if I go to a therapist it will be a waste of time because I know Ill sit there and start thinking to myself thoughts like oh I know what the therapist is trying to do or I already knew that I dont want to have thoughts like that trust me. Ive just always struggled to take advice or let myself be vulnerable. Its sad but Ive had times in my life where Ive basically faked vulnerability just because I am self aware enough to know I struggle with it. Ive never legitimately been vulnerable with anyone in my adult life. I dont know where this post is going m, goodnight."
3,vulnerability,AskMen,"Single men, how do you occupy your time when living alone?",1,ifdhcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/ifdhcw/single_men_how_do_you_occupy_your_time_when/,2020-08-24 09:10:53,"Firstly, I hope you reading this are doing well and healthy. I recently moved into a bigger home, alongside with my family about two years ago. This was a very fortunate opportunity for me and my family, as we lived in a tenement and had little to no room. Three people were living in an one bedroom apartment, and with 300 square feet. I'm currently living with family, but expect a move out in maybe couple of months, or end of next year. For my whole life, I've been a mother's boy at heart. I would do anything for family. My mother hasn't lived an easy life. And we're a pretty traditional family. Unlike others, she has been very supportive of me and my growth, never judging me. While we have our discussions and disagreements, she has been my hero. At first, I wasn't ready to move. But now, as I've gotten older, I've been ready, but stayed behind to support my family. Parents are divorced, and I'm the main breadwinner in my family. We kept our childhood home as it was rent-stabilized, and have been subletting the apartment. However the previous landlord is now requesting that one of us live there, or forfeit the home. I've been thinking about moving out. It's not a monetary issue, but I've been feeling anxious. How do you live alone? The thoughts I have even now, living under the same roof. I've never been dependent on my family, but feel I also should take this next step in my career. What can I do to feel better about the choices I make? The scariest thing is being left alone with my thoughts. I don't have any friends, and have largely been inactive on any hobbies, for fear of vulnerability. This is a ramble, but if you understand where I'm coming from, maybe you can chime in. TLDR: Main breadwinner and supporting my family, thinking about moving back to childhood hood, but how to live alone, and deal with the thoughts and loneliness I might feel separated from family."

Not to toot my own horn, but Id say Im a catch (well educated, kind, good morals/values, attractive, self aware, health/ fitness conscious, etc). I usually wouldnt have entertained a talking stage for such a long time, but I thought giving some time and patience to someone who had relationships with some women who cheated/ physically abused him in the past would require more time for trust to be established. I was open to it because we agreed to be exclusive, but I honestly thought maybe there was a fear of intimacy/ vulnerability. Ive tried bringing the conversation up, but it gets largely ignored, but other topics will still be discussed. Ive decided to move on since I know the issue isnt with me, but Im just curious why a seemingly good man would drag this out/ do that to a good woman?"

6,vulnerability,AskMen,"For the first time in my virgin life (M28), Im confronting my personal shame on relationships/sex",1,hnd7oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/hnd7oe/for_the_first_time_in_my_virgin_life_m28_im/,2020-07-08 18:17:47,"**Warning**: This is a boring story about a 28 year old virgin. Please consider returning to /r/funny for your own amusement. **Background** I grew up in a loving, traditional, and Christian household. My parents have a very healthy marriage of 30 years and despite arguments and raising voices here and there in addition to the fact that they dont display physical affection towards one another, I would consider them to be in an ideal marriage. Ever since I was young, I always thought that I would marry and have children someday because thats what growing up meant. Im sure we all thought that. High school went by and I didnt get into any relationships. Despite the fact that there were a couple girls that were interested in me, I was a Christian at the time and thought my future wife and I would fall in love at first sight under Gods preordained plan. Yikes. During college, I was in a fraternity and let loose after living in a tiger parent household for 18 years and partied a lot, experimented with different drugs, and had a few girls in my bed at times. Despite the pressure for guys to not be a virgin by college age, despite the fact that most of my friends were in relationships, and despite the fact that I am still embarrassed that I havent had any serious relationships or sex, I never made it past 2nd base with any of those girls. I genuinely thought my future romantic interest would commend me for my restraint as I was holding myself for the one. Yikes 2: Electric Boogaloo I often asked myself if I wrong for picking up signals from these girls and just ignoring them. Truth is, I was afraid. I was programmed to think that sex before marriage was wrong. I was afraid I would reach ecstasy in world record 1 second. I was and am still afraid of my Frenulum tearing during sex. I was afraid that my reputation would be damaged for having sex and hurting people by ignoring them afterwards when I didnt really like them in the first place. I never had condoms during those situations and I was afraid I might knock someone up or get STDs from hidden jolly ranchers. This brings me to some questions to the guys/girls here that has had sex casually and/or with romantic partners. Do you feel a deep connection with them after sex and can there truly be no emotions after sex? Have there been cases where girls/guys falls for you harder and how did they react towards you if you see them on a daily basis? I always thought that sex was dangerous because the aftermath will always involve feelings from the release of dopamine + oxytocin and I didnt want others or myself to get hurt. Thats what I told myself anyways. **INTERMISSION. DRINK SOME WATER** Eventually, I fell for a nice Christian girl and thought this was finally it. She had mutual interest in me and things were exciting at first, but I watched as her beaming eyes slowly turned to disgust and in the end, she told me that we werent compatible and I dont blame her one bit. As a 4th year, I had stopped attending church (became non-religious but didnt know it yet), my grades were terrible, my room was an embarrassing mess, and I had no plan for myself in the future. I didnt realize I was depressed until years after. To my surprise, there were girls that were interested in that wreck of a person but I knew they didnt know me well enough to see that my core was rotten and it wouldve only been a matter of time until they found out. I was afraid of being abandoned in the end so despite making out with them on their beds, I would stop, go back home and move on with my life. Ive made massive improvements in every aspect of my life (thank you Jordan Peterson and get well soon) after college and sacrificed my social life and my mid 20s to be happy with where I am and where Im headed but to this day, my view on relationships remain pessimistic. The relationships I saw during college honestly disgusted me. People were getting into relationships for a quick and dirty solution to duct tape their loneliness and lack of self-love, I saw my friends girlfriend cheat on him and try to justify her actions, and saw jealousy between guys and girls ruin other relationships. I ask myself, why should I have to deal with all that stress? Im someone that enjoys solitude and only get mild loneliness on occasions. If I get horny, I can just whack the dragon and put it back to sleep. Most relationships I saw were in stark contrast from the loving partnership my parents continue to have to this day and I cant tell if relationships are not for me or if Im ashamed of my lack of relationships. **EPILOGUE** In the present, theres a girl that wants to see me when its her birthday. Weve always had a great time when we were together but when she brings up the topic on sex or relationships, I change the topic or omit the truth about my past. These are the only topics I actively avoid discussing with anyone and I wish I didnt do that. My anxiety stems from reading about relationships gone wrong in /r/relationship_advice or witnessing them firsthand. It also comes from the idea of letting my date know that Im a virgin and that Ive never been in a serious relationship. If I were in the other persons shoes, this would seem like a huge red flag to me. What can I do to face the truth about my lack of experience and convey this vulnerability in future dates? If I only like someone like 60%, is that enough of a reason to get into a relationship? I think throughout my life, that answer wouldve been a no but Im only getting older at this point. Should sex come before getting into the relationship or the other way around? With divorce rates in America at 60%, are traditional family values dying and is heartbreak inevitable? What do you think about the idea of having kids and not getting married? What are your thoughts on how I view relationships and sex? Also, is fear of a torn frenulum a real thing for you uncircumcised folks? Is it preventable? I apologize if I sound like a spoiled kid that lacks initiative when it comes to relationships or if it seems like Im making a mountain out of a molehill but this is a part of me Im ashamed of and I want to overcome it. TLDR: 28 year old virgin that wants to be able to talk about my lack of relationship history openly on dates."

I get frustrated thinking that my guy friends and I just talk about the most superficial things. Im way too scared to step over and expose vulnerability when Im actually needing help. Talking with women seems to be easier since I dont mind doing that with them, but I would really like to do this with some bros sometimes too, because Im a bro. I have a line of counselors which help, but it also can make me feel alone and weird sometimes. I have a hard time articulating myself so I apologize if this is hard to follow.

It's nearly impossible to distinguish a player/liar within the first few dates. Plus, additional risks like infections. BUT I've heard that some men will take not sleeping with them as a lack of interest or they'll think that you are arrogant and think too highly of yourself and will judge you extra hard when you do sleep with them. AND making a guy wait puts you a risk that he will sleep with someone else and develop a closer bond with that person. I also know that people say that you should when you're ready and feel the connection but often there is a great sexual connection but the guy isn't emotionally available, wants something different or doesn't want something serious with you.

18,vulnerability,AskMen,How do you emotionally support your male friends? Are you the sort of friend your friends could cry to?,1,fpswvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fpswvc/how_do_you_emotionally_support_your_male_friends/,2020-03-27 18:44:40,"Recently, I've seen a lot of men discussing their lack of social support systems outside of their mothers and girlfriends/wives. It appears many men feel as though their personal problems matter less to society or their social groups than women's problems. So putting aside societal oncenrs, I was wondering how we, as men, can sometimes contribute to our male friends feeling isolated or unable to open up without judgement, and how we could change to let our friends be more vulnerable around us. A lot of this obviously comes from the way that men are socialized and pervading beliefs that we're all very familiar with, like men are supposed to be strong and unmoved, never cry, never ask for help, never show vulnerability (or 'weakness'). But I believe some of it might also be the way the we react to our friends vulnerability, the way we talk in social situations about men than seem to need help, the way we react when our friends cry, and the level of concern we show for our male friends' emotional well-being. So that lead me to a couple questions: How do you show your male friends you're emotionally there for them? How would/do you react if your friend cried/cries? (outside of major grief or pain, rather cried out of frustration or a lesser sadness) Do you judge men who cry? (If you believe men lack support structures) How can you be part of a good support structure for the men in your life? Do you make fun of your friends if they seem vulnerable or 'weak'? Do you make fun of other men for being vulnerable or 'weak'? Do you think you've fostered relationships where your friends can ask you for (emotional) help without judgement?"

I am married and i have an excellent wife and we are waiting for a baby (5 monts). To start my question and can support me with your experiences and how you have solved this in your live, I will discuss some important aspects in my life ... .- My blood father rejected me knowing that my mother was pregnant with me. I look so much like him that once time Facebook related to his profile in the labeling. .- I grew up with a father who adopted my brother and me. .- My brother grew up hating me because he didn't have the last name of our adoptive father and I did. .-The Christian religion received my parents and my father stopped beating me and being hard on me. .- I cried for everything and at 7 years I was doing badly in primary school, so they decided to change my primary school by finishing my 2nd year of primary school. .- In third grade I was already applying to school and I was excelling a little in math . .- My math teacher sexually abused me taking advantage of my vulnerability and the great confidence of my parents towards teachers and that I had to learn from life and stop crying for everything. .- My math teacher invited 2 other teachers to rape me. This for more than 3 months on different occasions ... I will write this topic in another post ... .- My brother also abused me indirectly by touching me and humiliating me sexually, he is older than me for 3 years. I already forgave it but it is still engraved in my memory. .-By the time I turned 14 I experienced ""sexuality"" for the first time when my cousin forced me to penetrate him through the anus after blackmailing me by telling my mother that I masturbated in the shower. It was nothing pleasant nor did I like doing it. .- Through a dating application , I contacted a child, older than me at that time for me to give him in the ass, we met in the bush and ended up giving him ... i did not feel anything pleasant or pleased me at all . .- For my 16 years my mother asks me if I am Gay, to which I answer no ... she tells me that her dream in life is to see me married, with children a wife and see me prosper with my heritage, that being gay is not normal and that God would not agree with it because the ass was not made for that ... but if so, she would accept me , but I had to tell her at that time. I repeated that I am not gay. .- By the time I turned 17 I looked for a man to teach me to have sex, he took me for the first time (I looking for him ) and I took it also several times ... at that time my pleasure was only momentary , not enjoyed and was more afraid than pleasure. .- I continued in the search of my satisfaction when I was 18 until 22, at that time I had only had sex with men and almost always as a top (an active guy who penetrate his partner). My moments varied between an hour or 3 hours without stopping, but it only ended if I masturbated. .- I met a guy, a student at the university, through others I had already met, at that time I had many sexual relationships with different people. if 3 times a week and 3 different people in those same. The guy I'm talking about gave me a chance that I could be gay, but inside me I said I was straight, only that I was experiencing. .- Then, in 2014 I met a girl, I corresponded to her affections and intentions of formalizing a stable and lasting relationship . I had sex with her for more than a year 5 months without looking for anyone more 100% faithful. Later I found out that she was looking for conversations to whom she had taken her virginity, a man, little older than her, already married and with children. His wife was the one who warned me that there were strong conversations with images of them naked and that she was the one who insisted they see each other. I faced her and she denied it , we separated for a month. .- During that month in my mind the idea of wanting to satisfy me returned and I looked through a dating app and it turned out that I met a classmate of her. My wife at that time my girlfriend and I studied the same career. With this guy, it was only talk and an alleged video call that was never made . but I stuck in the conversation on Skype . .- I return with my girlfriend, she insists on returning and I forgive her. But over the months she finds my conversation on Facebook and Skype and connects the conversations for seeking someone when we parted and he was a man. I explained that I was curious to experience something, but that it did not happen and she accept it. For her I had told her that it was very experiensed on sex with women and I had a lot of sex, I liyed. But they didn't satisfy me . .-Over time, she kept checking my messages and I was faithful, but I wanted to annoy her and I pretended a conversation that rose in tone at the moment that my friend sent images of a guy and a huge penis, very real to believe that He had taken a homemade photo. My girlfriend (yes, the same) saw my conversation while I bathed ... too fast to be true ... and I faced it ... I repeated that I would like to experience that, it was curiosity and that she would understand why my concern to find something like that (and i had talked about my teachers when I got raped on childhood, only that part of the story) she understood and made me promise never unfaith her , so i promised to never cheat with a woman. This time we lived together, we had 3 years of dating and a year of union free. .-Spend a little more time, already at 5 years of relationship (2 of living together) and I ask for marriage. I felt very happy with her by my side and felt that she supported me in every aspect of my life. .- I stopped looking for sex, for more than 8 months, but something in me woke up the hormone and I went back to look for a guy through an application , I told him a part of my story and he told me that he understood me and that He could help me. He offered me that he could be a bit rude to me in sex and that with that I was going to free myself. .- This guy, already in his apartment, I injected the drug called crystal in my anus and with euphoria I said many things that I will never forget ... among them I realized that I did not love my girlfriend, who was only with her for appearances and i wasn't really happy. This guy put his penis into me on a violent way that made me bleed and hurt a lot ... that night I didn't come home, I had marks from a board marked on my buttock, marks from a belt , I was panting and sweating like crazy and especially I My body hurts a lot, I had humiliated myself in a very strong way and I had floor marks on my fists, knees and in general my whole body was marked. My skin is clear so it was very noticeable that something had happened. Thursday night all this happened .- On Friday I arrived at work and pretended that someone had thrown me down some stairs, everyone believed me and I already believed history. .- I went back to the apartment of this guy and he mistreated me again in the same way again, but I refused and resisted the drug and he told me that it would only work if i took the drug again on me so I decided to go home. .-At home nobody noticed my marks, luckily my skin heals quickly . But until Saturday night I ask my girlfriend to buy me an ointment for hemorrhoids, it hurt so badly that I could not walk. She forced me to show her my anus and was scared of the way I was mistreated. .-On Sunday it turned out that I ended up convincing myself to go to see to the doctor because I wanted pain relievers , they operated on me and I ended up interned for 2 weeks. .-I finish my recovery of a month without any sex and return to work. .- One guy who i contacted him by a sex app but with whom I never had sex before, contacted me and agreed to see him, I gave him oral and he to me, I liked the kind treatment of a man. .-The next day I had intense sex with my girlfriend and I liked it so much that I felt really in love with her and decided that we should get married without frills, that it was for love and not appearances. .-We planned to buy a house, to buy the house that we liked, we were busy getting plans to married. We got married at an express wedding by the civilian. .-My now wife, tells me that we are pregnant and I feel happy and sad by news at the same time, I feeling that I am a child I remember how unhappy I was as a child and immersed myself in a sea of anecdotes . .-I seek the understanding of an adult to advise me, but with this we end up having sex and he turns out to be a pedophile who wants to introduce my son to mold it to his taste and pleasure ... .-I move away from this man, but I still attract his image ... he looks so much like my math teacher ... .-I seek refuge to my emotions in someone of my age and it turns out that we also ended up having strong but very emotional sex ... (with strong I mean not as slow as I did with the man, I remind you that I had an anus operated on already 8 months ago ) .- We have so many ideals in common this guy and I that ends up attracting me so much, his voice makes me smile , talk with him makes me sigh, I feel relaxed and calm by his side, I feel that everything is possible and that I can really be happy. .- I return home and my wife waits for me (still pregnant, already 5 months) and I curl up and she tells me that she had worried about me the night before I did not come home to be with my friends, it turns out that my sister-in-law scared arriving beaten home and my wife thought that I would arrive the same or worse because i was on a party ... I got back worse at home from my private party with my friend, because in my mind now it was clouded with the idea that I wanted a divorce to be with that guy who made me to sigh. .-But my wife pulls an ace up her sleeve and proposes that she can stimulate me, because she found a small dildo that I had for rehabilitation by surgery and she completely understood my situation . She suggested that I also would buy one dildo of my penis size or smaller to make her feel comfortable when I was not at home and I accept (not even buy them ). .- The idea that I have a wife who has understood me at every stage, who is next to me, who is going to be the mother of my son, who loves me in such a passionate way makes me understand that I also love her I love her, because I reciprocate in many ways. Only sexually I'm insecure. I had not felt a feeling towards anyone like the one I felt for that guy and my wife before. And I realize that it is very likely to be gay or bisexual, because of my history, but I feel straight because I love my wife and the idea of not separating from her makes me happy. .- With this guy that I fell in love with in a fleeting way, I indicated that if I had to leave someone it would be him, since I am still not sure with my feelings ... and he understands me, but returns to the issue of he wanting to have sex because he liked me a lot ... there I understand that I am physically attractive, but nobody has been interested in what I say or think or what I think is right more than my wife. .-Now I am confused because despite having moved away from this guy, I am still in love with him, but at the same time in love with my wife and greatly touched by my son who is still on his way. .- I do not feel to have been unfaithful before this guy, with him I really feel guilty because it corresponded in mind and soul to two people when always, behind , it was just sex. .- Among the talks I had with him, he made me wonder what decision should I make to be really happy ?. .- I decided to continue with my wife and my family, the direction that I have taken so far, but I know that within me I will continue to seek the pleasure of being with a man and that he treats me in a way between wild and sweet. .- With my wife sex is very routine and even tedious, just one posture, if it gets interesting there are two. Oral sex is not good at all, and when she masturbate me I feel that it does so abruptly but without touch until it bothers me. With a man, I like to have oral sex, I feel a great pleasure, when I am active I feel that I can be as rude or soft as I want and I feel that the other is upset with pleasure for me. when I penetrate my wife she gets very hot and loves it very much, but if I want to be rude she asks me to stop and it is only in one position , that of the missionary. which is why I get tired of the monotony and end up taking my erection off. When Im on bottom (passive), I feel that there is nothing better in the world (talked about sex), that with an accurate movement that makes the other I can reach the climax , but the same, in both cases, with man or woman I almost always end up masturbating because It lasted a lot or because the other or she already got tired. .-My sexual pleasure reaches the point where I want her to be more open to experiencing sexual pleasure, as a man makes me feel. And with a man I feel that he lacks the feeling that I would like in the relationship . .- I am really confused because I feel that if I ask my wife to penetrate me I could lose her, but if I do not, I feel that I could lose her if she finds me that I am still looking for sex with a man. **En espaol:** Hola, soy un chavo de 26 aos, recin cumplidos.Soy de Mxico y espero que mi nivel de ingles sea al adecuado para darme a enterder. Estoy casado con un excelente esposa y estamos esperando un beb. Para iniciar mi pregunta y puedan apoyarme con sus experiencias y cmo han resuelto esto en sus vidas, les platicar unos aspectos importantes en mi vida... .- Mi padre de sangre me rechazo al saber que mi madre estaba embarazada de mi. Me parezco tanto a l que una vez Facebook me relaciono con su perfil en el etiquetado. .- Crec con un padre que nos adopto a mi hermano y a mi. .- Mi hermano creci odindome porque el no tenia el apellido de nuestro padre adoptivo y yo si. .-La religin Cristiana recibi a mis padres y mi padre dejo de golpearme y ser duro conmigo. .- Yo lloraba por todo y a mis 7 aos me iba mal en la primaria, por lo que decidieron cambiarme de primaria terminando mi 2do ao de primaria. .- En tercero de primaria ya estaba aplicndome en la escuela y estaba sobresaliendo un poco en matemticas. .- Mi maestro de matemticas abus sexualmente de mi aprovechndose de mi vulnerabilidad y de la gran confianza de mis padres hacia los maestros y que yo deba aprender de la vida y dejar de llorar por todo. .- Mi maestro de matemticas invit a otros 2 maestros a que me violaran. Esto durante mas de 3 meses en distintas ocasiones... Redactare en otro post este tema... .- Mi hermano tambin abusaba de mi de forma indirecta hacindome tocamientos y humillndome sexualmente, el mayor que yo por 3 aos. ya lo perdon pero sigue grabado en mi memoria. .-Para cuando cumpl 14 aos experimente por ""primera vez"" mi sexualidad cuando mi primo me obligo a que lo penetrara por el ano despus de chantajearme con decirle a mi madre que me masturbaba en la regadera. No fue nada placentero ni me gust hacerlo. .- Por medio de una aplicacin de citas, contact a un nio, mayor que yo en ese entonces para yo darle por el culo, nos citamos en el monte y termine dndole... no se sinti nada placentero ni me agrad en lo absoluto. .- Para mis 16 aos mi madre me pregunta si yo soy Gay, a lo que yo le respondo que no... ella me dice que su sueo en la vida es verme casado, con hijos una esposa y verme prosperar con mi patrimonio, que ser gay no es normal y que dios no estara de acuerdo con ello porque el ano no fue hecho para eso... pero que si fuera as ella me aceptara, pero deba decrselo en ese momento. Le repet que no soy gay. .- Para cuando cumpl 17 busque a un seor que me enseara a tener relaciones sexuales, el me cogi por primera vez (yo buscndolo) y me lo cog tambin en varias ocasiones... en ese entonces mi placer solo era momentneo, no lo disfrutaba y tenia mas miedo que placer. .- segu en la bsqueda de mi satisfaccin cuando tenia los 18 hasta los 22, en ese entonces solo haba tenido sexo con hombres y casi siempre como activo. Mi momentos variaban de entre una hora o 3 horas sin parar, pero solo terminaba si yo me masturbaba. .-Conoc a un chavo, estudiante en la universidad, por medio de otros que ya haba conocido, en ese entonces mantena muchas relaciones sexuales con diferentes personas. si es que 3 veces a la semana y 3 personas distintas en esas mismas. El chavo del cual hablo me dio pie a que poda yo ser gay, pero dentro de mi yo deca que era heterosexual, solo que estaba experimentando. .- Luego, conoc en el 2014 a una chava, yo le correspond a sus afectos e intenciones de formalizar una relacin estable y duradera. Mantuve relaciones sexuales con ella durante mas de un ao 5 meses sin buscar a nadie mas fiel 100%. Despus me entere que ella buscaba en conversaciones a quien le haba quitado su virginidad, un seor, poco mayor que ella, ya casado y con hijos. Su esposa fue quien me advirti que haba conversaciones fuertes con imgenes de ellos desnudos y que ella era quien le insista que se vieran. La enfrente y lo neg, nos separamos por un mes. .- Durante ese mes en mi mente volvi la idea de querer satisfacerme y busque por medio de una app de citas y resulto que me encontr con un compaero de clases de ella. Mi esposa en ese entonces mi novia y yo estudiamos la misma carrera. Con este chavo solo fue platica y una supuesta videollamada que nunca se efectu. pero quedo grabado en las conversacin de Skype. .- Regreso con mi novia, ella me insiste en volver y la perdono. pero con los meses ella encuentra mi conversacin de Facebook y de Skype y las conecta y me reclama por haber buscado a alguien cuando nos separamos y que era un hombre. Le explique que tenia la curiosidad de experimentar algo, pero que no se dio y lo acepto. Para ella yo le haba contado que era un don juan con las mujeres y me la pasaba cogiendo con muchas pero no me satisfacan. .-Con el tiempo, ella segua revisando mis mensajes y yo le era fiel, pero quise molestarla y fing una conversacin que se subi de tono en el momento que mi amigo mando imgenes de un chavo y un pene enorme, muy real para creer que se haba tomado una foto casera. Mi en ese momento novia (si, la misma) vio mi conversacin mientras yo me baaba... muy rpida para ser verdad... y me encaro... le repet que me gustara experimentar que era curiosidad y que ella entendera el porque mi inquietud de buscar algo as (ya le haba platicado que mis maestros me haban violado de nio, solo esa parte de la historia) ella lo entendi y me hizo prometer que jams la engaara, lo le promet que nunca la engaara con ninguna mujer. Aqu ya vivamos juntos, llevbamos 3 aos de novios y un ao de unin libre. .-Pasa un poco mas el tiempo, ya a los 5 aos de relacin (2 de vivir juntos) y le pido matrimonio. Yo me senta muy feliz con ella a mi lado y senta que ella me apoyaba en cada aspecto de mi vida. .- Deje de buscar sexo, por mas de 8 meses, pero algo en mi me despert la hormona y volv a buscar a un tipo por medio de un aplicacin, le cont una parte de mi historia y el me dijo que me entenda y que poda ayudarme. Me ofreci que poda ser un poco rudo conmigo en el sexo y que con eso yo iba a liberarme. .- Este tipo, ya estando en su departamento, me inyecto la droga llamada cristal en el ano y con la euforia yo dije muchas cosas que no olvidare jams... entre ellas me di cuenta que no amaba a mi prometida, que solo estaba con ella por las apariencias y que no era feliz realmente. Este tipo me meti el pene de forma violenta que me hizo sangrar y doler muchsimo .. esa noche no volv a casa, tenia marcas de una tabla marcada en mi nalga, marcas de un cinturn, estaba jadeando y sudando como loco y sobre todo me dola mucho mi cuerpo, me haba humillado de una forma muy fuerte y tenia marcas del piso en mis puos, rodillas y en general todo mi cuerpo estaba marcado. Mi piel es clara as que era muy notorio que algo haba pasado. Jueves en la noche paso todo esto .- El viernes llegue al trabajo y fing que alguien me haba tirado por unas escaleras, todos me creyeron y me cre ya historia. .- Regrese al departamento de este chavo y me volvi a maltratar de la misma forma otra vez, pero me negu y me resist a la droga y me dijo que solo funcionaria si me drogaba as que decid volver a casa. .-Ya en casa nadie noto mis marcas, por suerte mi piel sana rpido. Sino que hasta el sbado en la noche le pido a mi prometida que me compre una pomada para las hemorroides, me dola de una forma tan fuerte que no poda caminar. Ella me obligo a mostrarle mi ano y se asusto de la forma en que estaba maltratado. .-El domingo resulto que termine convencindome de ir a consultar por que quera analgsicos, me operaron y termine internado por 2 semanas. .-Termino mi recuperacin de un mes sin nada de sexo y vuelvo al trabajo. .- Un viejo conocido con el cual nunca tuve sexo anteriormente, me contacta y accedo a verle, le di oral y el a mi y me gusto el trato amable de un hombre. .-Al da siguiente tuve sexo intenso con mi prometida y me gusto tanto que me sent realmente enamorado de ella y decid que deberamos casarnos sin lujos, que fuera por amor y no apariencias. .-Planeamos comprar una casa, para comprar la casa que nos gusto ocupbamos casarnos. Nos casamos en una boda exprs por el civil. .-Mi ahora esposa, me dice que estamos embarazados y me cae la noticia feliz y triste a la vez, yo presintiendo que es nio recuerdo lo infeliz que fui de nio y me sumerjo en un mar de ancdotas. .-Busco la comprensin de un adulto que me aconseje, pero con este terminamos teniendo sexo y resulta ser un pedfilo que quiere le presente a mi hijo para ir moldendolo a su gusto y placer... .-Me alejo de este seor, pero me sigue atrayendo su imagen... se parece tanto a mi maestro de matemticas... .-Busco refugio a mis emociones en alguien de mi edad y resulta que tambin terminamos teniendo sexo fuerte pero muy emocional...( con fuerte me refiero a no tan lento a como lo hice con el seor, les recuerdo que me operaron el ano ya 8 meses atrs) .- Tenemos tantos ideales en comn este chavo y yo que termina atrayndome tanto, su voz me hace sonrer, platicar con el me hace suspirar, me siento relajado y tranquilo a su lado, siento que todo es posible y que realmente puedo ser feliz. .- Regreso a casa y mi esposa me espera (aun embarazada, ya 5 meses) y se me acurruca y me dice que se haba preocupado por mi la noche anterior que no llegue a casa por estar con mis amigos, resulta que mi cuada la asusto llegando golpeada a casa y mi esposa crey que yo llegara igual o peor por tratarse de una fiesta... Yo llegue peor, porque en mi mente ahora se nublaba con la idea de que quera el divorcio para estar con ese chavo que me hacia suspirar. .-Pero mi esposa saca un as de la manga y me propone que me puede estimular, porque encontr un pequeo dildo que tenia para rehabilitacin por la ciruga y ella entendi completamente mi situacin. Le propuse que yo tambin le comprara uno del tamao de mi pene o menor para que se sintiera cmoda cuando yo no estuviera y acepto (aun no los compramos). .- La idea de que tengo a una esposa que me ha comprendido en cada etapa, que esta a mi lado, que va a ser la madre de mi hijo, que me ama de una forma tan apasionada me hace entender que yo a ella tambin la amo, porque le correspondo de muchas maneras. Solo que sexualmente estoy inseguro. No haba sentido un sentimiento hacia nadie como el que sent por ese chavo y por mi esposa anteriormente. Y me doy cuenta que es muy probable sea gay o bisexual, por mi historia, pero me siento hetero porque amo a mi esposa y la idea de no separarme de ella me hace feliz. .- Con este chavo que me enamore de una forma fugaz, le indico que si tuviera que dejar a alguien seria a el, ya que aun no estoy seguro con mis sentimientos... y el me entiende, pero regresa al tema de querer tener sexo porque le gusto mucho... ah entiendo que fsicamente soy atractivo, pero que nadie se ha interesado por lo que digo o pienso ni por lo que yo creo que es correcto mas que mi esposa. .-Ahora estoy confundido porque a pesar de haber alejado a este chavo, sigo enamorado de el, pero a la vez enamorado de mi esposa y enormemente enternecido por mi hijo que aun viene en camino. .- No me siento haber sido infiel antes de este chavo, con el realmente me siento culpable porque le correspondi en mente y alma a dos personas cuando siempre, atrs, solo era sexo. .- Entre las platicas que tuve con el, me hizo que me preguntara Qu decisin debo tomar para ser realmente feliz?. .- Decid seguir con mi esposa y mi familia, el rumbo que llevo hasta el momento, pero s que dentro de mi seguir buscando el placer de estar con un hombre y que me trate de una forma entre salvaje y dulce. .- Con mi esposa el sexo es muy rutinario y hasta tedioso, solo una postura, si se pone interesante son dos. El sexo oral no es para nada bueno, y cuando me masturba siento que lo hace de forma brusca pero sin tacto hasta llegar a molestar. Con un hombre, me gusta que me hagan sexo oral, siento un gran placer, cuando soy activo siento que puedo ser tan rudo o suave como a mi me plazca y siento que el otro se revuelca de placer por mi. cuando penetro a mi esposa ella se pone muy caliente y le encanta mucho, pero si quiero ser mas rudo me pide que pare y solo es en una posicin, la del misionero. por lo cual me cansa la monotona y termina por quitarme la calentura. Cuando me penetrar, siento que no hay nada mejor en el mundo (hablado de sexo), que con un movimiento certero que haga el otro puedo alcanzar el clmax, pero igual, en ambos casos, con hombre o con mujer casi siempre termino masturbndome porque duro mucho o porque el otro o ella ya se cansaron. .-Mi placer sexual llega al punto en que quisiera que ella fuese mas abierta a experimentar el placer sexual, a como un hombre me hace sentir. Y con un hombre siento que le falta el sentimiento que a mi me gustara en la relacin. .- Estoy realmente confundido porque siento que si pido que mi esposa me penetre la podra perder, pero si no lo hago siento que igual la podra perder si me encuentra que sigo buscando sexo con un hombre"

Im not the most vocal about my feelings, especially when theyre negative. In recent weeks Ive been trying to open up more and show when Im hurt or mad or frustrated more so that my SO and I can build a stronger relationship and future together. The only problem is, showing this vulnerability is terrifying to me. Is this normal? How have you all gone about letting your guard down with others and being more open emotionally?"
22,vulnerability,AskMen,My guy friend / my crush said that we shouldnt be in touch for a while then he matched me on Tinder. What is this with this guy?!?,1,fbo2ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fbo2ke/my_guy_friend_my_crush_said_that_we_shouldnt_be/,2020-03-01 14:18:40,"Long story short, I (28F) used to hook up with a guy (26M) for a while. When we stopped doing it, we eventually became friends and hang out regularly without sex. After a few months hanging out, I got feelings for him and I told him that. But since hes leaving the city in a month and surely not coming back anytime soon, we decided to keep it as just friends. After one time seeing me out on a date, he seems to be annoyed by that. And a day later when I asked if he want to hang out. He said that we shouldnt be in touch for now, just park our friendship and both move on from that. He said because I want more but hes leaving, there is no future for us, it doesnt make senses if we keep hanging out, meeting up or talking on WhatsApp. Its unfair on me and also hard for him to move on. And he believes its for the best. And he said hell be in touch again before he leaves the city then we can chat more. Until then, if we bump into each other, hed still love to have a chat to catch up. And he insisted that he didnt ignore or and he wasnt annoyed by me at all. Anyhow, I didnt react too nice to the message. I basically told him that Im humiliated because it feels like he want to say that it makes him uncomfortable when showed him my vulnerability and revealed my feeling toward him. I said that I wish Ill never bump into him anywhere and only want to see him before he leaves to get some of my stuff back! I told him dont even feel bad about it cos we are not even too important to each other, its what it is, just another meaningless connection on a dating app that went a bit too far. And I ended with Have a great life and good luck with finding some empathy out there. He read my message and replied very quickly, saying that please dont read too deeply into the messages cos you cant convey someones feeling and attitude through a text, thats why talking in person is so important. He said that i somehow created a false narrative and its on me not him, and insisted that he told me how his feelings when we talked in his room, just remember that and please stop reading too deeply into text messages. Anyhow, I think its what it is. Time to move on for me I guess. Just feeling really upset and hollow after that cos we get along really well. Also Its wasnt anyones fault, we both knew that there is no future for us anyway. And guess what, we just matched on Tinder... whats wrong with this man??? I swiped right because I know he always swipes left on me. TL;DR : Having a crush with my guy friend. He rejected and said we shouldnt be in touch for a while. A few days later, we matched on Tinder."
23,vulnerability,AskMen,How do you feel when your girlfriend shows vulnerability?,1,ep89f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/ep89f4/how_do_you_feel_when_your_girlfriend_shows/,2020-01-16 07:53:27,"This question gets asked a lot from men asking women, but I havent seen a post asking how men feel when a woman shows vulnerability. Ive always been the type of woman to not cry in front of people (besides my brother and sister)... I always felt like people would look at me differently. And I never wanted people to think I was weak. So, Ive been with my bf for almost 5 years and havent shed a tear, except for when my grandpa passed away. But recently we got into a small fight and I kind of just blew up. He said why are you crying over this little thing? And that made me cry even more. Later, he came to me and apologized. I told him that I just need time to feel. I also said that, I feel like I have to be happy all the time and I think I really need therapy because I bottle up my emotions all the time. After we talked, I felt like I showed him a really weak side of me. He was very kind to me and super sweet. Saying things like, if I need anything, to let him know. But part of me thinks that he views me a little differently. Anyways, how do you guys feel about your girlfriend crying and opening up to you emotionally? Thanks for the future responses :)"

Dont talk over women. If you are asked to be on a panel/team and see that its all men, say something. Maybe even refuse the spot! When you see another guy talk over a woman, say: Hey, she was saying something. Learn to read a fucking room. Dont call women crazy in a professional setting. Dont use your feminism as a way to get women to trust you. Show us in your day-to-day life, not in your self-congratulatory social media. Dont touch women you dont know, and honestly, ask yourself why you feel the need to touch women in general. Do you feel that any woman on earth owes you something? She doesnt. Even if youre like, Hm, but what about basic respect? ask yourself if youve shown her the same. Dont send pictures of your penis unless she just asked for them. If a woman says no to a date, dont ask her again. If a woman has not given an enthusiastic yes to sex, back the hell off. If a woman is really drunk, she cannot consent to you and she also cannot consent to your buddy who seems to be trying something. Your buddy is your responsibility, so say something and intervene. If you do the right thing, dont expect praise or payment or a pat on the back or even a thank you from that woman. Congratulations, you were baseline decent. Involve women in your creative projects, then let them have equal part in them. Dont make misogynistic jokes. Dont expect women to be nice or cute and dont get upset when they arent those things. Dont make assumptions about a womans intelligence, capabilities or desires based on how she dresses. Pay women as much as you pay men. If a woman tells you that you fucked up, and you feel like shit, dont put it on that woman to make you feel better. Apologize without qualification and then go away. Dont punish women for witnessing your vulnerability. Dont get defensive when you get called out. Dont need to literally witness a man being horrible in order to believe that hes horrible. Trust and believe women. Dont use your power to get womens attention/company/sex/etc. Be aware of your inherent power in situations and use it to protect women, especially via talking to other men. Stop thinking that because youre also marginalized or a survivor that you cannot inflict pain or oppress women. If womens pain makes you feel pain, dont prize your pain above hers, or make that pain her problem. Dont read a list like this and think that most of these dont apply to you."

At 34, hes had problems dating women who expect a certain level of emotional maturity from him. Ive highlighted his lack of thoughtfulness, compassion, and empathy but he genuinely doesnt think that stuff is important. He says its enough to show he cares through physical acts (doing chores etc), rather then the hard work of putting himself in someone elses shoes and thinking about what they want and how they feel. Ive expressed that he will most likely continue to have shallow relationships and the women he dates will continue to feel unsupported and uncared for and he should probably try to explore this area, maybe with a therapist. Ive talked to him about vulnerability and being honest with himself. Im not sure Im getting through. Im hoping to show him how others have tackled this and potentially have him reconsider the importance of emotional support in a relationship. So what steps did you take to learn these skills? How hard was it, and how long did it take? And ultimately, was it worth it?"

But even when we were together, when in social situations she'd snide remark me in front of her friends, stuff like that and I started getting the feeling that she likes to play my boss.I,m very open and caring type, so I feel, I dont mind showing my weaknesses. It soo happend that I lost my job once and had to go through a lull period, I couldnt find one for over 5-6 months and she and her dad kicked me out of our shared home by purposefully gaslighting and creating trouble , I was paying up until my Salary and reserves lasted.So, then I got highly placed again and moved her and the kid along with me and as long as she was my dependent, things were all fine all cuddly and loving. So, then now since the Kids growing up, I wanted her to work aswell and she took up a job, we are employed in two different places for the time being, until I move along. Missing her, i'd message her to see if her jobs well, shed not respond, so when I ask her why?shes like, i,m too busy at work. I took the cue and dont disturb her.Usually, she messages everyday in the morning before leaving to work, its our routine, so one day she dint message, so I inquired, shes like ""Oh I forgot, got busy with some things"". Now the situation is, that i,m wanting her to keep in touch, but she keeps in touch only if she feels she has nothing to do and if I keep in touch, which she usually doesnt respond promptly and sometimes ignores, I feel it very difficult to keep talking while being humiliated in a subtle manner. As we have a kid, i,m pretty trapped in the unsatisfactory marriage. As if, everything is about ego, and who wins every-time, like I cant be my own self, like I cant show my vulnerability without being judged. I often fear If i,m old and useless, will she take care of me. I guess not. And i,m not in a social situation to actually break the marriage, I love my son.Being a pretty attractive guy who generally does well in life, I feel I have options and need to make Gfs and try to relate emotionally, I cant relate to someone who is always profit or ego driven.Because, If I dont keep pandering to her, i,m left alone and lonely without any response or initiation from her side.I,m soo lonely in this marriage, even if its a pen pal, that would be great. Just wondering if some men have gone through this, knowing very well there is noo love, but only finances and egos involved. PS - I,m not interested in answers from women."
27,vulnerability,AskMen,"I'm after some male advice... Me and my boyfriend split up almost 3 months ago and I'm still devastated and so in love with him, I don't know how to cope.",1,e16ayi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/e16ayi/im_after_some_male_advice_me_and_my_boyfriend/,2019-11-25 09:50:21,"TLDR: Sad and difficult break up, but still with a lot of love between us and the possibility of a future in a few months time, which has drastically deteriorated since. I'm still so in love with him and I can't cope with it. Me \[21F\] and my boyfriend \[27M\] of almost 2 years (we were friends for 3 years beforehand) split up 2.5 months ago. Our relationship wasn't perfect, and we'd had quite a major fight, but decided to work through it in July. It wasn't always easy, but for the most part we were doing great. In late August, we attended the wedding of one of his childhood friends, with a large group of his other friends and their partners. All weekend, everything was so great, all his friends were commenting on how happy we were, how lovely I was, how they've never seen him this happy before and how great I've been for him (and he's been friends with most of them 20 years). During the grooms speech about his new wife he leant over to me, unprompted, and whispered in my ear that that would be us in a couple of years. And honestly I've never felt more in love with him than I did at that moment. We talked on the drive home from the wedding and he tells me that our relationship isn't just back to before the fight, but it's the best it's ever been and he's really happy we worked everything out. I was moving to London a few weeks later for my 2nd year of uni, which we knew about for a long time and wasn't that big a deal, as it's only a couple of hours away on the train, as originally he was going to be moving with me, but decided to do a college course and try and go to uni in London the next year instead, so that he could get a better job (he wants to get into computing which is really hard without a degree). So we had 2 weeks at home together after the wedding, I went to New York with my mum for a week and then I was only home for 5 days before the move. He had been working a lot while I was in New York, doing a lot of double shifts, so was understandably tired when I came back. But baring in my mind I had 5 days to pack up my life to move and say goodbye to all my friends and family in my hometown, I really wanted to try and spend some quality time with him before I went. And so the day I came back from New York, everything was fine, other than both of us being tired, as was the next day, but then on the Wednesday, I had my driving test in the morning (I failed but I was kinda expecting it), he went to work, and we had plans to go to a weekly quiz night we often went to with friends. At the quiz, an argument arose between me and another one of our friends (who was my ex's childhood friend first, but separate from his main group) over the friends birthday, as me and my ex had plans with my family that we weren't really looking forward to, but it was important to my family, and they were over a year old. Me and this friend have often disagreed in the past, but this was the first time anything had actually been publicly discussed. My ex had basically told his friend he was planning to bail on my family for just a regular night out, it wasn't a special birthday or anything, but hadn't told me anything like that at all. So we left early, he tried to make a joke which I obviously didn't respond well to, and we got into a huge argument on the way home. Everything I said or asked him for about 10/15 min was just met with shrugs and 'I don't know' until I was so frustrated I just said for home not to come to the family party, not to visit me in London and not to see me again if he was that unbothered, and he just said ok. We ended up arguing and then calming down and just talking in the car for about 3 hours outside my house, and he said he felt overwhelmed with starting college, changing jobs, and the subsequent lack of money, me moving away and everything else going on, he just felt too under pressure and he still loved me but wasn't sure if he was still in love or not because he didn't care as much as he thought he should about me leaving. It was basically just awful, and I had to move away 2 days later. Just under 2 weeks after the break up, we met up and had a huge talk, that was really open and honest, we were both heartbroken but just kind of aware that we were both feeling that way and we still loved and cared about each other so so much. He kept bringing up how he was still attracted to me, but that he didn't have the space in his head for a relationship at the moment, and how he wouldn't be surprised if in a years time when we've both worked on ourselves, we still end up together, but that we just need some space to grow as people at the moment. When we talked about the wedding he started crying and had to go outside because it was too painful to talk about how in love we were then. He said he couldn't imagine not having me in his life and that he knew he'd never meet anyone that loved and supported him the way I have. He said that he's never met anyone in his life that understands him the way I do too. He was really insistent on being friends, and I told him I was sure I'd be able to do that, but that I was willing to try basically, as we had a couple of events we had tickets to etc. We were both crying, holding each other, and neither of us wanted to leave that moment, because I think we both knew this was the real end. I still didn't understand what or why this had happened, but I felt a lot more peaceful about it afterwards. 2 weeks later, we met for a coffee and he was in an absolutely foul mood, forgot his card so I had to buy him coffee, sat there talking about basically how awful everything was, and then being like I'm fine though!!! I'm over it!!! Which I obviously didn't believe, but then he started essentially having a go at me for not being over it yet, how I'm 'harming myself' by wallowing, and how I'm doing 'exactly what everyone expects' and being predictable by being upset. So I was just like... wtf??? And the whole day just made me feel even worse because I had no idea where it all came from. We had tickets to see Impractical Jokers later on that week, which was why we'd met initially. So we went to that, it was awkward initially, but we shared a bottle of wine and then it was tentative, but ok, as ok can I could've hoped for really. He also apologised for how he'd behaved at the coffee. We also had 3/4 beers each after the wine so we were pretty wasted, so when the show finished an hour earlier than we were expecting it to, I asked if he wanted to get another drink, which is when the whole night like switched. He started having a massive go at me, saying I wasn't his friend and that I was just trying to get him into bed, and that I specifically wore an outfit he liked for that reason (it's a normal outfit I've worn to a lot of gigs before, a little dressed up but still casual, plus he literally turned up in jogging bottoms and I've never seen him wear them outside home/the gym before) that he didn't care about me and he never did, and loads of spiteful stuff like that. I basically just got really upset because I didn't understand where it was all coming from cause the night had gone ok, and I got off the tube with him at his stop because I didn't want to leave things like that between us. So basically we ended up getting on the next train together too, it would take him all the way home and it was just an alternate route I could use. I missed my stop because we were still arguing, and it basically culminated in him telling me he hated me, whilst crying, and leaving me in NW London at 1am, obviously very visibly upset, make up down my face, still drunk, the works, miles away from my flat (SW London) with no idea how I was going to get back. I was so acutely aware of how vulnerable I was and also that he was the only person who knew where I was. He texted me about 20 min later that of course he didn't hate me and he didn't mean it, but didn't actually apologise. Over the next few days, we texted a little about what we were going to do about the next thing we had tickets for as it was only about 8 days away, and he insisted I didn't go, and paid for 2 150 tickets instead of just his one, so that he didn't have to see me. Through that whole conversation, he was really rude and dismissive and refused to listen to me, but made me listen to him. I also apologised multiple times for my part in the train situation, and he is still yet to acknowledge it. We met up about a month later (currently about 2 weeks ago) to close our joint bank account. It was technically fine, but so cold and weird, and he told me he doesn't want to see me for 6-9 months. The problem is, he works (only 1 day a week) at the place I'm going to work over Christmas break, and I don't really have any other job options, and I really really need the money, so not doing it isn't an option, but he's fine with us working together in this state? He said I apparently need more time - which I corrected him to we - to be friends, and that he's getting really anxious everytime we meet up and stuff like that, which is why we shouldn't see each other, but I don't understand how a) that'll be different in a work context (we work in a small, close team), b) how time will change that, because the issues will still be there unresolved, and c) how the fuck we ended up here? I've also had mutual friends talk to me about how concerned they are about him, how he doesn't talk to them at all anymore and they never see him, he's drinking loads and started smoking again etc, and honestly I'm really worried about him. I know he won't talk to his family (could write a whole other essay on that), he's no longer talking to friends at all, and I was the only person he was ever really open with about his feelings, and he struggled a lot with that, because he was never really allowed to express himself growing up, he just supresses everything. I've tried to support him through our whole relationship with that but it wasn't easy on either of us (he always thought I was too emotional in comparison which tbh he's probably right about but I'd rather that than nothing), and I almost feel like because his mental health is in a bad place and he's feeling so overwhelmed, and I'm the one person he was vulnerable with, by breaking up with me, he's tried to remove that vulnerability? Because even the night of the gig, I know him well enough that he was just lashing out to push me away - doesn't make it ok, and doesn't mean it doesn't hurt, but I know him well enough to know what he was doing basically. There's literally so much more I can say but this has already gone on forever, so my point of this post is, how can I deal with this? I'm obviously furious and heartbroken and upset, but I still love him so much that it seems small in comparison. I did want him back through most of this, and it's only in the last week or so that I've realised I actually don't, but it's only this person of the last couple months I feel that way about. The person I've known for 5 years is still in there and I still love that person so deeply, that's the person I talked for hours with about moving in together and getting married and having kids and having a future and an entire life with - and it wasn't one sided. I don't understand how or why this happened and it is killing me. I've missed so much of uni and networking opportunities (I'm studying music so just as essential as class) that I'm seriously considering deferring the rest of this year because I'm just wasting my time and money by being here. I've lost most of our mutual friends, but most of all I've lost my best friend. Because we met at work, we've spent 5 days a week together for pretty much the last 5 years, and I feel as if I've lost half of myself. I know that I can't change how he's behaving or make him realise what he's throwing away, as much as I want to, so I just want to know how I can feel better. Because yeah I'm getting up and eating and showering and sometimes going to uni and stuff like that, but mentally I'm still just shellshocked, I don't understand what changed literally from the morning to the evening on the day of our break up, and what has happened to make it worse since, and I can't deal with it. It's been almost 3 months and I still feel worse everyday and I know I can't get our relationship back, not now, but I'm struggling to deal with the possibility of this being forever, and I'm struggling to live in my head everyday. I'm scaring myself with how I feel because I have a history of depression, I know just how bad I can get and it terrifies me. I just don't want to feel like this anymore and I don't know how to make it stop without getting answers from him. I've talked to friends until I'm blue in the face and exhausted and everyone is sick of hearing about it now, not that they'd say it to me directly. I'm just not moving forward and I've had enough of it, I just want a break. So please, if you have any advice at all, send it my way. If you've read all of this you're a champ."

I started acting a little more aggressive when I encounter a woman that I'm only mildly interested (who I would never go for), was somewhat condescending in our conversations and was not afraid to breach any touch barriers if we're dancing or talking. The worst part is, that its working. I'm getting more #'s, and making out more often (I haven't tried to bring them back home with me, because I dislike having sex with strangers). I haven't really been following up with any of these women, but a few have texted me back out of the blue (which never happens).

I think I might also have depression, although I havent been officially diagnosed. My emotional struggles, especially the social anxiety, are a major source of shame for me. Why? Because from everything I have learned, it seems to me that these kinds of traits are viewed as defects in a man. I am incredibly self-conscious and embarrassed about my anxiety. It makes me feel weak and unmasculine. I feel insecure when dating, because I imagine how turned off the woman will be if I show any kind of vulnerability. I feel like I have to maintain this stoic, masculine frame, in order to preserve my dignity and get respect from others. So when I feel anxious inside, it makes me feel like less of a man. Im envious of women for being able to openly express their emotions without being looked down upon.

I'm definitely needing some advice on this. I am a 26 (F) in a long-distance (IL to IA) with a depressed 29 (M). We dated for 2.5 years, broke up for about 9 months, got back together. It was by far the most difficult breakup I've ever been through. We started dating again about a year ago, but we were non-exclusive because I wasn't sure if any of the problem areas would actually be different the second-time around. He kept pushing for exclusivity, and even though I wasn't quite ready for it, I felt very pressured and we became exclusive in January of this year. I was afraid that if I were to be exclusive with him, he'd stop treating me so nicely and the old problems (from his side, at least) would come back. Almost as soon as we became exclusive, the way he was treating me changed drastically. I needed/wanted to hear a lot of confidence in us from him. I needed/wanted to hear a lot of reassurance and affirmation to kind of re-build the trust &amp; security that had been broken down in the previous relationship. I wanted to give things another shot, but I had doubts/fears. If I present him those exact doubts/fears and he can say ""no these are wrong"" and/or tell me why they're wrong, I become much more confident in the relationship, and I feel like I can then be vulnerable to him again. He did all of these things when we were non-exclusive, but when we became exclusive, suddenly he just nose-dived into his depression (He was depressed while we were non-exclusive, but he didn't let it affect our relationship much at all until we became exclusive). \- My love language is words of affirmation &amp; gifts/acts of service around special occasions (My birthday, Christmas, Valentine's Day, Anniversaries) \- His love language is mostly physical touch and quality time. I meet his needs for physical touch &amp; quality time. But he really doesn't meet mine on words of affirmation or special occasions. On Valentine's day, he apparently thought I was going to break up with him, so he came to visit me in IA, but ...no flowers, no card.. nothing. Really, I just wanted the card more than anything. I made some cupcakes with him, put on a romantic funny movie and we had a good time. I tried to make it special anyway. On my birthday (3 weeks ago), he brought me an orchid. I really do love the orchid and I appreciate it, but my mom was very unhappy with the ""very low level of commitment - that's something a friend gives you"". He did give me a card, and we'd recently talked about how I needed more words of affirmation from him...but there were no words inside. Just a big cat that you push and it meows (to be fair, I do LOVE cats). I told him what my mom said and that the card thing really hurt me, and asked if he would write one for me. He said he would. On our anniversary (3 weeks later), he did nothing...I bought him roses, had a gift for him that I'd bought months before and knew he wanted, and also made him a cute ""girl-friend remote control"" from cardboard, paint, wires and bottle caps. It took me hours to make, and I was so excited to give him all of these things. He loved it. I was going to write him a card too, but I ran out of time. He came to visit me to celebrate yesterday, and ...he didn't even have a card. :'( again. He did let me choose where we went to dinner, and paid for it, though. We had a great day &lt;3 But I could tell he was in his head (he's almost always in his head since he's been depressed - I can see him arguing in his head with himself, or with his old boss. He recently left grad school without his PhD and with just a masters which really killed him and still kind of does. He's super uncertain about what he wants to do career-wise, but he's working part-time for his uncle and making a good amount right now). We got home after dinner, and he just started being super negative about the relationship... told me I'm not being vulnerable to him...that me asking for words of affirmation is me not being vulnerable; that instead, being vulnerable would be to just love him, do sweet things for him, without worrying about what he does for me, and just accepting what he does do. To do this, he thinks, would mean me being vulnerable. After long enough of me being vulnerable first, THEN he feels he can be. But right now, he doesn't feel that he can be. He says he was ready to be 100% in and vulnerable when we started dating again and were dating non-exclusively, but the fact that I was so paranoid and protective of myself, etc. made him 'fall out of that'. To me, the period RIGHT AFTER becoming exclusive is when I really needed to see that his behavior wouldn't change. But by that point h had become fed-up with the fact that I wasn't being vulnerable to him, so he stopped. I cried a lot last night. This morning, he cried a lot, saying that he's not sure if he loves me or an idealized version of me. He was supposed to be here until Tuesday of this week, but he feels really awfully about the relationship right now. He says he doesn't want to break up with me, but he needs space. He packed up his things and left abruptly, crying. I helped him carry his things. It was very difficult for me to get him to just sit with me for 5 minutes. He wouldn't let me cuddle him. I asked ""So you don't love me?"" and he said ""I love you."", so that helps. I'm going to hurt really hard when it hits tonight I think. I need help. He won't get treatment for his depression, he won't go to therapy or take medication, he's had a long history with it. He doesn't like going to the relationship counselor at my school because he doesn't like being analyzed. He hates that we have these intense conversations about the relationship (which is weird, because while for me in previous relationships it was always a net positive experience that drew my SO &amp; me closer, it's a huge net negative experience for him. I mean, these intimate conversations are a huge part of a relationship for me usually) I told him I won't ask him about the card for my birthday or for the anniversary anymore because I know asking makes it worse; I'm just gonna give him the space he needs and try to show him that I love him the best way I know how. But man I need to be focused for school right now (huge exam called STEP 1 coming up for me and tomorrow starts my dedicated 8 weeks). He's leaving IL (where he had grad school) and driving to CA to live with his parents &amp; sister for a while and then he's planning to come back here right after I take STEP1 to try living with me for a few months. I'm so terrified that we won't make it that far. On a practical note, I'm terrified that I'm not going to be able to do my best on STEP 1 if we fall apart right now, and I can't delay it. He says he can't keep going this way, and that I've hurt him. He knows he's hurting me, and he apologized a few times for that as he was leaving. tl;dr: \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wonder - **should I not put so much weight on the words of affirmation or the special occasions? - Am I being spoiled/unrealistic in wanting these things, or would I bet settling if I tried to go without them?** **How can I make him feel more loved/less awful like this? Is he right - am I being not vulnerable? How can I show him vulnerability?** I don't know what to do. Please help. I'm open-minded to how I might be doing things wrong, how I might be being ungrateful, how I might be in the wrong relationship, etc."

Here are some excerpts: *if youre determined, and somehow you do start off the relationship by making the first move, subconsciously you have created a template where youll now be expected to initiate everything throughout the entire relationship.* *Of course, there are women who genuinely dont want a chaser, and would prefer a less aggressive man. For them, making the first move makes sense because it immediately sets up the dynamic of the relationship. If that works for you, congratulations! You can stop reading and enjoy life with your new friend. But most of us are looking for something a little more challenging, a little more equal.* Is it really more equal if the guy has to make the moves? *The fact is, successful malefemale relationships begin naturally with the man falling for and pursuing the woman. The woman feels adored and cherished from day one and the man feels proud of his securing her. This foundation  where both parties are equally thrilled about their entry into the relationship  solves a great many possible relationship issues. How much more secure, for example, will you feel knowing your guy chased you and wouldnt take no for an answer, as opposed to knowing you asked him out, and he didnt have to invest any effort or expose himself to any vulnerability to land you?* The thing is I just asked a guy out yesterday, that I am really into, and we plan to meet this week. I met him on this dating app, and a lot of guys there never make a move after matching anyways, so I just said hi. I am also leaving town in a few days, so I just asked if he wanted to grab some beers some time before Friday. He seemed keen, and proposed this cool themed bar we could go. But would he maybe subconsciously devalue me a bit because I have already showed clear interest? Should I try to play it cooler from now on?

Hes often if not always initiating texting, activities, sex, sleeping over, talking about using his 3 weeks vacation during the time Im still in The continent. We had a talk about me extending my stay in the country came to the conclusion ( which is what I definitely want) that yes we like each other but we are realistic and know once I leave well just have to appreciate for what it was. Context about him: I can tell hes got issues with showing vulnerability which I respect.As do I but I still brought up this talk just so that we could make this decision together and it not be out of the blue l go bye I leave or oh btw i extended s few more weeks ( cause that could scare a guy) And is very reserved and with things other than emotions pretty straight forward Situation: my coworker asked him (when I wasnt there) how he felt that I was staying ( she thought shed get an Im pumped well make the best of it ) but he kind of just pouted and shrugged. ( now I cant recall the entire convo she told me but this is what stood out) she then asked  so wether she leaves tomorrow or in a few weeks you couldnt be arsed -  well shell have to leave either way  . Then she asked so youre not getting to attached or falling in love ( disclaimer I am not in love nor am I falling in love but I am attached as in I enjoy spending time w/ the guy) he said  no Im not getting attached, does that make me (she said bastard but I dont think thats part of his vocabulary)  Now my issue with this isnt the fact that yah he knows it wont go anywhere because I know that its fun for now but I still care for the guy. What hurt me is that he seemed totally unbothered and cold about it. Now I know this is something I was told so I cant trust the words are 100% accurate. Im also not him so how do I not know this wasnt a dfense mechanism to not wanting to talk emotions with this girl. Concern: do I bring this up or let it pass. The convo wouldnt be about us or who well be because thats clear. The convo would be about how I feel a bit hurt and just kind of like Im filling his free time now...

Whenever my buddies or roommates start seeing somebody, it makes me feel like shit. Like somehow them dating is a reflection of my own singleness. I'm self conscious that I'm being singled out (no pun intended) for being single; that people see that as a vulnerability and judge me on it, like I must not be a good person, or attractive, because I'm always single. I need to work on finding validation elsewhere than women but I don't know how... It makes me involuntarily garner all this resentment toward my roommates/friends and their partners for some reason, which in turn makes me feel guilty for feeling resentful. For example, my roommate and I both met a girl for the first time at a party and both started texting her separately over the course of a couple weeks. When I told her I was interested and asked if she wanted to go out for drinks, she said she wasn't looking for anything right now, and that she'd tode my roommate the same thing. I, knowing my tendency to put myself in the so called ""friendzone"" but not making my intentions clear in the beginning, decided to nip it in the bud when she wasn't reciprocating and stopped chatting her up. We're still friendly when we hang out in groups and I don't necessarily have any bitterness toward the way that all went down. *Except* now she's been hanging out with my roommate a BUNCH (I honestly am not sure if it's romantic or platonic) but my mind keeps building it up like this ""she chose him instead of you and lied to you about it"" situation.

I am 100% straight and have 0 problems being friends and talking to women. I recently gained twenty five pounds of muscle after being very skinny. As a result, I have had a lot more success with women yet I have never been in a relationship. The problem is that I want a relationship and have had many opportunities to be with fun, cute women but something deep in me is creating hesitation. It gives me a weird feeling thats hard to explain but it doesnt feel normal feel this way. I have been asking myself questions to try to find out why but it only leaves me asking more questions. &gt; Am I afraid of opening up? I have always been the type of person to clam up and want to be left alone in my mind if I feel angry, depressed, or scared. This has been something I got better at throughout the years. I have never been one to share deep emotions even though I am a person with no shame and share stories that are humiliatingly embarrassing. Also, I dont have any problem telling a girl I like her or even going for a kiss though. Is it a different form of vulnerability I am worried about? &gt; Do I feel deep down that I am not ready for a relationship? I am at very high point in life. Throughout middle school and the first two years of highschool I was extremely depressed and had bad anxiety. I managed to get out of that rut but still had lots to learn about social cues. I worked on it very hard and now I would say I am better than the average person at socializing. I have gained a ton of muscle and am working while attending college. Why wouldnt I be ready for relationship? I feel better than I ever have before. I am ready to enter a relationship yet something in me is pulling back and causing me to ask these questions. Has anyone felt this before? It is stressing me out a bit because it doesnt feel healthy to feel like this. I know it is stupid but I really want help figuring this out. Thank you so much if you read all this. "
56,vulnerability,AskMen,Living an extremely boring life. Cant find fun in anything anymore and rarely get excited.,1,aq22ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/aq22ne/living_an_extremely_boring_life_cant_find_fun_in/,2019-02-13 14:26:27,"A little back story: (22, M, straight) I moved to Chicago about 3 years ago not knowing anyone. I was overweight. I didnt care about my health. Since I didnt know anybody, I figured I would keep myself busy someway so I started going to community college and I started eating healthy and lifting weights/exercising regularly. Ive been an introvert almost my whole life so meeting new people was tough (especially at a community college where everyone just goes to get their work done and leaves.) Nonetheless, I started going out to concerts and events by myself because the boredom and passiveness was absolutely killing me. Ive always been into music (rock, hard rock, metal, heavy metal) and I play guitar and recently I picked up the drums but I feel like those are just hobbies, not real career options. Fast forward to today: Its now been a little over 3 years since I moved here. I have a job (so Im financially-okay for someone my age) Im on my last semester of community college (going for something that my parents insisted on, not something Im interested in ONE bit.) I have a total of 2 friends. Everyone else Ive met is just kind of an acquaintance that acts shady and/or flakey almost all the time. I have no problem attracting and talking to women but they all seem to lose interest once they see the real boring ol me. Literally. Every single one. My sex life is almost non-existent. I live with my (senior) parents in a small apartment due to a complicated situation so I never invite or even have the chance to invite company over. My father and I do not get along very well. (We never have) My last (and only) serious relationship with a girl ended catastrophically about 6 years ago and Ive had **serious commitment issues since then.** I am in the best shape of my life and still continuing to exercise I dont drink alcohol. I do smoke weed occasionally. Ive slowly and progressively cut out bad habits and replaced them with good ones. Yet.. I just cant seem to find motivation to have any real fun. I go on dates with girls from class, but that never goes anywhere. I show vulnerability in hopes someone else will reciprocate but it just never happens. It honestly depresses me knowing I live in such a big city full of possibilities and things to do, yet barely any people to share these experiences with. I feel like at this age people are just reliant on the friends theyve made in high school and arent really looking to expand their social circle, of which I do not belong to a single one. I just dont know what to do. I want to belong.. I want to be (not feel) BE important.. I want to love and be loved.. but I dont know what to do or where to begin. :/ "

Is it because being the stronger sex means youre taking the active role and acting as the pleasure giver instead? Straight sex just seems like its all about the woman to me. No offense. Im a gay man, and I always thought straight sex looked unappealing because 1) Im not attracted to women 2) Theres less dynamism and dexterity involved, as far as roles in the bedroom 3) It seems like its more riddled with taboo areas 4) A man is shamed if he cant bring his partner to orgasm 5) They dont know anything about male erogenous zones as a result and therefore 6) The pleasure a man can experience seems limited from my perspective...just plain penile orgasms. It also made me think about circumcision, and how its normalized for men, even though it has no proven health benefits and blunts some of the sexual pleasure felt when you stroke it. Why do we, as a society, seem to want to downplay, ignore, or outright take away sexual pleasure for men? Its sort of sad and irritating. It creates the line of thought I men that sex is what youre doing to a woman, rather than something youre doing together. I started having sex with men and enjoying it much more because I got more pleasure out of it, less was taboo, and it was far more mutual and reciprocal. Maybe its because we intrinsically link sexual pleasure to vulnerability and submission, in most cases? And its always been tough for men to be seen as vulnerable and submissive?

I am a 30 yo attractive female, love wearing dresses, great job, long dark hair, masters, volunteered overseas and have a life of my own and of course would love to share that with someone. I don't like being clingy, I truly believe a life that's with your spouse and one without is healthy. But being from a different cultural background,( 1st gen american), women aren't as open sexually in the beginning and just in general women are timid initially. This VERY different than western cultures where sexuality and hookups etc are open..(no judgement tho) I am 30 and have only had 2 sexual partners, one was a LTR. TL;DR I come across as confident in appearance with my dress, makeup, body and hair, always smiling but I am so shy in the beginning!

Should I be less of myself and lose the boobs? Anyway: I'm 29/f, but I look maybe 19/20. I'm small, ethnic, cute face, and curvy (big bust and hips, hourglass figure), thick/wavy/shiny hair, wear red lipstick, have an elegant and interesting fashion sense and am well put together-- every day without fail people comment on my style. I am told I am intelligent and talented (I can see how women get shy around me, and the way men look at me when I speak, or when they've read my work)- and I can say personally that I am accomplished in my field. I make six figures and have 2 degrees. I am told I come off as a great conversationalist, charming, enigmatic, interesting, intimidating, and unusual/original-- and that I have a strong personality. All that is fine. But the issue is how men have historically acted with me because of the curvy body/strong personality thing that I am not comprehending. I feel there is something wrong with me. I didn't choose to be ""original"" or ""strong"" nor did I choose my body. In my head I am a little, shy girl-- delicate and romantic. But people treat me like a disposable slut. &amp;#x200B; My whole life, in retrospect, all the men I've met have only wanted to have sex with me (never talk to me before or after, continue a meaningful conversation or emotional connection, date me, think of me as a ""dream girl."" Literally none have ever wanted to date me (except really the bottom of the barrel and objectively unattractive...and that too only a couple of times). I can tell because even really nice, decent ones who were or eventually are literally always in relationships with nice girls-- end up with me at the end of the night and literally ask ""do you want to sleep with me?"" or rationalize what they think of casual sex and insinuate they want it with me-- shamelessly, bluntly. I also am particularly annoyed with this--the ""I am attracted to you."" That literally means I want to sleep with you-- not you are beautiful, interesting, worth anything. That means I want to bang you. And that's what they try. I don't like casual sex, and I don't have it 99% of the time. Which means I can go without ANYTHING, no dating, no tenderness, no sex, for years. I have never had sex more than one or two times a year, and never twice with the same person. Then it turns into years of nothing and I feel like I would love a man to touch me, and then I think maybe this is the one I can date, and then it turns into the usual one night stand. &amp;#x200B; I have had guys tell me I am easily objectified because of my body. I think maybe if I lost more weight my boobs would shrink a little and I would be more ""datable."" Or I think maybe if I toned down my intelligence or ""strong personality"" (which is just confident, not emasculating) -- then I would be seen as more datable. Because it seems even the amazing men prefer simple, pretty girls-- not ""sexy."" I am sick of being told I am ""attractive"" and ""sexy"" but never cute, pretty, delicate. I feel like I am delicate. But all I get is like the crazy sexual side of people, and the most dejecting thing is that they are generally considered nice, decent guys. I don't go for assholes. But I bring out the asshole in them all. &amp;#x200B; Because of all this I am weird during meeting guys and hook ups in the sense that I can seem detached. After we hook up I feel they just used me and don't want to be around me so I seem detached. But I think they are being detached. Afterwards no one calls me. No one says it was nice to meet you. I feel like I'm always the one who does it (in the rare instance I do). I can;t believe someone would want anything more from me than sex because I've never seen it. I know guys will do anything to pursue and talk to women they like. But the attention I get is overtly sexual. I know I have sexual energy, but that is just my general energy. I do not flirt, be suggestive, or anything. I just ask questions, seem interested, have intelligent conversations, and bold in my forthrightness. The other day a guy called me ""very forward"" for saying ""I like you, but we don't live in the same place, so I wish I could date you but it can't happen. And I don't want a one night stand."" But even if I am not forward, others are. They literally say ""Are you attracted to me/I am attracted to you"" and make moves or try. &amp;#x200B; I feel so dejected and used. I have really beautiful friends, and all of them at least have guys who are interested in them or pursue them. But with me, it's just always a really objectifying, sexual, intense and invasive vibe. I don't know what to do. &amp;#x200B; Should I act dumber? Should I lose more weight? Should I smile more and say less? What can I do to fit into this world? What can I do to make my vulnerability and tenderness visible, what can I do to be honored? &amp;#x200B; Thanks... I don't mean to sound like a whiny brat on Reddit where most guys are whining about not getting laid. But if you were consistently treated like a blow up doll who no one ever calls or says a kind thing to, you would understand that I am truly in distress and confused about how to live the rest of my life like this (I mean it won't be the rest of my life, I'll get old and ugly in a few years and then really past my expiration date)-- but I want a relationship that happens by chance, I want to have guy friends that last and not just until they try to get laid and then disappear when I reject them. I want to find someone who finds me, and loves me. But is that only possible for women who are... less of everything I am, and more of everything ... more flower-like? &amp;#x200B; Thanks :( &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

I'm hoping I don't make this too long. But if y'all make it through reading this. Kuddos! Also I pre apologize for the typos. I'm horrible at it, nor do I have grammerly installed on this laptop, nor is this a work email; so I feel more causal typing fast/proofreading. Everything goes over my head and I don't pay attention. ***I'm currently over analyzing something I was hoping I never had to do.*** &amp;#x200B; **So first off the basics.** We met on a dating app. I'm 25 and he is 33. He was hot and had all his shit together; so we hooked up the first time we met. He is very dull and he never went down on me. (Yes that's important also I am respectfully and happily a giver) So the sex was good. Not fantastic fireworks but really good sex. Also side note very cute dog. BONUS. &amp;#x200B; **Backstory.** So I was in a 5 year relationship for a good part of my young adolescent milestone years. Which ended horribly because I was young ignorant and not taking care of my mental health. Then soon after I went into a 6 month whirlwind long distance relationship. It ended so suddenly and painfully because a change of my partners mind. So at the ripe age of 23 I focused on grad school, myself, and things I felt mattered more than having a relationship. &amp;#x200B; His backstory. Late spring this year I believe his ex-broke up with him. He doesn't talk about her much because when he does he gets angry. I know hes still hurt from her. Had cute pet names for her and such. She moved and didn't want to work it out and just left. They were together for two years. In early 2012ish he had a yearlong one and another one after which I believe wasn't as significant. He has very much a type previous exs as well as insta likes (yes I creep, I'm a girl on reddit, I can go hours on end just researching) &amp;#x200B; Yet lets be honest, girls got needs. So I have loved and do take full advantage of a FWB system. One guy; for a decent amount of consistence time having sex and maybe drinking a beer or two. Or watch a movie and get baked. For me FWB are fantastic because: 1. Obviously the Sex 2. You never care or worry if you look okay (your dick is in my face, Im pretty sure, you give two fucks about my cute hat) 3. There is no obligation to cuddle. 4. You don't have to send pointless superfluous texts back and forth. (I literally will text my FWB ""Hook Up?"" or ""Busy?"") 5. There are no obligations to do anything with or without them. Hours/Days/Weeks and I can hear nothing from you and we're cool. Also if you're chill, and I no way really enjoy hanging out, were going to smoke a bit maybe watch a basketball/football game for like 10 minutes and then we do it and call it a day. Say have a good week at work, and see ya next time bud. &amp;#x200B; If Im more of an actual friend with you; Im down to eat or watch a full movie or drink a few beers or chat stoned. Then do it later that night and Ill stay over. Yet if I stay over; I leave no later than **8:30 AM** weekday/weekend. I am out that bitch. I don't like showering with people unless Im head over heels in love and even then Im eh about it. I take cold showers as well and men lean towards searing hot showers too. My clean clothes are at my apartment. The coffee I like is there. There is no need what so ever to be at a guys place past 8:30 for a FWB. I'm not trying to get brunch with you unless Im trying to date you bud. &amp;#x200B; I like him as a FWB because he just does not care. I know that sounds like the absolute worst but for me its the most stress free person to be around. He is a grumpy old man set in his ways. He has the things he likes and the things he doesn't. He rarely smiles. Works too much. Kind spirit. Well I am excessively loud and talk a lot. Mostly due to my anxiety. He doesn't care that I can go on a 15 minute tangent about nothing while he cooks veggie tacos. That I can ask him a million questions when watching TV on the couch. The reason why is because he doesn't care. He'll look me dead in the eye and be like ""okay"" or a small amount of words or sometimes he wont even respond at all and I then can easily go on another long talk. Mind you we do have conversations sometimes. &amp;#x200B; *If you made it this far in the post, you may be able to tell, Im a talker. Its horrible and obnoxious.* Another time we hung out was because we were both reading books at our homes respectively one evening and I texted him. ""Busy"" he says come through. We talk for a while and how he got back into town from work and was just wanting a quiet chill night. I laughed and was like well that was a terrible mistake on your part because you know how loud and talkative I am. He laughed, put on a record, and said ""eh maybe Im masochistic and enjoy it"". Rest of the night was normal. I even recollect just this moment he had mentioned we had gone a month without hooking up and he casually said in conversation that he had only been hooking up with me the last few time because hes too lazy and hes not ""great with getting all those ladies with these bad boy looks"" He has a dry sense of humor its great. Which at the time I didn't think anything of it. Another night I had teased him about him not knowing anything about me, because I was telling him how very little I remembered about him for the reason of preserving boundaries in a FWB dynamic. Well he got all flustered and rattled off things he specifically remembered from the random rattling of tangents I go on. Which was baffling because he had been paying attention and I felt bad because I hadn't made the effort to really know him? &amp;#x200B; This is when it goes into the gray part for me. He's a FWB why did I feel bad about not knowing as much about him as he did me? We don't listen to each other and can talk about anything and be open. Thats why our FWB works. I thought. I dont date for this reason the oh does he does he not. The confusions. These very silly feelings that lets be honest aren't necessary because it makes everyone involved less honest. V dumb. He knows I don't care that he doesn't respond to my random texts that have not value, my memes, and my stupid article links. I talk so much. I talk because being quiet makes my anxiety worse. Talking about nothing important allows me to be distracted. I just like speaking. Yet at the same time I don't want a response. I don't need a response. All of my closest friends know that our message history is me sending them a billion things and them responding every so often on things that actually matter. Like dinner/yoga/shopping every day plans. They don't respond to my doggo meme because they don't need to. I don't need a response. A response is not necessary for everything. You can say something without needing a response. &amp;#x200B; **Well this is where the Dilemma begins:** I had thought we had only been hooking up for a few like maybe 5 weeks and I mentioned this to my friend. We use to work together, months ago and dont see each other that much. I mentioned I was still sleeping with him last month and she was surprised because I had just began to see him when she was leaving the company in late July/early August. That was a shock to me I had been seeing this guy for that long without really noticing. So after that realization from dinner with that friend last month the guy and I hooked up again and the sex was different. More intense. YET. I just presumed I was too in my head about us hanging out so long. &amp;#x200B; ***This is the plot twist. I'm sorry if this is disappointing, stigma and such.*** &amp;#x200B; The other night he said to come over he was just hanging out and even teased about going down on me since I had mentioned it last time. Well I come over and he was shirtless and said he just took molly. So that night we rolled till about 6 AM. I've done drugs every blue moon. If it's available, free, with a very trusted friend. So I was surprised how easily I was down to do it. I do not want to not read into anything that happened that night, I want to say it was just because we were high. Yet the sex was different, we talked so much more. We talked about our FWB and our dynamic of how I can bug him all I want and hes fine with it. We cuddled and watched a movie in bed watched the sunrise and I left that morning 8:00 AM. &amp;#x200B; I just want to know from this very limited amount of information. Do either of us have an inclination towards each more than FWB? &amp;#x200B; I do not want to have this conversation with him. I'm hoping its in my head and Im over thinking it. I like our FWB now. Its simple. Easy. I'm scared of whatever my feelings are because of us taking molly. Knowing that I was safe and that comfortable to do that with him meant a lot. I didn't realize it until the comedown the next day. Being so comfortable with him to do that is whats stressing me out into me thinking I may care for him. Yet that's not what I want. Caring for him means vulnerability. Which neither of us want. Sorry for this long post :l &amp;#x200B;"

Anyway, we talked, he cried, we cuddled, we worked through some of his feelings.

I have friends I could call that would drop what they are doing and come support me. He has good friends too, and no doubt one of them would have come, I just dont think he is comfortable showing that kind of vulnerability to people other than me.

Decided to go on a fall retreat and sat through one of many sermonsone that stuck out to me most was vulnerability. Depression and anxiety along with some childhood trauma caused me to be sad, awkward, insecure, and bitter. It led to me not knowing how to express myself and had little relationships. And the ones I did have were strained. But digging deep inside and shoveling every inch of my problems, being honest to myself about them, and letting it out without being ashamed has lifted a weight off my shoulders.

So i've known this guy for about 3 months now, and man has it been a roller coaster. We met at the library, we were sitting across the same table and I kept sneaking glances at him. I noticed him looking my way too but I wasn't sure if it was a ""why does she keep looking at me, whats wrong with her"" response. Either way, I don't know what possessed me, as I've never done this before, but I asked him out. Or rather, I wrote on a post-it: ""hey sorry this is kinda creepy but I think your cute, let me know if you want to get coffee or something sometime"" and tossed it across the table at him, before I basically ran out of the room. He texted me and asked me for coffee, we agreed to go out the following week, as I was busy until then. He finds a cafe near my class, and meets me there at 4pm. We hit it off, we talk and walk around for 3 hours, before he hugs me goodbye, mentions we should get dinner, and then i'm off to my next class. I was already kinda smitten at that point. He texted me that evening, but in a way where I thought he was passively letting me know that he wasn't interested anymore- which confused me. After deliberation and to the dismay of my girlfriends, I told him that i had a great time and wanted to see him again, but wished him the best if he wasn't interested. Turns out he totally was interested, he's just never been in a relationship before and has always been the more stoic type. He literally has no female friends, doesn't have a sister or a mother. Appears to not have emotions, except for when he laughs. He's just a very dude typa guy (thinks lotion is stupid because your body self-regulates, meanwhile his are bleeding from dryness haha/ thinks real men chop wood and don't wear shorts/ never heard of fabric softener before). We start going on dates and every things amazing. He just finished his masters in financial engineering and i'm about to go to law school so we're at the library 24/7, and he used to always brings me snacks and red bulls without me ever asking. One night, we go out for drinks and really open up to each other He tells me he's enamoured by me. That night, he slept over. We didn't have sex, we weren't perfect angels either, but for the rest of our brief dating period (1.5 months), we never had sex, whilst he continued to sleep over occasionally. PS- I wanted to have sex, but after the first night, he never made a move again, except once where we tried but I want to assume that his 'guy' a little nervous and thus ""stepped down from the task"" (At the risk of sounding conceited, i'm not awful to look at, I'm an athlete and I used to professionally model before I focused on law so i'm relatively decent looking). A month later, this is my fault, I came clean to him about a habit I was struggling to break, especially as I run and row, which was smoking. This launched us into a wayyy too soon 'relationship check in' discussion during which I lost my cool. I told him that I felt like I liked him more than me, and if this wasn't going to work then it'd be because I fucked up. Right before that night, things were so good he was talking about things months from now with me involved. After that night? Things changed for him, he became distant and didn't talk to me for a week. I told him to come get his things, as it was evident he changed his mind about me and I'm not one to cry over someone whose not sold on me. He admitted that he wasn't looking for a relationship right now, and felt like I had all these expectations from him that he was scared to fuck up. While i've never overtly said anything, I'm sure I did something to imply that. We ultimately decided to go back to being friends after I half-truthfully admitted that after the shitty way he treated me for the past week-2 weeks, I wasn't so sure about how I felt for him anymore either. We both agreed that everything went super fast, and we needed more time. However, despite everything, I I still like him, alot. Its been almost two months, and we recently had a talk where we talked about some of mine and his deepest insecurities (he lost his mother to cancer at 8,family never talked about it, dad never remarried, brother is single and never wants to marry, he himself has never been in a relationship nor had real feelings ever and is emotionally immature/damaged to say the least which he actually admitted). Prior to this specific topic but within the same general conversation, he had told me that he didn't see us getting into a relationship in the future as of this moment, when I asked him where he stood at the time, because we have communicative problems which are admittedly super fun because we both overthink, and ruminate, and never bring up concerns to one another for fear of vulnerability, so our thoughts manifest into actions and projections :) .He asked me where I stood and I told him I wasn't sure if I was leaning more to a romantic side or more to a friendship (lol what bullshit). When we're together, talking face to face everything is easy and fun and communication is clear but when we're apart (we see each other once a week) a narrative of its own gets manifested. Sure a relationship right now isn't something I'm set on right now either, but I'll say it again: I fucking like him. We still hang out one on one once a week for a couple hours, and he texts me on the occasion, calls on the even rarer occasion. But he never initiates plans. Agrees happily to do what I suggest, but never bothers to plan on his own anymore. He occasionally compliments me, usually picks up the tab,always teases me, maintains weirdly long eye contact, remembers little details, never checks his phone when he's with me and has met some of my friends, willingly. I know his friends know of me, but I'm not a part of his life. Sometimes it seems like he's only willing to put in the effort to show me he actually cares when i'm on the verge of leaving our friendship. I know hes so busy, and I know he hates texting, but it'd be nice to have some kind of sign that he cares whether i'm in his life or not independent of the once a week hang he sees me for. I don't get it, he went from being 'enamoured' by me, to shutting down, to wanting to be platonic friends. Where did his feelings for me go? I know he likes me as a person and enjoys my company, I know he thinks i'm pretty, so where did his romantic feelings go? I still remember the way he kissed me, there was definitely something there. What did I do? Honestly, I haven't been in a relationship in two years. I'm very independent and career oriented, and left my last relationship because I wasn't ready to fully commit, I figured I just wasn't the relationship or commitment type. But then I met this guy, and everything changed. 3 years with my wonderful ex who was also my best friend, and something always felt off, 3 months with this guy i've just met, but somehow, it feels right, despite all the exhausting drama. Again I honestly have no intention of having him meet my parents anytime soon, I just want to be with him in a capacity where its acceptable to kiss him (not FWB, but also not ""meet my parents"" intentions). I don't know whether to stay or leave because I feel that he doesn't have romantic feelings for me anymore, but he once did. I don't fall for guys easily honestly, so i'm willing to wait on him, he's just different. He makes me want to be and do better. I don't need a guy, but I want him for some inexplicable fuckin reason, but my concern is, what if all this waiting is in vain? Does he really just not like me anymore? Do I stay or do I leave? "

We're very similar and often have hours-long discussions on anything from politics to philosophy to simple, everyday things. We have other friends that we hang out with in groups, but because we live very close to each other we hang out one-on-one too. It is very established that we are *not* into each other. He occasionally flirts playfully, but he's not serious and I shut it down. He's hooked up with a few of my friends and I have with his. Recently, he's started getting very emotionally intimate with me. He shares secret anxieties, fears, etc about his family life, his romantic life, and other vulnerabilities. Some of our conversations resemble therapy sessions, but it also goes both ways. He asks me about myself, too, and we'll talk about my problems thoughtfully if I need it. But because being female, I have a ton of emotional support from my other female friends, but he only has me. He has told me things he hasn't told anyone ever or in many years. The problem is, I'm a sucker for vulnerability and I can feel I'm starting to view him as more than a friend. I don't want this and I know I need to pull away to prevent myself from becoming too emotionally involved in this blooming crush. The problem is, I don't want him to think I'm pulling away because of things he's told me. I want him to know I fully accept him and it's not a reflection of him, but for my own protection. I also don't want him to feel abandoned if he needs to talk to someone, but I also know if that someone is me I'll only fall harder. I've casually recommended he see a therapist a few times, but he doesn't think he needs to see someone and refuses to entertain the thought. How can I create some distance without hurting him?"

It is something that comes with trust and comfort in a relationship (friendship or romantic), and those two things take time to develop. Im fairly guarded until I believe I can trust someone, which doesnt happen often. I didnt know that this type of innocence was a bad quality to have, and would like to better my chances when dating.

89,vulnerability,AskMen,How do you maintain your masculine edge in a relationship?,9,6xqrtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/6xqrtk/how_do_you_maintain_your_masculine_edge_in_a/,2017-09-03 12:50:12,"Possibly a weird question and I hope I articulate myself well. Let me start with my personal relationship experience. While I am a generall masculine guy, I definitely am a man who is reflective and in touch with his feelings. I like this about me. I have noticed a pattern where initially in the early dating stage, I am my masculine self. I lead. I initiate plans. I am firm in saying ""no"" when necessary and not seeking approval. Somewhere along the way from the dating stage to a steady relationship .... my masculine self disappears. I am unsure exactly why this happens. But I know it's a big turn-off for the women I've dated. If I had to guess, it's because I am more invested on the relationship working. So I am more focused on keeping the peace, trying not to rock the boat. Another thing is at this point in a relationship, the woman I'm with usually wants to learn more about my feelings and even my pain/insecurities. Sometimes when I share these things I feel like even though that's what the woman says she wants, that vulnerability, it's a turn-off. I still don't know if it's because of the delivery of these things or the fact I revealed I have them at all. So I currently single but plan to date again soon. What are your suggestions for maintaining a masculine edge while in a relationship? Some solutions I already am thinking of are to make sure that I have a standing weekly or bi weekly get together with other men. This could be joining a men's only sports league (I am into sports and am athletic) or a men's book club or just getting together with friends. Another is to make sure I stay focused on a hobby that doesn't involve my relationship. What are your thoughts men? If it helps, I'm 30. Also have any of you dealt with this?"

Is there anything that I can do to encourage that? Or is it just a matter of time? Or is it not possible at all (there are some people who truly believe that men and women can not truly be platonic friends)? What can I do for my guy friends to show them how deeply I care about them that won't be seen as a romantic advance? I hope I'm asking this question effectively. Upvotes appreciated."

My boyfriend (m/22) of a year is stressed about job searching as he is graduating from comp. engineering in about a month. Most, if not all of his friends studying the same degree as him have job offers lined up, which adds a toll to his selfesteem and confidence. Plus his parents don't support and believe in him at all when it comes to his needs as a student and son. I currently work at my school's career centre and so sort of have experienced with career aspects that peers younger and older than me experience. That being said, I have helped him strategize his next career move, updated his resume, searched for jobs to buying tickets for us to go to a career fair together. However, he cancelled at the last minute due to thinking career fairs are pointless and wasn't emotionally prepared. I understand. I'm also aware he's really down, most likely depressed and losing interest in school, in himself except programming which he genuinely loves to do. And so I have suggested booking an appointment with a counsellor at his university but he doesn't feel comfortable expressing his feelings to anyone except me.. I appreciate his vulnerability emotionally and mentally I really do as he's the reason I'm comfortable communicating when stuff goes wrong. However, it has been difficult emotionally lately as I feel that the opportunities I guide him to he doesn't want to do.I love him and I don't want to abandon him over this struggle that is so temporary but scary. What can I do as a girlfriend (f/21) aside from his wishes of just giving him affection (listen to him vent and give him hugs) whenever he's down? I'm aware there's a fine line between support and nagging, especially during this time but I also don't want to feel useless (I'm a giver who needs to do something not just listen, etc) and be dragged down in this relationship.

I live my life openly, willing to talk about instances where I've failed or areas I want to grow in. I also have a blog where I talk about gaining confidence, singleness, and other topics I find interesting. I'm vulnerable when I write because it serves a purpose for the story I'm telling or the advice I'm giving. When showing vulnerability, its under the circumstances of ""Here's where I was at one point in my life."" Sometimes its even, ""This is where I still struggle, but here's how I'm trying to grow."" It also creates a reliability that's impossible to achieve with a stoic or ultra-confident attitude. Of course, this applies to more than just writing. Vulnerability seems to be the glue that strengthens relationships. Not just romantic ones, but family and close friendships too. I guess I'm asking this question because it seems so impossible to not be vulnerable in life when I feel like we were created to do so. Yes, there are manipulative, horrible people in the world. Both men and women. They will try to take advantage of you. They will use your vulnerabilities against you if they know what they are. They can hurt you. I cannot deny this. But true confidence to me is knowing this and still remaining open because you know they cannot affect you."

One of the [articles]( URL I came across states this: &gt; A woman is a woman no matter what, but manhood can be lost. It goes on to say: &gt; In 2014, clinical psychologist Martin Seager and his team decided to test the cultural understanding of what it means to be a man or woman, by asking a set of carefully designed questions of women and men recruited via selected U.K.- and United States-based websites. What they found suggests that, for all the progress weve made, both genders expectations of what it means to be a man are stuck in the 1950s. The first rule is that you must be a fighter and a winner, Seager explains. The second is you must be a provider and a protector; the third is you must retain mastery and control at all times. If you break any of those rules youre not a man. Needless to say, as well as all this, real men are not supposed to show vulnerability. A man whos needing help is seen as a figure of fun, he says. The conclusions of his study echo, to a remarkable degree, what OConnor and his colleagues wrote in a 2012 Samaritans report on male suicide: Men compare themselves against a masculine gold standard which prizes power, control, and invincibility. When men believe they are not meeting this standard, they feel a sense of shame and defeat. &gt; In the U.K. and other Western societies, it sometimes feels as if we collectively decided, at some point around the mid-1980s, that men are awful. One result of the battle for equal rights and sexual safety for women has been a decades-long focus on men as privileged, violent abusers. Modern iterations of the male, drawn in response to these criticisms, are creatures to mock: the vain metrosexual; the crap husband who cant work the dishwasher. We understand, as a gender, that were no longer permitted the expectation of being in control, of leading, of fighting, of coping with it all in dignified silence, of pursuing our goals with such single-mindedness we have no time for friends or family. These have become aspirations to be ashamed of, and for good reason. But what do we do now? Despite societys advances, how it feels to be a success hasnt much changed. Nor how it feels to fail. How are we to unpick the urges of our own biology; of cultural rules, reinforced by both genders, that go back to the Pleistocene? In countries where genders are increasing treated equally in law, work and society, I wonder how many men still feel they have to meet the 'golden standard'. Do you believe the urge is something that is built-in (social perfectionism) or a behaviour we have learnt or is it a gender role forced upon us as we've grown up, and one that women, men and society in general still try to enforce? If it cause such high suicide rates, then is it acceptable? If not what's the alternative? This stuff (my place in an equal society as a man) generally confuses me, and I'd really just like some other views."

For example; he has a friend who constantly publically hits on him and makes very clear she would like to be involved with him. She recognizes we're together, but disregards me in public (subtly). I'd like to tell him this bothers me because I feel disrespected by her, not that I worry he'll 'give in' to her ways. I think a solution would be for him to be clearer with her that he's involved with someone, but again feel that this would come across clingy if not worded properly. How can I bring up being upset by her actions without seeming needy? If problems involve feelings, am I always going to come across as over-emotional?

So as the title says, I have a hard time connecting these two things sometimes. I'm wondering how common it is, what you have to say about it, and if you've overcome the same: how you approached it? A bit about me, I was to be a pretty overweight guy growing up and because of that I was never really interested in pursuing women but always had crushes. Big crushes. After losing quite a bit of weight and gaining quite a bit of confidence I started dating but this wasn't until I was in my later twenties; I'm thirty now. Once I started dating, I found it easy to engage with women and that vulnerability really allowed me to enjoy the new found freedom of talking to new people...but developed this sort of habit of finding myself in situations where the person I was seeing would be like me and want to pursue something more serious (a lot of times too soon(or maybe it's not and I just thought so)) and on the other hand, women that were less interested would be more desirable. It's like when I'm pursued I develop sexual attraction, when I'm passed up I develop an emotional attachment. It's a situation where I can see the pattern but can't see how to change it. Can you relate? TLDR; I'm never sexually attracted to the people I'm emotionally attracted to and vice versa, what should I do? How is my behavior or thought process causing this?"

We have fun together, are very attracted to each other, and enjoy each others' company. Last night, we laid together on my bed and just talked for a while. He told me a lot of things about his childhood and family and personal struggles he had while growing up. I was glad he felt comfortable enough with me to share these things, and I felt it had brought us closer. Later in the night, we almost had sex (for the first time together). He suddenly just stopped, apologized, and got silent. I asked what was wrong, and he just said that he was no longer in the mood. He said he felt weak, and that he wish he didn't share those things about himself because he was being too emotional and not masculine enough. Of course, I assured him that I didn't see like that and was glad he had told me those things. I said I felt bad that he viewed it that way and was upset about it, and he curtly replied that he was fine and it was nothing. It is worth noting that he is a very traditionally masculine man (muscular, stoic, mature) and has a lot of pressure placed on him from family members and friends to appear strong. I think this has caused him to now place excessive pressure on himself to appear strong to everyone else, including me, and see any sign of vulnerability as weak and small. I am conflicted as to how to proceed from here. I told him that I want him to feel okay with opening up to me, and he got a bit defensive and said that he is not used to that feeling so I can't expect it to happen soon. I want to be able to help him and act as a support for him, someone to show him that it is okay to be weak sometimes and open up, to loosen up a bit and approach life less seriously and intensely as he does. But then I worry that this is too hopeful, that I can't actually change this aspect of him. How can I help him work through these feeling of weakness and allow us to grow closer? Is this even possible, or should I end things with the realization that he is not ready to enter a relationship now? Would that be cruel, to just dump him when I am fully aware that I am the only person he can open up to about these things? How do you men generally deal with the insecurities that come along with being emotional when you're expected to always be stoic? Thanks in advance, guys!

We see each once or twice a week (occasionally she'll sleep over at my place, which is about 40 minutes from her). She's a lovely girl. I find her so sexy, and she is a tender, kind-hearted person who takes her of her siblings, respects her parents, has good friends, and is all-round a great catch. She also loves me, and tells me that, but not much more. She just isn't especially expressive....she's not a very dexterous person conversationally, which leads to more stilted moments than I'd like. By the way, we have a lot of common interests - similar tastes in books and TVs and so on - which is another strength. Anyway, I'll ask her something like ""What about me do you love?"" and she'll reply with ""I love everything about you!"" So sweet, but after hearing that response several times you wonder if she actually does love you. I mean just a little specificity would be nice. She's also a very bright girl, and reads more literature and news than I do - but when I ask her for her opinion on x or y issue, she'll say something very generic and not really elaborate. Anyway, the point of this rambling screed is that I don't feel emotionally connected to her. I don't know how to be. Maybe it's not even possible? God, that would suck so much, because she really does seem to love me - she looks at me with such tender eyes, and loves caressing and holding me. Maybe I need to find some other method of connecting with her? Or maybe I need to approach our conversations in a different way? EDIT: I've learned a tremendous amount from this thread. Firstly, that people express love in different ways, and it takes attention and effort to learn those methods and be responsive to them. I also learned about my insecurity, and how a fear of being hurt and low self-esteem can sabotage a person. Finally, and most importantly, I learned that you can't expect a person to be affectionate and loving when you don't return that love - that it is ridiculous to expect someone to prove their love to you, as you sit in judgement, deciding to reciprocate. Love entails risk, it entails vulnerability, and there's no way around that. I like this girl. I want her in my life. And reading your responses - some supportive, some chastening, some both - has made me realize that I'm ready and willing to put my guard down. "

I'm so grateful for them, and I'm living under their roof during my college years; so I'd almost feel bad asking for anything else. What I'm worried about most is being unproductive. If I had the choice, I'd start classes tomorrow. Instead, I have a void of time (2 months) before anything really starts. I don't know what to do in the meantime, and I'm getting really worried that I might end up wasting all of this time I have; when I could probably make this summer out to be one of my most productive ones yet.. Not exactly pertaining to just men, but what do I do in the meantime to get a good start on my adult life? "

Another 28 million are currently uninsured. Due to the repeal of the individual mandate (the requirement under the Affordable Care Act to purchase insurance or face a financial penalty), the uninsured population is projected to increase to 32 million by 2019. Caring for these medically vulnerable populations is a challenge due to significant limitations on access to care as the cost of health care continues to rise. In addition to cost, the number of physicians available to provide care to these populations is limited and may become even more so. More than 36 percent of U.S. physicians are over the age of 55, and a similar proportion of U.S. physicians do not accept Medicaid or uninsured patients, making access to quality health care even more limited.
