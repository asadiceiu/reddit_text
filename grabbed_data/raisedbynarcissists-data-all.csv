Raised by a Narc/Borderline Mother -- in short my entire life was manipulated around her getting he needs met.... it went as far as drugging me to keep me at home \*life long side effects from this\* Broke away eventually --- Went no contact with both parents and the entire family as I had a very aggressive smear campaign launched against me and I had no gas left in the tank to deal with it Years later, I am extremely stable.. living my dream of being away from all the abuse, I understand most of it and am working through the rest. I have an excellent career, have reached multiple goals but I'm alone in all of this. No one from my family cares, and I just see all the fakeness/manipulation thats taken place. **Im realizing im craving authentic love, vulnerability and all the things that come with having strong ties**. I feel so alone I could just cry. I ended up moving across the country for work and thankfully am away from everyone but Im in my early 30s and its very difficult to meet new people, let alone people you develop those types of bonds with. tldr: hoping theres other humans out there that i can relate to and I know im not just alone in everything ive dealt with."

I never really thought much about this until recently, but Ive always had a bad track record with close friends and partners. I was in a 5.5 year relationship with a verbally and emotionally abusive narcissist and the only reason I stayed was because he convinced me that he was the best that I could do and no one else would ever want me. Even now, Im very wary of letting anyone into my life because it feels like they can sense my vulnerability and I dont know how to stop the cycle."
4,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Triggered from lacking external validation but unable to validate myself,1,i86upp,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/i86upp/triggered_from_lacking_external_validation_but/,2020-08-12 14:00:38,"My entire life I've felt like no one was there for me because of my two narc parents and their inability to be there for me/ literally yelling at me, ""I can't fucking deal with your problems,"" or just straight up ignoring my obvious panic attacks or self harm. Consequently, I deeply value validation from others; just simply hearing: ""I see why you'd feel overwhelmed,"" immediately calms me down. It feels like it fills this hole inside me that has been eating away at me my entire life: I feel heard and loved. However, when I show vulnerability to people in my adult life now and they're not validating, it's really, really triggering. I've worked in therapy for about 8 years, and I no longer escalate the situation, but it's still deeply painful. If I tell myself, ""Hey, it's totally understandable that you'd be upset,"" it doesn't help. Even if I feel warranted in my feelings, I still crave the external validation/ coregulation. Has anyone else overcome this?"
5,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My parents believe crying and mourning a loss in front of someone is manipulation. Basically that any sign of vulnerability is an attention-seeking ploy. My mom mocked a woman mourning her dad,1,iaqlmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/iaqlmg/my_parents_believe_crying_and_mourning_a_loss_in/,2020-08-16 21:12:02,"It's starting to sink in. My parents are major assholes. I don't know if they are narcissists but there's a lot they have in common with narcissists. Their pain is real, but no one else's pain is real. According to them. They act like they are better than everyone they know. One of mom's friends lost her father recently. While her friend was in mourning, my mom was busy laughing at her and berating her behind her back to all her other friends, calling her a drama queen and a baby for crying during her dad's eulogy that was posted publicly on facebook. ""She wants attention. She's always been that way. Don't give her attention. She's milking it."" is what mom told me. That disgusted me. There are other instances where my parents were terrible people, but this is one example that sticks out and is most recent. I'm beginning to hate most of my family. Only a couple are decent people. It's a damn shame people can't do the bare minimum and not judge people who are hurting and in mourning. Fuck them."
6,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Was it abuse...? Adopted by narcs.,1,ih1ygb,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ih1ygb/was_it_abuse_adopted_by_narcs/,2020-08-27 02:22:05,"Hi all, Thanks to everyone who has been posting in this group. Earlier this summer, my therapist identified my parents as narcissists and it kind of melted my brain. Your honesty and vulnerability have truly helped me cope. I just created this account so I can make my first ever Reddit post (!) because I'd love your thoughts/feedback on my situation. It's been building up in my head for months so I apologize that it's going to be long! **TL;DR:** My parents are narcs and I know their behavior is not acceptable...but I'm struggling to understand whether it qualifies as abuse, or how much that distinction matters. For some reason this feels important to clarify before I can move forward. **So, the rundown on my situation:** My dad is the main offenderhe's childish and fragile, quick to blow up and constantly in need of reassurance/praise/gratitude. He constantly one-ups me or makes absurd remarks to bait political conversations. My mom props him up and enables his behavior; I honestly think she's so starved for companionship that her loneliness makes her a bit of a narc as well. Whenever we talk on the phone, my parents talk about themselves nonstop for 30-40 minutes and breeze past any information we share about ourselves. My husband and I have had a tough time during the pandemic, yet my parents only offer contrarian remarks or platitudes with no substance. For example, if I say I've had a lot of work to do, they remind me that rest is important. Like yes...but I have deadlines and we need $, so it's not helpful to correct me. Now, my therapist and I are digging into my childhood and how it shaped my worldview. My therapist observes that my parents' affection has always been conditional, and that I had to perform a very narrow spectrum of behaviors (happiness, contentment, gratitude, obedience) to earn their love and approval. My husband thinks my parents were downright abusive. Adding to the complexity, I was adopted. My birth mom and I reconnected a few years ago, and she is absolutely wonderfulwe click in ways that I've never experienced with my adoptive familyyet I hesitate to be fully open about what I experienced growing up. My adoption was necessary for my safety, my upbringing was stable, I'm unbelievably privileged to not have student debt. But I'm not sure how to admit that my emotional needs just weren't met. Growing up, I learned to suppress my own needs and constantly act as the peacemaker. An example from elementary school: One time, my dad and I got in a screaming fight while my mom was outside talking to a neighbor. When my mom came in, she was furiousat both of us, equally. I was scolded for embarrassing her; she never asked if I was okay. For most of my life, I've had what I now realize are obvious symptoms of anxietyhair pulling, constant stomachaches and nausea, irrational, intrusive fears that ruled my life, disordered eatingthat went unnoticed or ignored. As I got older and started having sleepovers, my parents would complain that I was tired and ""unpleasant to be around"" the next day. I was tested for anemia every time I had a checkup because they were convinced my tiredness was abnormal (in hindsight, I was a busy teenager who dealt with insomnia, likely the result of my anxiety). I never pushed back or made waves because I thought I was banking goodwill I could rely on laterbut it only got worse when I gained some independence in college. My parents set a midnight curfew for me well into my early 20s, constantly barged into my room while I was working, got frustrated when I would spend time with friends instead of them (and then ignored me or gave me the silent treatment when I was home). I'd offer to plan to do something as a family, and they would be offended that we ""had to be so formal about it."" After my freshman year, they never helped me movewhich was fine, because when they ""helped"" they often broke my possessions out of carelessness. I lived with them while job hunting after graduation, and it was unbearable. My dad would come home every night and say inflammatory political things (""I bet you're happy when police officers die"" was a memorable one. I fully support defunding cops and BLM, but it's cruel to accuse anyone of enjoying death. Another time, he yelled at me in a public restaurant about his support for CIA torture; I hid in the bathroom out of pure humiliation). If I calmly expressed my opinion, he'd blow up because he was ""passionate"" about politics. Once he told me that respecting my parents meant agreeing with all of their views. Their classic line was, ""For a supposedly open-minded liberal, you're certainly not open to OUR views!"" Which, yeah I'm not going to tolerate being told All Lives Matter, sorry. The subtext I've always feared is a current of buyer's remorse, now that I'm not turning out to be the child they envisioned for themselves. Worst of all is the landmine that is my adoption. When it's come up in the past, they've become emotional and volatile to the point where it's too damaging to attempt any conversation. Because I said as a young, pre-elementary school child that I didn't want to talk about it, they always refer back to those early statements and act hurt that I've ""changed my mind."" At one point when I asked them for information, and my dad ended up screaming that I was the product of statutory rape. I asked if he knew how old my birth dad washe didn't lol. He once told me that my birth dad's excuse for not claiming paternity rights was that he already had a dog to take care of. (My birth dad says that never happened, but he's not exactly a reliable source so I don't know who to believe.) At one point in college, I asked to see a therapist to help me cope and they were deeply offended that I didn't want to confide in them. I distrust their ability to be sensitive so intensely that they still do not know that I met my birth dad or regularly talk to my birth mom. They ""forget my adoption happened,"" which must be nice because I think about it every day and always have. My birth mom was willing to meet my mom before the adoption went through, and sat in a lawyer's office for hours, but my mom never showedwhen my mom has told this story, she's been vague and said ""it just wouldn't have been good to meet, and it just didn't happen."" And then came my weddingthe one day I thought they could put aside their weirdness and celebrate something happy with me. When we told my now in-laws that we planned to elope and have a bigger celebration later on, they were thrilled for us. When I called my parents, expecting a similar reaction, they blew up and started tearing everything I said apart. They accused me of not having good reasons for getting married (I was in love and needed health insurance, so it was both romantic and practical lol), that I was having a ""sham marriage,"" and tried to bargain with me over the date and timing (which again were based on what worked for us financially due to the health insurance piece of it; also my husband has a chronic illness and we didn't want to waste time not being married!). When I confronted them about how badly they reacted to the news and asked why they were so inexplicably angry with me, my dad offered a groveling, over the top apology and my mom said I should apologize to THEM because my email made them feel bad. (I said no, that's not how apologies work!!!) They couldn't explain why they felt so strongly; the best they could offer was that they're ""traditional."" They waged this campaign for months, insulting us and undermining us at every turn. Every time we spoke to them, their reasons and excuses changed, ranging from my husband's brother not being able to make it (which we were truly fine with, and didn't expect due to the timing), to me having to do my taxes and being ""distracted"" by elopement, to it being inconvenient due to their planned vacation. They fought me up until the day they booked plane tickets, complaining that the date made the tickets $400 more expensive and that I should ""just consider that."" We got married and honestly the best part of the day was collapsing on the sofa in absolute exhaustion afterwards and playing Death Stranding. After five months, they begrudgingly announced our marriage to my extended family. Thankfully they showed me the email first, which was so incredibly sterile that I fully rewrote it. As my therapist said, ""a death announcement would have been more detailed and juicy."" The best part of all is that we planned our bigger wedding celebration with family and friends for 2021 to avoid conflicting with my cousin's date...and when the pandemic hit, my aunt rescheduled my cousin's wedding to TWO WEEKS before our date. I found this out by text, and my parents did zero to stand up for us or even let us know it was going on until it was too late to change it. Truth be told, we were planning to cancel anywaybut my parents, aunt, and cousin didn't know that, and if we had just had a direct conversation, it would have been a non-issue. Now I know that they and my parents view my wedding as so insignificant that they're willing to stomp right over it. The entire wedding experience really soured our relationship, and now I don't know how to move forward. I don't feel like it will be productive to discuss things with them. Every time we talk, they ask to do a video call or talk weekly, and I don't really want to do itthe pandemic has been hard on us and these conversations leave me stressed and drained. Yet I don't know if it's unfair to them to keep these feelings and realizations to myself. If they knew, would they try to change? (No, they probably wouldn't.) And were they abusive? Are they abusive? This question gives me pause. Is it possible that my parents did the best they were capable of, and that I'm holding them to too high a standard? Everything I've written truly did happen, and moreclearly there is a pattern here. And is my ingrained habit of doubting my husband and therapist's perspectives (""influence"") itself a symptom of abuse? I'm sure many can relate to this circular internal debate. If you've read this far, thank you. Even just typing it all out has been cathartic, and I'm really grateful for this community."

I cant trust them with my vulnerability. At the same time, Ive noticed that Ive only ever had a few friends in my life and theyre all pretty shitty. This means that I havent been opening up to my family or friends; I feel like I have no back to lean on. These past few months, Ive just been crying nearly every day. I dont have people to go out with and when Im home, I find it difficult to enjoy a new hobby because nothing makes me feel good. So how do you do it?

The majority show narcissistic behavior. I feel like manipulation, being over dramatic, wandering eyes, confusion/ immaturity, miscommunication, fear to show vulnerability and love, honesty, obsessing over someone you believe is perfect and idealizing them, pettiness, not owning up to their actions, not apologizing, apologizing in ways to avoid blame such as Im sorry if you feel that way, trying to make someone jealous, handling rejection poorly, cheating, not handling criticism, not showing remorse for their actions, using girls for hook ups or to make other girls jealous, poor communication, lying, denying things they said, playing with girls emotions, acting nicer with girls and different with friends. All of these traits are awful. But Ive seen almost every guy my age portray at least 2-3 I feel like I could diagnose every frat boy Ive ever met with covert or grandiose narcissism. These traits arent going to make some one a vindictive abuser who will tear someone apart subtly. I have this fear and get freaked out by guys doing things wrong that are normal my age. Im scared Im not going to recognize the subtle abuse and it will build up &amp; by that point Ill be ruined since Ive already had an extremely manipulative emotionally abusive mom"
9,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I need a hug :(,1,iiw8dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/iiw8dh/i_need_a_hug/,2020-08-30 03:18:39,"I feel so exhausted right now. For a while, i have had the suspicion one of my siblings is a narcissist but i was not quite certain. A few days ago i opened up to her and started to cry. I was always feeling a lot of emotional pain because i have got nowhere to go and no one who would offer genuine understanding for me. I have selective mutism and i just felt i would explode if i didn't talk to someone about some stuff that was bothering me. I don't have a support system and i am only surrounded by abusers. I opened up to her about having being sexually assaulted four times, the abuse i experienced at the hands of those two people, i opened up like i never had before. I showed a lot of vulnerability in front of her. However, the moment i started to cry, she didn't do a thing. She didn't move, didn't emote. She didn't come over to comfort me and looked disappointed when i mentioned what had made me cry. She usually does not mirror my emotions. She does not mirror when i laugh and when she does it feels weird. She is very passive-aggressive towards me even when i am smiling or talking softly. I told her about how i was bullied for 10 years at school, about my pain, my suicide attempts and.... you guys... i felt so scared when i didn't see a modicum or genuine feelings in her face. She actually keep her eyes wide open, she didn't blink and it was then that she started to cry but her face didn't.... change shape like when normal people cry. She didn't look sad, she looked like she was putting on an act. She then said she was trying to put herself in my shoes and that she felt compassion for me and yet, days afterwards, she was back to being passive-aggressive, rolling her eyes at me, making demeaning comments about things that are precious to me. &amp;#x200B; She also acted very weird when i told her i was never going to attempt suicide ever again. That i would not try to kill myself. Her response was so empty. You know how someone else, someone who cares about you would be like ""OMG, REALLY?!!! That is so amazing!!! omg!"". They would be so happy for you, right? But something as serious as suicide and she just sat there, staring at me without any facial expressions. She is religious and she keeps mentioning how no one can be truly happy without god in their lives. She also said things like ""i know how true healing feels like"" when i started to explain how i felt so much better with a calm smile. She was implying i didn't know what healing felt like, that i was ill and that i was hopeless. I kept telling her i wanted her to be honest with me and i know she was lying when she kept saying that she was ""okay"". A couple weeks back she forcefully entered my bedroom and i politely told her to not do that again as she started to furiously clean everything around. I regressed when she did that because that happened to me a lot in the past and i felt the knot at the back of my throat and started to feel like i did when i was 5 and the people i live with invaded my privacy. I told her how that made me feel like crying and she started to use something i had told her before against me, saying: ""perhaps it is your own feeling of self-rejection.."" ""it was so dirty, i needed to clean"" &amp;#x200B; She also alluded that when a kid is hit by their parents, the kid needs to be left alone to ""self-reflect"", that it is a ""process"" the kid must go through, and that the kid must not be touched as they cry. WTF?! A kid needs to be comforted when they cry, not alone. Doing the opposite qualifies as abuse! She said that in such a matter-of-fact way. Even after all i said she kept patronizing me. She will do this thing where she asks me a question and when i start to give my opinion she stares at me, her head tilted to one side and blinking at me but with this very slow type of blink and a creepy smirk on her face. She also said i was ""being dramatic"" when i fell to the floor after i was hit while having a panic attack. &amp;#x200B; I told her, several times, i wanted peace and that is all i have ever wanted, that we could co-exist as long as we respected each other. She tried to splash me with detergent in the past, made fun of my veganism, triggered me when she passive-aggressively showed me pics of how i looked like when i was severely depressed all while talking with a very calm voice, she rolls her eyes at me, purses her lips, has started smear campaigns against me, has acted like i am a witch, a demon, like my coping mechanisms are ""bad"", ""wrong"", everything i do she dislikes. She feels such a level of aversion towards me that i have never been able to understand. She never says ""sorry"" but i say sorry a lot. She is aggressive and ignores when others are in pain, and has done it a lot before. I threw up once and she didn't even ask me how i was feeling but showed even more contempt. When i was having severe OCD symptoms and asked her whether i could sleep with her or not she told me in a cold voice ""i can't sleep with you here"" and closed the door. No follow-up questions, nothing. She analyses the things i do to the point i became paranoid. In her eyes, all i do is the devil's work because she believes in body possession. &amp;#x200B; She always used my illness as a way to say ""ooh look she is crazy i am the sane one"". She makes fun of me all the time and it is like nothing i say registers in her brain. She says she is compassionate while bullying me. The fact she had to force herself to cry scares the fuck out of me. What the fuck? I tried to compliment her, even offered advice and encouragement and she looked at me like ""uh-huh"". She uses silence a lot plus the lack of facial expressions.... it is maddening at times! &amp;#x200B; At one point i started to feel i was adopted because i can't honestly fathom how someone can be so cruel and still act like they are emotionally stable. I don't have anyone who could offer me any comfort because everyone around me enables abuse and are abusers themselves. It is so scary :( &amp;#x200B; Thank you for reading, you guys. Much love and strength to you all."
10,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Narcissistic mother and the mind-trapped young adult,1,ij2d69,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ij2d69/narcissistic_mother_and_the_mindtrapped_young/,2020-08-30 09:16:58,"Typically, I call my family home where my elderly mother still lives to speak to my substance-addicted brother, and his son, my nephew, who my elderly mother has raised. My brother and his son have both told me they are depressed, and, in fact, as one of four siblings, from my own experience and what I am told EVERY one of our mother's four siblings suffered from depression, and at least two have had chronic depression since late adolescence up until today. &amp;#x200B; The situation hit-home for me a few days ago when I called to speak to my nephew with a view of helping him move to live with me and my family. Our old family home is very dillapidated and literally falling to pieces, eg. only a few electrical sockets in the house work, there are holes in the walls and ceiling, the carpets are rotted and wornthrough exposing the sharp securing pins pointing up around the border of carpet and wall which people sometimes tread and stab themselves on, the bathroom is not operational - there is a shower in the laundry but its drain has been disconnected for decades so it's necessary to wash in a bucket. On a plus, this house is in a desirable area. The physical state of the house is bad, but what makes it worse - and I only get hints of this as the only time I visit is on Christmas day some Christmases - is that - I believe - our mother's household has the worst reputation of any family within the neighbourhood of approximately 10,000 people. I get a sense of the contempt from neighbours on those few occasions over the last decade I have visited, but as I have been out of the system for a long time, am with my own family, and am an assertive person, I see the tip of the iceberg of social contempt but neighbours hold back with me, and even are occasionally positively curious about how I am going after all these years. But for my 20 year old nephew, who has depression, and extremely low assertiveness, I expect it would be difficult. &amp;#x200B; My apartment, while smaller than the old family home, is relatively modern and well appointed. It is also in a desirable location, close to my nephew's school friends. So I rang my nephew and suggested he move in with me. I thought, ""he's depressed, he's living in a terribly rundown house he can bring neither friend nor girlfriend to, he will jump at the chance for a room of his own in my house!"". And then, I called him, and after that I realised how much less insightful I am than I thought I was. He did not jump at the chance, he hummed and hawed and said basically, you know, maybe in the far distant future when things that are unlikely to happen do happen I will think about it. &amp;#x200B; Then it struck me, 'my mother has got him, from the inside'. Not from the outside. And then I was struck a second time, 'the person I was at 20 is more like he is now than anyone I have known in my life so far'. There is nothing surprising about him not wanting to leave an environment in which he is so unhappy and which is so sabotaging to his progress as an adult. Our mother, I must give her credit, is both intellectually brilliant and has an unbreakable will. Sure, her moods move from 'normal conversation' to 'rage and the desire to emotionally hurt the other' several times a day. Her depression is obvious to anyone around her, of course not to her. Sure, she often spends 14 hours plus a day in bed. Okay, so her mood is out of control. But her will to power is not out of control. I have nothing like her level of willpower. I expect if I did I would use it in ways that didn't smash up the psyches of those closest to me, but it is a moot point because I just do not have that level of willpower. &amp;#x200B; I still have not worked out, in my mind, my father's part in all this. I know by the time I was an adolescent I did not trust him, and there were reasons for this - but I do not know whether, had he been absent, and we had been in a single mother family set up, it would have been even worse. One day, I will have an answer to that. &amp;#x200B; As children, our mother constantly reminded us of our own superiority, that with our 'gifted' IQs we were not like normal people. We were told to tell people of our greatness and our opinions at every opportunity, because such outspokenness was the character of a courageous and superior mind. We should, in essence, give everyone 'a piece of our mind' as much as possible. Of course, as a child, as an adolescent, and even as a young adult I believed my mother to be both sincere and correct - her put downs of others were correct assessments. The few extended family of my father we did have, given he was an immigrant, were, as my mother said, 'fakers', 'ridiculous', losers putting on a show who only wanted to bring our superior family down, and dutifully at 13 I deeply insulted my aunt - a successful happily married woman I hardley knew - when she called our house. She never called again. &amp;#x200B; I think my mother did and does have superior intellect. She also has extraordinary willpower. I do believe, now, that that is what made things so much worse. She got you dependent and you stayed, as your mind slid further down the sinkhole. I left at 25, and really only because I was pushed out. I was about to leave at 20, the same age my nephew is now, but I got persuaded into not doing so. &amp;#x200B; I never really understood what had happened until I was in my 30s. This is partly a testament to my naivety, immaturity, and fantasy-making, but again I do believe a lot of this stems from how brilliant mother was. She was, I suppose, an 'excellent' life coach. &amp;#x200B; My own thinking about this topic has been to wonder what is at the root of minds like hers. Those whose dreams of supermen children ruling the lesser fools, speaking their wisdom to wisen up an ignorent world end with unemployed, drug addicted adults without the capacity to take care of themselves enough to live a normal life. Whose dreams of the perfect superior family, admired by society near and far, leads to a household so subject to shame and contempt that to leave the front door of it is to know one is moving into a local community that despises you as a member of 'that' family. &amp;#x200B; There are two things I see. The instigators of these freakshows, such as my mother, MUST have been terribly, terribly invalidated by several people in their childhood and/or young adulthood. Not just a bit, not just one person, a long series of blows, and I am certain that many of these blows were completely unjustified and unprovoked. Sure, the latter-stage narcissist tends to deserve all the scorn and animosity heaped upon him or her, but I do believe in the embryonic stages they were just a very vulnerable person. And many times, that was all that was needed for them to experience abuse, vulnerability. So vulnerability is the first step. But I also believe this kind of person takes a second, much more fatal step. They started to respond to rejection and abuse by externalising their negative emotions onto others. Not all depressed, or even most depressed, people do this - oftentimes, they are simply quiet and withdrawn. Sure, their apathy is a drag on others. But the narcissist doesn't do that, he or she starts to lash out. Instead of responding to the abuse of an abusive person by being loving and kind to a non abusive person, they respond by being abusive to a non abusive person. And then you get a closed circle, I can't trust anybody, and nobody can trust me. &amp;#x200B; I would like to get my nephew out of the house and into safe living arrangements. Maybe I can try another angle, such as him having a 'holiday' with me, for say a week - even though we live in the same city. Maybe allow him to come and go as he pleases, and maybe over time he will simply vote with his feet. I'd also, one day, like to get a granny flat for my brother to stay in. Our mother will sooner or later have to go into aged care - there is no way in God's name I will have her living with me, but I would be willing to try and get a high quality aged care provider for her, and keep an eye on her, perhaps forgnightly short visits, to make sure the staff aren't being terrible to her. &amp;#x200B; This is my reality. It's the only one I will ever have, and I just want to enjoy all that life has to offer to be honest."
11,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Broke NC to inform Nparents of a family member who was hospitalized with Covid-19 and they haven't changed a bit.,3,hkxrc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/hkxrc1/broke_nc_to_inform_nparents_of_a_family_member/,2020-07-04 14:59:55,"So this morning I broke a 6 month NC with my Nparents to let them know that my mom in law (who has become a second mom to me recently) has been hospitalized with Covid-19 and immediately my Nmother responds asking if she is on a ventilator and my Ndad tells me that I need to be ""strong"" for my husband because he is likely very upset...  First of all, no she is not on a ventilator and second of all, no duh I need to be strong but your definition of being strong and mine are not the same! Your definition of being strong is hiding your feelings until you explode and mine is letting my husband know that I am very much upset and concerned about my mom in law as well but offering him lots of hugs and serving him in whatever way he needs me to! This may not make sense as to why it upset me so badly without context but basically my Nfather is not just Narcissistic but also by his own admission sociopathic, as in, he has no empathy for anyone or anything. So, when I was 21 and having a nervous breakdown/massive PTSD period of my life from witnessing a friend die from drowning, he was completely oblivious to how I was feeling. One day that summer we were in his truck coming home from somewhere and he made some kind of joke about something being killed or dying or something like that and I absolutely lost it and was crying so hard that I couldn't breathe, he pulled over the truck and started to lecture me about how when he was 18 he held his grandmother right after she had found his aunt dead in bed and that I just needed to be stronger and not be so weak and on and on until he was basically like, ""Can you please stop crying? There's someone at the house and I don't want them to see you crying like this because they will think that I made you cry like this."" So, yeah, not exactly a welcome sentiment from my Nfather right now... That and the last year and a half have been absolute hell for me and my husband because we went from not knowing why we were not getting pregnant to me having a total hysterectomy in a matter 9 months last year so I do know a thing or two about strength in the midst of hard times but again, my definition is not the same as his. Strength is having the vulnerability to cry with your husband about the lack of a child. Strength is holding your husband while he cries. Strength is allowing yourself to admit your pain. Strength is not a lack of emotions but rather the courage to feel them and process them and then use them to spur you on. No, father of mine, I will not be strong for my husband using your definition. I will instead be the true definition of strength for my husband. I will pray for my mom in law, I will do whatever I can to help my dad in law, I will pray for my husband, and I will use my emotions to be strong for him by empathizing with him, not encouraging him to shut down his feelings. Sorry, I know that this was long but I needed to post it. Thanks for reading this far! Have a great day and Happy 4th of July! Watch Hamilton! Lol!"

I've had to pee for like 3 hours, and now I have arrived in this waiting room where I can see the bathroom. And this is a *coffee pee* I'm holding, not an ordinary pee. But I can't take the chance of vulnerability to use the bathroom. The physiological reaction is such that my bladder has relaxed to accommodate the extra wait. Even if I went in, I wouldn't be able to go. I also am sitting in a chair that lets me see the entire room. This is what I always, *always* do. If I am at all ""threatened,"" I won't go to the bathroom, won't eat, won't drink. Nothing. All biological urges either cease, or decrease severely until I'm alone or in familiar territory. I expect I'll be holding this pee for a minimum of 2 more hours. I attribute this to feeling vulnerable and unsafe around nmom (2+ years NC! Yay!). I was terrified of her. Now, unrelated situations with even a molecule of uncertainty put me in this state. I don't feel extra anxious, either; just on high alert.

I love this community. Honestly, I don't know how to talk about this. I've recently been having serious bouts of anxiety for more than a few months now. For a long time, I've been wondering what is the flaw? *Where* is it? Now, I know it sounds absurd, but I've been asking myself this on a loop and unsurprisingly, every time I've made a mistake, said a word here and there, gotten *angry*, been slightly irresponsible and I have had the worst kind of attacks - followed by ""This is *the* mistake."" You are flawed. I've found it so comfortable to point to my flaws, as if that is all I am. That is all I will ever be. I knew about emotional abuse, and its effects. This sub has been an *amazing* help. But yesterday, it truly hit. Today, after 20 years, I've realised the extent of damaged my parents have inflicted on me. I was reading this book - Running on Empty: Overcome Your Childhood Emotional Neglect, and I was crying the entire night. I think for the first time my feelings made sense. My negative feelings. The emptiness I felt was *because* of a reason. The shame I felt was not because I was flawed. I was just used. Objects don't feel, and I was one in their eyes. Don't feel, don't get angry, don't..be. Any form of expression would make them holler, or completely ignore us, or just a nod, until...it was about them. Oh no, you better not stop telling them how grateful you are or else the *look* is on your way. Some things I found in my behaviour that are linked to neglect and abuse: 1. Apologising incessantly. I think it's easier for me to think I am flawed than blame someone else for this. Partially, because accepting this unnecessary flaw, makes me want to be ""better"" or fix myself for the other person. So, essentially, ""I am willing to take on your work for some validation."" 2. Working myself to exhaustion. ""When the obsessive/compulsive flight type is not doing, she is worrying and planning about doing. She becomes what John Bradshaw calls a Human Doing \[as opposed to a Human Being.\] Obsessiveness is left-brain dissociation, as opposed to the classic right-brain dissociation of the freeze type described below. Left-brain dissociation is using constant thinking to distract yourself from underlying abandonment pain. When thinking is worrying, it is as if underlying fear wafts up and taints the thinking process. Moreover, if compulsivity is hurrying to stay one step ahead of your repressed pain, obsessing is worrying to stay one level above underlying pain."" - [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving: A GUIDE AND MAP FOR RECOVERING FROM CHILDHOOD TRAUMA](URL 3. **Alexithymia**: Avoiding my feelings. This is so quick, I have to work very hard to notice this has happened. I feel something and I can't identify it. 4. Triggered when I interact with authority figures. I want their approval and despise them at the same time. 5. Co-dependency: for the longest time I had been looking at my partners as a source of self worth. I attached myself to their identity as I saw it, and kept compromising what I wanted in hopes of filling this ""gap"". I felt just as disconnected with them as with myself. Took me a year to figure out that this stemming from my childhood, and not entirely because of them. 6. Engaging in risky behaviour. 7. Perfectionism. If I had this one more skill, if I could make this as amazing as what I dream, then - only then I will feel satisfied with myself. 8. Attracting emotionally unavailable partners, because they could fix me, perhaps? 9. Extreme fear of certain people, situations and thoughts. Speaking in crowds. Talking about my feelings. I could *die*. 10. Never fighting. I just couldn't have a healthy fight without breaking down and losing all interest in my point in the first place. 11. Never being spontaneous. Or feeling extremely guilty about doing what made be feel happy. For that little time. 12. Contempt. 13. Thinking that other people want to ""damage"" me in some way; trust issues. 14. This one is particularly baffling - I never knew art became a way to escape. I wasn't doing it because it brought me joy, it was a way of disconnecting from the toxicity. 15. Rejecting people I ***actually*** love: No one who really loves who you are will ever play these sick games with you. And that is why, when you feel safe, loved, protected - you will be massively uncomfortable with that vulnerability. These elements will question those joys precisely because they do not serve the master. According to him or her, it is your duty to serve them like this. All your life. This is a really long list. I am now starting to see. I discovered that I had been consciously avoiding connecting to my inner emotional child, because that was discarded at the cost of another ""desirable"" persona. All my life, I've been moulded to become that ""persona"". That is the perfect child worthy of love. And all our lives we have suffered to get there. Trying to get there. I think the depression and anxiety are *protective* mechanisms, for this ""persona"" to exist. Punishments for you to keep trying lest you will deemed broken. Unwanted. Stupid. Pointless. It will hurt till you realise that there is more to life. There is more to you that needs to be seen, loved, heard. There is more to life than *suffering* under someone's identity. We as kids deserve love, warmth and affection - but most importantly a presence that available to us. All the children of narcissists are denied this sacred bond because some part of them cannot ever accept you as you are. That is just not happening and I think we deny ourselves joy until we truly accept that. They are the *flaw*."

At age 12, my sister was born, two years later, my little brother was born. From that time on, I lost my identity. I had to babysit at all times. After school, Id come home and my parents would leave to work. I remember having to come up with excuses for not being able to hangout, it was very stressful. I remember acting like a mother to my own mother as well. There would be times when Id have breakdowns and Id rant to my dad and tell him that I wanted to be mothered, to feel like a child. My dad catered to all my moms needs and still does. It makes her entitled and act like a brat. Shes so dependent on him and used to letting him do everything. I had several breakdowns as a teenager. I remember needing to feel loved, asking my parents if we could go to a therapist, I didnt know what the matter was but I knew something was wrong. I was always the perfect kid, I was a pushover while my brother who is two years younger was able to enjoy his teenage years because he really didnt care about my parents feelings. At 23, I finally moved out and lost my faith in God, I needed to be selfish. It led down a negative path where I was self medicating with alcohol, marijuana and sex. I realize I had a huge need to feel loved, I struggled and still struggle with vulnerability so it was hard to let anyone in. When I moved out my parents said that I abandoned them. All I wanted was some autonomy and to have a better relationship with them. Instead they continually rejected me. Id go over every weekend to visit to show them I cared and hadnt abandoned them. I invited them over to my place several times only to be rejected. I continued having these big breakdowns because its very easy for a disagreement to happen just about any time were together. These breakdowns were me expressing to my dad (hes the one whod listen) that I wanted to be closer to them and have a better relationship. No effort was ever maintained. Last year I met my wonderful boyfriend, we became inseparable and I moved in with him. I kept It all a secret from my parents because they never cared about my personal life so it was also difficult to share with them. Theyre religious so finding out that I was living with a boyfriend was a nightmare for them. My dad got angry saying we better fix our mistake and get married, dealing with him has been so stressful. When he sees me, hell just ignore me sometimes. It makes me angry that he acts like this when I begged to be loved countless times. I now feel loved by my boyfriend who treats me like Im his world. He cares and fully accepts me and is always trying to make me happy. I finally have what Ive needed for so long but my dad continues to be a nightmare. I feel Its so unfair and extremely stressful :/. When my family met my bf it was such an awful situation. Mid way through a lunch, my SIL ignorantly got up with my brother and my younger siblings. Leaving my parents, bf and myself alone. It was super awkwardshe was trying to get us to have a serious conversation. After meeting, my dad threatened to come find where we lived and said a bunch of rude/mean things to me. Ive tried to make things better, at Xmas, I tried inviting myself and bf over. My dad said that if I wanted my bf to come over that he first had to speak to him one on one. I dont trust my dad to be nice so I havent let this happen. A year has passed, Im so angry at how my dad has reacted. On a positive note, my mom has been supportive and I feel I finally have a mother. I think about how time is going to continue passing and it makes me angry he wants to make zero effort. K so what if we get married, does he think that all of a sudden hell be fine and that well fully accept him in our lives??? UGH. I feel hopeless."

It sounds like youre being too sensitive. You find yourself babbling and retreating into your shame bubble. If I were to show others one of the many letters she has sent me, or record a conversation we had, they might be hard pressed to spot the emotional abuse. There is a reason for this. My mother knows me like no other. She watched my vulnerabilities and weaknesses develop from infancy. She crafted them in her likeness. For someone to really see how abusive she is, I would have to reveal to them my shameful secrets, my fears, my biggest vulnerabilities. Only then could they see how skilfully she is exploiting them to cause pain. I use this as a red flag now. If I spot someone using information gathered from when I opened up about something or showed a vulnerability or a flaw and weaponising it to shame or humiliate me, I now have the language to express what just happened. I dont sink into a shame bubble now. I see their behaviour and I heed the warning signs to distance myself.

17,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Just joined this group and wondering if my mother was a narcissist? Any insight appreciated.,1,hxswww,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/hxswww/just_joined_this_group_and_wondering_if_my_mother/,2020-07-26 05:46:17,"Hi guys, So, I am 21 years old and up until a few years ago I thought I had a normal, even ""spoiled"" upbringing. I was wondering, please, whether anyone here might validate my feelings so I do not feel as though I am crazy or making assumptions. My mother has never been diagnosed as having NPD. She was always volunteering; she was well-liked and bubbly. I remember being treated well in my childhood. I was given lots of toys, went vacationing every year, etc. Lovely house, a very fun and rewarding childhood. I remember her being strict, but nothing out of the ordinary. She has always given me whatever I wanted. Jewelry especially, expensive dresses, tuition fully compensated for. She made a cross stitch frame for me, which reads ""Best girl in this whole world."" When I was physically hurt by a man, she defended me and expressed outrage towards him, and she seems to have always been protective over me. My mother consistently tells me that I am ""pretty"", that I am ""smart"" and that I should have a future. However, I'm constantly confused and feel gaslighted. She fluctuates between putting me on a pedestal or tearing me down to criticize or shame me for minor mistakes. If I say that I am phobic of insects, or that I have depression, she tells me that I am weak-minded and will say something like, ""do you think you are SO special?"" when I am suffering with anorexia and body dysmorphia. When I expressed my desire to move out, she told me that I was ""selfish"" and a ""terrible person"" for leaving her alone. She despises all of my friends and constantly tells me not to trust them. She tries to poison me against my dad, my sister. When I am upset, she acts sympathetic initially but immediately will turn the discussion to herself and her own troubles. She has NEVER given me comfort, emotional support, or compassion. And, to this date, I have never experienced anything like that from anyone in my life. Once, she literally told me that she and I are the same. She also said that I do not have a right to privacy. She called me ""lazy"" for getting a B in my calc class instead of an A. She called me ""cowardly"" for having social anxiety. She told me that she'd like to move in with me and be near me when I move out. I vacillate between feelings of hatred for her and estrangement. Am I overreacting?? I just feel really depressed and empty all the time. I've been emotionally neglected and invalidated for over 9 years now. When people try to be comforting, I misinterpret it as patronizing and I'm basically just constantly ashamed of being vulnerable. I feel like my whole life is a fraud. A huge facade of perfectionism. I'm hopelessly codependent, and I'm afraid of not appearing stoic. It feels shameful to have needs or wants, and I don't even know what they are. I just, I feel numb like I have no oxytocin or the ability to attach healthily to anyone. I have a care-taking/savior complex personality because I like to take care of my friends and make them happy, but I am also DEATHLY terrified of any slight vulnerability or insecurity. My entire self-worth is rooted in external achievements. I have no intrinsic self-worth or self-esteem, nor do I have a concept of that. If I succeed, I artificially like myself, and if I fail I loathe myself. The only time I feel happy is when I do well academically or when somebody compliments me, but even then that happiness feels superficial. Sometimes I don't feel real, like I'm a machine on autopilot. My life feels like a never-ending quest for validation. My mother has had a lot of traumatic life experiences, which have changed her because of her PTSD, but she is so manipulative, domineering and invalidating that I feel as if I only exist to be this subservient extension of her. I don't love her. I don't want to please her. She's always talking about the ""unconditional love"" she has for me, but she violates my boundaries, shames me, and antagonizes me. I've thought about seeing a therapist, but the idea of crying in front of him/her makes me anticipate anxiety and humiliation. Any advice on how to start feeling things again instead of an all-encompassing numbness? Thank you to the kind community, and anyone who takes the time to read this. Words cannot articulate how thankful I am for that. And, incidentally, if anyone on this thread would like someone to vent to, day or night, I'm happy to be messaged. Thank you guys!"

My SIL left a message for nmom. Asking how her recent test went. My mom was recently tested for COVID despite having NO symptoms of it.

They have become resentful over their own lives and the way everything has turned out. They seek pitiful, unjustified revenge as a way to attempt to justify that before they pass away. Likely as a result of squandering their own potential in the early years of their lives, where it matters the most, so they have set themselves up for a lifetime of pain. They are incapable of willingly enduring the resistance associated with improvement and growth because it just adds more pain to their lives, making them even more resentful... so they have grown an entitlement so large, they expect everything to be handed to them on a golden platter, they think that they are somehow OWED it, that they do not DESERVE life to give them more pain on top of what it's already given. That's how they perceive the world, they feel that they have been oppressed in some unbearable way and none of it is their fault, and so they want their revenge. They need that justification before they pass away. They need to have had a purpose when they are laying on their death beds, even if their purpose is to destroy life as much as they can. They hate the world for what they perceive it to have done to them and they will not die knowing that they remain the victim to life so they attack it, forcefully, relentlessly, because it's their purpose, it's their meaning. They wake up every day seeking revenge, it's what keeps them going. [There are two pleasure systems in the brain](URL one associated with short term reward, and one associated with purpose, and working towards a high aspiring goal. The issue with that is that it can be exploited, because purpose can be built around negative goals too. So pursuing a high aspiring goal, no matter the moral attachment, will fuel that pleasure system. That's why they do it, that's why they become obsessive, addictive, manipulators. They need that feeling, otherwise they are empty, left with nothing but short term satisfaction in a dismal life where they have no other resistance, no friction that will make them grow and be satisfied with life. It's the reason they get out of bed in the morning, knowing that they have another shot at getting their own back. Knowing that they have a purpose, to make the world burn. They don't change their circumstance, they are lost, straggling, lacking the empathy that is required to seek a good purpose in life that will benefit them and others, so they spent their lives rotting away, seeking pleasurable escape to fuel their short term reward system and using others to exploit their long term reward system. They seek validation in people who are empathetic, because these people are the most vulnerable. They realise that they can find the pleasure reward associated with domination and growth by exploiting the vulnerability in others. It's all so that they can feel better about themselves, so that they can feel good about their lives, because without that stimulation their life is a dark, dark place. They are faced with nothing but death and meaningfulness. So, it has to always be about them, otherwise they will spend their lives feeling empty, feeling like they are getting closer and closer to death, having achieved nothing. This is why they are incapable of putting themselves inside your shoes, they don't want to, they know what they are doing is wrong, that it stems from nothing but weakness. It stems from nothing but lack of self control and discipline in their early lives, where it mattered the most, they have set themselves up for the life they have now and they are SO resentful for it. So, they need to be in control of something to feel like they are higher than they actually are, to imagine that they have already achieved what they would have liked to achieved in terms of social status, to put a barrier between the chaos and order in their lives. They need to shun, manipulate, degrade because there's no chance they will ever find that level of validation anywhere else, it's easy, cheap, and damaging to others. But they don't care, in their minds they see it as a sacrifice they are making to live a better life for themselves, because they can't bear the alternative. They have shut themselves off to feeling empathy somewhere along the lines, because nobody truly, completely, lacks empathy unless they have an underlying mental health condition that causes that from birth. Statistics show that there is only a minute percentage of the population who are pathologically pre-destined to lack empathy, therefore it's likely that the narc is suppressing their empathy in great amounts. This doesn't mean that they are willing and/or able to change, it just means that deep down, they will know that they are in the wrong, and that knowing fuels them even further. It fuels their self hatred, it adds to the realism of who they have become, who they have made themselves into. They will even take that out on you too, because you are their target to project upon. You are someone/something to channel the resentment, hatred, anger towards. They are already projecting onto you, and you are receiving it in every way they want you to, so what's a little more? Surely it's worth it to damage you even further to get rid of those negative emotions too... The resentment, the deceitful vengeance overpowers any last trace of empathy so Instead of finding purpose elsewhere in life, they find their purpose in seeing how much hurt they can bring to others, how much they can ruin someones mind/soul/spirit in an attempt to get their own back at the world for the wrong hand they think it has dealt them, to get back at life. Narcissism is deeply rooted. You can not, ever, heal a narcissist. Don't ever kill yourself trying. All my life I was brought up by narcissists, I was mentally ill from a young age, I always thought I was the problem, I was a mistake, I was unlovable. These we're all thoughts that we're placed into me, as a catalyst to grow, and they we're assumptions that my family nurtured. It wasn't until I sought therapy 20 years later that I realised the root of approximately 80% of my mental health problems lied within the confounds of my narcissistic familial structure. Once I removed them, I felt free. I've never had so much mental clarity as I have now, my self esteem, as crippled as it has become over the years, is slowly developing. I'm slowly making progress in my recovery and I will get there eventually, mark my words. To all of you here, stay strong, it is not your fault. There \*are\* people worthy of your love, don't lose sight of that. There are other empaths in the world who will take your love and nurture it, who will build you up instead of tearing you down. But be aware that to the empath, the narc seems like the ideal person, someone who is in \*need\* of your abilities to see the world as a beautiful, loving, caring place. The idea that you can bring your love and affection towards an empty, broken soul and heal them... but then you end up completely losing yourself in the process. It's not worth it, don't ever try it, it's nothing but a fantasy. An empath and a narc are complete opposites, and opposites that should repel, but seemingly, they attract. Be wise, and enfore the former. So, constantly be checking yourself, checking the people in your life. Seek other empaths, walk away from narcs, in fact, run. All the best."
22,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Drained and resentful around my family,1,ha26xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ha26xr/drained_and_resentful_around_my_family/,2020-06-16 21:29:30,"***I originially wrote this on another forum (about porn as a coping-mechanism), but I thought it might fit here also. This is about my entire family on my mother's side, but my mother is main character in what I write. I'm curious if anyone can relate to what I write.*** I've visited my mother for the last couple of days. Every time I visit her I look forward to it, but when I get there it only takes a couple of hours before I'm completely drained. I then remember the frustration growing up, why I liked to isolate myself from chaos. I think this has played a large role in my PMO'ing and developing coping-mechanisms. My mother is the sweetest and kindest person ever. However, she has had her share of problems (a lot of our family died early, including her own father) and this has blunted her development. She has no self-esteem at all, she's envious of everyone else, she's angry, bitter, overreacting, anxious, entitled and much more. Rationally I know that this is not ""her"", but is caused by what she's been through. I can easily notice how her condition is by how she treats others. When she's having a rough time she lashes out on everybody for no reason, she get's angry in the traffic, constant chattering about things no one cares about. Her/our entire family is affected what they've been through. Her sister is a functioning alcoholic, another sister has basically given up on herself and only does things for others while she's slowly ruining her own life. One of the biggest problems are the how the entire family is ""fucked"" and how this makes them think they're normal, because they compare everything to them. Their biggest issue is their self-esteem. When I'm visiting my family I have to compliment their food, their looks, the way they dress, them as a person and so on. This is so extremely draining and I often just end up not responding to anything they say or just answer ""yes"", ""no"", ""okey"". This leads them to think I'm quiet and shy and can't speak up for myself. I absolutely hate being around them in social situations, because they treat me (and their own children) as we're 10 years old. Ironically, we (my cousins and I), have felt like the grown ups in the family the past 20 years. Just a couple of days ago my mom and I went to the store. She told me I should just grab anything if I wanted it. Of course, she also smiles at me while saying it and adding ""Your mother is paying. Isn't it nice to be here with your mother?"". I didn't really want anything, mostly because I got infuriated by the way she talks and treat me. That's another thing by the way, my entire family on my mother's side talks with a childish voice and vocabulary. They also uses our names in litteraly every sentence. Even if it's just my mom and I and we sit next to eachother she uses my name. It makes me feel like a fucking child. I don't see how they expect people to take them seriously. Another thing is how the always just avoid talking about things they don't like. If I say anything to my mother and try to put her in place she just acts like she didn't hear what I said. If I tell her ""it's about time you do finally manage to take some time of and relax, because you've been trying to for 25 years and still hasn't succeeded"". She either doesn't answer me at all and just act like I didn't say anything, or she says things like ""everything I do is wrong"" and make's me feel awful about the things I say to her. My family has a tendency to always be drawn to chaos and not fix things. My mother has told me for the past 25 years that her psychologist says she has to put herself first. Everyone knows that. The problem is that her entire self worth is determined by her ability to help others. She can't sit still for 2 minutes without asking if anyone wants her to get them anything, like a snack or something. We say no, and then she asks again a couple of minutes later. Again, we say ""no, you've already asked"". When we say no it's like she gets hurt. Eventually she just finds some snack and places it on the table, although no one wanted it. My aunt hasn't done a thing in her house after her husband left her. She cleans and everything, but her cloths are everywhere, and most her things is in boxes, she uses years to just hang a painting on the wall, she need to fix her plumbing and electrical system, but instead she just buy new stuff she doesn't need to give the impression she's successful. The point I'm trying to make is how much frustration I've dealt with through my upbringing. My family just loved to talk about everything that was wrong in their life, what's holding them back, who they dislike, bringing up the same theme over and over again, but never wanting to do something about it. They were also constant chattering about everyone else; who has gained weight, commentating the appearance and personalities of people they know ""I've never understood what he sees in her"", ""she's always been kind of ugly"", ""I heard he's having some problems with his nerves"", ""If only people had gone through what we've been through they wouldn't think their problems mattered"", and so on. They expect me to have an opinion about things that doesn't affect me at all. They want me to tell them everything, just so they can get more information to pass around. It's like their information about others is the only value they have. When I tell them something it's like they don't react to what I'm actually saying, they just store the information so they can pass it along. My family takes such great pride in their looks and can't even leave their houses without wearing tons of make-up and putting on a new dress. I've told my mother ""I hope you realize how stupid it is that you guys sit all day badmouthing everyone else and can't even walk outside without make-up, because you have such a poor self-esteem and needs people to find you attractive to get validated because you have no faith in your personality"". That's another thing; I've begun to not care about filtering what I tell her, because they has to be stopped. I tell her it's no wonder you don't feel good about yourself considering how much hate, resentment, badmouth the people you really care about. I have always been a pretty objective and rational guy, which didn't fit in with my family at all, because they just wanted someone to agree with them when they blamed everyone else for their pathetic lives. Every time they talked about someone's back I sat there and agreed more with the person they badmouthed, than my own family. I'm one of the oldest males in my family and was exposed to all of this hate, yelling, whining, without them having any form of filter or self reflection. I heard about them talking behind the back of their own family, how they ""hated"" their friends, how they want to improve their lives but this wasn't the time to do it etc. I really care for my family and wanted to help them get better, as I knew that their toxic behaviour just had to do with their own issues. When I think about it now it's kind of weird how I, at the age of 10-12, was the person who tried to help my family get their shit together. Anyway, as time went by I started reading more and more about psychology, depression, self-esteem, anxiety, nutrition, mainly just because I wanted to help my family out, as none of them seemed to actively do something productive to fix their situation. The good part is that I've learned a lot about those topics, but at the same time my family has no interest in doing anything right, so it hasn't helped them in any way. Or, they want to, but it's just been 25 years and it's never the right time.... The thing that annoys me the most is how this has impacted me/us. How they use their children to feel validated, get complimented, use us as their emotional crutch, drained us emotional, robbed us for part of our childhood, how they affect others by not being able to get their shit together. The first time my mother met my girlfriend she told me ""she's a pretty girl, but she got ugly teeth"". She doesn't mean anything by it, but this is the kind of things my family thinks is OK to say, because all they do is talking about everyone else and feels entitled to do so. They (my mom and her sisters) phone each other every single day, yet have nothing to talk about because none of them actually does anything with their life. They just talks about everyone else. I know everything that is to know about every family member, their friends, their friends children, the women she work with that is secretly a lesbian and her husband doesn't know, about how a friend of my cousin was having problems after giving birth because of a vaginal tear. I have completely lost interest in staying in touch with people, even my family, because I know everything about them. If I buy a new sofa and I try to show it to my aunt the next time I see her (just to make conversation) I don't need to, because my mother has told her and send her a picture of it already. I hate how they have exposed their vulnerability to me my entire life and leaving me with a constant feeling of chaos around them, how they expect that their behaviour doesn't affect us and leave us with the responsibility to take care of our family. I hate how my mother told me that she still loved my father more than my stepdad 12 years after they separated."
23,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I wish my SO could see what her family is really like.,1,hag8pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/hag8pn/i_wish_my_so_could_see_what_her_family_is_really/,2020-06-17 10:19:50,"Long story ahead, I will try to add all relevant details. I was 22(m) when I met my SO who was 25(f). I had just gotten out of a narcissistic relationship about 3 to 6 months prior to meeting. That relationship almost ended with me buried in my own back yard, just to clarify how bad it was. I will not discuss that relationship further as it is too upsetting for me. So I met my SO through a mutual friend. We went to her house to hang out with her. She lived with her parents at the time, but that didn't bother me, as I was back to living with my parents too after my bad breakup. I met her parents too, it all went nicely and they offered for me to stay for dinner. I agreed. Me and my SO had an instant connection although we didn't converse much. I ended up staying the night as a friend. As mentioned earlier, I was living with my parents. My family is very toxic and highly indulged in what they call a religion, but I call a cult. I call it a cult for many reasons, but the main one for me is huge amount of pedophilia in their church, which I endured for 7 years. I had gone through much physical and psychological abuse from my family, and was severely sheltered up until the age of 12, when I was placed in foster care. I was living with my parents again to recover from my narcissistic relationship. As you can probably guess it wasn't going so well and I was looking for a way out. So I met my SO and her family and they were all very nice. I stayed there on and off for like a week or two and then asked out my SO. We were now a couple. Her parents knew about what my home life was like with my family, so they offered for me to move in and live with them. I was blown away by the offer as it meant I could escape my family again. My vulnerability had blinded my mind to the gaslighting I was being showered with. Life went on and we were all very happy. I was helping my SO get fit and healthy etc and was doing the same myself. I moved my things into my SO's room and settled down. Then as I was tidying our room one day I found a piece of paper with a list of objectives, clearly written by my SO. The one objective that stuck out for me was: (paraphrasing) escape my family. I instantly was a bit shocked as her family was so nice. I confronted her about it and she explained that she felt a lack of independence etc as her family was quite overbearing or enmeshed. I didn't think much of it as we were saving up to move in the future anyway. This is where things got weird. It's like the switch was flipped. All of a sudden I was being subdued and manipulated by her parents. I saw it and advised my partner of it. She said something along the lines of, oh that's just what they are like. Next they tried to separate us. My SO had a friend who was clearly infatuated with her, shown by his physical actions. We agreed it was unfair to me that I should see some guy try to cuddle her etc, so we cut ties, as he just didn't get the message that she was not single. Now her mother messages him saying that I'm paranoid and delusional etc and that I am manipulating my SO to push everyone out of her life. She then asks me to fix her wifi problem on her phone as I am a techy. The messages were open right in front of my eyes. I was absolutely shocked. The messages stated that my SO had said all these things about me to her mom. I confront my SO with ""is that really how you feel?"". She was very confused and denied having ever said that. I was more confused. We confront her mother about it and she threatened to stab me and throw me out of the house. My SO sat by and let me be treated this way. I don't blame her after what I saw next. The event made me get back on my guard. Now I watched carefully and analyzed all actions and words, motives etc. I found that my SO's parents were running her like a slave. She did all the chores etc. Behind her back they told their friends that ""our daughter is a lazy piece of shit, she doesn't do fucking anything and is a slob."" They didn't notice that I too was outside at the time, just 5 metres away from them. I confront them. Denials etc. These incidents become a regular cycle and I withdraw to our room, becoming extremely introverted. Every chance they get they gaslight me and my SO, then switch to abuse when the time is right. Now 3 years on, we live in our own house and have 2 children. I cut my entire family out as they start causing problems involving my kids etc, as well as blackmail me about the sexual abuse their priest put me through. Her parents have been given boundaries regarding trying to get into our relationship and lives, just to cause havov. So many things have happened now that I'm sick of it. Every argument that I have with my SO is about her family and how they treat us, but most importantly how they treat her. We don't argue about anything else. We have a very nice relationship. She buys a car of her grandmother, doesn't sign a contract etc and is paying it off. She finds this normal as she can't see otherwise, no matter how hard I try to teach her about narcissism and enmeshed families. Her grandmother lives next door to us. The car us used as leverage over our lives. For one year straight the grandmother's boyfriend walks his dogs onto our property to piss and shit everywhere and on my things. It may seem trivial, but I am proud of my gardens etc, and finding dog piss all over my aloe vera which I grow for skin care.. it's just depressing. My SO confronts them about it multiple times and they continue, so she calls animal control. They issue a warning or something (we are unsure of the result). I am in the lounge with my children and my SO goes out for a smoke. Her grandmother starts bashing on the windows, essentially demanding my attention. I ignore her, as I do with narcissists that hold no power over me. I also suffer from PTSD from my childhood, so I don't deal with conflicts very well. I go into fight or flight mode. She was aggressive, so I didn't put myself into that situation. Now her grandmother is using the no contract sale of the car as leverage, and I fear that she will essentially steal the car leaving us out of pocket. She has already cancelled the car insurance, which was under her name, as the payments are still ongoing and the car is still in her name. She also called her daughter (SO's mom) and got her to tell my SO off for calling animal control etc and that we should have just confronted her grandmother about it etc, which we had already done. It was just all illogical. I have asked that my SO close the door on the drama in our lives, or in other words cut out her family so that we can just continue with our lives peacefully. The entirety of our time together has been a constant barrage of drama from her family. She will not do this. I am at my wits end. I have considered suicide. I have considered leaving, which will probably result in the loss of my children. For the love of god someone please help me."
24,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"My Dad, Condensed",1,hcdkhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/hcdkhe/my_dad_condensed/,2020-06-20 11:50:44,"This list is going to be long but I have to get all this stuff out about my dad to release my frustration. Always has to be right, can't accept anything less -Makes everything (good news, bad news, any mundane thing) about himself -Massively stubborn, won't take advice (if he's doing something the hard way and someone suggests an easier way he'll shut them out and do his way) -Raised by parents who never said I love you to him or showed emotional vulnerability (he has never told me he loves me, that I can recall) -His family are also narcissists especially his twin brothers. I dread spending time with his family because they are always passing judgment and everything is a game of one-upping, whether they'd admit it or not. For example: my uncle will ask me about a play I was in just to quickly turn the convo into how his daughter is a fantastic actress in a very prestigious program () and I should ask her for tips. My dad feeds into this too. He always forwards us emails that my uncles send about my GROWN cousins doing normal stuff. ""Your cousin baked a cake for a cooking class!"" It's like he cares more about his nieces and nephews accomplishments than being present for his own kids. -Talks down to my mom, treating her like a subordinate or even a kindergartner. She often comes to me to vent about their marriage. He can't even say ""I love you"" to her either. Actually I've never heard him say it to anyone. On their anniversary he wrote a card saying ""you are loved"" -Sometimes verbally abusive (will call us idiots, jerks, and other things like that. once he forced me to stare into a mirror and recite 20+ times that i'm a selfish person who doesnt care about my family... ironic right?) and used to be physically abusive (eg. grabbing my throat and slamming me against a wall) -Has had very mild, easily treatable cancer and always uses it to play the victim card or brings it up in conversations even though he's recovered and healthy -Threatened to kick me out of the house with one day's notice if I didn't sign a ridiculous lease he drafted up that controlled almost every aspect of my life. He told me to pack a bag and said he would ""drop me off at social services"" -Can go from calm to irate in the snap of a finger -I never feel like I have his full affection or support. Sometimes when there are moments in a conversation where a normal parent would say ""that's great news!"" or ""i'm proud of you"" or ""don't worry about it"" there's just silence. No validation. And yet I always seek that validation. I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him and I apologize for even the most mundane things. Again, never a response. No ""it's okay."" Yeah, he's really not a man of many words except when he's around his family or anyone he sees a potential to brag to or show off all his knowledge. Basically, my dad's family, friends, and basically everyone who knows him sees him as this great, smart guy when in reality he's someone I almost can't stand to be around. There are so many experiences I've had with him that I didn't share in this post because it would go on for miles. But TLDR: I don't love my father. In fact, I think he's an asshole and I don't want any part of his family. I wish I didn't live under his roof or need his financial support. Most of all I wish my mom would find someone better for her. She's the best person I know and even she herself has admitted she deserves more."

All while being a child (stuck in abuse), I was bullied by multiple relatives relentlessly, and I won't share too much detail but I was through a lot. Top that up with multiple diagnosed mental illnesses, and multiple diagnoses I would find out I have years later (I have ADHD: so, this explains some of my clumsiness, lack of ability to study hs properly, not being able to read a page or focus without extreme difficulty and time, forgetting my dad's orders and my mom's ridiculous expectations, etc, so it just made the abuse so much worse goddamit)...life was fun. Everything I did was scrutinized and belittled. For example, I would not be allowed to eat dinner until all dishes were washed, dried and put away, and I was fed food that made me sick as well, but I was a 'selfish money waster' so that just made him and mom more mad. Apparently there is a 'right' way to sweep the kitchen floor - ""YOU START IN THAT CORNER, NOT BY THE FRIDGE."" Nmom sometimes chimed in, along with her nasty bitch-grin, ""you stupid girl"" or ""she never learns"". Apparently you are supposed to wake up at 7:30 AM every day, including weekends, because that is what dad does', but unfortunately not only did this stress me the fuck out and ruin my life at 18 yrs old trying to partially escape, but then I was a terrible person who brought the mood down and bothered him and his wife, because I was so tired I would yawn constantly (I had a sleep disorder too, not yet known). I felt like a complete piece of shit all the time. Once, when I \*\*\* and had a short stay in the psych ER, and I returned to prison, dad blamed me for being so selfish and then the next day said you need to get a job asap, (I was 17), because 'your sisters' have life difficulties too, and they have jobs (so I just needed to stop being an attention seeking baby and grow up), while being in school, and being unable to study or understand most of what was being expected because my learning disorder was debilitating, coupled with fibro pain, major depression, and a pile of other issues. Or when, in my early 20s, I got my shit somewhat together, got a scholarship, and went to college planning on taking loans out to help as well, nothing was said about great, your going to college....or anything remotely decent...it was just (said in a mocking way), 'loans? seriously? you have a scholarship, you're going to make life hard when you graduate, etc etc'......everything I did was dumb, unwise, stupid, fucking reckless, when actually, I did the opposite...not saying I haven't made mistakes, like is completely normal...but I've worked pretty hard. Also, my dad liked to tell me how I need to learn to suck up shit, I am too sensitive, I need to learn that the real world is tough, and to be an adult (um, where the fuck do I live? on EARTH, in the real world, I just have different struggles, and am doing my damn best)...and would batter it into me how much of a failure I was compared to my sisters, my aunts and uncles, who 'had struggles too'. When I got sick, I would be blamed for it, and while incapacitated in bed, or in the hospital, he would love to let me know how much I should thank my mom for caring for me, even bringing me WATER when I was too weak, or for cleaning up my puke (I never asked them too, I would have done it myself), and made to thank my mom often while I was still half out of it, pale, and unable to walk straight. I was told how terrible I was, sometimes without such blunt wording, for causing issues. And to 'not get sick like that again'. 'You don't buy a Starbucks drink! That's expensive. You are selfish, that's what selfish people do. Be like us. You'll never get anywhere in life if you do that. You are so inconsiderate, we fed you as a child (I was 20 and left home/prison by then, on my own, my own finances, etc), that is so immature. I work a hard job, (shit pay, shit job, not my fault), and a Starbucks latte is almost 6.00, you have to think about what you spend your money on, you know, me and (mom) are wise, and frugal, we don't waste money on these things, we do smart things like walk in the park, etc. (it was a Saturday, I bought a Grande drink because it was a fucking saturday), even when we argued for a few mins in the lineup, him making me look like a fool, he still tried to make me buy a smaller size, because that would be cheaper, and since I was making such bad choices, he suggested I pay his drink too. I was a student, not well off. He did not fail to make my latte extremely un-enjoyable, and make me feel like shit about it for the rest of the day. These types of things happened all the time. He was also severely controlling, even after I turned 18, making me wake up certain times, making me do back breaking chores out of nowhere, when he just 'decides' he wants me to also scrub the floors on my hands and knees as well, in addition to doing all their dirty dishes, and sweeping, and making sure everything was spotless, and no pieces of string or any noticeable small thing on the floor after vacuuming were left, otherwise I would be called back upstairs madly, told I missed things, and that I was not allowed to eat breakfast until I re-did everything; sometimes he would find 'unclean spots' that did not exist, or were extremely minor, and make me re-do the entire room or floor again, while crying, because it was early in the morning, and the backbreaking work made me very sick. I was a good child. I never did drugs, smoked, alcohol, rebelled (in the normal sense), lazed around (unless 'lazing around' was actually me staying in bed a lot due to my pain issues and lack of medication), and no matter how much more I did to please him so he didn't hate me and lose his temper, there was always something 'terrible' about me. I was also punished for being depressed, apparently that hurt my mom and dad. 'You don't need psych meds! I don't believe in that stuff' he would guilt-say, when for example I had just been discharged from inpatient due to crippling depression and ptsd. 'Besides, those aren't REAL diagnoses - you just need to change your mind. I was regularly called dumb, dummy, dummy-dum-dum, for example when I struggled to comprehend grade 10 math, or when I vacumed the floor the 'wrong way', or called a fatty, when I was about 125 pounds (appeared slightly chubby back then on my face and stomach, due to not being fed proper protein and trying to fill my starving tummy with junk), I would be patted on the head, I would be forced to do huge amounts of chores, and not stop and break or have breakfast until everything was fully polished, until I was crying sometimes, because that made the pain so bad, I would have to get on my hands and knees sometimes to wash the floor, because they said buying a mop was a 'waste of money' (obsessively cheap with everything). I would be called other names, specifically curated for me, to make me feel demeaned and little, even after I was an adult. It made me feel sick, and sometimes violated. He didn't care. 'You are lazy' on top of never ever saying anything good about me, ever, which I recently realized is not normal, on top of telling me how much it hurts him that I don't talk to him often anymore, and blaming me for his mistakes, etc, on top of 'you know, your sisters are going to college, at 19, and you are 20, and still a mess....(I was sick)....blame on me, always, and I had to apologize to him for ruining his life, and making his life stressful, and costing him money, UNLIKE MY SISTERS, WHO MOVED OUT RIGHT AT 19, AND HAD JOBS right, I must be a weak retard....always forgetting to dry the last corners of the sink, or counter, or tap, or going to the bathroom after eating before washing dishes, which apparently wasn't necessary, and I was selfish. Often my dad would say ""I was joking' after insulting me so I thought he must just have shit humor and I must be crazy. I'm looking for validation here guys, as well as this is an anger rant. All the emotions are flooding in. Its been a rough fucking day. I don't know what to do with what I feel, it is very intense pain and trauma and vulnerability. Holy sh\*t guys, this is opening up a lot of emotional pain and rage."

I still feel ashamed to say it, I guess I'm still processing what happened to me, but they were pretty awful people. Most of it was the work of mom and grandma, who I believe now have narcissistic personality, but grandpa was complicit in it. I'll just refer to them as Nfamily. I went no contact at 18 and I'm now 21. Spent many years being homeless and in and out of psychiatric hospitals before I started to get settled down and attempt to begin sorting my life out. It took removing myself from them entirely to do it. I moved 200 miles away and completely started over. I still struggle with the negative impact their behaviour had on my psyche and self esteem. The constant nightmare flashbacks and self loathing are the worst, but I have hope that I can still move on. I got into a relationship and recently gave birth to our baby, I still have so much doubt in myself to be a proper parent but I feel the least I can do for my child is to give him a clean slate. I have made an agreement with myself that I will not bring up Nfamily in the childs presence or ever allow them to meet, including meeting my partner. I don't want them to have a chance to instill any of the toxic thoughts and behaviors that they created in me as a child, or attempt to break up our family by manipulating me or my partner. I have 2 family members remaining on that side of the family, my younger brother and my mothers sister- my aunt. I love them both very much and they are good people but still very much in contact with Nfamily. My brother is in the beginning stage of cutting contact, barely moved out, my aunt is disabled and 100% reliant on them. They both acknowledge that Nfamily has serious issues and they respect my choice to remove myself from them. They do not divulge any information to Nfamily unless I consent to it. They have both warned me that Nfamily is becoming more delusional with age. Apparently mom is having a midlife crisis because brother and I don't pay her any attention anymore, wants to apply to be a foster mom (I hope to God she won't be approved.) Grandma is apparently obsessed with the idea of me being pregnant (SERIOUSLY creeping me out ) and will not stop hounding aunt and brother about it, despite it having been years since we talked and my last interaction with her I told her to go fuck herself. All of this just has me on edge. And of course it has to coincide with the birth of my child. I recently saw mom breifly, when I met with brother to get something out of her house. First time she had seen me in years. This woman is so cold and yet she feigned these big crocodile tears the moment she saw me, claiming she was soooo worried and why dont I talk to her anymore, etc. But she wasn't worried when I was 16 and sleeping on a bus bench... yeah right. Now my breif reappearance has caused a big commotion with Nfamily, they know my aunt knows my whereabouts and she tells me they have started putting pressure on her. I trust my aunt but I'm worried about her at the same time. I've always hated how they take advantage of her vulnerability. She seems to be doing alright but it troubles me that now all that pressure is being put on her, because I exist and want her in my life. She's getting old and I know she just wants to be allowed to relax. She so badly wants to be able to meet my baby but it's impossible right now because of her living situation. I wish there was something I could do."

28,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Can being RBN cause you to have narcissistic traits yourself?,2,ge2pmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ge2pmc/can_being_rbn_cause_you_to_have_narcissistic/,2020-05-06 04:01:54,"My mom and younger sister have always been huge narcissists. I could probably fill several novels with stories from my childhood, but I will try to limit myself. My question is weather anyone else feel like being RBN have caused them to have some narcissistic traits themselves. Even if they were victims of narcissists and hate that kind of behaviour. I for one feel like I have been conditioned to show narcissistic traits as a survival mechanism. (I do stop myself and feel ashamed if I catch myself doing it). One thing that I have always struggled with is love. I struggle to love myself and others, as well as letting myself recieve it from others. From a very early age I learned that love was very much conditional, and that I was never good enough to be loved no matter what I did. I am still trying to unlearn this. For a long time I was a perfectionist, and worked very hard to try to deserve love. But the harder I tried, the more I ended up pushing friends and potential dates away. I still have to activley stop myself from thinking that achievements/admiration = love. I also find that I sometimes automatically think bad stuff about others. I was held up to perfect as a minimum standard and found too light no matter what i did growing up, so it is difficult to accept others when they do even worse and seem fine with it. I feel jealous that they accept themselves and get accepted by their family I guess. I find myself worrying weather my job, friends or dates are good enough (which they never will be in my familys eyes, so I really shouldnt worry about it, but I still do when I am not being aware of my thoughts. I hear my moms voice making negative comments in my head). My biggest fear is that any children I eventually have will be faulty like me, and that I wont be able to love them unconditionally/ repeat the cycle by being critical and having favourites. What if I cant help but love one and not the other? When I have to deal with my family, I will sometimes lie to avoid admitting fault, compete and compare myself to others, try not to show emotions/vulnerability, talk badly about others to make myself look better, be a perfectionist and always try to come across as perfect and/or wedge in my achievents and stuff. Doing these things was the only way to survive at home growing up because it minimized the amount of shit I got for being ugly/fat/dumb/lazy/any other exuce they had to pick on me. I actually copied it from watching my sister do it and not only get away with it, but be rewarded for it time after time. However, I was never praised only criticized less. Does anybody else feel like they show narcissistic traits from being raised by narcissists?"
29,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Am I dealing with a narcissistic mother?,1,geid7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/geid7g/am_i_dealing_with_a_narcissistic_mother/,2020-05-06 21:37:42,"ps; I really have very little mental energy left to make my writing seem fluid and beautiful, so if there are structural or grammatical issues please ignore! I cant be bothered atm :/ My life has been relatively normal and by all respects very good; I receive good education, we live in a big house, and I have nice things. But Ive always had a very odd relationship with my mother, which I suppose I have gotten used to, but my boyfriend and father (divorced, lives in UK. Were in NZ) insist it is toxic at best and emotionally abusive at worst. Theres been a lot of fucked up things shes done in the past but Ive honestly glazed over the smaller day to day things until my partner started drawing my attention to it. Ill start off with the bigger and very nasty things shes done. What my father has told me; -She constantly accused him of cheating and was incredibly paranoid about it, while equally soaking up attention from other men (shes exceptionally beautiful. Ex model). It got to the point where she stormed his work where he was the ceo and ranted and raved to his colleagues while he was in a meeting (he had no idea she was there) spouting off lies and other accusations. He was rightfully humiliated. -she stole thousands of dollars from him by doing some fraudulent shit; I cant remember the specifics but she wiped his bank account clean. He dropped the charges on her because he didnt have the heart to put her in jail. -after they split (i was 3) she used the spare key to enter his apartment where he and his then gf were sleeping and stole more cash from him before screaming at him when she entered his room. -she was always doing weird tests with him and repeatedly told him he didnt make enough money like her friends husband apparently did (father was the ceo of a company. He made ALOT of money.) when I asked her about it she scoffed and said it was a dumb joke, but knowing her it 100% wouldnt have been. My grandmother (dads side) verified this to me and was the one actively encouraging dad to have her placed in jail but he refused. Shes also openly suggested committing insurance fraud a number of times in front of me to my stepfather, and her answer to him telling her that her plan was fraudulent was so?. Now me; -Shes always told me that if I wanted to go live with my father I was absolutely welcome to. When I was 13 I decided that was what I wanted to do. The next few months for me was HELL. Telling me my father ambushed me and manipulated me (he was simply suggesting a school I could go to and telling me he would happily take me, and it was always my decision. Furthest from manipulation.) telling me I was a traitor and I betrayed her. Pitting her and my stepfather against me, they bullied me, he called me stupid for wanting to go live with a lying prick, mocking him in front of me with a grin on his face, among other things. I read through Stepdads and hers WhatsApp convo on their phone and found they tried to enact a plan to manipulate me into staying by acting all sugary and mushy and getting me whatever I wanted. She also brazenly said that if I did move over to dads country shed leave my stepfather to follow me there. Once was all said and done, she confided in me and told me that it was a good thing I didnt leave because she would have probably killed herself. 13 year old me was traumatised. -For years after that, any confrontation that was completely unrelated would end in her telling me that I so clearly wanted to leave her to go to live with dad and shed book me plane tickets ASAP. This was always screamed at me, and I always begged and pleaded her not to. -when I went through a depressive phase I told her I was struggling to feel anything asides from sadness, and the first thing she said was; that means you dont love me anymore. What started out as-what I had hoped to be a heartfelt moment of vulnerability-turned into a vicious fight where she played the victim and made me out to be a horrible daughter. -She has since laughed about that incident and claimed she was allowed to be emotional about it. She never seemed to care how I felt. This is one example of a number of fights where she has played the victim. -repeatedly calling me a liar when I brought up past events of hurtful things she said/did and denying they ever happened. It makes me feel insane. -I entered university at 16 to do a double major. I am 19 now and on my third year. She was dubious that Id get accepted in, but after I did, she took over my studies and I feel like she thinks my success is entirely dependent on her. She just received her masters (in psychology, no less) so she has experience with how university works, but at this point its beyond basic help and I feel like I have no autonomy over my studies. Ive tried standing up to her multiple times (always politely and very calmly) and she always responds by doing these incredulous smirk chuckles? Its extremely condescending and makes it seem like I just told her to fuck off. Not constructive at all. She has now resorted to telling me what study method works best for me. Not asking, telling me. -she has repeatedly made huge fights over nothing (one time was when I decided to wear a comfortable jacket instead of a leather coat) where she screams at me while I sit and silently cry. No rhyme or reason, it can just happen out the blue. -I have high grades in all of my biology subjects but stats is where I fail at. I have failed one paper before and am repeating it, and because studies are all online (exams included) she is now telling me that i need to have someone on her computer while I do the test on mine so I can send him the hard questions to complete for me. Cheating, essentially. I am very against this but she firmly believes Ill fail otherwise. No faith in my abilities, and its also why she tries to dictate my studies. -She makes derogatory comments about people, their weights, looks or profession unless they do something nice for her. Then theyre cool. She calls a number of construction jobs and other low professions for drop-kicks and drug addicts. I feel insulted for all the good and honest working people working these jobs when she says that. Shes done and said a lot of things but Ill end it there because otherwise itll go on forever. Im happy to give more examples if asked. My qualm lies in that while she has said and done all these things and while I am inherently uncomfortable around her, she equally has a lot of positive attributes and can be so lovely at times. But I feel the negatives are seriously overbearing and its killing me inside. I have extreme anxiety that is only getting worse as well as developing depression. Is this narcissism? How can I deal with this short of moving out? (cant atm, no money though hopefully Ill have something soon. She really doesnt want me to leave so that will be a fight and a half lol.) Ive tried standing up for myself in so many ways and nothing works. Even my father (an absolute hard-ass and not afraid to speak his mind) said nothing got through to her and its why he left."
30,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,How to not feel guilty for doing NC with N parents who have financially supported you?,1,gesu0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/gesu0m/how_to_not_feel_guilty_for_doing_nc_with_n/,2020-05-07 07:18:57,"Last night, I left with my partner to his family home after the last fight with my N parents. Weve been temporarily staying at their place due to COVID19, and have been there for two weeks. During the argument, invalidated all my feelings and everything that Ive said. My N step-dad would yell at me every time I tried to say something, so my partner did most of the talking from my side. They also mocked and taunted me while I was crying my eyes out. Invalidated me when I told them I was hurt but what they said and they responded with things like: stop being so weak, we didnt mean it like that, dont be so negative all the time. Well thats it. We left that night. Never have I down so much vulnerability in front of them to be shot down like that and stomped on. For them to keep yelling at me while Im breaking down, I can take everything else that they do to me but this was the last straw. I want to completely cut them off but I feel guilty. In the past, my N stepdad has given me pocket money from when I was a teen and loaned me a weekly allowance during university. Hes brought these points up a few times for the past two weeks that weve been here. I have been actively paying him back every since Ive been out of uni, however, it is still a large debt which will take many years. Im still going to maintain NC and continue to pay him back, however I cant help feeling guilty that I have used so much of their money growing up. But its like like they ever thought to teach me financial literacy so that I couldve saved my pocket money when I was young since I didnt really need it. And if my stepdad didnt earn above the threshold, I couldve gotten student support during university. I didnt know that all of this would be held against me ever since I came back to live with them."
31,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,After years of excuses Ive realized my mother is an N. This realization hurts a lot and I dont know how to cope,1,gfcv71,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/gfcv71/after_years_of_excuses_ive_realized_my_mother_is/,2020-05-08 05:03:54,"Hello. Long time lurker, first-time poster. Sorry for the long post in advance. Some background: On my mothers side I had an NGrandpa and EGrandma. I had a good relationship with them (I wasnt a GC or SG, I just existed). My aunt was a GC, my mom an SG. I spend a lot of my childhood (from 1-6 yo) living with grandparents and sometimes coming home for weekends because my mom had to work. My father is an alcoholic and was not interested in caring for me at the time. I hated it and always cried and begged my mom to not send me to grandparents. I even tried to give her what few dimes I found saying I have money so she doesnt have to work and I can be home. It didnt work, of course. My older brother stayed home but no one wanted to come there and look after me so I couldnt stay there as well. So every time my mom took me home I felt really grateful and I guess indebted to her. For the longest time, I thought something wasnt right and, inspired by some posts here, I did a thought experiment - what I would see if I wasnt thinking about my life as mine but some other persons. And, well shit. My mom neglected and abused me emotionally. She infantilized me in some ways and parentified in others. She made me dependent on her. I had to fight tooth and nail for every meagre scrap of independence. She made a point to always say how her parents treated and abused her and that she was never going to do the same to her kids. But she did, just in a more covert way. But because she always said how she was the victim, how she was doing her best, how everyone was against her, I sympathized with her. I felt so grateful for all she was doing for me. It didnt matter that I was falling apart mentally at the time. She had to work so hard whole days so I could have food and clothes. I couldnt burden her with anything else. She was my hero. I was going to be a perfect, quiet, obedient child, so her life could be a little bit easier. And I never realized it. I thought we had a good relationship. She was the only person in the world who I could trust. She was nice to me most of the time. She only got angry and passive-aggressive when I disagreed with her. Somehow, I thought that since she had abusive and narc parents she couldnt be one herself. And now I realize that we had such a good relationship because I was bloody scared of her and her disapprovement. And so I always agreed with her and walked on eggshells so she wouldnt get mad. In the few instances I stood up for myself the backlash was awful for me. I was literally afraid that if I stood my ground she would kick me out and Id die in the streets. Most of my sense of safety is tied to her being pleased with me. But this pandemic and all prohibitions and safety measures hit me hard mentally-wise. I wasnt in the best place before and now I was finally put on antidepressants. I never discussed any of my problems with her or anyone else. And since I showed this vulnerability to her over 2 months ago its an ongoing obvious emotional and sometimes verbal abuse. And I just dont have the energy to put up with her bullshit anymore. Im 26 and I live with her (in my house but she cannot legally be made to leave  and I feel guilty even thinking about not wanting to live with her) and Im being attacked by the one person in the world I trusted and thought cared about my wellbeing. I just want to finally live my own life but I feel so trapped. I choose the worst possible moment for a mental breakdown. And half the time Im thinking that I'm just imagining all of this, making things up and its actually my fault she is acting that way because she is old and I should be supporting her through this hard time and yet here I am barely capable of minimal functioning. And now I feel like I had the rug pulled from under my feet because I realized that Im utterly alone with not one person reliable enough to trust or even confide in. Sorry, I needed to get this off my chest. Not sure what I expect from this post, but I guess anything would be nice."

(for context on my family) i'm a 15 year old boy, i live with my dad and stepmum, i have 4 sisters, my 13 year old blood sister, my 15 year old stepsister, my 17 year old half sister (lives with my mum) and my 19 year old stepsister. i'm gonna use [this](URL article as [u/that\_bug\_lady](URL posted it earlier, and it seems like a good example to go off of. i'll go through all twelve points and fit an example for how this is seen, for some there may be nothing to apply. Acceptance is conditional - this fits, i couldn't imagine not following a rule or chore they've set. my 15 year old stepsister i'm gonna refer to as the scapegoat. she often has trouble following rules and being rude and not a day goes by where they don't get immensely pissed or shout at her for not following the rules. the reason one of my sister's left is because she wasn't accepted and i see it happening with my stepsister Submission is required - this fits, they don't have super out there rules, just basic stuff, keep the house clean, do the dishes when it's your day to do them, be polite and respectful, always ask for food, but not much else, but they definitely expect us to follow those rules without question, any questioning about rules they've put in place will be received as disrespect and they'll respond accordingly. Someone must be blamed for problems - oh boy, this fits. the other day is a perfect example. my stepmum bought 6 packets of gum, one for each of us. she unknowingly left one in the bag and cast it aside. she saw there was 5 on the table the next day and lost it, instantly got very pissed, left the house, asked who took it, the scapegoat suggested she could have left it in the bag or it could have fallen, but this was instantly dismissed and got pissed when no one said they took it. when the scapegoat got the bag and found it inside, there was no apology, no recognition that she made a mistake, not even a word. Vulnerability is dangerous - this is also very fitting, they'e held mistakes my sisters have made over their heads for a while now, and is used to justify their suspicions on why the house isn't perfect. not much more to say about this. You must take sides - this one also fits, my ex girlfriend got into an argument with my stepsister, and after that they pressured me into breaking up with her, this is one example. There is never enough love and respect to go around - this one doesn't fit, they give us all a lot of love, even the scapegoat which faces the worst of the problems. Feelings are wrong - due to stuff in the past, i feel that the only emotions that i can show are ""good"" emotions, any ""bad"" emotions i have to repress around them and whenever somebody expresses emotions that aren't ""good"" it pisses them off. Competition rules the day - this doesn't fit, there isn't any co-operation, but there's also no competition, it's each for their own, unless its the parents, then their work falls onto us. Appearance is more important than substance - yep, we can't show ""bad"" emotions when we're all hanging out, they're seen as wrong and taboo, even if we're having an awful day there's this illusion everything is okay Rage is normalised - not much to say about this, we have to take in all of their explosive attitude, i haven't even tried to fight back as i'm scared of what would happen. i've never been subject to abuse in the last few years though. Denial is rampant - yep, they constantly deny any fault on their part, every problem in the house is a problem with us and us not doing our jobs properly, i can't remember the last time i got an apology from them. There is no safety - yes, this fits. i have nothing else to say, but we are all to blame for anything at any time. god this was long, i'm sorry but if you do read this, please could you shed some light on things? i'm so confused and concerned, and each day quarantine becomes harder and harder. they aren't awful though, i've only shown the worst parts here, but they aren't awful, they tell me how much they love me and do seem to care about how i'm doing in the house and if i like it, but i can't tell them i don't like it here. a couple other things i think i should mention that don't seem to be a normal thing for houses: they have cameras in the major rooms of the house they have no respect for privacy have the shortest temper cant and don't try to deal with my sister's autism, any problems she has are seen to them as an excuse for bad behaviour. that's all i have to say."

I didnt realize I had an Nmom until I left to college and then it took many painful years to go NC and begin the healing process. This sub has made me feel less alone, less embarrassed and more dedicated to recovering from a truly painful childhood. So thank you all for your vulnerability and willingness to share. I was NC with my Nmom for nearly 4 years when I met my now husband and became pregnant. I reconnected with her to tell her I was expecting and surprisingly she seemed to be, dare I say, a normal parent. Giddy excitement quickly turned to her same toxic behavior and so I went NC again. However she now has my husbands phone number and uses him to communicate with me. Hes seen her toxic behavior and agrees that she shouldnt really be a part of our lives but says that I should email her from time to time to update her on our family. I dont agree but he comes from such a wonderful and loving family so I understand his perspective. Have any of you been in a similar situation? If so, how do you go about handling it?"

As you can imagine, me getting married was all about her: from screaming at me months before he was proposing about how she didnt think he would ask for her blessing, to when he asked for her blessing, she immediately told me he asked, we said yes, to asking for a picture of the ring from my fianc before the proposal and showing every person we came into contact the photo of it in front of me saying I love seeing you have no control, to not allowing any friends to come dress shopping with me because she wanted to just have it be us two, to inviting herself to my bachelorette party (which ended up being cancelled). Of course she and my Edad insisted on paying so they could say well since WE are paying...(insert ridiculous demand here). I wrote a letter in December recounting all of my abuse from her and asking for space - but reconciling in a family therapy session with her own therapist (who apparently told my mom that she and my dad are her favorite clients - come on therapist!) - so that was effective ::eye roll:: Fast forward to today. We had to cancel our August wedding due to COVID. She has been hysterically crying saying that she is grieving too. I have not expressed my sadness once, but have had to console her daily. She has nothing to live for anymore. She stole the letter I was going to send to our guests and changed the verbiage to make it seem like she and my dad wrote it. Then decided to tell every one of her friends that my fianc and I were going to have a small ceremony and then try for a baby this year with a party in 2022. When I calmly asked her to not share that personal information with others she began screaming that Im being so selfish and Im not the only one grieving here and threatening a relationship with me (a phrase she often uses, which used to scare the sh*t out me). I have made the decision to cease all contact indefinitely and telling her this weekend. I cannot have my future child witness her antics. I am relieved the abuse will stop, but of course grieving the fact that my parents wont be at our wedding or a part of my life and the fact that I never had a loving mom - her love was always conditional. I hate that even though I have done work I rationally know Im right in my boundaries but my body flares up in a trauma response. I wish that would end. Hoping working through this will allow me to be a different type of mom to my children."

BOOM. big mistake. suddenly he does a 180 and uses the vulnerability of me and the situation for a big, metaphorical punch to the face, he will say something horribly outrageous to me or just start to treat me like trash again or criticize my life choices and percieved shortcomings when he feels he's on my ""safe side"" again. this happens consistently with just a few minutes to hours in between. facial expressions mean nothing, you can't trust them or anything he does. you always walk on egg shells. I'd best describe it like he doesn't seem like a human to me. when I was in elementary school I started constantly being grumpy on purpose because I knew it's the only way I would get affection from him. has anyone similar experiences?"

Although it is by no means perfect, i love my present life, and I'm calm and content on most days according to my mindfulness app. Occasionally though, I seem to get into these very difficult, painful arguments with other people that leave me sleep deprived for a day or two. ... All the women in my family have been dominant types, and the truth is I'm not a very dominant woman at all. Most of the time, I'm silly and independent, while preferring to be submissive. Unfortunately, they taught me a very destructive behaviour - to not show vulnerability when i am feeling anxious/sad/vulnerable inside; it was beat into me that showing vulnerability will lead to being crushed. In hindsight, it's a large cognitive distortion of black-and-white thinking and fixation on the negative, laden with fear from past traumas that have little to do with the present day. These early experiences have conditioned me to clam up and cut off my openness to love during these moments. It is like a switch is flipped temporarily. It's a very painful mentality which i've been working on unlearning from. Of course, my solution is to let others know right away that I am feeling anxious/sad/other vulnerable feeling and if a conversation gets tensed, to take some distance from the interaction before saying any thing more. The problem is, I may not always be aware when fallen into that state of mind. How can I let other people help me during these times? What do i let them know before all this even happens? Thanks."
38,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Is it wrong for me to not love my mom? Vent,2,gmpj0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/gmpj0z/is_it_wrong_for_me_to_not_love_my_mom_vent/,2020-05-20 00:23:53,"This is going to be a long rant/vent/ order of events for those who don't mind. I felt like I just had enough with my mom. Growing up, I did not register my mom's emotional abusive behavior when I was younger. I was made excuses and played it off as her being an overprotective mother. As I got older, I realized her behavior was and is stepping over the line and I grew increasingly weary of her due to it. As far I could remember when I was younger. She tried to raise me to live my life as how she wants it. I never went out and was sheltered most of my childhood. I was never allowed to go out, attend birthday parties, or to hang out with friends in general. Whenever I try to ask her for any of the following, she would always say, ""you're going to go missing"", ""you're going to get sexually assaulted"", and etc. If I try to reason with her, she would throw tantrums, insult me, and wish things upon me that a mother should never say to her child. These constant outbursts prevented me from attempting to ask her again. The only time she accepted me to go out was at a friend's pool party, but I had a curfew to be home at 5:00pm. It took weeks of begging and my mom blantly told me that since she let me out once. I should not ask to go out anymore as long as I live under her roof. Another example would be when she accused my dad of cheating. She tried to stop me from using social media as she claimed that it was ""tearing her marriage apart."" If I didn't do something right or up to her standards, she would make me feel like I was stupid and act like I had one chance to do something right. Whenever we got into a fight I would always have to be the first one to apologize even though at times she is wrong or else she will threaten to cut me off financially. This was all when I was 13. Furthermore, when I turned 14, I got into a relationship during that time wasn't healthy for me. I felt alone and my mom always criticizing me for not doing anything with my life despite one of the main reasons was because of her. I had to go to school and straight back home, she expected me to repeat that process until I turned 18 and that's it. I fell into deep depression and leaned towards someone who I thought was my friend. Let's call him P. I found comfort in him as a friend, he gave me what I desperately needed; companionship or so I thought. It was 4 months into my freshman year. Since school and home was the only places I needed to be. I lied to my mom and told her I was staying back for tutoring when I was really going to an abandoned church to explore what's left of it with P. When P and I got there I started opening up to him and realized I had no one to accept me for who I was and expected me to be a certain way to fit their liking; my mom and boyfriend at that time. What I didn't know was P saw that as vulnerability and he sexually assaulted me. I was horrified after and got up and left, he followed me. I want to write everything out, but it's going to get long really fast. I'll extend that one day, but I'll sum it up as best as I can. The school, boyfriend, his parents, my parents got involved. I told my boyfriend, he told his parents, his mom threatened me to tell the school or else she thinks that, ""I asked for it."" The school called my mom and I dealt with hell when I got home. As a naive 14 year old. I thought I was going to have a real conversation with her, but instead she threatened me to send me to a new school and til this day she believes that it was my fault and that if I were to ever be sexually assaulted, it was my fault that I put myself in that situation. For years, I believed that it was my fault bad things happened to me. That broke my heart knowing my own mom didn't comfort me and asked if I was okay instead she blamed me for a situation that was out of my control. I accepted that I was a 14 year old running on high emotion with a lack of emotional and mental support from my mom. Fast forward to beginning of sophomore year. As for my boyfriend, she didn't know who I was seeing at that time didn't make it better for me either. But, I felt like he was the only person I had so I tried convincing my mom even though I knew what her response was going to be. She looked at me and laughed and told me no to going on dates with my boyfriend as she claimed again, ""something is going to happen to you."" I felt defeated so I accepted it and went to my room. I broke down and started crying and had a panic attack for the first time due to what happened in the last year of 2014. My mom came to my room and noticed I was crying. She left and talked smack about me to my dad so loudly so I could hear. She claimed that I had nothing to cry about and I was financially supported by her and how an orphan or a foster kid would accept anything to be in my place and instead I was complaining about my ""unnecessary personal problems."" Her words not mine. For the first time, I contemplated suicide. Junior year, my parents fought constantly and my mom dragged my sister and I into it. How she claimed to be unhappy, how she doesn't truly love us, how she married my dad to get an opportunity in America, but it was as sunshine and rainbows as she expected it to be and that she prefers to be back in her home country. She wished that we were never born, especially taking it out on me and telling me how useless I am. And when I told her she has no right to say that, all she tells me is, ""what it's true."" This was the year I had enough and started rebelling. I stayed out late and joined clubs that I was barred from joining. Although my grades weren't the best. I still maintained a 3.2 GPA with the clubs I joined. So I felt free for once. I also got to finally go out on dates with my boyfriend. I could see my friends. My mom didn't like how my freedom was making me into a rebellious child. So she started an argument with me saying I stayed out too late (I always come home at 10:00pm, if not earlier.) and I have duties at home and to help her. When I asked her what duties, she dodged my question and further tried to dehumanize me and point out my flawed characteristics as a person. She strongly hinted that she matters more so I should stay at home to pay attention to her and help her with anything she needs. Senior year, I was set to graduate highschool. I was a few marks away from failing in Precal, but I was trying my best to maintain my grade. My mom instead of giving the support to help push forward was sad because she wonders why I'm not smart like other kids, how I wasn't an honor grad, and asking questions what I was going to do if I did fail. But turns out in the end, I did pass on my own. My mom had the audacity to say she believed in me this whole time and that I passed because she was praying for me. After that, I graduated and got accepted into a community college. When college hit, I started to use this time to start over and find an opportunity to discover my interests that I didn't have during high school. I pulled away from her and as expected my mom did not like that. She started to complain how I wasn't there for her and that she doesn't matter to me anymore. Her main threats are cutting me off financially and how I'm spending more time with my boyfriend than her. I was mentally drained from her accusations and for her need to keep holding on to me in a toxic manner. I thought about getting a therapist, but since my sister was the first to get a therapist which my parents pay for. There's no room for me to get one and my mom expects me to be the strong one to endure any emotional and mental distress that comes in my direction. I realize now that I don't need to love my mom and force that feeling isn't there. She had several chances to be a mom, but messed it up due to her own selfishness. She thinks that she's entitled to say whatever she wants, but when I say it back she says I'm being disrespectful and that the reason why she could say whatever she wants is because she is an adult and I'm still a child. Overall, I don't think I could ever establish a real relationship with my mom, she still believes everyone is in the wrong especially me and that she's right. At this point it's too late for her to attempt anything. I just see her as an assigned guardian. The fact that she gets sad that I'm not there for her or have the energy to care anymore because of her is beyond me. I do agree that I was wrong at times too, but for my mom as I said before she has several chances to make it right with me. I guess my mom forgot that having a kid takes patience and that there are going to be obstacles."
39,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Raised to feel like an unlovable monster,4,gmq6sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/gmq6sm/raised_to_feel_like_an_unlovable_monster/,2020-05-20 01:00:34,"First time posting here - just want to get things off my chest after spending two months in quarantine with my parents as an almost-30-year-old. I feel alone. My wonderful partner is supportive, but he grew up with loving parents and doesn't *get* *it* in an intuitive, in-the-trenches-with-you way. My father has untreated mental health issues including violent rage, addictive behaviors, and an intermittently warped sense of reality. My mother grew up with a father who physically abused her and a mother who didn't show affection, and she has never really addressed her trauma. She takes her trauma out on other people all while saying she's the victim because of her lifelong history of abuse. She doesn't believe in mental illness (except as a way of criticizing others) and has never sought treatment for depression, anxiety, or PTSD. They both have narcissistic traits and are very bad at emotional vulnerability and honest communication. When I was a child, my father was rarely home and my mother came home from work too exhausted/depressed to spend time with me. My earliest memories are of feeling lonely as I realized that other children had someone to talk to, play with, and care for them. My parents fought frequently, though I didn't realize until I was 12 that the verbal fights included physical violence behind closed doors. My father would leave the house in a huff and my mother would turn to me and tell me it was my fault he left. ""Look what you've done. Now we don't know if he'll ever come back."" Every time it happened, I felt afraid that this time, it would be permanent. And it would be my fault he left us. When my younger siblings were born, I was blamed for everything that went wrong while doing my best to care for them (put them to bed, teach them to read, babysitting and cooking dinner as I got older, etc). My siblings were my joy and my life. They are still my closest friends. Despite the joy I felt with them, I still wasn't happy at home. I argued with my parents frequently. My mom didn't care about my academic achievement or creative endeavors. Her only ""positive"" comments were about my body, which made me squeamish. Eventually, I left for an arts boarding school at 13, thanks to the generosity of my extended family. They didn't know things were bad at home, but they knew I was a ""weird kid"" who would do better among her kind, and they made that happen. I was very depressed throughout childhood and into high school (now I can make it through the day without crying but I'm still on antidepressants). My father was occasionally supportive but was drinking more and more, and when he finally lost his job, it became my turn to support him instead of the other way around. My mother told me to get over my feelings and be more mature. Despite finding suicide notes I wrote as early as five years old, she told me she never worried about me because I wasn't strong enough to commit suicide. I did not date in high school but I made a few close friends and developed a strong sense of identity. I wanted a partner who valued my individuality and freedom. I believed in soulmates. I was willing to wait for the right person. As soon as I got to college, I thought I met that person. We spent every night going for long walks, baring our souls, all that teen love stuff. When we became intimate, he changed. He became violent but he still gave the same affection and compliments and attention. It was so confusing for a 17-year-old. I was afraid of him but I thought I found my person. When I tried dating other people, he would break us up in increasingly bizarre ways. I confess I thought it was romantic and a sign of enduring love. When I saw my father abuse my mother, I missed this occasional lover and went back to him. We even formally dated for a few years, totaling six years of this toxic relationship. Other friendships and relationships splintered in the process. During breaks from this partner and after we split for good, I gained more empathy for my mother. She was cruel, lying, and gaslighting, but she was broken too. She was just trying to survive and make sense of a life of abuse. When she accused me of stealing thousands of dollars from her, I gave up the fight and offered to take out a loan to give her money, at which point she ""realized"" her mistake. Even if things were never truly healed between us, I thought we had reached a comfortable peace. I called her a few times a week just to chat. Even when she only talked about herself, it was comforting in its familiarity. I ""uh huh""ed to her work gossip while making dinner until she talked herself out and said goodnight. It wasn't profound, but it was the closest I had ever had to a family routine with her. And then I went home for the pandemic. I expected to stay a week or two, and ended up in lock down for two months. My mom had many meltdowns that revealed she had not moved on from the feelings of blame I had faced as a child. She told me she believes that I have corrupted my younger siblings (who are both grown-ass adults with opinions and jobs and therapists) into hating her. She thinks I enable my father's abuse of her when I lecture them both on communication strategies. Her memory is shot from a stroke, so she denies entire conversations and experiences and says I am making them up. She accuses me of gaslighting her when I have lived an entire life of her gaslighting me. It is exhausting. I've been LC with her in the past, but I'm too close to my siblings and extended family now for that to be feasible. Instead, I've muted her notifications so at least when I talk to her, it feels like it's on my terms. Thanks to anyone who read this. Knowing that there are people out there who have had similar experiences makes me feel less alone."

I am currently living with my parents again after three years of living a couple of hours away from home in another city. Since I'm back home, I'm constantly clashing with my father and it is really tearing me down. I will start providing some background. Long thread, sorry. My dad didn't have an easy childhood. My grandfather was a really unpleasant man when he was younger (he was always nice to me and has become pretty soft) and used to be really mean to his wife and the children. He basically only liked my dad because he was the oldest son, but even with him he was really harsh and tried to raise him ""like a man"", so they went climbing mountains without wearing any harness and so on. My grandfather himself had been the youngest of 7 children and always was the last to get food (if there was any left) and never got any love from his parents. Growing up during WWII in Central Europe was quite harsh. But yeah, it led to him not showing any love towards my aunts and uncles and most of them have developped a mental illness related to it. My mother on the other side, even though she comes from an even poorer family that was part of a suppressed group during a dictatorship, has had a very loving environment growing up and it really shows. She basically is an angel and the one holding the family together. I was a really sick child and almost died several times when I was very small, but my mother always cared for me in the most perfect way. My father's family is very intelligent, like everyone of them, and he himself went on to become manager at a big international corporation. We didn't become rich in the way of owning properties and stuff like that, but I grew up in a home where everything essential was abundant. We never had financial problems and could go on nice holidays in summer. Growing up I never really saw my dad, as he was working his 70-hour weeks. It was mostly my mum and myself, and sometimes he would join us for dinner. In that sense I don't have many unpleasant memories on him during that time. We didn't do much together either, and apart from a game of pingpong every now and then and the two weeks in summer we never really spent time together. There were some episodes of foreshadowing during my youth though: I once tried to study English with him during my first year of studying English and he called me stupid and didn't have the patience to do it with me, so yeah I never studied with him again. He also always told me which questions to ask his parents when we were visiting my grandparents and when I didn't do it he would always tell me I was being weird and why I didn't want to spend time with my grandparents and why I didn't appreciate them. So yeah, he pretty much made trips to my grandparents a really unpleasant thing for me. Finally, once when we were on holidays together, I was like 15 years old, he just straight up told me that 2/3 of the people who know me don't like me and find me weird. I still don't know where that came from until today, but it really hurt and he never apologised for it and never took it back. Also I should add here that I am very different from my father, but I still believe that most people actually do like me for who I am. But apart from these episodes we had a fairly ok relationship. I never liked when he touched me (not that he really did anyways) but we didn't have problems either. It basically got worse when my dad lost his job right when I was finished with high school. He suddenly was at home all the time and started behaving really weird. He counted every cent on our bills (e.g. when me or my mom went grocery shopping), but went to expensive restaurants himself. He always told me I needed to find a job or an internship (I was doing a gap year and worked during part of it) and often told me I would never become anything if I didn't do something for my CV now. He is a very egoistic person who only looks after himself most of the time and doesn't care much about the needs of my mum or me. Every time one of us has to go to the doctor he rolls his eyes and says we are exaggerating (he himself has literally never been sick in his entire life). Well, I went on doing my undergraduate studies abroad and my parents paid for me. Note that I live in Europe so the tuition fee was practically free, but they paid for a room in an appartment and my basic needs and I'm very thankful for that. I am now finished and living at home again and these past weeks have been really unpleasant. He has also read my bachelor thesis (which got an A) and declined commenting on it as he didn't want to ""disappoint"" me. He now has a job again but never went back to ""normal"" as he was before. He has become more controlling and especially much meaner than before. My mum and me often confront him on this and he never listens. You literally can't have an argument with him because he will either change the topic, blame you for the problem, or play victim. I have never in my life seen him admitting to being wrong or saying sorry for something he did. He has also started lamenting that we don't have a deep bond and blames me for it. Last summer he has brought up the ""people not liking me""-topic again and still insists on it. I personally think the real reason behind that is that I am just not like him. He is an absolute extrovert who basically is a libright, while I'm more of an introvert (although when I'm not around him I'm more outgoing) and more of a leftist and humanities guy. We both have very strong characters and opinions, so we clash often anyways. A couple of days ago we also have installed a new wifi in our apartment. We had the old one for over ten years and it worked really really bad for my mum and me. The new one is working better for us but worse for him. Since three days he doesn't speak to us anymore, only blames us for his internet not working properly and says that we are at fault and that we are stupid etc. In the ten years before he never listened when we complained that our internet was bad and he never cared. Just a couple of more things to add: My dad has come away as quite a shitty person on this thread, but his intentions are not that bad. My mum and me mostly get what we want (our demands are not really exaggerated usually), he gives a lot of money to charity and other family members in need, he worked with refugees when he was unemployed, he usually treats people at restaurants or other facilities really well and tipps them adequately, and all of my friends and most of our family really love him a lot. He is so extroverted,funny, and generous that they all adore him and never understand any of my complaints. It even leads to me questionning my own experience with him and if I'm being too harsh towards him. My mother also claims that he is often sad that him and me don't have a better relationship. But I honestly believe that that is mostly because of his actions, and not mine. It is true that I have become cold towards him, but what am I supposed to do? I don't really know what to do. The field I have studied requires a graduate program to have real job opportunities, and I can't finance that without my parents. They are very willing to pay for it, but I feel bad taking money from him, as it creates a kind of dependence on him. Then again I don't really have another option. I would really like to reconnect with him too, but I don't see that happening. He is still my dad and I subconsciously crave his approval, but I know that I will never get it if I don't become an extrovert capitalist just like him. He still tells me every day that I need to find an internship right now or I will never find a job and be a failure. I have also started visiting my grandparents without my dad and it has been very nice, as I finally got to just be me with them. Finally, this is what bugs me the most. Even when I try, when he is around I can't be the real me. It's like my personality retreats when he is around, to not show any vulnerability. I've heard from many people that I shine up once he's not around. Pretty tricky situation. And of course, if you would show this text to my dad he would genuinely not understand what I'm complaining about, deny all accusations, and say I'm exaggerating and making it up. So yeah, is my father a narcissist?"

I am the scapegoat and even though some of my siblings recognize that our parents have done many harmful things to all of us, they persist in perpetuating a myth that we had good parents. I have been realizing lately that my siblings have some narcissistic traits. I probably do too, something I'm frequently worried about. We grew up in a house where expressing our feelings or revealing any vulnerability was considered wrong so some of our inability to express empathy is ingrained behavior but I often wonder if there are just some really fundamental differences in how we relate to people. Anyway, I am pretty close to three of my siblings but was hurt by some recent behavior. I dont know that talking to them about it frankly will do any good. Most likely will be viewed as me being too sensitive and always getting mad at everyone for very little reason. While I blame myself for most problems and issues that come up in my life, they don't seem to have a lot of self awareness or ability to accept responsibility for their actions. I think I need to lower my expectations for them but I want to continue having a relationship with them. Does anyone have advice about resolving a conflict with siblings in a narcissistic family dynamic?"

I just watched the following video (warning: this was an extreme trigger for me) and it has made me want to seek revenge against my evil demonic NPD father- [URL After being in therapy for about 2 years and with my lifelong suspicions confirmed, I am filled with a rage inside myself so intense I can hardy even contain myself. I am the son of not one but TWO narcissistic parents, with my mother being shy/covert/communal and my father being malignant/grandiose/psychopathic. However this post is going to focus on my father. To say my life has been a fucking train wreck would be an understatement. After I was born I am not entirely sure what kind of dark things happened between the ages of 0-3 years old but I have very deep seated emotional issues that seem related to very early life. Turns out my father was fucking another woman almost immediately after I was born who would later become my first Step-Mother after his first divorce to my mom. I have lived in so many different houses and apartments/condos over the course of my life as we had literally zero stability ever. I'm convinced that my father is literally a demonic entity. He would take pleasure in berating me, hitting me, shouting at me, forcing me to like the same things he did, and worse of all publicly humiliating me (his favorite was in front of my friends). He would also make me get naked in front of him, remove the locks for my door, and punish me in the most painful ways he could. My father would later after marrying my first Step-mother go on to become a very successful business owner, thus proving his grandiosity to himself and worsening his behavior. He would drink so much red wine he could barely even talk. I had two abusive step siblings as well but they were nothing compared to him, and we could literally cower in fear when he got home from work as he would normally explode and yell at all of us, including my step-mom. When he was not throwing a tantrum he was completely emotionally unavailable, but would give me tiny nuggets of praise if I danced like monkey and did everything he wanted me to.He divorced my step-mom later on and I had to tell my friends I was moving into hotel with him, as my step-mom kept the house and I had ignorantly grown comfortable in. I was sad to be alone with him again. This abuse was so relentless for years and for a long time I literally thought I was insane, and began to cope by cutting off my connection to my heart and invalidation all of my own emotions. My emotional and social development was severely stunted because of this. I had strange violent tendencies as a kid and was eventually forced to leave private school in 4th grade. Of course, my father attributed this to me actually being a special needs child. He homeschooled me briefly (which was an excuse for him to make me feel stupid) and later forced me to attend a school for special needs kids. He even lended me out to people as a case study for their books and studies, an example of a terrible misbehaved child. I remember being forced to talk in front of a huge crowd of people once with an author who specialized in ""fixing"" bad children. Again, he fed on my humiliation like a vampire. I went on to have an extremely tough time after I transferred to public middleschool and highschool. My self hatred must have been so obvious to other people, and I had terribly low confidence. It was hard to make friends, and the friends I did attract were usually narcissists who treated me like shit. Guess it felt familiar. I felt like I was the ugliest human being on the planet, and hated looking at myself. I wondered why everyone else seemed so normal, had natural romantic relationships and friendships. I felt so undeserving of love. My father convinced me I was not talented at anything and a loser, so I never pursued the sports I wanted to play or stuck with anything. He was very unathletic himself, so he emphasized good grades, which he could then compare to his own and make me feel stupid. He told me I couldn't hang out with certain friends, while encouraging me to spend time with narcissistic friends who put me down. Again, my dying spirit seemed to make him so happy. When I moved away from home for college it was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I had a chance to breathe, and had a much more fulfilling life with friends and my first romantic relationships. I joined a fraternity and somehow probably seemed normal to other people for the first time in my life. Little did I know I could fool others but couldn't hide from myself. I would drink myself into violent rages (later found out I'm allergic to alcohol) and do such dangerous things that I really shouldn't even be alive today. I blacked out by myself and fell asleep on the ground of random parking lot, I got into fights with other kids, went to detox, had to have my head stapled shut after being punched and hitting my head on concrete, I broke my arm, and I would ruin relationships with others with my actions and words. I'm crying just writing this as I did not want to do any of those things or be that person, its like I was trying to commit suicide without actually doing it. When my grades in school tanked, my parents were helping me pay tuition. And despite being 1 year away from graduating and begging both my father and mother to let me stay, my father cut me off and was going to let me fail out of school. The only reason I stayed was because my mother stepped in to help me financially, which I'm sure was a power play and trump card to use against me later in life (which she did). I never forgot that my father betrayed me like this, and basically gave up on me. Of course now I realize that he had delighted in every bit of my suffering since the day I was born and this was no different. A chance for him to ""outshine"" me since he graduated, and feed on my pain. Since graduation I have had a long and volatile battle with severe suicidal thoughts, self harm, depression, anxiety, loss of self, and difficult interpersonal relationships. I moved home after (I was out of state) and my father forced me to live with him so he could continue to emotionally abuse me. He would bring home numerous random women to our house and fuck them on the couch in our living room, and I would sometimes come home and it would make me feel sick and uncomfortable. I even had a God Father who was one of the most genuinely great guys I've ever met who tragically died of cancer. He was also my fathers best friend for most of his life. After my God Father died my father started having sex with his wife. My favorite thing in the world was when he would be away on business, and I had the whole house to myself. He would make soooo much noise whenever he was home, and would walk so loudly up the stairs and it became almost a trigger for me. When he was gone the silence was beautiful, and I loved every second of it. I learned to love to be alone, and that no one would ever be there for me. Also due to my fathers material wealth he would make fun of me for being a ""spoiled brat"" and ""entitled"", and yet when I was a kid he would withhold everything he possibly could from me, while buying himself $200K cars and just about any unnecessary thing he wanted and parading it in front of me. Teaching me I was cheap, and deserve cheap thing while he deserves the best in life. I somehow managed to hold down a few jobs (this is still hard for me) and get my own place away from my father but still in the same city. I then found a therapist who has taught me more about vulnerability and empathy then anyone I've ever met, and I am eternally blessed to have met this man. He exposed both of my parents for what they were, and I have never in my whole life felt such a moment of complete clarity. It all makes sense now. When I watch the video I posted at the beginning, it all makes sense. Until this moment I thought I was the root of most of my problems, and that my relationship with my father was ""rocky"" which is totally normal (LOL!). I cut him off and went completely no contact shortly after. It has now been 1 year since I spoke to him, and I am learning to love myself and feel better everyday. I've experienced good and supportive friendships, and even had girlfriends who were extremely supportive which has shown me that not all relationships are fake, transactional, and hurtful. However, my father also got married to my now second Step-Mom around a year before I ceased contact with him. She was a windowed shortly before my father met her, and seems like a genuinely good person. She also has two kids (my step-siblings) who seem nice too. And this is where a whole new set of problems has began. None of them know why I am no contact with my father even though I have made hints to my Step-Mother, but she is being heavily gaslighted and converted into a flying monkey, along with both of my step siblings (the son even works for my fathers company, which he was pressured into shortly after he graduated from school). My father has made them believe that I am some kind of unstable person who's acting out of immaturity, of course conveniently hiding the fact that he is the single most fucking evil and demented human being I have ever personally met. He has lived a double life for so many years, betraying people and friends, and surrounding himself with ""yes man"" flying monkeys who either work for him or who are subject to some kind of leverage from him. And yet he always seems to get away with it, and nothing catches up with him. The way he can start a new life over and over again, gaslight everyone, lie his ass off, never confront the reality he is a terrible person, and nobody is the wiser. Other people in my immediate family completely enable him, buying into his grandiose persona and pretending nothing is happening. It makes me fucking sick to my stomach. He is also a functional alcoholic who was successfully able to project this onto me due to my drinking issues (I've since quit) making sure to tell everyone about me going to rehab and making a scene at restaurants when the waiter asks if I want a drink (he will jump in and say ""nonono, my son actually can't handle alcohol, he will just have water""). So basically everyone in my family either thinks I'm crazy or just pretends none of this is real, like I'm a drama king or something. This has been so difficult for me I can hardly take it. No one even remotely understands and it makes me want to cut all of my family on his side out of my life. And because of this, I now have no contact with my new Step-Mother of step siblings which is becoming increasingly awkward. I don't attend Christmas or family gatherings because of this, and there is no real way for me to explain this to them, much less the rest of my family I've known my whole life. I also resent the fact that I have to explain this stuff to anyone, like if I don't explain everything in a compelling enough way people just brush it off like its nothing. ""We get it, you had a tough childhood. Just move on, its time to get over it"" or something to that affect. Like HOLY FUCKING SHIT I CAN'T EVEN TAKE THIS. So basically, my father has gotten away with having zero accountability for anything he did and is now enabled by both my family and step family to keep doing the same thing. I'm sure he bad mouths me to no end behind my back too. Now here is where I need help, I know the best revenge is to live a good life and I completely agree with this sentiment. I'm on an upward trajectory and doing things I never thought were possible, and still relatively young. I have hope and love in my life for the first time in a long time. However, I am now very physically strong and almost need to resist the urge to go over to my father house and literally beat the living shit out of him. Like break every single bone in his face and spit on his broken body. I know I could go to prison to jail so I won't do something like this, but I can't help but think about it sometimes. I wonder if it would be reckless to share a post like this to my new Step-Mother and end his current marriage? Assuming she isn't ok with being married to a serial cheating narcissistic psychopath with a track record of around 40 years and who feeds on pain and suffering, and will lie and say anything to get what he wants. Part of me wants to see him destroyed, I know he will pay for his crimes dearly at some point but the lack of justice in his life is just crazy to me. And I feel bad for my current Step-Mother who is the perfect pray for him, she is naive, just watched her previous husband pass away tragically, and will most likely be the newest target of his abuse. He has love bombed her and bought her diamonds and nice things, and will slowly reveal himself to be the demon that he is over time like he does with everyone else. He will most likely seek revenge against me if I tell her all of this, but I am not afraid of him. Would this be a dumb idea? Should I just move on with my life and never talk to him again? I could live with either of these outcomes but I can't help but feel entitled to revenge against the person who tried to destroy my entire life just to feed his own ego and not feel like the worthless piece of shit that he is. Sorry for the long post I kinda just vomited all of this out but if anyone made it through I sincerely appreciate you and any advice you have. Writing this has been like therapy for me. **TLDR: Father is the biggest scumbag on planet earth and I have a nuclear bombshell of information I could use against him to get revenge. Is this ever worth it? Should I just move on and have an awesome life now that I'm free?** Thank you all, much love, and stay safe out there!"

I just watched the following video (warning: this was an extreme trigger for me) and it has made me want to expose my evil demonic NPD father- [URL After being in therapy for about 2 years and with my lifelong suspicions confirmed, I am filled with a rage inside myself so intense I can hardy even contain myself. I am the son of not one but TWO narcissistic parents, with my mother being shy/covert/communal and my father being malignant/grandiose/psychopathic. However this post is going to focus on my father. To say my life has been a fucking train wreck would be an understatement. After I was born I am not entirely sure what kind of dark things happened between the ages of 0-3 years old but I have very deep seated emotional issues that seem related to very early life. Turns out my father was fucking another woman almost immediately after I was born who would later become my first Step-Mother after his first divorce to my mom. I have lived in so many different houses and apartments/condos over the course of my life as we had literally zero stability ever. I'm convinced that my father is literally a demonic entity. He would take pleasure in berating me, hitting me, shouting at me, forcing me to like the same things he did, and worse of all publicly humiliating me (his favorite was in front of my friends). He would also make me get naked in front of him, remove the locks for my door, and punish me in the most painful ways he could. My father would later after marrying my first Step-mother go on to become a very successful business owner, thus proving his grandiosity to himself and worsening his behavior. He would drink so much red wine he could barely even talk. I had two abusive step siblings as well but they were nothing compared to him, and we could literally cower in fear when he got home from work as he would normally explode and yell at all of us, including my step-mom. When he was not throwing a tantrum he was completely emotionally unavailable, but would give me tiny nuggets of praise if I danced like monkey and did everything he wanted me to.He divorced my step-mom later on and I had to tell my friends I was moving into hotel with him, as my step-mom kept the house and I had ignorantly grown comfortable in. I was sad to be alone with him again. This abuse was so relentless for years and for a long time I literally thought I was insane, and began to cope by cutting off my connection to my heart and invalidation all of my own emotions. My emotional and social development was severely stunted because of this. I had strange violent tendencies as a kid and was eventually forced to leave private school in 4th grade. Of course, my father attributed this to me actually being a special needs child. He homeschooled me briefly (which was an excuse for him to make me feel stupid) and later forced me to attend a school for special needs kids.

Ive just been too hesitant and scared of judgment. Im also only 90% sure she did this, the other 10% is from me not believing anyone could actually fucking do something like this. But, as crazy and messed up as it sounds, its the only logical explanation to what had been happening to me throughout the years I was living with her. Ill explain everything a little better eventually. This is also the thing I mentioned in my very first post that I was wanting to talk about. &amp;#x200B; Im not even sure where to begin. I guess I can start off by introducing myself and giving a \*little\* background since I know not everyone on here has read my previous posts. &amp;#x200B; Im a 26 year old female from Kansas. I had finally been able to move out of my parents house for the very first time on January 1st of last year. Although I wasnt living on my own and was living with my brother, I still saw it as a very positive step in the right direction. It gave me the boost I needed and allowed me some much needed fresh air away from my abusive Nstepmom. &amp;#x200B; My Nstepmom came into my familys life when I was 12, but it wasnt official until I was 13. My dad had been secretively talking to my Nstepmom (obviously not my stepmom at the time, she was still unknown to me and my brothers during this time) online/or over the phoneIm still confused on how they truly met, because they were never straightforward with that at allfor about eight months before my dad ever brought her up for the first time. Im fairly certain she preyed on him, his vulnerability, and what Im assuming was his obvious expressed \*dislike(?)\* towards me. I know she saw him as an easy target and an added bonus was her ability to feed off of his dislike towards me. Anyways, my dad never ever mentioned my stepmom until one summer, he said he wanted to go to a certain state for vacation. My brothers and I were excited to go there, because it is a beautiful state with lots of fun attractions. After about ten or so minutes, he finally mentioned the true intentions of why we were going to this certain state; which was for him, my brothers, and I to meet my stepmom. We were obviously a little confused, but also excited because we had been wanting a mother-figure in our lives for a while. &amp;#x200B; Life with her started out pretty normal during our back and forth visits throughout a year and a half. She treated my siblings and I with respect and a Great willingness to want to get to know us and be close to us. &amp;#x200B; My dad eventually proposed to her when I was 14, and they were married within a few months, in June. They had their wedding in my stepmoms state, it was very beautiful to be honest. We stayed a little longer for this visit so we could help her and her daughter pack since they were moving in with us in our home back in Kansas. She was living with her parents at that point, while my dad already had bought a house of his own. So moving in with us was the most logical option. It does feel like my dad only moved us into this new house (a few months prior to us knowing about my stepmom) \*because\* of her. But thats something I will probably never know for certain unless I ask him, which I dont think I ever will. &amp;#x200B; After they moved in with us, my Nstepmom started to treat me differently. It started off with her ignoring me and being very controlling with what I could and could not do. It escalated when I got a boyfriend, and she started calling me a slut, whore, every nasty name you could think of. I eventually could not do anything or go anywhere without her forcing my dad to do her dirty work and call the cops on me for simply \*hanging out with my friends, my cousin, or my boyfriend.\* So I just stayed in my room. Cue the, youre a worthless, lazy piece of shit remarks she would toss my way. &amp;#x200B; She really broke me. I cant even remember a time where I enjoyed life after she came into it. She forced me into counseling because \*she\* thought something was wrong with \*me.\* She kept talking about how slutty and promiscuous I was when I was just a damn child. She really did not like that guys were into me and attracted to me. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; She was also very food abusiveI was never allowed to eat anything she made for the rest of the family, unless I was told otherwise that I could have the leftovers. She would always write do not eat this, get a job and buy your own damn food!!, eat this on pieces of tape that she stuck onto different food items. A lot of days I would just not eat, even at school, because I felt so shitty. She and my family just knowingly watched me starve and did nothing. &amp;#x200B; I was eventually allowed to eat more foods, but only the things that were marked as such (I think I was about 16 or 17 at this time.) This is when I started noticing changes in my body. I was gaining weight in a pretty small time frame. I just chalked it up to me finally getting some proper nutrition in my body, and thought nothing of it. Throughout the year I started noticing more changes in my body: &amp;#x200B; \- I had developed pretty bad body odor, although not too bad at this point; but it would not go away no matter how much I scrubbed or how many showers I took. Again, I made up excuses for why it was happening. Its pretty embarrassing to go into detail about this, but Im a female, so Im sure you can figure out what Im talking about. But this change is the one I want to highlight the most. &amp;#x200B; \- I gained about 30 or so pounds, weighing in at 138 pounds from what I remember. &amp;#x200B; \- my heart rate was fairly high no matter if I was sitting and doing nothing. My aerobics teacher and the school nurse showed concern over this, but never did anything about it or gave me advice on what I should do. &amp;#x200B; \- it was hard for me to catch my breath or unable to satisfyingly take deep breaths at times. &amp;#x200B; \- I would sweat pretty easily. &amp;#x200B; Im sure there were more, but I cant think of anything that raised any concern for me during that time. But all of these changes were consistent up until I moved out and finally got away from my Nstepmom. Besides the body odor one. Looking back at everything when I was putting all of these pieces together at the beginning of last year, I remember there were times where I did not smell bad at all and had no bad body odor. They were the times where my Nstepmom went to her home state for her two week visits. Within a week, every single time, I wouldnt notice a smell. At the time I didnt think anything of it, because the thought of it being because of \*her\* never crossed my mind. I just shrugged it off every time. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward to when I was able to finally move out. The awful body odor started to fade within the first couple of weeks of me moving out. Its the very first change that I had. I couldnt believe it and was so excited and relieved. All that was normal to me was that smell. I didnt want to get too excited, because from past experiences, I knew it would eventually come back. So I waited a month. Nothing. Waited another month. Still nothing. Within those few months I noticed I was losing weight without really changing any foods in my diet or changing my workout routine (at that point I weighed 226 pounds, the heaviest I had ever been in my life and the time where I thought I was doing something wrong.) I lost about 20 pounds within a span of a month and a half without doing anything special. Then the weight just kept dropping, so I decided to start doing some extra workouts with the added confidence I was gaining. &amp;#x200B; The odor stayed away. I was at a healthy weight for once in about seven years. I could finally breath normally, I never sweat as much as I used to; but Im not sure if those two things have any relevancy or if they only went away because I lost weight. &amp;#x200B; I was feeling pretty good about myself. Then it all just hit me. All those times my Nstepmom was gone and I didnt notice the smell. All this sudden weight loss for no apparent reason. I tried thinking of why this was happening and if it had anything to do with my Nstepmom. The only thing I could think of was that she was unknowingly putting something in my food that she \*allowed\* me to eat. How else can this all be explained? If anyone else can think of an alternative explanation, then I would honestly love to know, because Ive been so torn over this for a while now. Is someone really capable of doing that to someone? \*What\* could she have possibly been giving me? Am I just crazy? &amp;#x200B; She has been trying to give me random foods now because she has so much of these at her house: strawberries, peeled oranges, yogurt, applesauce, stuff like that. Ive accepted them but would always throw them away. I did, however, keep the strawberries she just gave me last week. &amp;#x200B; \*\*I guess a little off-topic:\*\* &amp;#x200B; Im not sure who has read my previous posts. But theres some extra information in there about my life if anyone is interested in reading it. I did successfully get my State ID and I also finally got my social security card last week, which took about a month to get because of the whole virus and SS offices shutting down so I had to mail in the required documents. I moved into my new apartment at the beginning of this month and it has been such an amazing experience so far. The freedom is something I have been craving and needing for so long. My dad has paid for my rent for this month with the agreement that I pay him back eventually. I have an interview at McDonalds tomorrow, hopefully it goes smoothly and I get hired, because I tried putting in applications everywhere else with no luck. Im extremely nervous about it, but I keep telling myself that its only 30 minutes of my time, then its over. &amp;#x200B; My life is officially starting to turn around and I couldnt be more grateful and happy. Itll still take me some time to get used to everything, and I know I eventually need to see someone professionally about my traumas because I have honestly never openly talked about any of this to anyone in real life. &amp;#x200B; Thank you to whoever reads this far, and thank you so so so much to everyone who was there through my last posts and showed an amazing amount of support. It means a great deal to me. I know it seems like this turn-around happened within a few months, but trust me when I say that this has taken me YEARS to get to where I am currently at in life. I hope everyone is doing well during this time. Im always open to talking to anyone about anything, so dont be afraid to reach out."

My mother and my father got divorced when I was 5, and it just was a hell hole for a lack of words. Me and my sister started taking care of the house together when we were 8, where she would sit and watch MTV while I would sweep, mop, vaccuum, do laundry, do dishes, mow, weed the garden, lay out dinner, clean me and my sisters room, wipe down walls, ect. You catch my drift. If everything wasnt done by the time my mom came home, I could expect to be screamed at and possibly hit. I remember once, after me cleaning me and my sisters room three days in a row, with only needing to vaccuum and put the clothes away, her destroying my room and then beating me and my sister with a flip flop- after her hand started to hurt. It only got worse after she married my step dad, who was a junkie, and I would often only have dinner because he would take my lunch money (really, any money laying around the house. I fundraised for band and 200 dollars were gone, constantly stole out of my sisters wallet.) I was also bullied all throughout elementary and middle school, because I was the T A L L girl (I was 56 by fourth grade), who had a speech impediment but was also very smart. I even had a teacher and my speech therapist bully me. Every time I tried to talk to my mom, she would be blank face, smoking a cig, drinking coffee, watching NCIS/Law and order/(insert any other crime show). She says that she handled it everytime I talked about it, but it took the teacher that was bullying me to call my mom to apologize for bullying me for anything to happen. My mother also makes everything about herself. After her and my step dad broke up, while I was home, she was allowed to cry, my sister was allowed to cry, but after we moved all of our stuff out of my childhood home, when I finally cried, I got told to suck it up. After I was raped, and finally told my mom, all she said was so was I, after I had to watch my stepdad drown the litter of kittens that was born under my bed and I helped take care of, and then him take my cat tho throw out the window of a car, she told me to get over it, its just a cat. I was never allowed to show any emotion, or else I was yelled at, which caused me to have extreme issues showing any type of vulnerability in my life. But she acts like the perfect mother around everyone else. No one gets it. I cant even do school work around her without being screamed at."

I finally decided to open up to my mother about how I had been crying 24/7 for months and was all alone and depressed, and how my cousin's death worsened this. Her response: ""You probably pushed everyone away by talking about [cousin] too much. People don't want to be around that. You're gonna have to move on. You really do talk about him too much."" My cousin had died literally just a few days before this conversation happened. I had been depressed for months prior to his death. And to be clear, I wasn't talking about my cousin a lot to anyone, even people in my family, despite the fact that he was my only close friend outside of the internet, and he and I both struggled with depression. I had already learned that my mother wasn't to be trusted with information on my emotions and mental state. Big mistake, opening up to her. I just really hoped things would've been different that time due to the severity of the matter at hand. The same woman that would ransack my room to find my drawings and diaries then bring them to my school to show them and ask them if anything felt ""off"" to them in the way it did to her. Of course she'd not empathize or understand that a pre-existing depressive period was exacerbated by the death of my best friend, then tried blaming my discontent and lack of friends on my grief. I still think about this instance regarding my cousin a lot even though she's done and said far worse. I was quiet all the time and barely spoke and would cry alone in my room all the time, trying to spare everyone around me of having to deal with my grief, and even when trying to keep all of this to myself I was still too annoying, too emotional, too sensitive, just simply too much for her. I absolutely cannot trust this woman with anything and I grew up with 0 privacy or agency so I learned to never speak to her unless spoken to. I just thank God I'm not completely closed off as an adult, and that I've retained my warmth from childhood, but I don't show my warmth to her since she only takes advantage of the vulnerability to fuel her projections and feed her ego. It's just very funny that the parents who make you feel bad every time you're open the entire time you're growing up complain when you eventually learn to be cold towards them, and then they think you're evil because they assume you're like this to everyone and they've done nothing to deserve the detachment."

I work as a unionized grocery store cashier full time. I wanted to state clearly that my store management and coworkers have been 100% amazing during my employment. I am paid competitively for the industry, I have insurance and some paid sick time available plus guaranteed additional leave if I get COVID-19. My store provides cleaning chemicals and hand washing instructions as well as other directives and I have been following these 100%. I wash my hands before leaving the building and also once I enter my home. I stay in my room at home most of the time. I use the kitchen and bathroom obviously to cook. The issue is with my landlady only. I have lived in this place for *21 DAYS*. The last half of March and all of April was prepaid by me in February before move in, when I signed a month to month lease. Heres the thing: she seems pathologically narcissistic and maybe even psychotic. She has openly confronted me because she said I left a skid mark in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement. She also has a habit of trapping me in long winded conversations about the virus but also just about everything... I grew up with a narcissistic parent and it is EXACTLY like that. Just a trapped audience. She will run out and start a conversation with me on sight and it is all about her, her needs, her thoughts. She has even sat in the common area staring at me, waiting for me to exit my room and then greet me. She doesnt care that I worked 8 hours on my feet and dont have energy for conversation. I put some boundaries down, saying in writing politely that Ill wear headphones and thats a signal that Im too tired to talk. This was initially respected but then I sent another email saying I want to just pass each other without speech during this stressful time since Im working full time and sometimes above, because she was still talking at me every five seconds. She then sent me a long letter asking me to move out: Notice how many emotional abuse incidents, gaslighting and word twisting occurs, claiming that I dont care about her and belittling me: Hi [wpb_mod], I'm glad to hear that the noise level in the mornings has not been a problem for you. Although you are not concerned about it, I'm giving serious consideration to a policy of 6 feet separation in the condo, as much as reasonably possible. [Other housemate] has been pretty much doing that, and I'm starting to think that's probably a good idea. You and she are both working in frontline situations, and I'm at a vulnerable age. You say you are practicing recommended hygiene, but this morning I noticed that you used the toilet and then did not wash your hands afterwards. So please be more mindful about that. I've also noticed that I sometimes have to wipe off the refrigerator handle when you have touched it with food on your hands. I don't mind doing a little of that, but again, please be more mindful. Don't worry, I will not be attempting to start any more conversations with you when we pass in the condo. Yes, it is a small shared space, which you knew when you decided you wanted to live here. I'm truly sorry that this living situation does not appear to be working out as well as either of us had hoped. We must consider our options. I feel that you should probably begin looking for an alternative place to live as soon as possible. I'm not giving you official notice today, but if our (email) communications and living habits don't manage to become more compatible very soon, I will give you formal written notice later in the month. According to our rental agreement, either of us can give notice by the 10th of the month. Of course, I would want to give you enough time to find another place. It's the 8th today, so there are still a couple of days left for both of us to decide about giving notice right away, with perhaps an extension of extra time to make the transition, if necessary. If you want to discuss any of this, let me know, and we can arrange a time for that. Maybe a conversation would help? Otherwise, we'll see how it goes. I don't think either of us has the time/energy to engage in a lot of emails back and forth. It may look to you like I have endless time on my hands, but that's really not the case. Please give careful consideration to the option of finding a new place where it would be easier for you to get the space you need. Please acknowledge that you have received and read this email. Thank you, [Landlord] What should I do here? I replied this: Hi [Landlord], I can follow any policy or guideline you set forth. I will wash my hands and wipe down surfaces always. I do care about your health and vulnerability. As much social distancing from each other as possible within the condo sounds like what you are wanting. I want to stay in the condo and I do not have an intention to be in conflict with you. Please text me if there is any area I have left dirty and I will come to clean it right away. Thank you, [wpb_mod] Im waiting to see if I will be served with formal notice. If I am, I am going to let her take me to court or see if she tries an illegal eviction. My understanding is that WA does not allow video recordings or I would record her and/or set up surveillance in my room. Unfortunately she has also become preoccupied with the idea that she needs to open all the windows and asked permission to enter my personal room to open my window. I said no to this. She continues to press with it. Unfortunately despite that my pay for my job is competitive, I simply cannot easily afford to move out to a more expensive place because I have a lot of medical and supplies bills to deal with from a chronic condition. I also cannot drive and have no car. Any advice welcomed. Thanks ."

She encourages me to try to take certain steps to improve my communication with my parent who Im convinced is a covert or moderate narc if there is such a thing. Her advice is great for dealing with normal people, and I use it for dealing with my other relationships. But they revolve around allowing vulnerability and it just does not feel safe or productive at all with someone who just wants to be in control of everything. I assume that first: a therapist is naturally wary of any patient who wants to diagnose their family members with issues because I dont have a psych degree and she probably sees me as biased And second, not all therapists have a background in narcissism or narcissistic abuse My non narc parent has the same problem with the marriage counselor they see with my narc parent. But obviously cant come out and say I think my spouse has NPD Super frustrating.

When i lose my cool he loves that and keeps mocking me. I love my mum and she does support me but it hurts when i have to beg for her to help. She took so much abuse from my dad and brothers. She keeps forgiving. But if they never change or apologise, why should i forgive? At least 2 of my other brothers understand and aren't abusive. Still they just tell me to ignore this stuff but it's so hard when you have to live with it and you get hurt constantly. I feel alone. There has also been violence and what i learned is called covert incest situations where he slapped my butt even after sternly telling him to stop, sitting on me when i was laying on the couch, shit like that. I, the idiot, over the years hoped to somehow salvage the relationship and would forgive and be a supportive sister and move on, but he remains the same. What bugs me most is he is not always like that. It's like a switch flips. He has helped me get a car, drove me to school, bought me gifts, at times supported me. It's like it's not the same person.

My entire life, as my OCD developed, I was terrified that Id be an abuser. That Id be as narcissistic as him. That Id intimidate and hurt my pets and significant other and children. That power and control would overcome love and vulnerability. But now that Im a pet owner, I know for sure that I am not like him and that my own fear of being abusive was part of his gaslighting and abuse.

I am 19 now so that should tell you how long it been. I actually heard about this Reddit through youtube on r /slash. I talked to my best friend about it and she thought I should post here and give my full story as this was a group of people who may go through something similar and be able to help me better. She had to emphasize the full story as I tend to give different parts to different people out of fear of being left vulnerable however since this is pretty anonymous there is no vulnerability so Ill try to give the full story. First of all, there is full detail you might want to know beforehand. 1 I can remember things from really far back because of the abuse I went through. 2 I was raised in the Orlando Florida region so things are a bit closer together. 3 I am 19 years old now so Some of the older details are not so finely detailed. When I was only a week or so old my biological dad left me and my mom and for several years my mom had many boyfriends including one who I still speak to who was perhaps my favorite out of all of them. eventually, when I was 2 years old my mother found one who became stepdad(SD) and things were fine until I turned 4. When I turned 4 I was bullied by the teacher's kid and the teacher ignored it at the daycare/preschool. After a few weeks of telling the teacher and the teacher just laughing in my face, I broke my kindness and punched the kid before blacking out. This would be the first of many blackouts I would experience. When I got home My mother sat me down and talked to me with SD standing in the door frame but neither of them wanted to listen to how it had been happening for so long and that the teacher had done nothing because why wouldn't she do her job. I was grounded for a week and treated like a criminal. I was later told when I was in High school that I had sent both the teacher and kid to the hospital with the teacher having a broken arm and the kid having a broken nose and fractured leg and apparently I had also broken a plecky glass window aka bulletproof. This I am told happened constantly until I was kicked out of every daycare/preschool in 3 counties. All I remember is bits and pieces of bullying and wishing that someone would listen to me and just be a friend as I also didn't make any friends with any of the kids. When I was halfway to my 6th birthday(5.5yrs old) My mother finally found a school which could handle me and well I finally found a school where I could be myself. In this school, everyone had mental issues and I had been this point been diagnosed with Adhd which they were reviewing as possibly bipolar(spoiler: it was bipolar). I had speech impediments and so did not like to talk. I never cried because my family made fun of me every time they found me crying and called me a girl and saying I was weak. I didn't make friends and instead, I took to books and isolation. when the class was out at recess I could be found in the quiet corner reading a book on science/history or with a bunch of paper trying to solve harder math problems. I enjoyed reading as it was a place i could escape to a place where I could be free and stronger/smarter/better than what I was. I was still bullied and got into fights pretty much twice a week and I would blackout in all of them. every time I had to go home and tell them I had been in a fight they would spank me till he hurt to sit and sometimes till they drew blood. They used anything from a rhinestone belt to a metal spatula to a wooden spoon. Sometimes they would come into my room even and break some of my stuff. If I received any birthday money they took most of it and if anything they would give me $20. (I counted it as I was given it and one year I had $110 but my parents only gave me $10). I also received $50 from my uncle on Christmas and they would take it claiming it was the cost for them putting up with me. This continued for several years and in 3rd grade, we took the IQ test at our school where I found out later I had scored 156. It was also around this time do to all the science books to learn bits of greek and latin. The same year our school had standardised tests which I had the highest scores on in the whole school which went from prek to 7th grade. I was super proud and rushed home to tell my parents as I wanted them to be proud of me but instead they shushed me as I had a baby sister at this point and it seemed like they never wanted to see me since she had been born and my little sister was 2 yrs old now but Still soaked up their attention. I remember crumbling up the paper from the school which said how I had done so well and through it against the wall before running to my room and collapsing on my bed crying feeling like I was nothing but a waste of space. about an hour and a half later SD came by and asked if I was crying to which I wiped my face off and said no. He frowned and went into his room where my sister and mother(M) where. The only thing that made me happy was on the weekends when I went to MIMI(MM) who was my moms original boyfriend's mom. To me she was my grandmother and when I visited her I always wanted to see her son who to me was like an uncle if not a father possibly. When I was in 1st grade my M took me to see my Biological dad and all I remember of the trip is pretty much everything and how I hated the trip and wished we had never gone as all my mother could see when she looked at me afterward was my father and her hatred of him and that I was broken and needed to be fixed. As a result I was heavily medicated to the point that my teachers thought I seemed to be a zombie as I was not emotional like the other kids but instead I was more reserved and sluggish. In 4th grade, I had a few bad teachers again who made my life hell by telling me that I was stupid and didn't know anything. I also became the best artist at my school with my skills being good enough to enter the competition at the middle school level and win. My M and SD still paid me no attention and were instead focused on moving houses where they gave half of my stuff to my sister including my tv which was a birthday present from only 6 months prior(my sister broke it 2 months later). When my sister got the items she broke them each in turn and every time she would blame me to which my parents were both happy to blame me and beat me around the house. In 5th grade, My school was closed and in 6th grade, they moved all of us to a high school for kids like us so you had 6th through 12th grade all on one campus and I was quick to have good enough behavior to get out and go to a normal school. When I got to a normal school I made a single friend but even then I only talked to him once a week for lunch which was half an hour long. During middle school and high school, my mother and I became further estranged along with my SD as I in 6th grade finally blew up at home at them both. For years I was the one they beat, never listened to, never let go outside, always made very hurtful jokes about, etc so I finally blew up at them and screamed ""why do you hate me?"" they both laughed at me and told me they loved me just as much as my sister and that it all was in my head. I a week later attempted to run away the first time tempted at the idea of freedom and I will be honest I thought we might meet ""bad"" people and could die but I didn't care as even death seemed better than what I got from my family. I was caught about 5 miles away and sent back home to which my parents both said I should have told them how I felt to which my only thought was ""Would you listen?"". My mother since then Had me clean the house inch by inch with a scrub brush everyday every summer, weekend, spring break, winter etc. I would wake up at 8am and clean until 10pm and If I even made eye contact I would get beat and if I told anyone I would be beaten. I remember one time My SD literally grabbed me by the head and bashed me sideways into the door several times until my mother told him to stop. It was around the time I turned 14 that my mother got me my first job at her work where she could watch me. It was also around this time that my sister was going to friends houses and my mother stopped allowing me to talk to anyone else in the family including MM who was the only person in the family I cared about at the time. A few weeks later I asked my mother when we got paid when she handed me a $20 and said that was my pay. I did the simple math in my head and told her I should get more than that but she waived me off and told me to be grateful as the rest of the money was her fee for room and board and that she could tally on meals, transportation clothes(provided by relatives) school supplies, and cleaning supplies. I told her it was not fair and she told me to shut up before stating that children should be seen not heard and that I was to be a good Christian. I stormed to my room and she followed screaming that I was being disobedient and that it would have been better on everyone if my father had not knocked her up because then she wouldn't have an ungrateful brat to take care of to which my mother standing behind her smirked at me and she continued saying that she could have been able to afford more and maybe be able to live somewhere else nice. I yelled at my sister to get the hell out and told my mother that she was not my mother. These fights happened every month for several years until when I turned 16 I attempted suicide and got to the hospital where my mother came in and claimed I was only doing it for attention. this resulted in a fight in the hospital where they ended up telling her to leave. fun fact i was there for a week and they gave me more meds. My mother then took me to therapy where they diagnosed me with Aspergers and had me on a grand total of 4200mg of meds per day. In high school, I studied engineering and got involved in Jrotc, and Choir where I quickly gained respect as in choir I performed at Disney for 2 years in a row on Christmas day and took my choir to the top of our district again after we had stopped competing 15 years previously including forging partnerships as an ambassador for the choir. in Jrotc I was respected with my coronel even saying I was his Padawan as everyone respected me for my intellect and leadership skills. I ran away from my mother several times during this time as well for a total of 16 times. I worked several jobs and did several engineering competitions including one with NASA in which 50k teams entered nationwide and my team placed 2nd. My mother continuously to others kept saying I was her pride and joy and once everyone was gone she told me I was pathetic and should have a 4.0 and have gotten 1st place. It broke my heart and finally after so many years of being reminded I was a failure I stopped feeling altogether and no longer felt anything inside. When I turned 15 I cried myself to sleep every night for an hour where I would fall asleep and this continued until I was 17. When I turned 17 I told my mother that I was leaving her when I turned 18 and that she had till then to heal what she had broken. Our fighting got worst and eventually I did leave her when I turned 18 and became homeless living off the street. When I left I told my SD he was the ole she danced on and I left her a voicemail on my phone which I left for her to find which said that I needed to leave before I forgot what my mother was like and that the monster she had become took over. I was homeless for a month before my school found me a nice couple to live with who supported me and treated me like the family I never had. I eventually found that my mother had since I was little collected $550 a month from SSI to help her take care of me. After I left she had continued to receive $320 to take care of me as she had lied and said I was mentally disabled without a job. I put an end to it and eventually I did graduate to many of my teachers admiration as they had learned about everything since I left my mother and they wished me well till I went to college where I am now. In college, I went to therapy again where they diagnosed me with Anxiouty, Bipolar, PTSD and we are currently talking about multiple personality complexes. I was even given an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) though he passed away 4 months later or 1 month ago after suffering from heart failure. she continues to play the victim and is tearing the family apart as a result as half the family defends me and the other half takes her side. I want all this drama to stop and so my question is what should I do?"
59,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"Help: How do I stop viewing emotions and vulnerability as weakness, when that's all I've been taught?",1,gal1t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/gal1t0/help_how_do_i_stop_viewing_emotions_and/,2020-04-30 10:09:48,"Hi Everyone, I hope you are all doing well during this difficult time. **This is my situation:** I am a girl? woman? lady? in my mid-twenties. My mother is an alcoholic who struggles with anxiety, depression, anorexia, bulimia, and on occasion, bouts of psychosis and alcohol induced schizophrenia. Because of the ongoing and traumatic myriad of issues that my mother has presented, I have only recently realized that my father is actually part of the problem and is, to my surprise, an almost textbook narcissist. The fallout from our relationship that I cam currently dealing with is the following: Any time I express any negative emotion or feeling whatsoever, my father mocks me. This has been the case from even my earliest memories. I have always been afraid of my father, and have always editorialized my feelings and behaviors to accommodate him. I have learned that the ""real"" me is unpalatable, and my real emotional spectrum -- who I truly am -- is unlovable. Some examples: * The tumultuous situation with my mother and her health brought on serious bouts of childhood anxiety. When I tried to confide in my dad, he started to sing a mock song/chant about how I was a ""wussy"". This started when I was 8 but has gone on since then. I hate that fucking chant. * In my teens, I tried to talk to my dad about some of the traumatic things I'd witnessed surrounding my mother (finding her in our backyard guzzling Windex; the 3-day bender that culminated in her having a seizure and wetting herself in our kitchen... in front of my friends; hallucinating that there were bugs living in her skin and picking a hole entirely through her cheek with some tweezers; driving my brothers and I onto the off ramp of the highway, etc). He told me that I was self-indulgent and ""precious"", and that nobody was interested in my feelings. This has been the rhetoric of my childhood -- that I am overly sensitive, and selfish for having feelings. ""Snowflakes"" indulge their feelings because they are weak. * He completely denies the physical abuse that he inflicted on us. There was lots of it, it was brutal, and my siblings all corroborate that, but his complete denial of its existence is *c r a z y m a k i n g !* * He denies the extent of the emotional abuse. i.e. Doesn't deny locking me in a dark, windowless bathroom for days at a time, but denies the fact that that might be too extreme a punishment for a 6, 7, 8, 9, fucking any year old. That'll teach me to accidentally clog a toilet ( p.s. it didn't, I still #shithard). * Any time I try to talk about my feelings now, he will **literally** stand up and walk away, put on headphones, or, without a hint of irony, just start talking over me. I don't know why I still desperately want/need him to acknowledge my feelings, to acknowledge that I'm not crazy... but I do. I feel like I have let him take advantage of my desperate need to be loved/approved of by him. * I mentioned recently that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a very stressful, anxiety inducing time for people. Everyone's mental health is suffering. Nope. We are all weak, we are all babies, we are precious ""snowflakes"" and ""whiny little bitches"". When I suggested to my father that he is not a mental health professional and as such is not qualified to deem what is/isn't a legitimate mental illness (never mind moralizing the issue), he let me know that he *does,* in fact*,* know what he's talking about, because he worked as an orderly in a psych ward for 3 months when he was 18. You're right dad; that's the same thing as a professional certification and I am passive aggressive for suggesting otherwise. * I have tried to talk to him about my experiences as a woman, dealing with sexual assault. He firmly let me know that I was making it up (we all are, all women are liars). Basically, any type of expression of unhappiness whatsoever is a regarded as a deep-seated character flaw. It is nothing more than attention seeking. I am morally deficient because I am sad about this serious and justifiably upsetting thing. The crazy part is that, until very recently, I believed that about myself. I believed that I was weak and whiny and self-indulgent and inappropriately sensitive. I can only now look back and see that my emotional reactions were reasonable and not over-the-top. Obviously, there are huge consequences to constantly mocking and invalidating your children's feelings. **None** of my friends are really aware of the situation with my parents, because I am too ashamed to tell them. I never open up to anyone about my true feelings and insecurities. Not a single soul in this world really knows me, they only know what I show them. I have never even shared a kiss with a man, let alone a relationship, because I know that I am not capable of that type of vulnerability. I spent my whole life asking for my parents to pay attention to me, and now, as an adult, the attention that I so desperately thought I needed makes my skin crawl. I push away anybody I get ""too close"" to. I love my friends because I don't have to see them to often. It's like social anorexia. Speaking of... I even worry that my dissociation with my feelings has become physical. Throughout my childhood, my father used to force my to eat until I threw up. I'm talking gagging and crying at the kitchen table, swallowing down the last bite of something, and immediately throwing up all over the kitchen table. In front of my siblings. So humiliating. Now, I **never** seem to feel hungry. It's like I'm so used to being to what to eat, when to eat, how much to eat, that I can't eat unless instructed to. Am I some type of pitiful dog? I can't feel when I'm cold, but any time someone touches me they tell me that I feel cold. I know that I should feel hurt when I get hurt, but nothing seems to hurt anymore. I have come to associate the honest expression of feelings with weakness, self indulgence, and, paradoxically, *narcissism.* People who expect their feelings to be taken seriously? Narcissists. Manipulative narcissists using cheap tricks for attention. People who have a reasonable expectation to not be mocked and bullied by their own parents? Narcissists. People who expect love and acceptance from their parents, regardless of their education, job, weight, mental health status, etc, and then have the gall to stand up for themselves when they are mistreated? The worst kind of people. I can feel myself calling bullshit on their claims -- *you don't really feel this way, you just want to be the center of attention and manipulate people into validating you.* I am terrified that everyone has this internal monologue, so I keep my mouth shout and carry my struggles with me. I still feel that being honest about my feelings will drive everyone away. Of course, what I really feel, deep down, is an admiration for the people who are brave enough to say what they feel. I feel, deep down, an envy and respect for the girls my age who are gutsy enough to do what they really want to do and to live their life the way they really want to live. I have lived only the way that my father tells me to because I love him and want his approval, but I know that his love and approval is conditional on me being *just so*. He sees my love for him as a weakness that can be exploited. I hate that I have been raised to be so cruel, so cynical, and so dismissive of other's feelings. I hate the voice in my head, it sounds like my father's. So this is a crux of the issue. The olive branch that I could not extend to others is the same one that I cannot extend to myself (as is always the case), and now I've realized that I have to change. I cannot change my relationship with my father but I can change my relationship with myself, so that is what I am here to do. When it comes to working through the issues that my dysfunctional mother has fostered, I have had a great deal of success with cognitive behavioral therapy workbooks. This conscious dedication to ""rewire"" your patterns of thinking can and really does work, for me at least. I am looking for a similar resource for adult children of narcissists. In particular, I am looking for exercises/routines that I can implement in order to no longer deny the way I feel, to stop lying to others when I am not okay, and most of all to stop being so judgmental. I don't even know what I feel most of the time, and I don't even really know how to articulate that: how can I even be honest with myself about how I feel? How can I have an honest conversation with myself? I'm so emotionally turned off that I just feel things as vaguely ""good"" or ""bad"", but I need more nuanced feed back, like ""today I am excited"" or ""now I feel worried"". I don't want to be afraid of being honest about my feelings. Does anybody have a recommendation for a resource of this type? I find simply sitting down and talking about the issue doesn't fix anything and, as such, doesn't make me feel better. I feel that I have been raised to be cruel and desperately fear that that might be coming to fruition. I want to no longer see ""sensitivity"" as weakness. I want to learn to be okay with that type of vulnerability. All I want is to connect and be honest with people. I want real friendships, real relationships, real kindness, real love, real acceptance. I've realized that all the things that I thought were wrong with me largely don't exist, but what I am guilty of is keeping the world at arms distance because I am terrified of engaging with my feelings. Thank you to those of you who have taken the time to read this and to those of you who will take the time to respond. We are all here for each other. **TL;DR** I need self-help books. Cognitive Behavioural therapy workbooks. Mantras. Anything actionable."
60,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Do you ever feel broken because you unconsciously push love away out of fear?,1,fg1zr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/fg1zr0/do_you_ever_feel_broken_because_you_unconsciously/,2020-03-10 08:13:39," Even if it's right in your face, do you find it hard to implicitly trust? Was anyone here able to find a significant other in their life that understands issues showing vulnerability and trust? Was it difficult for you, and what did you do to get over your fears to make the relationship work? I had a chance to be closer to someone who was genuinely kind to me and I felt very strongly for, but my inner monologue messed it all up. I was reasonably sure they were into me, but I need so many reassurances that I feel like I'm asking for too much. I just freeze up with them now. It hurts, needing too much yet staying so closed up and inadvertently invalidating and hurting this person as well. It was something really positive in my life staring me in the face and I ruined it. I've had relationships in my 20s, but in my 30s I went without relationships for a number of years. I can't tell if it's just bad past relationship experience, my age, or lost touch on how to let someone in after too much hoovering. I have so much difficulty trusting people and it seems to get worse now that I'm older."
61,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Am I crazy? (A letter to nmom and her response.),1,fjvjcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/fjvjcf/am_i_crazy_a_letter_to_nmom_and_her_response/,2020-03-17 11:18:18,"Nmom (f50) said she wants to do counseling together to ""make things right."" My therapist suggested I write this letter and take a two year break from nmom before counseling together. After nmom's response (which I think is technically breaking the expectation I set forth not to contact me once I sent the letter), I'm not sure if I'm crazy. Maybe I'm the bad guy. Or maybe I'm the narcissist. The response she's given me is typical of any time I have ever confronted her about what she's done to me. I think this sort of deflection is gaslighting, but I could be wrong. I guess I'm just worried I'm wrong about this whole thing and maybe I need a slice of humble pie, not her. It's hella long, but if coronavirus has got you bored and indoors, I'd love your perspective and advice. My letter: ""Dear Mom, I hate that I have to write this. I hate everything that it implies. Because honestly, who likes struggle? I hate struggle in general, but especially struggle that will likely be the culmination of our two decades of interpersonal struggle and abuse. Either it will end by ending our relationship indefinitely, or it will end by forming a healthier relationship than weve ever had. Honestly I dont know which ending Id rather have. But it will end, so I take comfort in that either way. My therapist told me that I need to tell you what things are causing the internal trauma reaction I have when I spend time with you. I also need to tell you what boundaries I need to help me recover well enough to approach a mend to our relationship. I need you to know that only two minutes before you sent me the text saying you wanted to make things right, I had a serious conversation with a friend about going no-contact with you. And we discussed how I was starting to feel genuinely peaceful when I thought about it. Long-term, indefinite, never talking to you or seeing you again unless the distant day comes when I want to and feel safe to. Giving myself an eternity to heal if I need it. I felt so relieved thinking about it. I was that close to ending it, then I got your text. Your text sent me into a spiral deep enough that I decided to look for a therapist again, which I needed. I spiraled hard. I had finally found something that would give me peace, with the thought of never having to see you again. No more back-and-forth, thinking youve changed until you abuse me or someone else again. No more being on eggshells around you. But your request to fix things tweaked my sense of character. Youve invoked the part of me that wants to give anyone a second chance if they ask for it. The part of me that genuinely believes that two people can make it work if theyre willing to work. Know that youre not entitled to this, and most of the world would support me for leaving you without another word. Im being very gracious and taking a huge emotional risk, putting myself out on the line just because you asked me to. Mom, Ive already given you so many second chances. And every time youve abused the opportunity and abused me. So this is the last chance in this life. Im willing to make it work if you are willing to work for it. Im not going to bow to your whims and play the submissive child to please you and avoid conflict and save our relationship. You will have to meet me at least halfway for once. And if you dont, thats it. No more talking. No seeing each other. No visits with grandbabies. Not a passing hello at the grocery store. You can hate me for it. Which wouldnt surprise me, knowing all the times youve passively spit venom about your sister or your former sister-in-law or anyone else who has rubbed you the wrong way. But at least I wont have to be dragged down by you again in the name of family. Blood doesnt make you family. Choices to love unconditionally do. And you stopped loving me unconditionally once I hit puberty. You stopped being family to me a long time ago. To be fair, God has been merciful and is constantly reminding me of all the good, motherly things you did for me. And no, birthing me, providing food and shelter, and giving me at least a lower-middle-class upbringing arent good, motherly things. Those are necessities every child is entitled to. Good, motherly things are things like unconditional love. Give-and-take in a relationship. Encouragement. Tenderness when the child is suffering. Acknowledging and encouraging the childs autonomy. Saying, Im sorry, when you make the child cry (even if they deserved it). Being honest with the child. Letting them make mistakes and still loving them after they do. Letting them have hard conversations with you without shutting them down. Investing interest in the things that are important to them. Validating their emotions and experiences. Even letting them challenge you and receiving their perspective with an open mind. I have so many memories of my childhood that you were the center of, and the smile they give me warms me down to my core. You took such good care of me, often going above and beyond. However, once I became a teenager, those memories stopped. As soon as I started becoming my own person who didnt need you like a toddler did, you resented me. I believe you were more attached to having control over me than loving me, and thats when things fell apart. Mom, I really want to have tender memories like that again but Im beginning to realize it may not be possible. So heres the list of grievances my therapist asked me to address. First, your engorged sense of entitlement. Everyone is entitled to their basic needs, I think. But you take it to the next level. You destroy people so you can use their resources for your selfish whims. Remember that cheerleader that rear-ended you when we were in the carpool line at my high school? Sure, you were entitled to have your bumper fixed. When people break things, they should fix them. But you were not entitled to take the money intended to fix the bumper and spend it on whatever you want, or make that poor girls life a living hell by berating her while she was crying over her mistake. And for the record, youre not entitled to alimony. Dad gave you so many chances and opportunities while you were still together to further yourself so you could support yourself. He didnt have to do that. You decided instead you were entitled to having a fun job, even if it pays less than your lifestyle can afford. You had boyfriends financially supporting you as well after the divorce. But after my youngest brother left and took his child support with him (which I know you didnt give all of it to himI should really tell dads lawyer about that), you went back and sued for more money. And for what? So you can fly out for pickleball tournaments whenever? So you can go to expensive shows and buy expensive pre-made meals? You dont need it. You sure as hell didnt earn it. But you took it anyway. You took advantage of a man who was trying to do the Christlike thing and not put up a fight. Now he cant afford to fly his kids out to see him. And Ill be damned if I have to listen to your bullshit one more time about how abusive dad was to you. How miserable he made your life so you deserve a little spending money to make things better. Thats a self-preserving lie and Im not going to argue with you over it. You were far more abusive to him than he ever was to you. The self-sacrificing way he handled the divorce, giving you more than you deserved in assets, is evidence of that. More on entitlement. Something as simple as taking care of the apartment every Memorial Day. First of all, Im entitled to that day off. Second of all, I hated working on that place for free when I still lived under your roof. But it seems you feel entitled to having your adult kids come work on it for free without even asking. I guess you think that if you just offer free french toast and maybe snow cones later, your kids will be obligated to come. No, mom, I dont have to be there. I want you to ask me. Acknowledge the fact that Im going out of my way to give you free labor on a holiday and that you are not entitled to it. Kate, I really need your help with the apartment. Can you come help, please? Like, how hard is that? Not to mention I used to get paid to do professional landscaping for my college. There I got paid and my foreman gave us free ice cream and popsicles on the hot days. You dont even pay me and think I should be grateful that I get a snowcone when Im done. Thats entitlement. The second thing is your lack of compassion. Early in life, you were great. You did nothing but dote on your babies. You encouraged me, openly showered praise, showed interest in the things that were important to me, and held me when I cried. But once I became a teenager, those shows of compassion and empathy waned unless showing them served you. And it was finally gone by the time I was in college. Remember when my roommates were causing me emotional trauma over that stupid cat? Sure, you said screw them. But you also said screw toilet_paper_lord too because she would rather take the path of peace and emotional sanity then exact a pound of flesh from her roommates. I understand that you were trying to help me stand up for myself in a mature way, but you should have done that with compassion, not manipulative threats. When my boyfriend broke up with me and I was also dealing with significant, anxiety-triggering life changes (changing schools, saying goodbye to friends, etc), you decided to withhold every ounce of love except the bare minimum needed to feed me broth in bed. Why? Because (apparently) you warned me that my boyfriend was a bad idea and that I brought this suffering upon myself. I dont remember you warning me. But even if you did, and even if I did deserve the pain of the breakup, how could you still withhold love from your suffering, suicidal offspring? What person who calls themself mother intentionally starves their intensely suffering (and mentally ill) child of tenderness to punish them for not taking their advice? When my youngest brother was suffering because of your first, mega-creepy sugar daddy and we offered a way for him to get out and get some peace, what did you do? You yelled at me. But worst of all you yelled at my brother. Someone who was already so hurt and vulnerable and suffering because of the choices you made. You invalidated his feelings and made him feel like crap to manipulate him to suit your own wants. And you continued to do that to him anytime he brought up his concerns or opinions when he was with you. So, yeah, not everyone is great at empathy. But like, you take that to the next level - arguably to the level of emotional abuse. Thirdwhy is it so hard for you to say youre sorry? I remember dad yelling at me when I was little, even if I deserved it. A little later hed calm down, come to my room, and at least say he was sorry for losing his temper and making me cry. But that time you berated me (on my fucking 16th birthday) for following my intuition and not going to prom with that nerdy boy? (Who, by the way, had developed unhealthy sexual boundaries because of how sheltered he was and ended up taking advantage of the girl he took in my stead.) I started crying and ran to my room. You followed me to my room. Not to say sorry for making your daughter cry on her birthday; to corner her, berate her, and make her cry even more. Just so you could win the argument, tell me I was a mean person, and have control. That was the first time in my life I ran away from home. And Im such a considerate goody-two-shoes that I called dad to tell him where I was so you wouldnt panic. Often after these spats you buy me gifts, tell me how great I am, take me out to do nice stuff, all probably to curry my favor again (I assume). Unfortunately, no amount of extra-good behavior can make up for causing someone pain if you dont apologize for it. Never once have you admitted fault and said youre sorry about something youve done. Sometimes youll fix it, but Ive never heard you admit fault for it. Thats unacceptable and unhealthy. Mom, Ive never really had the chance or taken the time to heal from these traumas. Partially because I havent made the effort, and partially because I continue to keep an active relationship with you and open myself up to further hurt. I convince myself that its okay, this time around nothing bad will happen because youve done nice things for me before. But every time you trample that trust and drive that knife in as soon as I do something you dont like. Because of this, I have this instinctual, visceral reaction when I see your face or hear your voice. The kind of reaction a cat has when its owner has a spray bottle in hand: terror. Fight or flight. Whether or not its rational, its the trauma-induced neural pathway my brain has formed. And its real. So I have to suppress the minor panic attack it gives me - my heart skipping beats, the adrenaline rattling through my veins, tensing muscles, nausea. I cant make eye contact. I speak softly or mumble. I only address inert topics like the weather. My skin crawls when I have to hug you. I physically carry that stress in my tissues hours after you leave. Not because I hate you, or because I find you repulsive. I still love you mom, I really do. But I have that reaction regardless because youve hurt me deeply and repeatedly, and most animals instinctively avoid things that consistently cause them pain. And you probably wouldnt know it because Im so damn good at concealing that raging dumpster fire in my brain. So now I really need to take that time. I need to learn how to protect myself and how to deal with the fight-or-flight symptoms in a healthy way. I also need to learn to witness your behavior (and the behavior of the other toxic people in my life) from a distance rather than internalizing it. I need to learn to trust myself and my choices instead of constantly second guessing my internal compass. One gaslit conversation with you and it takes me a month to work myself out of an existential crisis. I need space to get to a point where I dont even go into that existential crisis in the first place, no matter what you or anyone else says to me. Until I have that foundation in place, its impossible to have a constructive, fruitful therapy session with you. I need to build myself up again so I can offer you my best self. Thats why I need a break. Right now, Im just not healthy enough. Not healthy or strong enough to be vulnerable enough to successfully work at a relationship. So I need a two year break. Pretend Im serving a mission and Ill be a better person when I come back. I know that I will be working at your work's customer appreciation BBQ this June, which I agreed to before arriving at this decision (plus I need the money), so I expect that any interactions with you there will go through my spouse, as I will be ignoring you for my own safety. Anything you say to us there will only be that which is absolutely necessary, and will be distant, professional, and unemotional. Before and after that, nothing, please. No holidays or special occasions. I also know that taking this break will limit the things I can enjoy with my extended family on your side, as well as my siblings, but Im willing to make that sacrifice and I will make them aware of the situation. Then, by your 52nd birthday, Ill get back to you. Hopefully I will be in an emotionally better place. We can do counseling together with the direction of my therapist. Maybe Ill even be better before then, who knows. But you have my word that when Im ready, Ill give you another chance. Our last chance, indefinitely. So what do I need from you in the meantime? Well, I definitely need the space. But I also need you to acquire some humility. I know I cant change you. The only person I can change is myself, which I plan to do a lot of in the next two years. But the same goes for you. You can change yourself, if you want to. Im looking for real willingness. Im personally of the belief that you need some hardcore, character-changing repentance via the atonement, but I know Jesus isnt your shtick anymore. Please do the best you can anyway, with whatever higher power you are beholden to. For this to work, it will take work, humility, and intense vulnerability. I never want to have another conversation with you where you manipulate me or gaslight me or make me feel like Im lesser when Im not. I dont want to doubt if Im doing the right thing or if Im a capable adult because of you. I dont want to watch you abuse the men you date or my dad. I dont want to hear you lie, withhold information, make excuses, or manipulate the facts to save face. I dont ever want to watch you use other human beings to serve your sense of entitlement. I dont want to be parented by you unless I ask for it; I want to be treated as a capable colleague and not condescended to. If we do counseling together with my therapist and after that I still experience pain from any of the above, I will end it. Know that if we start therapy together in two years and all you do is take and not give, I will end it. Any second, third, or twentieth chance after that will likely have to take place in the life after this. You can start now by respecting my wishes and my worldview outlined here. If I see attempts to violate my space for any reason, or that you deny the reality of what I have said here, or that you badmouth me like you do your sister, it will be a pretty clear signal to me that youre not really willing to do what it takes. Please, prove to me that you are willing. This will be the beginning of a great future and a lot of healing, even if this work must extend into the next life. I will have a beautiful relationship again with you someday. It will be done. I have hope and peace in this. I will see you in two years. Love, toilet_paper_lord"" Nmom's response: ""You wrote a version of how and who you wanted your mother to be at quite a young age. Youve been telling me about this other woman for years. And when I show up and I am not her you decide that it is because I must be bad. But really I am not bad; I am just bad at playing the part you have written for me. Im actually an amazing me. Im a good person. An excellent mother. A solid friend. Since you brought up my sisteryou should know she did the same thing as you. She wrote a version of who she thought her big sister should be and when I showed up as not that person, I was declared bad by her as well. Life is too short to try to convince others that you are not bad. Especially when you meet an abundance of people who thrive on exactly who you are, love you for it and demand nothing else other than your authenticity. You dont have to hang out with me if it hurts you. I would prefer all my children listen to their hearts and stay true to themselves; even if it means they fly the nest to never return. I didnt give birth to children to create my own built-in fan club. I birthed them solely to create new life and endless possibilities. The words I hate you have been coming out of your mouth and directed at me since you were eight years old. My response was then and shall ever be I will always love you, toilet_paper_lord. (The funniest thing is, my therapist told me that I was an empath. That I was so empathetic to others that I tended to neglect/lose myself.) SoI guess I will see you when I see you. Do whatever you need to do. My response to you at eight has not changed nor will it ever. I hope you find peace. (But noyour services are no longer needed at the BBQ. I wouldnt be able to perform my duties as a hostess there with a hostile vendor present.)"" So...am I crazy? Am I the asshole? Edit: typo"
62,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,(long post) Is my nFather invading my boundaries and purposely putting me under distress?,1,fjyhk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/fjyhk7/long_post_is_my_nfather_invading_my_boundaries/,2020-03-17 14:42:49," When I was younger, he would purposely invade my space and touch me when I made it clear I didn't want to be touch. He would kiss me on my neck and that caused me to have a panic attack. I even told him I didn't want that and he would still do it. One time, I was just laying in bed with my mother. We were just watching TV. Then he entered the room, and he was getting to close to me. I felt uncomfortable and I told that I felt uncomfortable. He trying to give me a kiss and I told him I didn't want one. I was trying push him off of me, so then he started becoming demanding. This was when I was around 10 or 11 so I was weak and vulnerable. He demanded me to stop pushing him off, so I stopped. But I was scared and angry. He kissed me and left. And I just felt humiliated and repulsed. I felt humiliated, repulsed, violated, etc. I just started crying and scratching my face uncontrollably, I have OCD so this was horrifying to me. This all happened in front of my mom. Everything happens in front of my mother and she never tried to protect me or defend me. I just felt humiliated and I still feel the same to this day about it. He always tries to find some way to make me feel uncomfortable in a situation. Whether he's cornering me, talking down on me in front of me, whatever. He's always trying to put me in emotional distress. I don't know why he does that or how someone can even gain anything from causing pain onto someone else. Another thing he would do/or still does, is that he would always criticize my appearance (hair, skin clothes) or my weight. They have been a couple of times where I just have simple hairstyle that I'll think it's cute. Then, he'll come out of nowhere and say that ""it's ugly "", ""all the other girls at school are gonna say it's ugly"", ""most girls listen to the advice they're father gives them"" ""I am never wrong about anything"", things like that. For simply having a different hairstyle. As for my weight, he has always made me feel so ashamed, or disgusted with my own body. He would always sign me up for weighloss programs, sports programs, or diet things. Telling me that I NEED to lose weight to "" be prettier than all the other girls at school."" One time he even purposely starved me when I was child to ""be healthier."" He took advantage of my vulnerability and insecurity and would compare to other girls, telling me to ""be more like them"". ""Why can't you be more like ____?"" ""Why can't my kids be more like ____?"" He would even complain about me, telling me ""why is it that I don't play sport?"" "" I want my children to be successful athletes!"" WE DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT SPORTS! WE NEVER DID! He would even go so far as to manipulate my mother and make her feel sorry for him. He would always use the ""I'm just trying to be a good father"" excuse on her and it would always work, because anytime I tell her what he has done or said, she either minimizes something or make an excuse. Like, anytime I tell her that he made a comment about his son being gay or make an remark on my appearance, she would always say he just doesn't understand. Guys, he so far as to brainwash my mother and she refuses to see that. It's frustrating."
63,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,The life of someone who's been raised by a narcissist.,1,fok2rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/fok2rj/the_life_of_someone_whos_been_raised_by_a/,2020-03-25 15:23:43,"I think the only reason I'm posting this is because I'm done hiding what I feel like and because I believe it will be relatable to some people here and they may find some comfort in it. I've been scarred in my childhood due to constant bullying that I had to keep my guards up at all costs to avoid feeling that deep despair of embarrassment. On top of that, I've had a father who has been incredibly emotionally abusive to a great extent. I learned early on in my childhood to learn to read people very well, or else I could find myself feeling hurt. That is why I sometimes cannot control this ability and overanalyze almost any person/thing that happens. Being overanalytical and good at reading people has been a useful skillset because it helped me cover my ass when my father, while he was drunk, got really abusive and changed moods quickly. I had to learn to read the situation very carefully so as not to get caught in the middle. When I was, it fucked me every time. My father has been the source of most of my problems as an individual, and let me explain why. I never really learned to process the emotions of intense fear and sorrow, because my father was a textbook narcissist. My father would drink till he was shitfaced, and got very violent. I believe that because my father lacked a father figure himself, he acted like a complete bitch. Allow me to explain. My father could not take negative altercations with other people well. Some people have even gone as far as to imply that my father acted like a bitch. A good father has a unique ability to teach their children how to grow to be independent, confident, and well-rounded people in the face of adversity. My father grew up in constant sorrow and made best friends in women who'd often talk about their feelings and take no action because generally in our culture, it is almost always a bad idea to stand up for what you think is justified. I have nothing against women, but I do have a problem with a man who lacks a spine. Most women have spines, but it seems evident based on cultural understandings that he grew up around mostly spineless women who could never stand up for themselves. What I don't know, however, if it is beyond their power to do so because the repercussions must've been really bad. Off-topic but anyway, it was the norm to bottle up the emotions and continue as normal. This was something I learned to do as well, but I'll explain that later. My father had a bad habit of being an angry drunk, and so one negative interaction with someone could determine whether or not I went to sleep in complete fear or live another day not haunted by the situation that I was in. Often times, things would get so bad that my parents fought because my mom had enough of his continuous angry rambling, and that angered him even more. Every morning after, my father always brushed it off as a small altercation, and this morning after behavior was a stark contrast to how much of a monster he acted the night before. When he severely fucked up, he'd always bribe me with food to make sure I remained loyal in some sense. I was a kid, and I responded positively to this behavior because I didn't know that I was getting caught in a vicious trap. To use an example, I was like a little fucking mouse who got the end of the stick with a snappy mousetrap, but always came back for more because there was food on the trap every other day. I grew up as a child who cringed at the idea of anyone expressing their natural emotions. I couldn't possibly fathom how people could open up and be so vulnerable, because I was always taught that it was weak. My father would always brush off what I had felt the morning after. ""You're overreacting"" or ""It's over now so just move on"" ""Look im sorry, its over lets just move on"". If my childhood self could see this post he would most definitely cringe at how vulnerable I'd have to be to talk about this. I realize now that this is probably the bravest thing I've done in a while and to be fucking honest, I'm kind of proud of how far I've gotten in this story. Even in my early teenage years, I used to think emotions were something you could move past. I was never allowed to take the time to process my emotions because my father had always placed himself so close to me that I couldn't escape and have alone time to be by myself after the shit hit the fan. I learned that this is the way couples deal with issues, so I did this in my past relationships if I had made a mistake or accidentally had hurt someone emotionally. I got close and wouldn't leave them alone. I hated the idea of uncertainty as to where my relationships would go, and I could never be patient and let the girl I date just think on her own without getting extremely anxious. I hated the idea of being abandoned. After being emotionally abandoned by my father and the trust I placed in him every day, I learned to rely completely on my relationships as a way to feel secure. I was obsessed with keeping my relationships together so tightly that it became the main reason as to why I was broken up with so many times. This feeling is something I learn to deal with every single day. A funny thing I realized was that the reason I was so enchanted by women who were white was that growing up as an immigrant, I always saw well-knitted families as exclusively in white families. It was during the times when I had discovered that black families lived extremely marginalized lives due to societal circumstances, and so I was not nearly as exposed to well-knitted black families as I was too white families. The reason I was so infatuated with a white female was that she represented everything I wanted in childhood and that by eventually being with someone who was white, I could emulate the same desires I had as a child and pass onto my own, or at least, experience it for myself somehow. I grew up bullied a lot. This is also how I learned to hide and mind my own business, blend in so well that no one could ever make fun of me. It has affected me so much that I dealt with self-esteem issues both in my physical appearance and my professional (school, work) life. I always thought of myself as someone who was not even qualified for anything. When I gained some independence to travel about on my own, I always thought that the world was full of structures that were designed intricately by people who were much more qualified than I am. The risk was something I was never willing to take because I always believed that I wasn't a person who deserved to even question, let alone explore the inner workings of how society operated. Since I was little and moved to America, I was always nagged by my parents to be successful so I could take care of them. Anytime I did something right, I was always given the same ""ok"" response. I wanted positive reinforcement, as any child should want and probably should get if he/she did something good. My accomplishments were always minimized, but my failures were maximized. My failures received more attention than any of my successes did. Anytime anything special was to happen to me, it would end up as a Facebook photo-op where the accomplishment became less about me, and more about impressing other people. I was a little gold trophy that my parents could show off, and that's what they cared about most. It didn't matter to my mom and dad that their family dynamic was abnormal in the slightest, because if it looks good from the outside, then everything's good. After enough social abandonment, I said: ""fuck people"". I retreated to understanding what life was really about. I wanted to understand that there was more than just sorrow. I read up on philosophy, biology, astronomy, psychology, and so much shit that I could get my hands on to make the pain stop. I became completely secluded from my friends after dealing with so much self-esteem issues and my whack ass family. It numbed the pain, but deep down, the more isolated I got, the more I started to suffer towards the end where I couldn't deal with the loneliness any longer. I started interacting with people again, but my childhood fears always manifested in some way to magnify the fact that I might get abandoned or hurt by people again, so it became this endless cycle of isolation and reengagement. I loathed myself every single day because I couldn't be happy. I learned to power lift and bodybuild because I did not want to be bullied anymore, and I believed that if I was physically strong, I could also become mentally stronger. My father did try quitting alcohol eventually. It was unsuccessful the first time, and it had gotten so bad that he had left the country. Upon arriving back, he was in worse shape than ever before. He'd quit his job, and was going through a lot because he was on medication for withdrawal. Eventually, he got better and better painstakingly. I remember driving him to the clinic to get his medication which was a two-hour drive, but I went through it anyway because I knew I would soon get the father I wanted. I finally thought that I will receive a father who was finally normal, and so I had high hopes of change. My gleaming hope of a father that I had always wanted as a child was so bright that I could see it. Little by little, I'd come to appreciate how far along he was in his process. After a while, however, he started drinking in small gatherings again. I brushed it off as being a small anomaly, and that it would go away, but deep down, I was fueled by monstrous hatred. It happened a couple of times, and I'd felt so much rage. It was quite literally the same rage I experienced while I tried to ""find myself"" through exploring different ways in which I could gain knowledge of what this shit tier life that I'd lived was really about. One day, I found myself on a cold night, exhausted, tired, fatigued, and impatient after finishing up classes at community college. I'd grown tired of life because of where I was. I had no friends, no job, no scholarship because my parents had fucked up their tax returns and because even with a scholarship, I couldn't really attend any colleges because the cost was so high. It was this bright glowing feeling of failure because my parents had constantly nagged on me to do this one thing, and I couldn't do it. School caused me so much pain because I believed it to be correlated to how I would get treated by the people I live with. When I came home that cold night, my father had irked me because he wouldn't open the door when he was just sitting on the couch for the longest time. I told him that it was really messed up to just not open the door. He got argumentative and we had a back and forth. A sudden sense of rage overcame me, and I charged at my father and finally beat the living fuck out of him, the same way he beat the fuck out of me emotionally and physically as a child. I managed to hold back after a couple of swings, but the damage was done. It became so great that he started drinking again, fled the country, went on a world tour telling people that I was out of control. My parents are separated now. Even to this day, he has a hard time admitting his faults without getting defensive. Honestly, he still harasses me because he thinks he's completely not at fault at all. I've been on my own emotionally for the last couple of months. I've learned a great deal about independence. I've smoked enough weed to realize that being vulnerable with your emotions makes you strong in the mind, and hiding it makes you weak in the mind. I've gone through unimaginable pain, and so I've realized that there's quite literally no reason to worry about what your future has in store for you because you'll never know. It's so pointless to ask yourself ""Am I going to lead a successful life"". I know that personally, if I could ask some sort of mythical creature who sees the future the question of ""Will I live a successful life"", I understand that that question implies whether or not I am successful professionally, mentally, spiritually, and physically. Even if the answer is ""no"" I know that it will not stop me from trying whatever I can to make my life better by changing the future by acting on the present. Life is one big shot in the dark, and I've gotten fucked over and over again by myself because the biggest person betting against me were never the snarky comments made by other people, nor was it my absolutely low life garbage father, it was always myself who bet against me. I've learned to stop betting against myself so fucking much, stop feeling like a victim so much because that's exactly what my father did and he ended up hurting everyone. The best way I can make everyone happy is by ending the bets against myself, and make myself happy. The reason I wrote this was because I want just one person to read what I've been through. The level of ""social"" a human being is has always irked me every single day. I know now that it is just one of those things that are both a necessary evil and a beautiful thing at the same time. It can help you grow, and as much as it sucks to not just be alone and not feel emotions caused by other people, it is so necessary. I know that if I post this mess, at least one person will read it and understand it. I don't need responses, but I just want to know that at least one person is reading my biggest vulnerability because it feels good to know that me being a vulnerable inappropriate context makes me a really strong human being. In that way it is selfish, but I don't really care anymore. I will live my life by being the best version of myself. It's all I can do to make the world happy, but most importantly, to make myself happy. If anyone reading this somehow and makes it to the end realize that they find themselves in the same situation as I, I urge you to not lose hope because as much shit is hurled at you, there will always be a tunnel at the end. It's probably not that bright and hard to see, but trust me it is definitely there. I like where I am and am still learning to deal with it, as it is not something that can be digested in a couple of months. I won't go on a crusade for the rest of my life to focus solely on the negatives and try my best to correct them, because that way I'll be obsessed for the rest of my life. I'll take each unique experience and learn from it, be more confident in what I deserve, and learn a bit more from each experience. That's basically all anyone can ever do, and what people have done since the beginning of time. I do not regret anything that I've done at all. I find the things that happened to me very unpleasant , but crucial in the character development of someone who's ready to finally live a normal life. And that concludes my too lengthy speech."
64,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,How to Heal From Emotional Abuse,1,fpz3gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/fpz3gp/how_to_heal_from_emotional_abuse/,2020-03-28 02:40:49,"**Introduction** Emotional abuse, or psychological abuse, is a form of abuse that is characterised by someone subjecting another person to behaviour that can result in psychological trauma, including anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. There are several different types or categories in the spectrum of emotional abuse. These include: intimidation and threats, excessive criticism, undermining, emotional blackmail, and economic abuse. &amp;#x200B; **Effects** There are various effects of emotional abuse, depending on the duration, severity and vulnerability of the victim. * Fear * Anxiety * Depression * Long-term emotional abuse can have long term debilitating effects on a persons sense of self and integrity. * Research shows that emotional abuse can sometimes be a precursor to other forms of abuse such as physical abuse. * Higher than average rates of alexithymia, which is difficulty identifying and processing their own emotions. * Marital and relationship dissatisfaction. &amp;#x200B; **Tip 1: Self-compassion** Self-compassion is when we extend compassion to ourselves regarding feelings of inadequacy, failure, or suffering. Kirstin Neff, associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin's department of educational psychology, believes self-compassion has three main components: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. * **Self-kindness**: Self-compassion entails being warm towards oneself when encountering pain and personal shortcomings, rather than ignoring them or hurting oneself with self-criticism. * **Common** **humanity**: Self-compassion also involves recognizing that suffering and personal failure is part of the shared human experience. * **Mindfulness**: Self-compassion requires taking a balanced approach to one's negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated. Negative thoughts and emotions are observed with openness, so that they are held in mindful awareness. Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, receptive mind state in which individuals observe their thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or deny them. Conversely, mindfulness requires that one not be ""over-identified"" with mental or emotional phenomena, so that one suffers aversive reactions. This latter type of response involves narrowly focusing and ruminating on one's negative emotions. If you are being hard on yourself, or you believe that you dont deserve compassion and forgiveness, then a good tip is to imagine you are caring for a close friend, family member, or other loved one. &amp;#x200B; **Tip 2: Empathy** Being able to empathise with those that hurt us can help us to see them as a fallible and wounded person, as opposed to just an evil monster. Trying to better understand and empathise with abusers is not to excuse or justify their behaviour, rather, to see them as a three-dimensional and complicated person also with feelings, emotions, pain, and a story to tell, which led them to their behaviours. Here are some good questions to ask your ask yourself and consider which should help you to better empathise with those who unfortunately chose to misuse language towards you: * How were they raised? * What were their parents like? * What emotions were they feeling at the time? * Have they experienced any traumas before? * What needs of theirs were not being met? * Did someone talk to them in the same way? * What other lessons can you learn from this? &amp;#x200B; **Tip 3: Self-esteem** Our self-esteem can take a major toll after being exposed to emotional abuse, and those who have higher self-esteem will naturally be more protected towards insults, criticism and psychological trauma. There are numerous ways of increasing our self-esteem, which are listed below: **1) Skills and talents**: Learn a new skill, take up a new hobby and increase your repertoire of talents. **2) Achievements**: Set goals, and aim to accomplish them. A sense of achievement can do wonders for self-esteem. **3) Relationships**: Healthy relationships are really important to our overall sense of well being, so minimise negative and toxic ones, grow existing positives ones, and even seek out new ones if necessary. **4) Self-compassion**: If you ever feel low, practice having compassion for yourself, like you would for a close friend or family member. **5) Assertive communication**: Try to practice assertive communication more, instead of passive, aggressive, or passive-aggressive. **6) Challenge and growth**: Growth is an important part of life, so every once in a while challenge yourself to come out of your comfort zone, and try something new. For more tips on self-esteem, check out this [extended post](URL &amp;#x200B; **Quotes** &gt;""Hurt people hurt people. We are not being judgmental by separating ourselves from such people. But we should do so with compassion."" \~ Will Bowen &gt; &gt;""When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That's the message he is sending."" \~ Thich Nhat Hanh &gt; &gt;""Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it."" \~ J.K. Rowling &gt; &gt;""Refuse to inherit dysfunction. Learn new ways of living instead of repeating what you lived through."" \~ Thema Davis &gt; &gt;""Being a survivor of emotional abuse is fighting daily battles in your head with a person you no longer have contact with."" \~ Unknown &gt; &gt;""You were always enough, but if you learn to see yourself through a lens that is warped by the projections of wounded souls, then you may arrive at a less fulfilling conclusion.""

HUGE achievement for me and I am so proud! The hopelessness I used to feel trapped in my misery was suffering beyond words for years and unbearable as a child. Yesterday I had an AMAZING experience where I could literally feel the parts of me I pushed away come back and integrate. 2) deliberately choosing to express vulnerability. It is an empowering choice to make! And because of this I experienced compassion and empathy from others where I truly did feel heard and seen. 3) experience making new social circles. This has strengthened my realization that I did not have to tolerate and be stuck with people who did not serve me. I feel more free and my relationships feel fluid and are deliberate and conscious. 4) allowing myself to own my success and starting a business! I used to be scared because I had a deep fear of my nparents coming back and trying to claim my success and enmeshing themselves onto me once they saw me doing well. And also pitting people against me if I try distancing myself again. But now, I feel in control and caretaking the fearful aspects of myself. I feel empowered to focus on my business and life purpose. 5) accepting that I am a unique individual and that I have my own purpose. I am not in this Universe to be accepted by every other human. I am here to express myself and fulfill my desires. I allow myself to grow, even if that means outgrowing certain people. &amp;#x200B; Bless you all."

Your room is available if you want it. There is no shame in moving back home even under normal circumstances, and these circumstances are far from normal. Our classes have been cancelled until May 1 at the earliest, and likely will not resume until next school year. Since I assume this (work) is probably the main reason you still live in [where I live], you could save quite a bit of money by moving out for a while. Plus, you could always change districts and work closer to the [district she works in]. I moved back in with Grandma and Grandpa, twice. I know you and [ex-wife] made a pact not to move back home, but considering everything that has happened, I would hate for you to resist help based on an agreement that is not serving you. I was not going to reach out again once the wedding was behind us, and wait for you to someday make the next move, as I didnt want you to feel that I was bothering you, but with all of this craziness, I just wanted to extend a hand and heart. This is always your home if you want it, and Id love to have you back and give you the opportunity to stash some money away and get back on solid footing. You are so far from everything up there, and maybe its time to come home. I think its time to come home. At least just consider it. I could have your room ready in an hour. I still miss you and think of you every day. Also, I am planning to send Aaron $3,000. This is absolutely unrelated to whether or not you decide to come home. The more I've thought about it, the more I realize that while I still feel that he was wrong for saying the things he said about me, I should have realized that tensions were high because of the wedding, and written it off as just a stupid thing to do, and not worthy of a lawsuit. I've always been fond of Aaron, in fact, i love the guy, and I miss him too. I was just so desperate to clear my name with you and that seemed like the only way. In hind-sight, I don't think it was him that was poisoning our relationship, so I am planning to repay him for any expenses he incurred (time off work, attorney consultations, etc). I just wanted you to let him know about the money so that he doesn't throw away an envelope coming from me thinking it's related to a lawsuit. It's just money, no strings attached. I am planning to send him $1000 on the first of April, May and June. I am going to send it to you to give to him, since I don't have his address. Love you now, and always. Mom"""

I learned that it wasn't safe to be vulnerable and feel or express emotions. So I closed it off. 2 years NC and I'm just discovering that I was carrying soooooo much pain. I don't need to think or rationalise about what happened, I just need to feel it, cry it out. Going NC created a space where I'm safe to start healing, it's not been easy and I've struggled a lot with the decision, but it's easily the best decision I've ever made and the kindest thing I've ever done for myself and my family. The people I'm close to won't take advantage of or abuse my vulnerability, I've learned to trust and connect with people again, I've learned to honour myself and my emotional world and it's wonderful. Today I've been crying my eyes out, allowing the pain to be there, sitting with it, acknowledging it, being kind to it and giving it space to dissipate. It feels oddly euphoric, it's a good feeling."

This went on for a while because I trusted my husband but after a while there were things that came into realization. Needless to say I talked to my husband and put a stop to it but while it was happening I accidentally let it slip to my mother in a moment of emotion and vulnerability. Its been almost a year now and her and her brother still both remind me of it to this day and throw it in my face. Especially in the company of distant relatives and her friends she never lets me live it down. Its embarrassing to me because its no one elses business and Im constantly reminded of what an idiot it was (their words not mine).
69,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Feeling lost in this mess. (LONG),1,f3qdyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/f3qdyn/feeling_lost_in_this_mess_long/,2020-02-14 21:32:14,"Warning: long asf. CW: domestic violence, abuse, violence, sexual assault, racism, substance abuse, mental illness, suicide attempt mention (the gang's all here) I am 19F, living at home with NDad &amp; codependent mother. Background: both of my parents are alcoholics. They drink beer daily; I've been catching them drinking liquor at work, they also drink and drive; lots of open container evidence. I have no idea how they're not dead yet, and this has been going on as long as I can remember. They are both going down fast. NDad got a DUI recently. I have witnessed domestic violence between my parents as well as my NDad attacking me on multiple occasions, as well as 2/3 of my siblings. I have witnessed my dad knocking out my mother as young as 6 years old. This has happened a handful of times, but not recently. My father is very controlling towards my mother. If she wanted to leave, she couldn't. She is dependent on him financially, she does not have separate money. Everything is in his name: cars, the house. One occasion she threatened to leave, and from my bedroom window I saw my dad mess around in the hood of her car, either fucking with spark plugs or disconnecting the battery. They also feed each other's alcoholism. My dad has done countless violent things to me and my siblings. He has hit me and my siblings, attacked us to the ground, dragged us down stairs, provoked us to fight each other, threatened to beat our asses, and once broke my brother's collarbone by pushing him over a baby gate. He will actually scream over the smallest things that upset him. I have been called every name in the book: bitch, whore, the c-word, slut, idiot, arrogant, freeloader, ignorant, worthless, untalented. I have a 9 year old sister as well, who he has called the c-word(?!) and hit belts against furniture to manipulate her into fear. He is racist and sexist. When I lost my virginity years ago, I told my mother and was shamed about it; she told my father, he did not speak to me or look me in the eye for over a month.(a couple Fourth of July's ago, my uncle, NDads brother, smacked and groped my ass. I told my mom, and she said ""Oh, he didn't mean it like that.) My femininity was stripped from me as a child, and my dad tried to raise me as a boy basically, shaming me on my vulnerability and girliness. He doesn't do shit around the house because it's women's work. My boyfriend is a Latino from South America, and last Thanksgiving he made racially charged remarks towards him. He will frequently spit racist slurs; once heard him say whites are superior. He is also extremely territorial. If anyone comes into the kitchen while he's there alone, you get an angry sigh, or an ""oh my fucking god."" Walking on fucking eggshells. I have anxiety just being in his presence, and I completely dissociate. He also threatened to kill himself in front of me once, and after conflicts, I am so scared to go down in the basement and find him hanging or something. Not only is my dad a piece of shit, I am sure he is a narcissist. My sister (18, moved out about a year ago and is doing wonderfully) and I have been pitted against each other multiple times. Outside of the house, he is a completely different person. On the outside, we are a perfect family, his children are diligent and talented. He will twist arguments back on me, calling me names. Actually, I can't even get a word in edgewise. The conversation is about him, and anything I contribute is quickly dismissed with a ""mm, okay."" Or I am blatantly interrupted. I am always doing something wrong, or am I crazy. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder/Generalized Anxiety at 14 and the past 6 months have been very hard for me mentally. I'm on medication but I was also on the depo shot which completely wreaked havoc on my mental health. It's very hard to live here. The house is always disgusting. My parents smoke cigarettes in the house. My mother is also depressed and unmotivated, getting drunk nightly, staying in her room, feigning happiness, sometimes taking 3 naps a day. I know that she feels ugly, unwanted, and worthless. It's very hard to heal in such an unsupportive and unhealthy environment. A lot of my childhood was spent in isolation. After the recession, my dad lost his job and we were right above the poverty line, we lived in the middle of nowhere and I was homeschooled. My parents were drinking themselves to sleep every night, fighting and getting violent. I believe a lot of my mental illness stems from that. Recently, there's been a scandal. My dad was emotionally cheating on my mom with some random bitch on the internet that he's never met. Going through his phone, I saw him talking to someone about struggling to choose a stranger over his wife of 20 years &amp; 4 kids. Wanting to just pack up and leave for Florida. Apparently they were going to spend a weekend together, and he told my mom he was going to some game. That ended up not happening because this woman ""did not want to put the 9 year old in the middle of it."" I took pictures and showed my mom. That did nothing but cause a huge fight. ""He chose to stay."" And I genuinely hate him for that. If he even thought of leaving, he should've left. Also, my little sis had a school talent show the other day. Boyfriend &amp; I went. When she got upstage to sing, she forgot the words from stage fright and closed the curtain on her. I've never felt that kind of pain for someone before and it genuinely made me cry. While waiting for her second chance (she killed it the second time!) we all went to the side of the stage to comfort her and build her up. My dad had to walk away to LAUGH about her stagefright, trying to change the subject to him and his prior stage experiences. I told him to stop, and it wasn't about him. He got angry. Boyfriend said he wanted to wipe that stupid smirk of NDad's face with his fist. I confided in my aunt who lives states away, and she told me that my dad is a sick individual and she wishes my mom should have left him years ago. I'm extremely worried about my mom. I have a very good feeling that they will both be dead within 10 years, and I am going to have to raise my little sister. Boyfriend, other sister, and I have already started to hash out plans. I am just at a complete loss of what to do or how to deal. It's 5:30 in the morning and I can't sleep because it's completely racking my brain. I don't believe that I love my dad anymore. I do have plans to cut him out of my life. I don't have plans to invite him to my wedding. I don't even think I could trust my future babies at my house, where my parents drink and smoke cigarettes inside. It's so hard. I've realized that I have a lot of parental wounds, and I am actually jealous of the relationship my boyfriend has with his parents. I know that I need to run far, far away from my dad. I am terrified for my sister, but I can't pour from an empty cup. I'm finally starting to come out of my depressive fugue and coming to so many realizations that it's painful."
70,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,What's shame got to do with it?,1,f6m4ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/f6m4ee/whats_shame_got_to_do_with_it/,2020-02-20 13:37:04," so I finally dug into Bren Brown. My therapist recommended I watch her Ted Talk on vulnerability months ago, but it was re-reading Oliver Burkeman's meditations on insecurity that gave me the final push. He mentioned Bren and I thought, alright synchronicity. I'm trying be concise, so I'll try and summarize what I understand of Bren Brown's perspective, but I'll probably mess it up and miss something. Bren says that we need to be able to experience vulnerability to experience joy. We need to be able to experience vulnerability to experience gratitude. Those of us who have experienced abusive trauma often experience shame for those traumas - either by not being normal and fitting in with the rest of the world, or by failing to meet the expectations of the abuser. When we feel shame, we feel unworthy and unlovable. So people with trauma are vulnerable to shame spirals and we protect ourselves with shame shields (akin to grey stone). The solution is compassion for self, and finding healthy relationships. I listened to Oliver Burkeman on a hike today and I can see a lot of parallels in what both Bren and Oliver are trying to get at. My interpretation of Burkeman (and Sara Ahmed) is that positivity and happiness are privileged in our society. Positivity and happiness = good, while negativity and anything but happiness = bad. Positivity and happiness are also pre-defined (like gender for example) before we are even able to engage with conscious critical analysis. For example, alcohol industry defines happiness as drinking alcohol; the beauty industry defines beauty as skinny. Oliver Burkeman and Bren Brown challenge us to critically analyse what we are told is normal and acceptable. Burkeman digs deep into facing our fears: failure, insecurity, uncertainty, mortality. He reminds me that trying to focus on positives, and ignoring negatives creates an imbalance; a disequilibrium. Had a bad day? Don't feel bad, drink. Drinking makes you feel bad, don't feel bad, drink. Feeling bad? Shame on you, drink. Those of us with trauma don't really know what to do with our shame. On the rational side, I know my trauma isn't my fault or my shame. On the subconscious side, I don't even know how to accept myself, let alone assert that others accept me for who I am. One of my friends recently reached out and reminded me that I can come from trauma but trauma doesn't have to define me. I'm still trying to figure out how to redefine myself as a survivor, let alone define myself independently from trauma. That shit follows you everywhere. "

I (34F) am not sure how I feel about how I feel.,1,f6us0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/f6us0x/bad_mother_63f_cancer_i_34f_am_not_sure_how_i/,2020-02-21 02:37:01,"This is going to be a little long for some backstory/context. My mother and I have never been close. I was basically left to my own devices as I was growing up. My mother has always managed to convince herself that everyone is out to get her and is just extremely non-self aware. We were always upper low class, despite having every opportunity to be better had my parents made any hint of smart financial decisions. My parents were selfish and rarely made decisions specifically to benefit my sister and I. My mother has told me a million versions of a million stories over the course of my life, and each time, the story is altered in a way to get the most sympathy for herself. For instance, shes told me both that my deceased father wanted me more than any thing and was so proud of the person id become and then that the same man had asked her to have an abortion because he would rather party and do drugs than be a dad. I truly think she believes whichever version of events suits her at the time. Possible mental illness. I legitimately have no idea which versions of her history are true. When I was 10, my dad got tired of the manipulative behavior and divorced my mom, who immediately packed up and moved us across the country with no home or job. We were homeless for 2 weeks. She only moved us to spite my father. After a year, my dad caved and agreed to remarry her. I moved out before I turned 18 because I knew there was no way Id be able to become who I wanted to if I still lived in that house. When my father was diagnosed with cancer when I was in my mid-20s, my mother played the victim and told his family that they needed money for his treatment and to pay bills while he couldnt work, only to use the money (thousands of dollars over 2 years) they sent but couldnt really afford to spare for cigarettes and casino trips. Did I mention he had lung cancer? When I confronted her about it after my dad asked me to look into their financials, she got extremely defensive and claimed that the casino visits were an attempt to get more money otherwise they wouldnt be able to afford to live. Which was not true. They were getting plenty of support. My mom hadnt had a job in about 8 years when my dad died. Afterwards, rather than care for herself, she used my sisters vulnerability and mutual co-dependency issues and has lived off of her for the last several years. She gets money from a widows pension and makes almost as much per month literally sitting on her ass at home all day as my sister does busting her ass every day + overtime. Then she has the nerve to tell my sister shes lazy because she is too tired to cook or clean the apartment when she gets home from her night shifts and college classes. Its infuriating. On top of that, since Im doing well and have a high household income, she has guilted me for money multiple times. Im always torn between wanting to tell her I cant/wont help and feeling guilty because she is my mother. Today, she brought over paperwork saying that she has a large malignant mass in her chest. I know that the burden of her care is going to fall to me because, though my sister is older, she doesnt drive or have the maturity to take on the responsibility. I have no intention of paying any of her bills, but in order to get the truth about the disease &amp; treatment, Ill have to attend her doctors appointments. The real reason Im typing all of this is because Im more annoyed and angry about how much energy and time away from work and my infant son this is going to cost me than I am sad at the thought of my mother dying. In fact, I feel like it will be better for everyone when shes not here to leech and manipulate. I know/feel like this makes me a horrible person and Im vacillating between so many emotions that Id rather be numb. TLDR: My shitty mom just got diagnosed with cancer and Im more upset about the burden that I am about to have to take on than I am about her likely death. I feel guilty about that reaction."

The more she told me about her experience made me wonder more about my experience growing up with my dad. The constant belittling as to why I was wrong, embarrassing, an ass, stupid... And the manipulation of I just dont get it - you seem so smart/ I know youre smart, why are you doing this? Generalized hate I could sense, but didnt understand why my sister was treated so differently Unrealistic consequences Explosive behavior and never knowing what would set him off He could do something, but I couldnt Defensiveness Denying it wasnt what he said Blaming Cannot stand victims Blatant disregard to following rules Catastrophizing - if you dont do __, you will become in jail/homeless/dead and I wont bail you out/I will report you/i wont feel bad because it was your fault anyway Dont do xyz to me, but its different if I do it to you Talks with my mom about how I was the problem child (but I wasnt allowed to be present so Id listen from the top of the stairs) Wasnt allowed to have fun or be too loud or too quiet Bulldozing through boundaries - even as an adult Never knowing what would get me into trouble with him Guilt over everything HES ever done for me and used the money he pays for stuff as ways to get what he wants later - I dont want to do that and he says, well who bought you that shirt youre wearing? I looked into Adult Children of Alcoholics and he has a lot of those behaviors. Including marrying my mom, who is a recovering alcoholic and whose mother is a narcissist as well. I guess I realize now when I would beg my mom to leave my dad for the way he was treating me that she couldnt because she didnt know a life of anything else. After long lectures of why I was POS, i would be isolated in my room only to have him come in and say, I love you and this why Im telling you these things. Why?? Was this a game to keep me coming back? Or what? Or can he just not accurately show vulnerability?? Or want to? Or know how? Hes putting together a large gift for my wedding and when he called (because it is dealt with on HIS time, no regard I have a job and cant answer the phone at all times, even tho he asks me to never miss his call when I call because its so important) he was telling me to make sure I was ready to go with the money to transport the gift to me. I thanked him THREE TIMES for the help he put in to finding a cheaper alternative and he argued with me about how it wasnt cheaper and how it was important to get it here safely and never acknowledged my thanks. I thanked him a third time, it went silent and awkward and then he said, well that was why I was calling and hung up. He doesnt just call me to see whats up, hes never asked me about what Im interested in (weve had one convo once recently about a trip I took) and he makes jokes about ways To get married. A part of me has wondered if he just didnt respect women (he and my fianc have a pretty good relationship, but one I havent seen my dad have with other people) but since Ive been engaged, he sees me with more life experience but of course Ill never have enough experience s him because hes lived longer and one day Ill know... Because Im pretty certain I have a better understanding of who he is than he has of himself, but yeah, *im the problem*. Wtf."

My family is very well off. We lived in a big house, with a pool in the backyard overlooking a lake. Parents drove Bmw and Audis, expensive vacations, shopping trips multiple times a month. It was all a facade though to seem perfect to everyone on the outside. We went to church and they were highly praised. Behind closed doors I was emotionally, psychologically, physically, and sexually abused and experienced emotional incest. The expectations put on me growing up were really unrealistic and my childhood was robbed from me. I still remember the nights I would be crying in my room begging God to save me from them and never had an answer, hence why not I am not religious. My parents would literally beat me for no reason or made up reasons or simply because I didn't live up to their expectations and double standards. I think my favourite times I got abused were when I was crying because they would emotionally abuse me and they would tell me ""shut up stop crying before I give you something to cry about"", then proceed to beat me. All sarcasm about the ""favourite times"". Never favourite or good experiences. Or the fact my step father molested me in the bath tub with my sister. That one took me until I was 21 to realize what he did wasnt normal. Why would you need to close the door, then close the shower curtain if your just taking a bath with your daughters? If its just an innocent bath, why was the door AND the shower curtain closed. Or whenever he found a reason to physically punish me, bring me to my bedroom, close the door, pull out the belt, pull down my pants, then whip me with it as i screamed for him to stop then he would attempt to stick his dick up my ass. or the times I had colds or stomach flus and my mom would be pissed off with me and stick the pills up my ass instead of give them to me orally so she could humiliate me and punish me for being sick and being a nuisance to her. Or getting reminded all the time my mom never wanted me. or hearing her talk poorly about my siblings when she was using emotional incest complaining about her relationship asking me for advice and saying to me she never wanted 4 children and her then husband pressured her to. Or all the times I would get bullied at school and they would ALWAYS blame me and say its my fault cause im a terrible person who probably does something to deserve it and list out real and fake flaws i had to justify the bullying i recieved, even projecting their own qualities onto me. ""your a really aggressive dominating person, youre really bossy thats why people dont like you, you act like a loser so theyll treat you like one, it's not what you say it's how you say it you rub people the wrong way, your bossy bossy bossy"" Meanwhile my step dads LITERAL NICKNAME was ""Bossy"" ""and Big Boss"" and we had to refer to him as that. And they always bossed me around dominated me making sure to always let me know theyre in charge my feelings and needs dont matter and i dont have a voice in anything, and excessively just dominate all aspects of my life. I had no privacy, no knocking when entering my room, alll my text messages, social medias, and diaries were monitored, and my sexually monitored too. I wasnt even sexually active at 16 and one day he comes into the kitching screaming at me that if i dare become pregnant he ""swear to god"" and clenches his fist.. Up until My late teens there would be nights I woke up to him literally standing at the door of my room staring at me in a creepy way and when Id ask him about it in the morning he would say im just dreaming. All my hopes and dreams would be destroyed by them. When I said I wanted to be an actress for a career he literally said to me word for word ""thats stupid, what makes you think youre so special you could ever an actress"" My mom would always create problems out of nowhere and get mad at me for the littlest things. When I had my first period i was too scared to even go to her for help but she found out anyways and said i was disgusting and must wash my own laundry from now at 10 years old. Which turned quickly into me doing everyone's ironing and folding every weekend starting at 10 years old. But hey , in my moms eyes at least she ""paid"" me, a 10 year old to literally do that and clean up the the kitchen every night when its a family or 8 and they pile up their dishes all day till its overflowing and covering the counters too, starting at 10 years old and no one helping me with the chores! or having my siblings mess up the basement with their giant collection of toys EVERY NIGHT too, and me having to clean it up . I even started babysitting at a young age too way before I was even a teenager. My mom always created problems. If I missed a small spot when wiping down the counters, somethimes i mad eu spot she made up in her head she would come over to the counter touch the spot and scream at me for being lazy and not cleaning the kitchen properly and this happened many times, or not cleaning the floors properly. This seeped into adulthood where i was paid to be her maid and she would get mad if the bathrooms werent perfection, one little spec on the shower glass, or a spot on the tile that isnt 100% smooth and yell at me for being lazy and cant clean properly and gaslight me to the point wher ei would beg to keep my ""maid"" job with her. My mom was literally a homemaker didnt ever have a job and we had 4 nannies and she complained about us even then when she had someone taking care of us for her. When I was 22 I remember one time she came home and got mad at me and my siblings asking us not to bother her cause she had a . long stressful day, when all she did straight the fuck up was get her hair and nails done and go shopping. M parents would bring me to therpists to traumatize me even furthur and have the therpist rip me to shreds too and pick em apart based on all my parents accusations of me. When my parents found out I cut my wrists they told me im disgusting and asked me what would ""possess"" me to do something like that. They would use christianity to abuse me too. I think I have accepted jesus in my heart over a 100 times and thts not even an exaggeration. Between them and my extended family, whenever i tried expressing my feelings about the abuse taking place they would pray over me and force me to accept jesus into my heart to wash away my sins . Over, and over, and over. This went on into adulthood too. When I told my aunt my step dad attacked me and gave me a concussion when i was almost 21 years old she asked me if I have accepted jesus christ into my heart yet and that I need to beg god for forgiveness. Any time I had friends my parents would tell me my friends dont actually care about me. If I happened to have a friend younger than me, they would say i cant make friends my own age so i target younger kids a year younger than me so I can ""dominate and control"" them. Not true at all, people my age would do that to me and the younger kids or older kids were the only onces that were kind to me. No one my age. High school i experienced so much narcassist abuse too, i went to a christian private school and constantly reminded what a terrible sinner I was when i wasnt even doing shit except pissing of the girls because their crushes would like me, or the grade 12's would like me and hang out with me. It was bullshit. I was ostracised from the first day i was there. People would talk shit about me behind my back but then be nice to my face, and this one girl that made it a mission to make my life a living hell would constantly come for me because her boyfriend admitted he liked me and not her, i even turned him down saying i would never like him ! Still she made me the enemy, and would target me and no one would stand up for me and I was always made the villain, always scapegoated. All this is happening, and my parents cover it up by taking me shopping and buying me nice things. But inside the home, I was targeted. They even shamed me for eating and had me believing I was fat for years and kids at schoool thought I was crazy cause i was actually fucking annorexic and skinny as fuck thinking in my head im skinny cause anytime my parents caught me eating they would ge tmad at me for eating and call me fat! They would even do these spiritual warfare prayers over me. I can't even go in any furthur the extent of the abuse. All I wills say is at the church we attended there were multiple pedophiles posing as pastors and youth pastors, and members in the church. One got caught and is in jail for molesting children and filming it. Thats all I'll say on the subject, I'd even post the news article but not trying to give my identity away. To say the least i'm extremely traumatized, and the abuse i faced made me so vulnerable that even in my adult years i was basely a walking target due to my extremely low self esteem and vulnerability. I was in an abusive relationship, my frist and last, ended up promiscuous where i gave up and let men use me pretending they care about me when deep down i knew they didnt. My parents destroyed any confidence i had, in fact they stunted the development of self esteem and confidence in the first place. I feel broken and trust no one in the world. It got so bad that i i couldn't live with them anymore. My mom basically kicked me out of the house just after i got into a car accident and could barely walk and on top of it was suffeering deep depressions for years that made me unable to world or have ambition or motivation for life, because they made it their mission to let me know I would never be able to survive without them. they didnt prepare me for the real world or teach my basic survival skills, nothing. Just threw me to the streets, i was homeless for a year, went back to teir house for a few months and after more brutal attacks to my being i packed what little shit i had left and chose to sleep on the streets dead of winter. no where to go. i ended up getting human trafficked, and had many people attempt to human traffick me too the 1.5 years I was homeless. The only reason im not homeless now is because i got human trafficked and was giving housing because of it and the severe ptsd i have that leaves me unable to take care of myself properly. If i dditn have government help i wouldve killed myself by now, be trafficked again, or living on the streets. I keep attracting the same person but in different bodies its like people can smell my fear and see im completely and utterly traumatized and instead of be decent human beings and try to help me and show me love and compassion, use it as an opportunity to kick me when I'm already down. The best part is, im a liar. im crazy. Typical old her, just a big fat liar who makes up stories for attention, and says she wants to kill herslef cause she wants attention. even someone at the psych ward when i wanted to kill myself said to go ahead and do it. Now, at 24 I have lost all trust and hope in humans. I don't know what its like to be loved, respected, cherished, or valued. I don't know what its like to have my boundaries, emotions, and body be respected. I don't know what its like to have a true friend. I don't know what it feels like to be supported. I saw a therapist recently and when i said i been eating more than usual because im depressed she glared and scoffed at me and said at least im still skinny, then lied to the agency that she ""didn't mean it that way"" to avoid accountability, she even tried getting me to gossip about her other clients. I'm just done. I'dk how im still here. But i don't leave my house, I cant walk for more than 10 minutes without my legs hurting and feeling like im going to collapse. I dont hang out with anyone, and after yet another person betraying me and getting their friends to bully me im done. i made this chick a website cause she was nice to me and acted like shes here for me always and i can vent to her and she cares about me, and she will give me free spiritual coaching sessions she usually charges for. I make the website then 2 days later wake up to a facebook story post of her openly talking shit about me, then when i confronted her about it called me crazy and said i have serious issues, and blocked me. I warned people in a mature manner she is a scammer, after realizing i wasn't the only one she did it to, and she posted a 30 min video where her and her followers taunted me and made fun of me, calling me a sex trafficked whore only good for sucking dick. I'm done. Idk what i did to deserve this but im officially just done."

Enter husband. He comes from a healthy family. He notices my familys interactions seemed superficial and forced. I guess thats what you get when youre keeping it together through fear, obligation, guilt, and accusations of disloyalty and ungratefulness the second someone chooses to set up a boundary. And thats why Ive gone VLC. My family was never meant to be close, because it is stifled by fear, walking on eggshells, trying to appease a narcissist, and fear of showing any vulnerability or getting deep - as that drives the narcissist crazy. So dont feel bad for forsaking the sacred institution of family, especially if your family was never meant to be. If they have to use coercion to keep you there, they have no right being there in the first place."

Today was my first therapy session ever. I was always told therapy was for ""crazy"" people. I was always taught not to show emotions and vulnerability. Cant have the neighbors thinking we arent perfect. It broke down alot of walls to even go today, let alone be honest with anyone besides my husband about everything I went through. Even just skimming the surface. It felt amazing to unload. My anxiety was through the roof waiting to get called in the office and while she introduced herself. It felt more natural to talk about as time went on. I felt no judgement. It felt amazing to finally have an outside party (besides my husband) validate that my mother was extremely selfish. That it's ok to feel the way I do and that I'm not alone. Anyone else in the back of their head just think ""well maybe they arent that bad? Maybe I'm just making it out to be worse? My own mom would only want the best for me right"" I was constantly doubting myself and thinking this shit was normal. super struggling with my own self esteem, but today helped me see the truth I knew all along. It was a weight lifted to know all I went through wasnt all in my head over thinking it. It's not normal for a mom to belittle you, or make you feel not enough. It's not normal for her to constantly call you Fat because you went from a size 7 to a size 9 pants. It's not normal for a mom to say ""those wedding dresses make you look like a heifer."" I cried in front of a stranger and it didnt feel like the end of the world. Idk why I felt the need to vent this but I did. So yeah."
76,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,'Secondhand apathy' regarding abuse,1,fcrsi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/fcrsi7/secondhand_apathy_regarding_abuse/,2020-03-03 19:44:06,"This title probably makes no sense. I'm dealing a lot better with this sort of stuff with where I am in life now, but I started thinking about this and felt like sharing. I feel like a source of bitterness 'outside' people don't really think of, that I think all abuse victims feel, is anger at the people who SAW what happened and did nothing. Looking back it was so incredibly obvious I was being abused. I'd come to school smelling horrible. I was seriously underweight (I gained 30 pounds when I went into my foster home, for reference, and was 'middle-average' when I did that re: BMI), I'd come in with bruises, I was terrified of authority, 'weird' in a way that made it clear I'd never had social interaction, and in general was very obviously unloved. Kids can be cruel, obviously, but looking back I'm stunned and nauseous regarding how I was treated. I hate my looks even now and have considered plastic surgery because not only was my biological family telling me how hideous I was, everyone at school thought I was ugly. Now I receive compliments from strangers sometimes regarding my hair or clothes, and though I still think I'm unattractive, I understand now that I'm not *grossly unattractive* to the point that it would somehow attract abuse. Instead I gave off a fear and vulnerability that attracted abuse. At best my peers ignored my obvious suffering. At worst and most often they facilitated and contributed to my abuse. Even when people didn't actively contribute, they watched and didn't intervene. Family members would be blind to not notice but they pretended not to see. Teachers ignored me. No one cared enough to reach out. 'Secondhand apathy' is a bad term but I feel like it fits in a way. Like 'secondhand smoke', someone who isn't actively trying to hurt you but is still poisoning you, or something. Because it doesn't affect them, they don't care. I feel like abuse victims in general deal with a feeling of invalidation because there is no reaction from surrounding observers. We either take away 'this isn't a big deal' or 'no one cares'. If no one is listening to you, don't take it as a reflection of the severity of your abuse. Even when it seems like no one cares, and that the only 'constant' in your secondhand apathy is -you-, you are not to blame. For anyone who's experienced this, it's not your fault. I hate the idea that some things 'aren't your business' and you should stay out of it. It is damn well your business if you are watching a child be abused and are doing NOTHING. Call CPS. Contact them. If there's 'nothing going on,' CPS won't seize the children or take action. If there is observable abuse or if it motivates the children to admit to what's happening, you could be saving them. Not all children go into foster care as a result. Most DON'T. There's something called 'kinship placement' where children are placed with supportive relatives trusted not to expose the children to their abusers (typically relatives estranged from the parents), close and trustworthy family friends, etc. I also encourage anyone and everyone to take in children in their family that need it, but I know that isn't possible for everyone. Even if you don't take an active role in raising them, please don't take a passive role in allowing their abuse. I really don't think that most of us need to hear the above, but it's more an indictment of people who stand by. But, it's also me saying that if you're afraid of reporting abuse or 'stirring the pot', don't be. You could save someone's life. If anyone read this chunk, thank you."
77,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I finally got the conversation that I spent 27 years hoping and praying to have. Ndad was a human being and was vulnerable for the first time in my life.,1,fd9z7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/fd9z7h/i_finally_got_the_conversation_that_i_spent_27/,2020-03-04 19:16:40,"My story is a very** long one and I've written it here before but always deleted once I've felt better as I do quite a bit on reddit. My dad basically had this horrible childhood that I occasionally heard about in VERY vague terms growing up, and I have had a couple of relatives say he had it rough while my mom and an ex girlfriend of his said he was abused by his dad, but their explanations have always been very nondescript. I always understood this to impact his personality and subsequent personality disorder. Without going too deep into him, he is absolutely the definition of narcissistic to the point where I have spent many moons in no contact but just as many moons absolutely begging him to show me who he really is underneath it all so that we can repair things. He is a pathological liar, an emotional terrorist, and a gaslighter/manipulator while wearing a veneer of the charming family man to everybody else- total Jekyll and Hyde. His one saving grace is that he has been extremely consistent in saying and in action that he will never ever lay hands on his children or accept anybody laying hands on his children. In fact my mom spanked me once as a child and they argued for *days* over it and I remember immediately after he came in the room crying and promised me he would never let her spank me again. She didnt spank me hard and it was well deserved, but that memory has always stuck with me and I can see it clear as day. Anyways in the past 365 days he has disowned me, lied to me about his address, his job, my job, my mom, my sister, to my sister about me, his drinking habits, his friends, and his money. His best lie of all time was that he had colon cancer and had to pay out of pocket for treatment (we live in canada) to get out of child support. He has ALWAYS been number one in his life at the expense of everybody and anybody else. He is also currently punishing my sister by refusing to come to her wedding (which I already paid for- destination wedding). So long story short is that I phoned him today because I've been having GI symptoms and I need to know if I have a proxy genetic link to colon cancer or not as I am young and doc wont do testing unless I do. So I call him and of course he's forgotten his BLOAT (biggest lie of all time) because he made that one upq almost 20 years ago now and says he has no cancer in his family. I then ask about celiac because I have about 20 of the celiac symptoms and he said his mom has it. I completely absentmindedly told him how I tried to FB message his mom a few years ago and she completely blew me off and blamed it on him and asked him what happened there, completely not expecting him to answer the question. He started in his usual way, with anger, but he quickly became completely choked and couldn't talk, and then he began to cry h y s t e r i c a l l y and I mean choking sobs and could not catch his breath. He proceeded to spend an hour detailing his childhood to me and told me that the biggest thing between them is that he can't forgive her because she didnt protect him from his father and he always felt worthless and unloved. This broke my heart into a thousand pieces but the second thing that killed me was that he said his dad held a gun in his mouth and threatened to kill him when he was 10 and his mother didnt do anything at all. He had no siblings and basically endured these things completely alone. Then he basically told me that he knows he has problems and needs therapy but that he basically cant form relationships or trust anybody and **apologized to me** for everything he's ever done to me. I have never, ever EVER in my life heard him apologize for anything EVER, let alone tell me anything personal about himself or let any vulnerability at all show. He also said he owes my sister an apology regarding the wedding and that he wants to apologize to her as well. All this in between sobs that he has been so worried that he has pushed us away to the point of not loving him anymore and that he wants to repair our relationship and be open and honest. Part of me is still in total disbelief and the other part honestly now feels a renewed ability to heal/forgive him because of what he has gone through. I had absolutely no idea it was that bad and I feel so sad thinking about him as a child and how small and alone he must have felt for most of his life, and then to become an adult and live like this. My sister says this doesnt change things for her unless she actually sees action, but for me something has changed here. Like even if he continued his bullshit I have more compassion for him and an understand of the trauma which led to his current personality disorder. I waited a long, long time for this and honestly believed that he would die one day and I would live out the rest of my life feeling this emptiness."
78,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,10 Signs of a Mother with Narcissistic Traits (specific to a Mother-Son Relationship),1,eljh83,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/eljh83/10_signs_of_a_mother_with_narcissistic_traits/,2020-01-08 10:06:28,"I love this youtuber. I have no affiliation just think he is massively underrated. I'm writing up what he says in this post for my own notes. URL **10 Signs of a Mother with Narcissistic Traits, *specifically about Mother-Son Relationship when the son is married with a woman.* ** 1. Mother says she is on side of the son, but only really does this when in her best interest to do so (protecting herself from embarassment). But she will not come to the aid of the son when he really needs her to. 2. Mother is unaware or unconcerned with the needs of the son. Son can be isolated by mother especially when young. Might say friends are too dangerous. Mother might be jealous of attention her son gives to friends. She might sabotage these relationships. Son often feels that his childhood was stolen. 3. Mother had poor relationship with her own mother. She was never shown love, only coldness. So she developed an insecure attachment, or perhaps dismissive/avoidant attachment, but not secure attachment. She felt dejected or worthless. Narcissism stopped that pain for her - it protects the ego and is an effective coping mechnism. Her thoughts are that the pain is too great, loss is too much to bear, she wont be victim again. The son MUST love her. 4. Emotional neglect of son. Very little warmth shown by mother to son. Linked to creating callous unemotional traits in the son (linked to ASPD or criminality). Son does not wish to share his emotions because son was not taught emotional reciprocity. Son was not allowed to express negative emotions so does not learn how or like to. This can affect his romantic relationships. 5. Son believes he can never be good enough for the mother. He was raised to believe it only takes one mistake to be terrible. And even if he followed instructions it might have been the wrong behaviour. Interestingly to the mother its a little different - to the mother only certain mistakes matter. These are mistakes that affect the mother directly. She does not worry so much about son's mistakes that harm the son and are not visible. This is part of what causes inconsistent punishments by mother to son. 6. Son acts as extension of mother. Boundaries are blurred. Son has not learned healthy competitiveness. Actions that appear successful (but aren't) are also rewarded more than normal. If a son wrongly wins an award and wishes to correct a mistake by the judges out of sportsmanship the mother might be angry. To the mother the appearance of success of the son and his actual success are entirely the same thing, even when they might not be. 7. Mother sees herself as having sacrificed everything for the son. Her career was for him, her staying with her husband was for the son, her getting an education was for the son. The guilt runs deep and thats a critical part of the relationship. The guilt trip is a very successful technique used to control the son by the mother. 8. The son will not reveal flaws to the mother. Dr Grande sees this as more worrying than you might think. The son will then be like this with everyone and avoid showing vulnerability to people who can be trusted. This can lead to all kinds of problems for the son in the long term. 9. Mother will organise events to be on same day as son's wife. To create conflict and force a choice for the son. The son attending her event will reinforce the mother's sense of greatness and position. ""She doesn't want to be number one, she wants to be the only one. "" 10. The son works to help his wife become accepted by the mother. But the conflict is always there. The mother sets up for existence of a daughter-in-law years before that DIL even enters in the picture - she will warn that future DIL will not like her as she will fear the mother-son relationship. Sometimes the DIL, in an attempt to win over the mother, will also become an extension of the mother, like the son. This is unhealthy for the son as he will be fighting a war on two fronts. This is often the point where the son first might enter therapy. He continues after the 10th point. No contact is not always the way. But sometimes it is. He says one of the lessons to teach the son and reinforce is that you can disgree with someone without having to be their enemy. Protecting yourself is one thing, being an enemy is another thing altogether, yet the mother taught they were the same. I love Dr Grande's channel. My mother is not NPD but I need to learn NPD to resolve another conflict. I learnt about Sadistic Personality Disorder (which is supposedly outdated now) through this channel and it really explained the behaviour of a friend I had to cut out. NPD and ASPD and Machiavellianism didn't explain his actions, then I saw the video about Sadistic Husbands and nearly every example my friend had done to the letter, but worse. I felt so vindicated and some tension and confusion went away. Highly recommended."
79,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,first time posting on a nice non-throwaway. i stood up to her!,1,emgxhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/emgxhz/first_time_posting_on_a_nice_nonthrowaway_i_stood/,2020-01-10 09:11:59,"My mom scores pretty high on the narc scale, She may not be a full blown narcissist but she sure is pretty abusive and neglectful. As of right now, Im sleeping on the couch because when I first moved out, she immediately changed my room into a storage space. Our heater has been broken for months, on too of it, and during a pretty cold winter, for northern California. And today, a guy was coming around to fix it. So after nmom drops off my sister at school, she comes through the door stomping her boots as she always does. And immediately shes waking me up and giving me demands. Theres no hello, simply I need you to wake up and join me in the bathroom, I have instructions. Im used to this, so Im taking my time getting up because I was still waking up. She snaps at me no more than ten seconds later, I need you to LISTEN to ME. So I get up and I walk to the bathroom, where shes doing her hair, and Im livid enough to start a fight. This kind of anger almost never comes over me but just how inconsiderate she was being in the vulnerability of my grogginess, it pissed me the fuck off. So before she says a word, I say, Look. I am you adult child, not your servant, not your maid. I want to be asked nicely to do tasks, not demanded. She pauses, and I can see the engines all firing off because I never stand up to my nmother. Im a pretty timid, sensitive person. But today, after reading a chapter of this book about nmoms and just after surviving the holidays relatively unscathed, I felt empowered to speak up. Im sorry Im being bossy, She begins. Which to me felt like a way to diminish her demands to something... less. Bossy feels small to what she does. She screams and storms around over chores. she always says she had kids so she didnt have to do chores. Thanks, mom. Im in a rush to get out for work and I need you No. This doesnt just happen when youre rushing. This happens everyday. I am an adult, you can talk to me like one. Im sorry. She repeats. That you feel bossed around. No! I do get bossed around, and you dont wake someone up with a list of chores. That is rude. Youre being rude. Im an adult. Talk to me like one. I get instructed on what to do when the heating guy comes, how much we would be willing to pay, and where to find a blank pre-signed check. And she ends with Im sorry I came in like that, but you have to cut me slack. God, no I dont. Youre so rude. And I turn and walk out. And sue immediately turns on the hysterics and screams what else can I do!? like I didnt just tell her and I say Im not having this conversation anymore. I repeat this five times, yelling over her own screeching about how hard on her I am. I dont want to hear it. I know nothing she can say will convince me to give her any sympathy. After more yelling from the bathroom, she finally backs down, figuring out that I wasnt going to stop refusing to engage in her bullshit. I sit back down on the couch and pick up my phone, booting up mahjong to calm the hell down. She comes out after shes done with her hair and says I love you very much, Rachel. But it feels like you dont love me at all. Everything I ask of you seems to be too much for you. Its not about what you ask of me, its how you ask it. I say. I do not remember the last time you said please or thank you. This is the third Thursday Ive stayed in all morning, and I never hear a please or a thank you, I am demanded around. Im sorry I did that. But I spent four hours cleaning the living room and two hours doing laundry and I never get a please or a thank you for that. That is not even close to the same thing. Im talking about getting a please and a thank you when given tasks or chores. Im not a child. And then I got really... mad. Thats distracting from me, you always do this, you make it about you to guilt trip! When I have a problem, it is never just Im sorry. Its Im sorry, but and she loses her head over my accusation, yelling that I look at her, because at this point, I was looking to the side. It was a little too scary to. I snap my head up and she goes on saying that she was saying that to RELATE to me and nothing she will ever say will be good enough and that I want to be mad. Im not speaking to you anymore if youre going to yell. I say. I dont WANT you to speak, I WANT you to LISTEN! In a moment of bravery, I say Im not listening to you anymore, either. She immediately got tearful and woe-is-me and said that she was praying for me, and that she hopes whatever it was I was doing with myself the she hopes Im happy. I rolled my eyes. I may be still in contact with her, but Ive never been happier. Im in therapy and working past my traumas. Im recognizing toxic behaviors in my life and Im learning to nurture myself. Im working with my father who is a loving figure in my life and happily separated from my nmom. The only reason why I cant live with him is because all he can afford is a small apartment he shares with his bandmate. But I see him every day and Im so thankful for that. Im finally grieving the mother I never had, and it feels good. After she said she was praying for me, she left and I made myself coffee, calmed myself down, and handled the heating guy like a pro. I was able to stand up for myself and make the focus about me. For the first time, she seemed at a loss. I called her bull for what it is. To her, Im being sensitive, but it wasnt just an insensitive moment, it was years and years of being treated second-class. Im no longer entertaining this. Im very proud of myself."

This is my Nmom,s brother. My aunt Nmom sister died just over a year ago. Both died of cancer and I am in the middle of treatment for bowel cancer and am about to go back in for further surgery In the next few weeks. Now the last time I had surgery my Nmom emotionally abused me for the last time. I was in hospital for nearly three weeks and I had been home a couple of days. My cousin had been taking care of me, as my mother was ill all through my cancer with shingles. She starved herself, refused pain killers and inflicted her misery on the whole family. Whilst in bed after coming out of hospital, when I was full of infection, in pain, dosed up on a cocktail of medication and still an acute pat being treated at home, she chose to go for my jugular. She started by going on about how much pain she was in and I lost it and said I didnt understand, as my main focus after surgery had been to manage my pain. I suggested going to visit the doctor and she said she was too scared. She then looked at me in an evil way and said she was scared in case she had cancer!! I cant explain the way I felt inside. It was as if she was deliberately stepping on a nerve and using my vulnerability to twist the knife in. At that point the penny dropped...the emotional abuse was so blatant and I flipped and began to sob uncontrollably. It was my worst nightmare come true. I had no figh, nothing to protect myself..... I was just vulnerable and for the first time I went to the place of sadness, hurt, disappointment and told her that she was evil and sick and to get away from me. She new she had gone too far and immediately backed down and literally begged me to forgive her. She said she realised what she had done and would never do it again. The next morning I woke up feeling suicidal. Now I havent felt that way for years. All through my cancer diagnosis and treatment I remained positive and philosophical. I decided to fight and get through. But this emotional barage I couldnt cope with. This led me to understand narcissism and what is going on. since then I have gone LC. My mother became ill and starved herself and ended up in hospital. My GCsis and her boyfriend have verba attacked me for ignoring them or going LC. The point I am trying to make is that the games have already started with my mother over the funeral. She fell out with my uncles wife and is refusing to go to the house and join the funeral procession. She is putting herself on the outside so that I feel emotionally responsible for her. She is making it about her and I am worried that my mother and sister are going to crdate drama and misery when I am ill again. Any coping strategies would be welcome"

Kinda feels like my sisters and I have had to emotionally parent her and (emotionally) succumb to and adapt to her needs, not the other way around like it should be. Im only 16 and Im confident this will change as I grow and come back to myself after a while of becoming a people pleaser myself, but I am so bad at self consideration lol. I think for myself constantly never relying on others and taking on lots of emotional responsibility, but I never think OF myself. I am very moody as a result of this, always being hurt without realising why, people affecting me but I seriously cant bring myself to blame them so I blame myself, refusing to believe I can be hurt by other people, even though I am really sensitive tbh and get hurt by people all the time. Its like I know this but my ego cant properly register it therefore I do not work with it. I dont ignore my feelings, I just dont acknowledge them if ya know what I mean. This is a result no doubt of narcissistic abuse, energy vampires, sexual assault and honestly my own self doubt and escapism. It makes me feel so down and frustrated. Why can I see so clearly everyone elses feelings, how the littlest things affect everyone, even exaggerating how much they must be hurt by things and being too empathetic, but I cant do that for myself..? I feel for everyone but me. I dont feel bad for me, everything that hurts me I laugh off as a joke kinda. I seem to have this... ability to feel and sense others pain and almost heal them, getting to the heart of the matter effortlessly, but Im so bad at doing that for myself. I think when I was younger I could. Ive always been super emotionally mature. Its just over the years of having my experiences invalidated and being gaslighted and all that by her, its like I cant accept that external things even affect me. I guess you could call that an unwillingness to admit vulnerability. I think Ive become like this because I am in actual fact so vulnerable and open with people. Im extremely sensitive and my waters run pretty deep. Everything affects me not just emotionally but like in every way, and I think so damn deeply about everything. I believe I am an empath (whether you believe in them or not, but either way it does very much explain my nature). I just wish I knew how to heal myself. I wish I knew where the wounds were within me, but Ive grown numb to it. Ive become icy to my own emotions. I wish to thaw that ice. I wish I loved myself but its so hard when youre being raised by someone like my mother. Someone like all of our nparents. No matter what level of abuse you are enduring, abuse in any sense of the word is so hard to swallow while still remaining true to yourself and not developing defends mechanisms (or even a lack of such)."

Im often told Im hard to read and even when I was a kid, another kid once said I was a robot. My Edad and brother are the same way, though Id say my brother is the most robotic of us all (I suspect he has depression), and my Nmom has also told me she doesnt like talking about her feelings with other people. So as you can see, I didnt see much emotional vulnerability from the family. I know this is a common problem for the children of narcissists. I think being in touch with feelings and being able to be vulnerable is really important to form close friendships/relationships. Plus the feelings always come out in less than ideal ways.

85,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My Mom and my future relationship with her,1,ev1z3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ev1z3v/my_mom_and_my_future_relationship_with_her/,2020-01-28 17:47:44,"As you all know, it isn't apparent when a person is doing something wrong, selfish, or neglectful. These things can be seriously affected by cultural standards, as we all can probably figure. My relationship with my Mother has been good, and bad. When it comes to being vulnerable, she literally sucks so bad that I can't tell if she really wants to even try and open up, or if she just uses justification to keep herself sheltered, or if she genuinely can't find a good reason to even try and ask, what sort of effect can this have on my childs emotional responsiveness? My father is very physically loving, and probably gave me the physical touch of trust that my Mother simply cannot provide. I suppose I can excuse her and say, it's not her fault, it's the way she grew up in mexico, or that she's had a tough life and that I should give her a break. Because then where does that leave me Dad? He might have grown up slightly worse off than my mother from what I've heard. So this fact leads my to resent her... if all humans have the same capacity to learn languages, go to work every day, and physically grasp new ideas REGARDLESS of how sheltered you""ve ever been, how does she herself expect me to just ""understand"" and just listen to her when she blurts out a hard ""no"" to a certain idea or when she actively pushes away any attempt to be emotionally vulnerable. I KNOW for a fact that most of the mess she created between us is her fault, because when I look back it totally makes me realize she never truly took care of my emotionally needs. But then I remember that maybe her job as a single Mom was to be more of a put food on the table and have a roof over my head. Does all that really excuse the feeling of resentment I have for her? When I think of all the work she has put in financially to keep me stable or to provide food, I immediately feel better about the emotional/vulnerability neglect. It's just tough when I can't connect with her and she only responds to people listening to her, giving her assurance, you know all that immature bullshit that narcissistic people do. And it hurts to not be able to have her listen to me, as these narcissistic people never do. But she still puts food on the table and pays for a lot of shit and has never truly physically hurt me, and has never talked badly to me or anything like that. Its just that when it comes to going slightly further she IMMEDIATELY starts going into panic mode, and i've done it ONCE where i gave her sympathy and she LOVED IT AND essentially became comfortable with having me listen and listen and listen to literally the most illlogical shit ever. For example she keeps talking about shit that doesnt make sense, but it gives her assurance. None of that shit is ACTUALLY connecting, its just her spewing a FUCKTON of wrong shit that she WANTS to be right because its a subconscious judgement she made and there is literally no room for anyone else to say anything, because like every narcissist if they dont understand what you are saying they typically wont want to AT ALL and will probably try and actively shut it down because it scares them. So why would she do that to her own son? The person that grew up under her immediate control(not ina bad way, more like hey stay home its dangerous at night and i trusted her implicitely) is somehow a person she needs to shut down? What the fuck kind of retarded logic is that? And i understand its not logic here. Its just probably trauma or emotional baggage she has when encountering certain vulnerable topics. But why the fuck would she feel traumatized when shes literally, LITERALLY known me for her whole life? Since I was born she knows MOST details Whats there to not trust? I know what it is. Narcissists actively try and find reasons to close up so that other people (included their own family) can forcibly show that they care and basically for attention. Because again... im her son arent I?... shouldnt the child of a mother be given this type of assurance and not the other way around? Should the child of the mother really provide for the mother emotionally? When i told her this story she said ""im sorry im such a bad mom"" and started crying and started saying i dont know what to do and looked down at the floor. At this point I was furious. It was almost like a battle of ""who has it worse"". So i fucken straight out told her, ""are you really crying in front of me for even more sympathy?"" And then told her the definition of victimization in spanish. And then I called her out and told her I suppose being sad in your shoes and constantly talking about it is suppose to make you feel better, but why the fuck would i be here listening to that if im the child and you chose to have me. Did you choose to bring me into this world to give you sympathy for being a ""bad mother""? Is that it? Is there no way that you will ever consider that constantly victimizing yourself deeper and deeper only hurts me more? At this point i dont care about my feelings, if she wants to make it about herself then lets do it. So I called her out on everything she's done psychologically and how life and the universe doesnt care about her being good or bad, and after a pretty decent discussion she was just standing there with no words and I kept asking her why she started crying about being a bad Mom when if she ACTUALLY cared she would look me in the eye, apologize, and maybe possibly give me a hug?(especially when i literally just called her out by saying she isnt ever physically loving with me for as long as i can remember). I actively remember being 5-6 and having her shove me away when I wanted warmth and cuddles. Wouldnt a traumatized person want to realize THEIR parents didnt give them that, so why would they want to pass it down? Anyways i said/explained this point of view to my mother as well, and 14 months later she realized I cooled off and being around her more often i realized she isnt going to do anything to ever try and make up for it or apologize without doing it for sympathy. I had a little vent, but I wanted to include as many short examples and scenarios to support my question and to have a sort of starting point of where I can take this I dont know what I want to do. I already lectured her(it was a point of view but it included things I learned about human psychology so it was somewhat a lecture to teach her about what humans have learned and modern psychology). Im not an expert, but its not difficult to learn and actually have sources for certain facts, such as victimization and trauma and how those type of things work. I have traumas too, but by logically deciphering them I overcame them, and im assuming so did my father. It bothers me for some reason that my Mom has probably just denied or shrugged off all these new ideas I have presented, and pridefully walks around like those little girls that constantly feel empowered and bullies other kids for their own self validation. Also she does that thing where she calls her friends and complains about shit using me. Im sure y'all are familiar with whatever that is called, ive read quite a few posts on here(although its hard to do so because its tough to read some of your guys stories, and i hope the best for the worst of scenarios. But hopefully this one can ease up seeing as how im not deep in narcissism myself and neither is my father/dad/pops. What can I do? It hurts to see her basically have low intellect and high self esteem issues. It hurts to see her stay stupid by forcibly pushing out new ideas. It hurts to see that she uses trust i have in her, to diminish and convince me that she needs to have trust in HER OWN. FUCKING. SON. It hurts to see she's taking advantage of so many things JUST to get assurance, validate her ego, and make herself feel like she has power(when she has none). To clarify, the power she THINKS she has and how it affects her cockiness IS THE ANNOYING PART AND HURTFUL PART. The fact that she actively seems mentally disabled because of the fact that she genuinely thinks she has power over certain things. She is no threat to anyone and really doesnt have the ability to tell anyone what to do, ever, but she seems to actively try and be in a ""good mood"" and its so superficial, because thats not what i needed her to be. I didnt want a mother when i was 5-6 years old to be in a ""good mood"" all the time even when ""things are so hard in my life"". I wanted to snuggle. I wanted physical love and human touch."
86,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,(Article) When Your Parents Have Mental Illness: Healing Childhood Trauma - Phyllis Rittner,1,evpxph,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/evpxph/article_when_your_parents_have_mental_illness/,2020-01-30 04:25:32,"As a mental health advocate, I've listened to many brave souls share their stories about living with mental illness. I've also chatted with concerned parents who are seeking help for their recently diagnosed child. But what do you do if you have a mental illness, and you were raised by parents who *also* have mental illness? Maybe youre a young adult still living at home or maybe, like me, you've been on your own for some time. Maybe youve spent your childhood watching your mother or father struggle with anxiety, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). My dad suffered from what I now know was severe OCD with psychotic delusions, and my mom struggled with depression and dependent personality disorder (DPD). But in 1970, I had never heard the words mental illness. Ashamed and frightened, I was convinced no one would believe me, so I hid my chaotic home life from everyone. I was the family mediator, calming down a frightened father and comforting a sad, lonely mother. I lived in a permanent state of hyper-vigilance, constantly attuned to my father's erratic moods and my mother's helplessness. Determined to please them at all costs, I became obsessed with fitting in. I blamed myself for my new-school-nerves, my bed-wetting, my lack of focus; I convinced myself I was defective or different from other kids. For years, this self-shaming helped me dismiss my father's abuse and mother's neglect. As a young woman, I chose to stay close to my emotionally unavailable, controlling partners and swallowed my needs to gain their approval. I repeated this pattern until my late-40s when I found myself in a paralyzing depression while living with a man who behaved just like my father. It took a skilled therapist to help me realize that, due to my childhood trauma, I was suffering from complex posttraumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD), and that I was unconsciously replaying a familiar father/daughter dynamic. When I finally accepted the truth about my parents' mental illnesses, I realized that the shame and perfectionism that helped me survive my childhood was no longer useful. So, I started learning and practicing daily self-soothing and mind/body techniques to alleviate my symptoms. Soon, I could let go of several toxic relationships, a demeaning job and even start my own business. I still live with C-PTSD, but now I can recognize my triggers and thought patterns and practice self-compassion. I speak publicly about my experiences and what others can do if theyre in a similar situation. So, what can *you* do if you grew up with parents or siblings experiencing mental illness, or in a family with a history of abuse or neglect? ### Seek Help If youre a teen, you can reach out to your school's guidance counselor, a teacher, relative or friend. Books can also be great resources; I recommend [I'm Not Alone](URL Adults may want to find a therapist who specializes in trauma. [Internal Family Systems or IFS](URL is a treatment modality that addresses all parts of ourselves, including the unhealthy behaviors and thoughts that kept us safe throughout traumatic childhoods. For example, my need to play the family mediator and be perfect. These were necessary behaviors when I was young, but they arent vital for my survival anymore. ### Learn To Self-Soothe Self-soothing is very individualized. Enjoying a delicious meal, listening to your favorite song, sipping tea in fuzzy pajamas or finding a fun hobby you can commit to weekly are all self-soothing activities. ### Is Your Family History Repeating Itself? Are you a people pleaser? Do you avoid conflict? If youre engaging in a frustrating/painful dynamic with a friend, lover or coworker, ask yourself if you might be repeating a relationship pattern from your past. These patterns *can* be broken. With the help of a skilled therapist and careful awareness, you can identify and stop participating in abusive relationship dynamics. ### Engage In Healthy Relationships Healthy relationships have an equal balance of power. Try to engage with people who make you feel safe and respected, who listen well and are emotionally available. Shared vulnerability is true intimacy. ### Calm Mind, Calm Body The mind-body connection is real. Studies show that negative thoughts or feelings can actual create changes in our brain chemistry and even affect our immune, digestive and other physiological systems. There are a variety of mind-body practices to choose from to calm an anxious mind, including meditation and yoga. ### Finding And Coping With Triggers Everything may be going smoothly and suddenly, you find yourself furious, panicky or tearful and you don't know why. Your physical body may be reacting to an old trauma trigger even though your current situation is not life-threatening. Connecting with others, using grounding techniques, noticing and observing feelings without judgmentthese are all techniques that can bring you back to the present moment of comfort and safety. I've found Emotional Freedom Techniques ([EFT](URL especially helpful for physical symptoms or fearful thoughts. ### Let Self-Compassion Replace Self-Judgment As a child, shame and self-judgment probably protected you when you couldn't protect yourself. Thank your shame for protecting you and ask it to please step back. Your childhood was not your fault. It is now safe to love yourself Go ahead and compassionately do so."
87,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Anxiety around sharing your N experience.,1,exp4f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/exp4f9/anxiety_around_sharing_your_n_experience/,2020-02-03 01:25:43,"I recently opened up to a girl I barely know (friend of a friend) about NMom because she was telling me all about her NDad. She was so open, it made me talk about my experience. I gave her details of my therapist who has really helped me and she's begun seeing her too. She was telling me how much it's helped her and we began talking about our experiences again. I woke up the next day and I had so much anxiety around talking with her. I had to stand alone leaning against a wall crying to try to regulate my breathing to prevent a panic attack. I feel so uncomfortable and exposed for talking about it. I only ever discuss my experiences with my therapist and SO so I just can't shake this anxiety around being open with her. Has anyone else experienced this having opened up about their NParent? Is there a way to ease the feelings of vulnerability? I'm glad she has gotten help and is in a better place, but talking about it with her seems to be too much for me to handle."

Moving out isn't an option...I just want it to stop. Why can't she just die?"
89,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,This holiday is such a confusing time and I have no clue how to deal with it - Long Post,1,e8zpwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/e8zpwg/this_holiday_is_such_a_confusing_time_and_i_have/,2019-12-11 11:54:52,"Note: This is a long post, and there may be some triggering topics discussed as I do explain a little bit about my parents. So, to give some background, I'm new to this subreddit but I've perused it a lot of times in the past when I've been trying to make sense of my own situation. I've long since come to the conclusion that my mom is definitely an Nmom, and my dad displays narcissistic behavior but he's not nearly as antagonistic as she is, he's usually extremely cold and detached and tends to only look after his own interests - he was practically completely absent when I was a kid so like it's hard to make sense of his behavior. He's also completely absent unless you're right in front of his face (like I lived in Sweden for 3 years and he didn't call once of his own volition) so like I don't really know what to think of him. He, to be fair, certainly enabled my mother by just never being there to stop her, but sometimes the roles were reversed where he was being abusive and exhibiting narcissistic traits and she enabled him by vehemently defending him no matter what. There's been a lot of conversations we've had where I flat out accused her of 'throwing her kids under the bus for her husband' and of course she's denied it completely and never really was honest with herself or us about her behavior. My mother is your typical martyr. My dad is less involved but when you call out his absence or the fact that he hasn't really been a father at all, he gets EXTREMELY belligerent. He thinks he HAS been involved - but being absent 6 days a week when I was a kid because he spent every waking hour at work or drinking and on Sunday, forcing us to go to a day outing of HIS choice all the while being toted along like accessories instead of people and not listened to about our feelings on said outing - isn't really 'being there'. To this day, our relationship is very one sided. I can't really display any emotional vulnerability or come to him for comfort despite him trying to 'change'. He got terminally ill and is now attempting to slowly work at relationships, but is still completely ignoring the core issues that we have which is that my parents have both made me a dumping ground for everything wrong in their life and no one thinks to listen to me about anything - nor do I feel like I can be vulnerable with my parents at all. I recently went through a divorce and I didn't even tell them until I was 6 months into the separation because I fully expected it to be open season on me. And it was. At first they were superficially supportive as they are apt to be - and then the second I had my back proverbially turned, the fangs and potshots came out as to how my divorce is basically my fault and they more or less sided with my ex husband in the whole thing (yeah, the spouse that isn't their kid) which is entirely unnecessary because me and my ex are still friendly - it just didn't work out and that's fine. I'm never not going to feel some affinity for him. 10 years is a long time to spend with somebody. So they were punishing me for like no reason. I could write you an entire 10 page dissertation on everything wrong with my parents, but suffice to say they're both probably narcissists and both completely unrepentant - I don't think either one of them has ever like really apologized for their behavior unless I've been actively in their face and cussing them out which admittedly I've done - I have a tendency to lose my temper because I'm 29 and I've been living in their house for the last 9 years. Not because I didn't have a choice, but like...I was young, I was trying to get my start in life, and once I moved in they both started using me as an emotional dumping ground and until recently I didn't really feel like I SHOULD leave...I felt a lot of obligation towards them that I really regret - especially with my dad being terminally ill with ALS, I think that would pull at anyone's heartstrings and I do have empathy for him...perhaps not as a father but a suffering human being. The root of the issue that I""m now experiencing is that I'm REALLY confused about my feelings towards them. I moved out on November 1st. If you asked me what I was going to do once I moved out on November 1st BEFORE November 1st, I probably would have told you that I hated their guts, I wanted to go NC and I don't care what happens to them and I hope the house falls in on itself and burns to ash. In defense of my hostility, I've been their parent since practical infancy - I didn't really have a childhood because I was always in service of one or both of them - or just left entirely up to my own devices. Now if you ask me what I want...I really don't know. They kind of detached from me in their own ways. My dad, per usual, doesn't know how to use a phone literally ever, and my mom sends me the occasional text but it's always kind of an announcement about her day as opposed to like 'hey how are you'. No it's just OMG JUST GOT BACK FROM TAKING YOUR DAD TO THE VA which kind of just irritates me because I know it's a martyresque invitation for me to 'oh no poor dear' her but frankly, I don't...really care. The reason I was in the house so long is because for a long time, she was trying to sort of shove me into being his primary caretaker, but I refused. I was already so enmeshed with them that I knew if I said yes, I'd lose all chance of reclaiming my independence ever again - or at the very least it would be damn near impossible because I'd be handing them the collar to place around my neck. Their main tools of control are finance and medically based pity and they just so happened to try and shove that on me when I was in the middle of my second degree which I'm now beginning to think is no coincidence. Much to their chagrin, I graduated, I'm a successful programmer and data warehousing consultant who got hired by one of their professors because the prof was so impressed by the natural skill I had (i love programming, have been at it since age 6, I have aspergers and it was my first 'special interest'). I worked hard and got practically pipelined into a successful career because of my performance in school, and I'll be going for my masters in data science next year at Johns Hopkins, hopefully. I'm EXTREMELY proud of myself - but of course, my parents are claiming that they always supported me (my mom told me I was too stupid to be a programmer and women can't do math and how can a man ever love me if I'm making too much money) and my dad argued with me every chance he got because he thought he knew more about my field than I did (didn't believe my starting salary, didn't believe I could work from home and make that much money etc) and both of them have been nothing but obstructions to me obtaining my degree and a thorn in my side in terms of self esteem. I have the WORST impostor syndrome tbh. My mom promised to pay for schooling too and I told her sure, but it's in my name so I'll pay it every month and you can cut me a check if you feel so inclined. Surprise, I have to chase her around so I just stopped asking. I'm financially independent. I'm sure they hate that. They're now in a situation where she hates being his caretaker, she doesn't want to call in anyone else lest she lose martyr cred, and he doesn't like her taking care of him because she's got a drinking problem and when they interact, her resentment of the situation is palpable. Since I moved out though, they've both like...kind of stopped being hostile/rude/intrusive because they can't. And to be fair, I stopped being permissive. Every time they get to bickering, I flat out tell them to stop or I'll walk out and catch a ride home. They usually obey. My mom has even started attempting to lose weight and has expressed interest in plastic surgery which I kinda feel is a positive. She also started getting laser because I started getting laser. WHICH LEADS ME TO A REALLY GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF MY CURRENT ISSUE WITH THEM So, my mom has always been jealous of me. I didn't want to believe it at first because like what mother would be jealous of their kid, right? But since I was a kid, she's been scrutinizing my body in a way that's just WHOLLY inappropriate. She used to be ruthlessly cruel about thick hair on the small of my back, thighs, once she even started talking about my bum when I was in a bikini and it just destroyed me for the rest of the day. I'm getting laser because I still have a complex about it. She criticized my skin, my hair, my face, she would even go as far as to compare breasts and put mine down which I now realize was because she was jealous of their size and lack of...sag. I feel kinda gross saying that because again, she's my mom and I'm her young kid, of course my body is...different. To be clear, I guess you could call me conventionally attractive - I don't like agreeing because I have low self esteem but yeah. My face is pierced to shit because I'm a bit of a free spirit who loves funky and weird self expression - but that's about it. When I got botox and lip injections the first time she called me gross and a plastic bitch. She made fun of my weight my ENTIRE life and my eating habits. And like, I don't know what kind of relationship I'm supposed to have with her now that she wants to do things she treated me like shit for but is suddenly being nice about? Like I genuinely feel weird moving forward with my parents. They've taken on this thing of like acting like things are just perfect, yay I'm their successful daughter and I'm doing so well and they're so proud and she's thinking of self improvement and he's happy spending time with me - whatever - but they've literally never apologized for anything they've done so like...what good is any of this? I kind of feel like they're only being nice now because they know I can and WILL pull the plug on our relationship if they act out because they don't seem at all apologetic for literally ANYTHING they've done over the years. As for me, I thought the problems would end once I left but like I spent most of my day rudderless, depressed and kind of fearful like I still have to answer to them for my basic day to day. Every time I spend money there's a flash of like 'oh god this is way too expensive' and I know that's my mom's voice, not mine. I haven't heard the criticism in years but it's still there. It's like they've backed off of it but because there was no apology or 'hey I was wrong' - nothing has really been done to resolve anything. In addition, after my divorce and another ex left me - I live alone, I have no super close friendships with people nearby. Not because I don't want to, but letting people in is agonizing. I feel like I live in a binary between feeling overwhelmingly lonely or feeling absolutely smothered with no middle ground. I looked up emotional incest and it seems that avoidance of intimacy is a symptom and I have that. I don't feel any obligation towards my parents - but I've never had a romantic relationship where I wasn't completely consumed by the other person so I don't trust other folks not to hurt me anymore. I've sworn off relationships because a girl I really liked (I'm pan, which my 'rents hate) and I didn't work out because the second we started getting closer, I could like feel my insides just start churning and talking to her gave me extreme anxiety. I feel awful about it. I finally decided to post today because my good friend was talking about a coworker of his who was venting to her about her 'bitch' of a daughter (who is 5 years old, mind you) and I just immediately felt disgust, got super defensive and then subsequently got really depressed because I guess I was triggered by it because my mom did that. Also, I do fully plan on getting therapy, I'm waiting for my new insurance to kick in in January so that's on the table, I also just got diagnosed with ADHD for the first time and put on medicine and I'm doing really good which is why I think I'm able to start really picking this apart and reaching out for help. Like, I'm kicking ass at my job (imagine, my boss thought I was a super skilled programmer before, in the throes of severe ADHD, so when I do stuff now i'm so impressed by myself and I can feel my impostor syndrome kinda start melting away) and my home life is getting better (the first few weeks all I did was work, sleep and cry, it felt like) and like this is the last part of my life that just doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm not like being patient enough and big time changes aren't going to happen in one month of living by yourself - but has anyone else felt at ALL similar to this? Did you move out and did your feelings change? Did you plan on going NC and sort of find yourself questioning that decision again? Confronting my mom is impossible because she will stonewall you and do some like expert level gaslighting and have you apologizing for stuff you didn't even do. It's like jedi mind tricks up in there. I wised up to it and now I don't apologize for anything, but every attempt to confront still works out as her being like WELL THINK OF MY FEELINGS and always circling back to her as opposed to even just hearing me out so I don't know if I wanna attempt that again. I've also decided I'm just gonna carry on per usual this holiday because with all the grief in my life, I just don't have the emotional energy to deal with any potential strong backlash that my parents might enact and my dad being terminally ill is pretty heavy duty ammo that they've weaponized against me in the past and right now, I'm too weak to defend myself so I'm lookin to just get through xmas before I make any big changes."

My mom has an illness and whenever she gets angry she blames me and my brother for making her sick by stressing her out 2. Whenever she gets angry, she can't control her temper. While I talk to her calmly, she screams that I am ""making her act this way and she can't control it and I'm pushing her button"" 3. I want to get into a college that fits me well, but my mom will only be happy if I get into a good college so she can brag to other parents whose children also got into ivy league schools 4. She ""takes care"" of us so that in the future we acan reciprocate by supporting her 5. She's extremely controlling and monitors EVERYTHING I do. She reads my texts, looks at my web activity, screen time, and the likes. Those of you who know Qustodio (child monitoring software), she uses it religiously. 6. She acts like I can't survive without her; one day I told her ""I won't need you in future"" and she flipped out and started guilting me about everything she spends money on for me (""I pay for your food, I drive you around, etc. etc."") 7. She says I don't deserve anything and I don't deserve to be loved by anyone and I don't deserve to have a good future whenever i ""give her attitude"" by talking calmly and rationally 8. She also says I ""don't deserve"" my good grades and my achievements even though I earned them?? 9. I go to Starbucks to do homework and college apps because that's the only place I feel comfortable doing work without her screaming in my ear all the time, and she literally called me a whre (""Only whores go to starbucks"") 10. She constantly tells me that I break her trust (like she ""trusts"" me to do my homework and everything SHE allows and lets me do, if that makes sense), even though I manage myself extremely well and in the top 5% of school 11. She treats me like... I can't really explain it, but she has told me that she'll buy a tesla for me if I applied for a major in computer science. Like my future and what I want to do can be bribed through money alone. 12. When I try to explain my feelings to her she seems incapable of understanding anything I say There's a lot of other shit that I can't really think of at the moment On the flip side, she's also really selfless. Like, she gives up food and her time to help us. Sometimes, though, she feels a need to point it out esp. when she's angry, and that my brother and I are extremely selfish for not ""appreciating"" it. But she does wholeheartedly sacrifice for us. Also, she is proud of my achievements and brags about those to other parents as well. However, if another kid does something different from me (like entering a computer science competition and getting first place), she berates me for being too lazy to do it when I'm not even interested in computer science. She is genuinely proud though of my achievements and compliments me sometimes, so I'm not sure. Then again, it feels like she only values me for my achievements She does say she loves us, but she doesn't even know me as a person. I act cold and not at all myself around her, because whenever I show vulnerability, she uses it against me whenever she's angry. I mentioned having a boyfriend and she talks shit about him and talks shit about me being a whre if we do anything beyond hugging. Sometimes though she does support our relationship? Is she just shallow and unempathetic or a narc parent?"
91,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,How I stopped hurting myself due to Nparent abuse,1,ebrkej,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ebrkej/how_i_stopped_hurting_myself_due_to_nparent_abuse/,2019-12-17 16:34:14,"TW: Self-harm I'm writing this because I know how hard it is to struggle with self-harm and I want to share some hope that it can get better for those of you who are still dealing with this. Due to my abusive upbringing, I had a serious problem with self harm for a long time (I won't go into detail to avoid triggering anyone, and I'd like to share what's worked for me in case it helps someone. I've been self harm free for about a year now and I'm very proud of that progress. I didn't used to believe I could get here though. I thought I deserved to be hurt and abused by myself on top of the abuse I was getting from my parents/others. But it is possible. 1. One of the things that finally put a stop to it was fear. Fear that it would hurt someone I love very much. I didn't want to become like my parents and be a source of pain to my spouse. I cared more not to hurt him by hurting myself than I did about not hurting myself for myself (if that makes sense). 2. It didn't stop over night, though. I had to bravely open myself up to the vulnerability of letting others know I needed them, and acknowledge (even though I couldn't believe it) that I deserved better. 2a. What I started doing was every time I had that urge, I'd try my hardest to do something related to self care. I didn't have to believe that I deserved love, I just had to do it. I made myself do it for someone else because I couldn't do it for me. Depending on how functional I was that day, my act of self care might be taking a shower, playing a video game instead of doing homework, making myself food, reaching out to a friend or whatever I was able to realize I was in need of etc. This was such a hard thing to do. It went against all of my wiring and conditioning. But it honestly helped. I still struggle to love myself, but I can behave lovingly towards myself even though I don't feel it, and to me that's progress. I started treating self harm urges like my babies that I needed to care for, almost personalizing them. Separating them from myself made it easier to treat them lovingly. 2b. One of the other really effective things I found was when the urges were really bad, asking a trusted friend to just come and sit with me for a while. I knew that I wasn't going to hurt myself in front of them, so having them sit with me and saying nice things to me really helped pass the time before I could handle being by myself again. I strongly recommend doing this. You don't even have to tell your friend you're dealing with self harm. All you have to do is tell them you're really struggling with your mental health and that you need someone to be with you for a while. Tell them that they don't have to do anything. You just need someone's presence. That saved me so many times when I was suicidal. I hope this helps someone. And I hope you're all able to show yourself some small act of love this Christmas. Peace out fam."
92,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,NC with Nmom,1,ecd331,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ecd331/nc_with_nmom/,2019-12-19 01:08:24,"I've been reading posts on this forum for a while to try and understand my family's behaviour, but I've not been able to do so, hence this post. Sorry if this is a little long-winded, I've cut some details for the sake of brevity: A little background: I'm a guy in my 30s. My mom has always been hard to deal with. I have often related to her behaviour as 'walking on eggshells', a term my late father coined years ago. She is prone to huffing and fits of tears when a situation escalates and doesn't go her way - i.e. not helping around the house when I was a kid. Both her and my late father were heavy-handed with me and my siblings when growing up, with seemingly trivial situations - i.e. household chores not being completed to a good enough standard, or my not doing them immediately when asked - escalating to family arguments and physical punishment. This year: I got married this summer and my mom, brother and sister did not attend the wedding. The lead up to the wedding was a difficult experience, one which caused me much anxiety and sleepless nights. It still does to this day. My niece's 1st birthday party was the point at which everything started to unravel : My fiance and I attended my niece's 1st birthday party March this year, and it was there that my mom upset my fiance. Other family/friends asked my fiance how the wedding prep was going and she replied that it was going well, with only the groom's suit to arrange. My mom then replied something along the lines of 'he doesn't need a suit if he's doesn't show up'. Unfortunately, I wasn't in earshot when that remark was made, only finding out that it was said 24hrs later, but it upset my fiance. I mentioned it to my mom next time I saw her, but she denied ever having said it. Weeks passed without the matter being mentioned again, with my rationalising that there must have been a breakdown in communication / misunderstanding, since I struggled to see why my mom would have said such a thing. Yet, my fiance was adamant of what she heard, telling her family of the incident, and clearly upset by it. Three months prior to the wedding, and two months since my niece's birthday party, I receive a text message from my mom, sent at 2am. She is disgusted that I believe my fiance and not her re: what upset my fiance at my niece's birthday party. Her text also threatened to close her client account with my wealth management practice. That same day, a Sunday, my fiance and I drove over to my mom's house to try and resolve the issues. My mom was difficult and initially refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing, repeatedly refusing to draw a line in the sand over the issue and be supportive of us in the lead up to our wedding. We left with mom walking up to her bedroom in tears, despite my trying to keep things non-confrontational and civil. My younger brother and sister contacted me the next day, Monday, angry that my fiance and I had 'confronted' mom and made her feel threatened and vulnerable. I countered saying that the situation was getting out of hand and needed sorted out. The next day, Tuesday, I popped over to mom's house to help her move furniture before her painter/decorator arrived. We had lunch when she dropped the bombshell that my fiance is not welcome in her house ever again. This day marked the last time I have set foot in my mom's house. The result of this entire experience is that I wrote a letter to my mom, brother and sister, expressing how I felt that they were engaged in a toxic 'witch hunt' against my fiance, and that they are only welcome to attend our wedding if they change tact and are in full support of us. Weddings are a day of emotional vulnerability, and we only wish those in clear support of us to be present. My mom didn't respond to the letter. Both my brother and sister responded, saying that they would not be attending. My brother, who was to be my groomsman and attend my stag-do, declined on both accounts. Soon after, I had the unenviable task of having to contact friends and other family members to establish if they would be attending my wedding without my mom being present. Some declined, but most attended. I have not spoken to neither my mom, nor my brother, nor my sister since. It has been approximately seven months of no contact. Some days are better than others, but how is it right that in gaining another family (in-laws) through marriage, I lose my own immediate family? Everyone whom I have spoken to about the situation is aghast with my mom's toxic behaviour and what has happened. Heck, before this entire situation escalated, I never had cause to use the word narcissist...."

Ive posted about it elsewhere on this forum. Ive been resenting about how she expects me to just let go of the past. Id do it gladly, but the fact is that I. Dont. Trust. Her. It took me a while to realize that was the issue. For the 33 years shes been alive, Ive noticed a pattern where shes been nice to me while she wants something, snaps at me the second I step out of line, and plays flying monkey for our parents. Shes mostly stopped the last, but I have no confirmation of the first two. I bought her food for a year after she got divorced. I helped pay for her lawyer and her Plane tickets to get away from her abusive ex. I dont expect long term gratitude. I didnt do it to be anything other than helpful, but looking at it, Ive been nothing but nice to her since weve been adults, In return, she has harassed me when she thought my blog was too critical of our parents, joined the pile on when I was under stress and the extended family wanted to yell at me for being too whiny. She, by default, assumes Im at fault in any conflict. And she frames everything in terms of my disability being so hard for others to handle. (Im on the autistic spectrum,.). Most people outside our family think Im a freekin delight! She was doing just that when she brought up the subject of our family being dramatic and bullying. I mentioned my therapist calling them wolverines after she read some of the stuff they sent me. She asked if she was included in that, I said she was in there, but wasnt the worst one. She got offended, and started to justify it with well if they dont know your disability, knowing how to handle you- Bullshit. I flat out stated I was looking for support. I wrote a nice list of four rules to follow to be supportive, and literally told them that if they didnt want to follow them, they should ignore me. No one outside our family had any problem with my rules. No one *sane * thought my rules were difficult. 1. Dont tell me its easy or fine 2. Dont tell me how to fix this problem. Im looking for sympathy, not solutions. I can find solutions on my own. 3. Dont wail, gnash your teeth, and make this about you. 4. Just say that sucks or some iteration of that. If you want to share personal stories, be my guest. If you want to share helpful links, they are welcome, I had explanations for each rule, and why I wanted them. Everyone in my family acted like I was the second coming of Stalin. I asked for normal human decency. This isnt me being some big crazy Autistic. This is them sensing vulnerability and pouncing. I really dont give a f*** about their anxiety and trauma. That trauma doesnt excuse them from trying, and doesnt mean I have to sit there and take their abuse. But because, since we were small, everyone has trained her to think Im less-than, crazy, or a monster, she still defaults to that mode of thinking. It f******** hurts! Im tired of it. I tried to explain that this is a long term pattern. She accused me of having a one sided memory, and only remembering how others hurt me. Its fair to assume that I do remember everything from my point of view, and tend to put greater importance on my hurts. But thats not what she is complaining about. I tried to explain its about ballence. She puts people into 100% good, or 100% bad categories. This isnt love, because it denies the fact that people are contradictory, so in order to sustain this you have to ignore parts of their personality, Just because I remember the bad stuff, doesnt mean I dont also remember the good stuff. But I refuse to let it go when she wants to forget the bad stuff. I try to see people accurately. I feel like its a way to fight abuse. I even demonstrated with a long list of my flaws. They dont make me a bad person. They are things I need to acknowledge and work on. Then she said she cant keep apologizing for things she did at 13 (those were examples of how this thinking has been life long, but what evs) and that she cant stand to be around someone as negative as me about her and everyone she loves. She also put in passive aggressive jabs about how she works full time and has four children so she doesnt have time for this. You know, because I chose not to have children and go to school. Im not doing as much as her, so I cant have any real complaints. Dude, I dont WANT a relationship with her. Ill let one happen if she wants one, but clearly she doesnt want one with me either. Weve agreed not to talk to one another for two months. I hope she doesnt talk to me for much longer, because she takes EVERYTHING out of me when she does. Next time she feels like talking, Ill reestablish the boundary. She may think Im a horrible negative monster who lives in the past, but shes welcome to. Im protecting my future. If I keep telling myself that, hopefully Ill stop feeling guilty. Now Im just worried about Big sister (40 f) calling me and taking me to task for upsetting her. Dude, if I need to blow up that relationship in order to get my boundaries respected, then I will. I dont want to, because unlike everyone else in my family, Big Sister actually seems vaguely capable of acknowledging that the way I was treated was unfair, and that Im smart for cutting off our parents. I think if it werent against her religion, shed do it. She still has flying monkey habits, as well, but they are getting weaker as she gets older. So yeah. Its right before Christmas, and rather than relaxing, Im dealing with this nonsense. I need to get better, because I have a new term of classes in January. I dont handle stress well (autism), so I need this peace, Im able to function better than I ever have, Im not lettingfamily get in the way. Thanks for listening to my rant and giving me your support,"

I have had the feelings rattling around in my head so I put them down to use later if I need them. I hope you guys get something out of it. &amp;#x200B; Dear MOM, You guys made yourselves totally clear to me at (my sister's) table. I understand you guys completely, your points got across to me. You both made it abundantly clear at (my sister's) table that my feelings, thoughts, memories, joys, hobbies and pain are both wrong and incomprehensible to you. So, it would be not only pointless but hurtful to try to open myself up again. I have accepted that you both are the way you are. That there is never going to be a wholehearted sharing of feelings or bridges of understanding between us. It is not safe to share feelings with you. Listening with your heart was not a skill that is encouraged or rewarded by you. Closeness comes from sharing and vulnerability but we cant be close because being vulnerable is not safe around you. Any doubt I had about that was completely erased watching Dad smirk at my tears or hearing you imply that I should be over my divorce in 6 months because we were separated first. So, I accept things are the way they are between us. I am a grown person that is not in prison, a drug user or homeless. You did your job, pat yourself on the back. I dont hate you but I dont love either. You are just people that raised me and say you love me but didnt like me at all. That used to make me sad but now I just accept it. I imagine it must be like being raised in a foster home, being fed and housed but resented. I have never felt the love and acceptance of a wholehearted family home. And I am not expecting or hoping for you to apologize or even understand me. My point of view is so alien to you, I know you will not even understand this letter. But it made me feel slightly better to put these thoughts down."

I grew up in this home with a narcissistic mother and narcissistic stepdad. Its scary. I just came back a few days ago, because I wanted to be around my dads side of the family.. although I ended up choosing to live at my moms because of the size of the home and the actual aesthetic of it being nicer.. Well, needless to say. It was a bad choice. The first day here, my stepdad went on an insane rampage, i was just asking about a computer keyboard if they had an extra one from an old desktop PC. He began yelling in my face, when I tried to respond he would repetitively interrupt me, and i felt really hurt and really belittled, so i locked myself in my room. Then, he came to my door and began slamming his fists on my door and yelling at me to open my door saying you cant close your door, not in my house I said im keeping it closed, i need my space And he yelled back EXCUSE ME? you dont get to have space if i say you cant So i propped up a chair against the door to keep it shut. He was extremely pissed to say the least. I felt scared and really vulnerable, i hadnt experienced anything like this for a long time either as id been living with a friend in Virginia (that bridge is burned considering we dated and broke up) Anyway.. yeah so my mom came home and i told her what happened and she was justifying his actions saying i was being annoying pestering about a keyboard even though i was being respectful. I even got to a point where i apologized for searching for an old keyboard ?? And then i told my mom i wanted to move out. they continued yelling, and my mom tried to get me and my stepdad to talk things out and i was like apoligizing, and i was trying to be respectful and he was like ok youre overreacting, this is dumb man whats your point i felt really invalidated by that so i told him like i felt invalidated by that and i needed empathy and he was refusing to empathize saying Yeah man i really dont care this isnt important to me and i just got up ajd was gonna walk away and said this wasnt going anywhere hut my mom told me to sit and then i was like Look, im moving out if this is the dynamic in this household, this is toxic and onesided And he flipped out at me again and started being sarcastic saying oh yeah your feelings are valid bro im sooo sorry and that just really showed me their maturity too. It was atrocious honestly. I told him I thought he was a psychologically abusive narcissist, so i walked away. He was like fix your shit or Get out of my house, i wont be treated this way Im thinking like touche you room temperature iq 50 year old man baby Anyway It really fucking upset me. What he did had me reliving trauma and im stuck now floating between vulnerability and anger. I dont know what to do.. i just wish i had parents that sctually loved me for me too. I grew up with my parents trying to change me all the time. Im gay and like ive always loved makeup, creative fashion etc but my parents forced me to dress in basic jock sport clothes growing up and would denounce anything that made me seem gay, and they justify their actions saying that theyre trying to protect me from bullying Right, protect me from bullying?do they not see the message that gives off Theres something wrong with you so we need to change you so people dont pick at you for it Ugh.

I was very surprised but very happy to hear that from her. I try not to get my hopes up too much though. Did that two months ago when she ended up going with her boyfriend. Got my hopes up soaring. She was kicked out and on a train back home within seven days of arriving at his place. It truly crushed me. She either gets kicked out of a roommate situation, loses her job, or her car stops working on her. So I try to be realistic instead of getting hopes too high. Her last car gave her lots of heartache by breaking down. Till she donated it. I really hope this car doesn't give her too much trouble. Anyway I broke no contact to let her know I was happy about her getting a car. That makes her life easier. I restated my boundaries. I poured my heart out to her in a brutally honest way. Didn't hold back. Wasn't cruel or aggressive. Just straight forward. I still tried to be kind. She's been bombarding me with multiple voicemails since the fifth of this month. On that day, I told her not to contact me, and hadn't responded to anything till this evening. She apologized. Very indirectly, but she apologized. She seemed heart broken, but she didn't answer aggressively. She didn't insult me. She didn't go beserk on me like most narc parents. She said she'd honor my request and wouldn't contact me until I was ready. She's still refusing to get help or admit she has a problem, but I was very moved by her response tonight. Now comes the intense wave of wondering if I've been overacting this whole time. Questioning reality. Feeling guilty. Feeling heartbroken over her passive acceptance. Feeling heart broken over her heartbreak. She's been through so much. Can't help but feel that I've abandoned her in her time of most need. That I'm the cruel, delusional, narcissist who's a bad, ungrateful child. I've been suicidal the whole month because of guilt over this situation. Been completely depressed. Thought about seriously ending it at times because the pain is so unbearable. But I won't do it, because I could never put my loved ones through that. Sorry for the long rant. Just in a very fragile state of vulnerability and pain. Deep, deep pain. Self doubt. Questioning my own sanity, reality, humanity and self absorption. Every holiday season since 2008 has been extremely hard and depressing. Year after consecutive year, the holidays have become a dreaded anniversary date, filled with apathy, angst, regret and deep pain. The holidays are a point where my suicidal ideation, depression, and agony are at an all time high (Over dramatic I know). Thanks for listening. It's just reassuring to put your voice out there. To know someone out there in the universe hears your cries. Cries you thought fell on deaf ears for the longest time.

My ex boyfriend and I split last year, a 7 year relationship. I was pretty distraught and vulnerable to say the least. My Nmom saw my vulnerability and swooped in to save me. Being financially tight after the breakup, she offered to get a place with me so we could have a nice place to live together. She convinced me to go in on a travel trailer with her as it would help build my credit and be affordable living as the trailer park fees were quite cheap. I stupidly agreed to take out a loan to pay for this trailer. A few months later, I sold the trailer for more than I bought it for. The cheque from the sale went into our shared account where I trusted she would pay the minimum payments. Stupidly. I was manipulated in my vulnerable state. Anyways, were a year later and Im in a better place emotionally, am more independent and my Nmom sees that now as a threat. Shes threatening to stop making the payments for the loan and has moved the money from the sale out of our shared account. And I am not in the right financial place to be able to make these payments, especially since I already gave her the cheque from the sale. So my question is, if anyone knows if there is anything I can do to lower the minimum payments with my bank? Or somehow prove that the sale cheque went to her account and force her to make the payments? I just dont want to ruin my good credit. But Im just not in the best place financially to afford to make these monthly payments. Im so incredibly upset with myself for being such a fool to trust my Nmom.

I had enough time to go through the whole range of possible responses to her. Mind you, initially it was incredibly difficult to hold my composure, I tried not to engage but she would just keep hammering me with ridiculous shit you shouldnt say to people. I stated that no one should have to listen to this, I asked her if she enjoyed feeling the way that she was feeling in that moment and why she continues to behave that way if it was causing her so much pain. She simply continued yelling, I asked that she not speak with me for the drive, she yelled at me to shut up, that she will talk to me how she wants, I got triggered and yelled at her to shut up too. Didnt work of course, she escalated her toxicity, she began referencing irrelevant shit from our life as reasons for why I deserve this, somehow saying even more toxic shit for why I need to shut up. I told her its really difficult to quietly drive with her yelling these absurd things. I realized engaging her wasnt working at all and switched up strategies. I calmly asked her to at least call me names in a quieter voice, that she doesnt have to yell to insult me. She was absolutely furious and didnt skip a beat, continued going off. In that moment, I turned and looked her in the eyes but what I saw completely disarmed me, all I saw was ... vulnerability.. her eyes were pleading, like a prisoner secretly begging for help, she was sad, lost, and vulnerable, it was like she couldnt help herself and all I could feel was so sorry, I felt so bad for her that her brain is wired like this. Suddenly I couldnt hear her words anymore it was like.... idk.. transcendent. I dont even remember what I said in that moment or what she was saying but she finally began calming down. God bless.

The backstory is as follow... Every year around the holidays I can't help but notice how small my family has gotten because of my Nmom and her NPD. So many people walked out of her life because of repeated toxic shaming and myriad ultimatums and insane demands that they cater to her fragile ego. My uncle ""T"" lets say bore the brunt of this because my Nmom basically put him in a position to have to choose between her and his own wife and kids. Of course he chose his family. That's insane. My Nmom has alientated so many people like this. Anytime folks would walk out of her life because of her horribly abusive behavior she would naturally paint herself as the victim and make up reasons why they were ""bad people"" and why she had to cut them off for her ""well being"" Oh and she would also forbid me and my sister from talking to them. Fast forward today, 10 years later. My mom has alienated all but 3 people from our family and these people aren't even our family. Don't get me wrong they're nice people but they're not family. Even though my mom likes to paint herself as the victim, when I think about it, I think the real victims of her NPD are me , my sister and my Dad who have been cut off from everyone because of her. Earlier this year, I finally moved out of my Nparents house and went VERY LOW CONTACT. Naturally I feel alone a lot of the time, but I also started to wonder what would happen if I contacted the family members that my Nmom cut off because of her NPD? So around Thanksgiving, I contacted Aunt ""Z"" which my Nmom cut off two years ago. To my surprise and relief Aunt Z was so happy to hear from me. She welcomed me into her home and to have thanksgiving dinner with her and my cousins who I also had not seen in 3-5 years. It all felt really good reconnecting with them. It was just so validating knowing that they weren't ""bad people"" as my Nmom said. They were just tired of her abuse and decided to go NC with her. Suffice to say, its been about 10 years since ive seen my Uncle ""T."" I did some reconnaissance work and found out they still live in the house that we used to visit when we were kids. Its less then 10 miles from where I live. I also found their phone number, though I don't know if its still the same. I want to call up, but I'm at such a loss for what to say... TLDR - N mom cut off almost all my family from me and now that I'm LC with Nmom I want to seek them out and make contact even though its been 10 years... Where do I even start? Why am I doing this? Am I just a loser who's hung up on the past for wanting to contact these people? What do I even say to them? I also have an Aunt ""R"" who is about 7 miles away and a cousin ""S"" too who I haven't seen in 15 years because of N mom. I should also point out that my memories of these family members were really sweet and altruistic , loving caring people, so I never bought into Nmom's BS that they were ""bad people"" and needed to be cut off. They're not, and I'm like 99% certain that if I reached out they wouldn't hesitate to welcome me into their homes, I'm just really scared because... this is something that requires an insane amount of vulnerability, and also to admit my Nmom is ill... But I still want to do it! Am I crazy for wanting to do this? Thanks for reading my insane ramblings and sorry if this made no sense.."
101,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Sick of my Ngrandma and bio N dad's family blaming me for my dad's lack of existence in my life! Anyone deal with estranged parents ?,1,efe8n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/efe8n9/sick_of_my_ngrandma_and_bio_n_dads_family_blaming/,2019-12-25 19:46:33,"I don't even like to call him my ""dad"" but sperm donor here lives 10 hours away and always has after he knocked my mother up. He didn't fight for any custody and just let my mother have me and there was no child support involved. I don't understand any of that, why A. My dad didn't want me and didn't even bother to fight for me, he even had my mom do a DNA test to prove that I was his ? I literally look exactly like the man ( which makes me CRINGE). B. Why did my mom not want child support? She didn't think I needed a good life in any way ? We were dirt poor, getting evicted, barley able to buy grocery's, etc . She's insanely emotionally abusive and probably just didn't want to be bothered by anyone and wanted me to herself but that's another story and I'm here to talk about sperm donor. So, he didn't support me financially, and would only visit me once every year or two when he was already coming to town to visit my grandma. He always guilted me with this line "" you are always invited to come see me, come down in the summer"". It was my choice, even as a little little kid, if I wanted to spend time with him I had to ask him on my own to go spend a week or more with a complete stranger if I ever wanted any sort of a dad. He didn't fight for some custodian rights over the summer, he didnt visit more than once a year if that to let me get to know him, what child wants to just go visit a stranger on their own 10 hours away ? I am and was a human being not some puppy you can just bring places. Once with push from my grandma I went when I was like 13 and I cried being homesick and begged my grandma to take me home. I once went on a vacation with them when I was 11 and the same thing happened. absolutely no support for anything emotionally/financially outside of a check in my birthday card and my mom begging him occasionally for money ( I saw the checks he'd fork out a 100 bucks). As a mother now it hurts more than ever his lack of existence and effort in my life. I would fight for 50/50 in court and my husband would with out a single doubt in my mind want the same thing. My husband and my daughter have a beautiful beautiful relationship and I know if we divorced he would fight for her ( I'd never make him fight, believe me I want this girl to have a healthy relationship with both parents ) I'm just saying. It's so obvious now more than ever how no effort was made by my sperm donor to have a real relationship with me and it hurts. It was too much work to go to court ? But he went through a dna test ? I wasn't worth a fight ? I know first hand how insane my mother is, but this was between us! There's no excuse! I am his daughter! My daughter is my husband and mines world I will never understand why I wasn't worth it. It makes me feel that there's something seriously wrong with me. So his mom is always making comments like "" you guys should meet up"" and what not and I never engage in it and just say yeah sure ok just to make this lady get off my back ( because I'm supposed to go out of my way to have a relationship with someone who I don't really know ). This year she goes "" he's coming up for Christmas, you guys should meet up ( not sperm donor asking, his effen mom is asking ) OBVIOUSLY to me he does not care about seeing me he doesn't even call/text me when he comes up his effen mom does like he's a 12 year old boy who doesn't wanna see a family member and his mommy's making him. I replied no, I'm not going to meet up with him. And she goes ok maybe in the future then ( when she askes me next , not him!) My entire life my sperm donor and his mom have made me feel like it's my job / responsibility to go out of my way to visit / see someone who doesn't want to be my dad. The visits I did have with him we're incredibly awkward and I could tell he just felt like he had to see me sort of a thing not because he desired it. So I took the step to cut off contact with him and stop these visits because I couldn't stop having panic attacks and crying the second I got in my car after listening to his stories of how he's raising his kids and how hard teenagers are, like I am some co worker of his and not his own daughter. Like a total disregard for my feelings and who I am, his daughter too. I had vented to him once about how upsetting our relationship was to me , I figured I had nothing to lose and maybe a relationship to gain, maybe he has his reasons and whatever, he told me I didn't know the "" whole story"" and promised he wanted to talk when he visited next, I was excited af thinking I'm gonna have this heart to heart and have a dad I always wanted, well the visit happened and he didn't say a single thing about it, too much effort, too much vulnerability for his ego ? I was able to reach out to a guy I barley know and tell him my most personal feelings about not feeling wanted and he couldn't even bring it up. Once again, it was probably supposed to be my responsibility, I was supposed to bring it up, ""so about you not wanting me ?"" How degrading to beg for these answers. So I cried my eyes out and that was the last time I saw him. My wedding was coming and I texted him he wasn't invited, after he said on a phone call he'd be waiting for the invitation, because we have no relationship and issues, I said I'd like to fix them but not with the goal to be so he can come to my wedding, but to have a real relationship ( why did I keep trying! So humiliating!) It honestly was going to make me dread my wedding day, he sends me into panic attacks and crying, so I said So maybe we could talk it out in the future. He didn't reply, and apparently his wife trashed me to that side of the family how dare I not invite them to my wedding ( I LITERALLY BARLEY KNOW THEM!). A few months after my daughter was born, I was emotional and once again told my dad how upset I was about his lack of effort to pursue a relationship and how he has a grand daughter he's never met and how that is sad ( humiliating ug uh uggg!!) And this time he replies im hateful and need to stop sending him hateful messages. I tell him these are my deepest feelings how can he disregard me as hateful, and told him not to worry I won't text again. He never said anything. So now I'm back to every year my grandma saying I should reach out or something. I should call him up and make plans. I know she means well, but I wish she'd get the damage she does constantly reinforcing it that it's my job to continue to beg for this relationship that he clearly does not want with me. Can she not reflect that he can call me and ask me to meet up and talk but never has and never will ? I tried. He never has and it is so painful. I call my grandma a N because she called me fat growing up and would literally make fun of my appearance, and my dad because he's incapable of reflection and only cares about himself. Thanks for listening to my rant if anyone does. This shit just hurts merry Christmas."

However, she doesnt mention that at home she cant stop talking about how lazy, unforgiving, and selfish I am of a person. Im the reason she is fat, why were not rich, why were not living somewhere better, and I need to try harder. She doesnt mention how when she doesnt get her way or if I disagree with her, she spits on me, hits me, emotionally plays with me and constantly invalidates my feelings. Im the emotionally unstable and lazy son who is the source of all of her troubles yet to everyone else Im their best friend. The moment I realized how fucked yo she was, was when I realized she took advantage of my vulnerability when I was 9 and my parents were going through their divorce. It makes sense because she doesnt have friends, she doesnt have any love interests no one except me, Im the person she lives through, her only friends she has are through me. Anyways, mom took advantage of me by using my shitty dads choices to cheat on her as a reason for me to stay with her. She made me hate him, she made me stay with her by having break downs all the time, crying endless crocodile tears until one day I told my dad I wasnt going to come over his house anymore. She made me take theatre and put me through tap classes and when she figured out I was decent I started being forced to go to auditions. She would use coercive and manipulative tactics, telling me she wouldnt take me to places I liked unless I kept going. She would exaggerate everything I did to other parents so that they would see me both as an AMAZING actor and dancer but also turn them against me. Anyone didnt buy into her delusions was an enemy, and they were mine as well. If I wasnt better than everyone else, I was a nobody. She would tell me everyday that she was waiting for me to make it on broadway, telling me I was too fat to get a lead part, and she consistently tells me that shes waiting for me to buy her a house, take her with me to college. I thought it was a joke, but I dont think that anymore. She touches me both when I was younger and sometimes recently, she says that she made me so she can"

But I can't help but feel like a teenage kid again in trouble with my whole family. I'm finally in therapy and I attempted to keep that quiet but that news spread like wildfire. This time, my nmom is not at all involved in my therapy like she was in the past and was able to manipulate to benefit her ability to control. So basically what I mean is that I'm finally getting therapy lol Long story short, I made a huge mistake of venting to my nmom thinking we had repaired our relationship a few months ago, about a pretty serious situation in my life. The word spread like wildfire through the family, as my dumb ass shoulda known it would, and I don't have proof of it but invites by obscure relatives who don't ever respond to my Happy Whatever Holiday texts is evidence enough for me that they're doin Ma a favor by reaching out to my problem-child-ass. Where I fucked up is by letting them in on a vulnerability of mine. Now they're on attack mode, thinking they're helping. The Family Gossip got to me first and ruined my weekend right as I was finally able to get my head out of The Swamps of ""I'm in trouble"" and back into the present. The texts from this person, a sibling of my nmom, it's so incredibly textbook to the things I read on here all of the time about toxic behavior. ""Don't ignore me. I'm not done talking about this yet."" Well. I was. I have been in a state of panic since my therapy session. I need a professional and self care and to be able to be present when I'm with my son. The Family Gossip proceeded to tell me that the things I went through as a child weren't as big as I make it out to be and I am the perpetual victim. ""Imagine their childhood, where he saw Grandma cheating on Grandpa and then Grandpa beating the shit out of her and sometimes them. Think about how much I hurt my mother by becoming an alcoholic when she did everything she could to ensure you were raised in a dry home. And how she feels knowing she has two kids that are alcoholics."" Then some fabricated parts of the story arose, such as, ""Oh, your aunt talked to you and said you were so drunk she couldn't understand you."" Oh really. Because I have my complete call history for the past three months and Aunt BlahBlahBlah's not in here once. Funny how I didn't become an alcoholic until after those failed stints in therapy led to me being moved to where she lives, where I didn't know anyone and completely isolated me from where I grew up. My nmom stayed with my father after he choked me until I had bruises around my eyes when I was three years old. My nmom waited around for years for that dude to get out of prison, only to emotionally and eventually physically abuse me and my siblings. I then watched her fabricate stories and lie to her family members completely about how she kicked his ass out to protect her kids, but the truth was she fucked him every night that month. I know because she did it with the door open and my room was right across the hall. I could forgive the shit from the past. She was young once, too. I was sexually assaulted a few years ago and she was the first I told. She took his side. Then when I said I was going to police with my story because he was arrested for doing worse to another woman less than a fucking month after what he did to me, she told me to ""think about if my brother were in that situation. He was drunk, too. People make mistakes when they're drunk."" I even forgave that. But you can bet your ass I haven't taken any sliver or shred of advice from her after that. It took two years in court to convict that guy. It's only been two years since. I am a fucking mess of a person right now, yes I can admit that. But breaking a four month streak of sobriety is something I have to answer to myself, I don't need these judgy bastards hitting me up with their false concerns, because honestly it seems to be coming from a place of utter boredom with their own lives. And the anxiety I keep feeling every time I get a text or a phone call right now has me really struggling not to fall off again before I go see my therapist tomorrow. I'll be alright, though. Thanks for the venting space. I'm finally admitting it to myself that I was raised by narcissists. I'm way too old and grown and terrified about fleas, but I'm on the right track.

Background: I work with my narcissistic mother who runs a small healthcare IT company. One of our main projects is developing an app. She is the product owner, I was the product manager, and we contract out the software engineering to a small team of 4-5 developers. The Breakdown: One month ago the developers informed me of a security vulnerability. I told this to the product owner, who responded, ""sounds good. we need protection. We'll pay ..."" I also included this in my bullet-point summary notes after my meeting with the engineers and reminded them again 4 days later. Note: THEY ARE THE ONLY ONE WITH THEIR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. Fast forward one month. The app doesn't work because a hacker exploited the vulnerability. Our users are trying to use the product and cannot. The product owner starts sending nasty messages to the developers and also writes that the developers blamed the outage on me in their 1-on-1 communication in a place where both the devs and I can see it. (Turns out, after speaking to the developers directly a couple of days later, they were only saying that it was only one of many possibilities and was quickly disregarded as a reason. Note: I have a good relationship with them in general.) The nasty messages continue for a few days as the engineers work to restore the app to working properly. I basically remain quiet during this time as it doesn't really involve me. Once it's back working, the product owner schedules a meeting to discuss the outage. In this meeting, both the developers and I state that the issue made its way effectively up the chain of communication to the product owner who acknowledged the issue, said they were going to do something about (again, they are the only one with the credit card information to make a payment), and then didn't. A couple of days later the news breaks that a new product manager (my role) is being brought on. This is a guy who has done some back end development on the app but is not a product manager and we don't need two product managers. Basically I feel both sad and hurt by all this. I'm essentially being replaced for a mistake that I didn't make. It was 100% the product owner's fault that the outage occurred and I have the documents to prove it. Had they owned up to it, we could have easily moved on as a team and kept being productive. Instead, I'm the scapegoat for their mistake. I'm sad because other than dealing with their regular outbursts I actually very much enjoy the work. I'm hurt that they would do this to me when I've done nothing wrong. TL;DR I work with my narcissistic mother. After they made a mistake (there was a security vulnerability in the company's app that I told them about on 3 separate occasions, they acknowledged, and then did nothing about even though it required payment and they are the only one with the corporate credit card information) I'm being replaced and treated like dirt."

I do realize that i could be completely wrong but hear me out please. Just a little bio of my mom. My mom is a helicopter parent. She is also kinda strict at times and she is pretty nosy in what i do every day, where i go , and even who my friends are. If my mom had the opportunity, she would even hand pick my friends and make every major decision for my life (and of course i will not allow that to happen). According to the [Mayo Clinic.org](URL , here are the symptoms of a Narcissistic Personality Disorder * Have an exaggerated sense of self-importance * ***Have a sense of entitlement and require constant, excessive admiration*** * Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it * Exaggerate achievements and talents * ***Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate*** * Believe they are superior and can only associate with equally special people * ***Monopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferior*** * ***Expect special favors and unquestioning compliance with their expectations*** * Take advantage of others to get what they want * ***Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others*** * ***Be envious of others and believe others envy them*** * Behave in an arrogant or haughty manner, coming across as conceited, boastful and pretentious * ***Insist on having the best of everything  for instance, the best car or office*** Everything in bold and italics above are the symptoms i believe my mom has. The [Mayo Clinic](URL also states that ""At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they perceive as criticism, and they can:"" (everything that is in bold and in italics are the behaviors my mom shows "" * ***Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special treatment*** * Have significant interpersonal problems and easily feel slighted * ***React with rage or contempt and try to belittle the other person to make themselves appear superior*** * ***Have difficulty regulating emotions and behavior*** ( I see this in my mom sometimes) * ***Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change*** * Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection * Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, vulnerability and humiliation One example that can support my theory of my mom having a Narcissists behavior is about 2 years ago, I told my parents that I wanted to change my major in college. I was originally going to get a B.A in Nursing. And guessed who talked me into going to college for nursing ? Yep , your right. My mom talked me into going to college for nursing . (before i actually wanted to go into the military after high school but that's a story for another day.) She was telling me about about what nurses do (she mentioned to me all of the great things nurses do but fail to mention to me all of crappy stuff nurses have to do) , she told me that i have a great personality and she really did persuaded me to be a nurse. I almost forgot, she also mentioned that nurses can make a crap ton of money. After she persuaded me, she was pretty happy to tell everyone she knows that her son is going to college to be a nurse. Well a year after college , i told my parents that i didn't want to be a nurse and she wasn't at all pleased to hear the news (which is understandable ). But the way she reacted to the news is kinda interesting. She started to say comments like ""well..... well..... what am i going to tell everyone now ?"" and ""do u want to live poor?"" &amp;#x200B; Again, I know i am not a doctor and i no that my mom does not check every single box that states that she has this disorder but i believe she might."

Their singer, Morrissey, is one of the most unique vocalists in the history of pop music. He expressed a vulnerability and alienation and mordant literacy that was utterly unique for the time. He was a celibate rock star who danced about on stage with a tree jutting out of his back pocket. And, not least important, he was a brilliant songwriter and melodist. I adored his music and his image. But then I started watching interviews with him and getting to know him. The more I listened to him, the more he reminded me of my NDad. My Dad doesn't have an artistic or cool bone in his body, and he's explicitly hostile to the tradition and sensibility which Morrissey represents. Yet, still, despite their differences, they appeared more and more similar as I progressed. It thus didn't surprise me that Morrissey had acquired a reputation for racism and for right-wing authoritarian sympathizing. It didn't surprise me that he has a reputation for harboring an inordinate persecution complex regarding the English press. In order to maintain the conviction that he's never wrong about anything, he chose to believe that the journalists who criticized his bigotry were doing so merely because they were embittered by the fact that he was famous and they weren't. He has voiced that sentiment in several interviews and sources. I've read the articles which he addressed, and they were serious and thoughtful and emotional things written by Smiths fans who were devastated that their musical hero had used his platform and influence to promote groups and ideologies with destructive real-world consequences. That he'd callously dismiss these articles as a conspiracy theory concocted by vindictive journalists who were criticizing him solely because they were jealous of his wealth/fame, is, well, essentially identical to what my NDad would have done in the situation. And, more, he surrounds himself with pathological sycophants. I sensed his narcissism because *something about him reminded me of my NDad.* And then I did some research and learned that he's a fairly substantial narcissist who would be diagnosed as such. I still love his music."

He can still walk and talk but I don't know for how much longer. He has been married to my Narcissist Borderline Mom for over 40 years, and I have been alive to witness the last 30 of those years as their son adopted from birth. In all my life, I never saw a person who didn't absolutely adore my dad. He's funny, charming, dutiful, dependable, humble, competent, loving, loyal and everything a man should aspire to be. But he has been conditioned by my NMom to serve and worship her every narcissistic tendency, even at the expense of me. He supplies her with and endless stream of adoration and she sucks the well dry for everything its worth. For the last 20 years he has been a shell of his former self. And for the last 6 years he has been a shell of a shell, sunk so deep into depression that I think the fact that he hasn't attempted suicide, to my knowledge, is a testament to his amazing spirit and character. He has been a firefighter, navy veteran, artist, painter, paramedic, business owner, foster father to dozens of kids, and more than I really even know. I'm the last child of 8 born/adopted, more than 50 fostered children whose experience of the family has mostly involved listening to stories of earlier days from parents and siblings alike. Much like the 1980's, my family feels like the party that I just barely missed. Over the past year I finally discovered what my mom is. I stumbled upon information about BPD and NPD, and listening to the experts describe these personality disorders feels like listening to somebody describe my mom to the letter. I'm still learning about these things and unraveling what happened to me, sorting through the parts of me that are actually me and the parts that are her. Every topic I read on this sub has me grabbing my hair and shouting at the screen that yes, this is exactly what it's like. I can't even describe what a relief it is to be alleviated of a lifetime of believing that I'm the problem, and finally being able to put names to the insidious behaviors that I've struggled and failed all my life to make sense of, to describe to the rare person who would listen. Anyway, the dilemma I face at this stage of my life is whether or not to share this information with my dad. Will he feel as relieved as I do? Or will he do what he has always done? When he identifies a piece of information that poses a threat to my mom's narcissistic needs, my dad will attempt to eliminate the threat at all costs. Sometimes that means silently withholding a harmless truth. And sometimes that means becoming physically hostile and threatening, shouting at the top of his lungs that I'm never to question my mother's rightness and righteousness under any circumstances because she's my mother. As a young adult this most often happened in the form of threatening to kick me out of the house. Considering that the roles of dependence are reversed, that threat isn't a part of my parents' arsenal anymore. I have so many questions for my dad. Like why didn't he divorce her? I would have been okay if he divorced her at a certain age. Why didn't he stand up for me against her? Why didn't he stand up for himself? Did he suspect that there was something wrong with her? How much of her bullshit did he really believe? Did he sincerely believe he deserved 100% of the blame for everything? Or did he simply decide that it wasn't worth the fight? Did he think it was fair to transfer the costs of his abusive marriage to his son? I run the encounter through my mind, trying out different ways I might go about it. I couldn't say some of those things without hurting him. The part of me that wants to soften the pain as much as possible is in conflict with the part of me that wants to put some of the blame back where it belongs, and demand answers for his shortcomings as a father and a man. For not standing up for himself, not even on behalf of his son. And forcing me to capitulate to the toxic needs of an abusive parent by tiptoeing around eggshells, conditioning me to suppress everything, from my problems to my very personality. Neither of my parents know who I am because I spent a lifetime subconsciously hiding myself from her, the family and everyone she knows. Because they all report back to her. At some point in my childhood I learned that the more information my mom has about me, the more she can and will hurt me with it. Every vulnerability is future ammunition, and she is always, always keeping score. I do not open up to my mom about anything anymore, ever. Trust is gone. Well, what do you think I should do regarding my dad? What would you do?"

Narcissistic parents can respond in many ways to an adult child relinquishing all contact with the abusive family. For some parents, they couldnt care less if their scapegoat child leaves the family unit. They will scapegoat them in absentia by continuing to rehash old stories which deem the scapegoat unstable, and they will distribute them among the scapegoaters. These repeated conversations are often fuel enough to relieve the narcissists emptiness. Smearing their scapegoat sibling gives these siblings a major self-esteem boost, and increases their feelings of superiority over this victim of abuse. However, for many narcissistic parents, and the family scapegoats siblings; the disappearance of this supposedly troubled child eventually becomes quite alarming and confronting to say the least. Scapegoated children are A grade narcissistic supply for their narcissistic parent. Why? The family scapegoat engages with the narcissist, gives into the narcissistic provocations, and will not hesitate to go into battle with the narcissist and expose the narcissists poor behaviour. Seeing the family system for what it is, is a double-edged sword for this child. They, unlike their cloned siblings, cannot sit back and simply say nothing about the abuse they are witnessing. They are now a target for goading, and baiting; as well as a buffer for the other siblings (if there are any). The golden child (or children) will subconsciously hide behind the scapegoat, ( the child on the front line) and will endure less abuse at the scapegoats expense. These children will learn quickly that they too can blame the scapegoat for their own poor behaviour, claiming all along in alignment with the narcissist that the scapegoats instability is the reason for the families abuse towards them. They buy into the lie to protect themselves from further abuse and often watch on with little remorse while their scapegoat family member cops the brunt of the emotional abuse. So when the scapegoat finally decides that enough is enough, the family becomes responsible for the dysfunctional family dynamic that continues with or without their scapegoat. With the scapegoat gone the narcissist is at a loss and must find a new sparring partner. The adult children are also at a loss because they can no longer blame their vile behaviour on the scapegoat. Why will the narcissist begin to turn on another family member? Nobody can be the perfect mirror. The scapegoats imperfections and the fact the narcissist cant control the scapegoat have been the narcissists two primary concerns for decades. However, with the scapegoat gone, the enabling parents imperfections will most likely become a cause for concern; and complete control over this parent will become the narcissists goal. The inability of this new source to be the perfect mirror, or to remain under the complete control of the narcissist is going to become an issue for the narcissist and the replacement scapegoat. The same siblings who were taught by their narcissistic parent that goading, baiting and/ or physically abusing the scapegoat was totally understandable due to the scapegoats imagined issues, will now have no choice but to direct what are hardwired patterns of bullying behaviour, towards someone else. These siblings will most likely end up fighting with one another. Afterall, they have been taught it is acceptable to project and disown your own shortcomings onto innocent bystanders. However, before any of these scenarios have a chance to take place; or while theyre taking place, either the narcissist, or another family member (probably the newest scapegoat) will subconsciously, or even deliberately try to hoover the family scapegoat back into the family to relieve the pressure from the pressure cooker, and to hand it back over to the most engaging family member, the family scapegoat. **So, what happens when the scapegoat leaves?** The pressure in the family unit becomes intensified. After a period of mutual silence between the narcissist and the scapegoat; or a silent treatment dished out to the scapegoat as a punishment, (a certain amount of months or years) the narcissist or the enabling parent will most likely try to re-enter the scapegoats life. Why? The enabling parent is probably sparring with the narcissist daily, (unless one of the adult children has become the focus) and is most likely realising that their partner is impossible to please. Both parents can no longer blame the scapegoat for the continuing negative family dynamics if they arent there. Once hoovered back in, the abuse heightens towards the official scapegoat, who, after a period of love-bombing is targeted for more abuse. The narcissist will drink up the delicious fuel the drama has created and will feign victimhood (more fuel) to all who will listen to the smear campaign. The drama from the emotional assault on the scapegoat will be fuel enough until the narcissist begins to run on empty again. Then the cycle will start again. **Why is no contact so hard to maintain?** For some scapegoats, no contact isnt difficult to maintain. These scapegoats dont second-guess themselves, dont believe any of the narcissistic projections that were thrown their way, and are so incredibly strong that they would never allow narcissistic hoovering to get the better of them. However, for many, theyve had to learn the hard way. Some people have to go back and forth from no contact a few times before they finally realise that when they break no contact, the abuse gets worse. For these scapegoats, they have been riddled with guilt after enforcing no contact. If one has forgiven way too many times, given way too many chances, and has honestly believed that in time relationships with parents and siblings could be mended, then the strength to maintain no contact wasnt there. I honestly believe that most scapegoats will continue to break no contact until somebody (whether that be a counsellor or a friend) informs them they may be dealing with a narcissist. This will lead to further research on narcissistic abuse. As children, we become reliant on our parents. We believe they will always be in our lives. Not having them in our lives for the rest of our lives is often unfathomable. The belief in the family unit as a whole, societies pressure to sustain the family unit, a lack of life experience, and next to nil knowledge about personality disorders has made many scapegoats susceptible to countless hoovers, numerous love-bombing attempts, and what I like to call relationship amnesia. Once a scapegoat discovers that the narcissist is a false self, and there is no real sense of self or purpose for the narcissist, other than creating chaos in the lives of other people, the scapegoat will be able to hold no contact. **Low self-esteem will hinder no contact attempts** A scapegoat child with an extremely malignant parent will most likely be fraught with low-self esteem, poor self-image, nil confidence, and a deep-seated belief stemming from childhood that everything negative that happens in their life is truly their own fault, The brainwashed child will most likely have a toxic inner critic, who will shame them daily. This second-guessing of themselves well into adulthood means they are susceptible to manipulation from toxic people; especially an enabling parent and siblings. It is extremely difficult to stand your ground and stay no contact when one has accepted the negative messages relayed to them from their parent about themselves, as the truth. From a logical point of view, if the scapegoat is the bad one in the relationship, then maybe the relationship is fixable. If they can fix themselves, then all of their relationships with family members will work. This perception is exactly what the narcissist wants. This overall poor self-concept and inability to believe in their own perceptions may see the scapegoat stay in the situation way longer than they would have if they werent second-guessing themselves; or they may simply go back and forth from no contact, before they finally succeed in standing their ground and maintaining it. **Why does the family scapegoat break no contact?** Relationship amnesia, emotional vulnerability, a death in the family, continued relationships with manipulative family members who lay on the guilt trip, and the narcissistic hoover (often played out through flying monkeys) are some of the reasons as to why a scapegoat child could break no contact with an abusive parent. **Relationship amnesia:** When unfamiliar with the key traits of NPD, one can forget very quickly the original reasons why they left the abusive family. A few grand gestures from a narcissist and that good old fake false kindness is perfect to suck a scapegoat back in. When people are being overly nice and loving, their abusive behaviour is often forgotten about until next time. It is so hard to remember the abuse ever was when someone is bending over backwards for you; until, of course, you know the game. One nice text, a few lovely emails, or birthday presents in the mail, can make a victim of abuse begin to believe that the narcissist does care about them. Hoovers such as these have the ability to put the victim back into the original fog of relationship amnesia. Relationship amnesia is very common for children of narcissists. We all want to see those acts of kindness as love, making amends, or a genuine apology. It is, after all, an unbelievable and unfathomable concept to think a parent would go to all this trouble to repair what was a broken relationship, only to idealise, devalue, then discard their adult child once again. **Emotional vulnerability:** No contact brings with it emotional vulnerability. A psychotic breakdown, loss of a job, a marital breakdown, or some other major crisis may make a scapegoat vulnerable to being hoovered. Hoovers are almost always successful when life is falling apart. I once had a therapist tell me that it is very common for toxic parents to deliberately try to re-enter their adult childs life when they are in crisis. Why? Their defences are down. **A death in the family:** A death in the family appeals to a scapegoats guilt complex. It is extremely common for narcissistic parents to try to reconnect at funerals, weddings, and other family celebrations; particularly if the scapegoat still has contact with extended family members such as cousins, aunts and uncles. It is not uncommon for a scapegoat adult child to reconnect with the narcissistic parent once the narcissists spouse has died. Its a vulnerable time for a scapegoat where lots of emotions are flowing, making them susceptible to manipulation, and hoovering. It usually ends in disaster. The scapegoat gives and gives, only to be turned against, again. **Contact with family members under the spell of mind control:** A narcissist wanting to get back into contact with their loss of supply (thats all we are) will often use family members the scapegoat was closest to, to act as resources to hoover the scapegoat back into the narcissists life. **And may the guilt trips prevail.** Continuing contact with siblings and an enabling parent, while remaining no contact with a narcissistic parent is often to the detriment of the family scapegoat. Even though these people may continue to be kind to the scapegoat; if they still have regular contact with the narcissist, then it is likely these family members will fall under the narcissists spell and will try to the manipulate the scapegoat into reconnecting with the narcissist at some point. Why? At the end of the day, the enabling parent protects the narcissist, and the siblings have been trained to do the same. When push comes to shove these people will always go in to bat for the narcissist, not the victim of abuse. Most of them are abuse apologists. Protecting the scapegoat doesnt protect the enabling parent or the siblings from further narcissistic abuse tactics. Instead, disagreeing with the perpetrator and defending the scapegoat will end in these family members being bullied too. Comments such as youre not honouring your mother or father, you really should forgive them, theyre only human, youve always been strong-willed, and youre just so stubborn are all aimed at disabling a scapegoat victims confidence in their decision to stay away from abusive people. In my opinion, it is not possible to have relationships with family members that associate with the narcissist. If not now, but in ten years from now, the narcissist will find a way to destroy these family members relationships with the scapegoat too. Having contact with immediate family members leaves the gate wide open for hoovering opportunities from a dangerous parent. Sad, but true. At the end of the day, the aim of the game for a narcissist is to break as many bonds as they possibly can. **Is the narcissist going to release the scapegoat from their clutches?** In a lot of cases, the answer to this really depends on what was exposed prior to discarding. If the scapegoat went out with a bang and exposed a series of heinous abuses, then the family will most likely never contact the scapegoat again. However, if the discard was simply in regard to the scapegoat disagreeing with an opinion, for taking away the attention from the narcissist, or for asking for support (all big no-nos) than the family scapegoat can probably expect to be guilted and manipulated by the narcissists brainwashed flying monkeys at some point. This is why it is so important to get no contact down pat and to make sure all of the hoover points for contact are non-existent. This ability to keep the boat watertight often comes with age, and trial and error. A young adult is more vulnerable to being hoovered back into the family than a much older adult who has gone through the cycle of abuse too many times to count. Going no contact is not easy to do, and you can expect to be hoovered at some point by somebody in the family. However, it is imperative that a target of abuse never affiliates with the abusive people again. If they do, the abuse only gets worse; and the victim always ends up going no contact again anyway. The young and youthful often give second. third and fourth chances, before they make the final cut. Its to be expected."

I lived out of a shelter for 2-3 months and then lived out of a tent for about half a year. The choice was for my own safety, and Im aware that sounds totally counter-intuitive. But please hear me out, it really was. I was going to kill myself if I didn't get away from my controlling Nmom. No hyperbole here, I genuinely felt like I had no other way out. She had me completely isolated from any friends and family, other than our household, and getting my own place properly and with her cooperation was out of the question. She'd shit on me at ANY suggestion that I wanted to leave, ""how do you honestly think you'll survive without me"" was the basic speech. She'd continue to make me feel bad for making the suggestion until I eventually just... Gave up on the idea on ever leaving. I was gunna be stuck being her terrified pet child trapped in the cage she called a home for the rest of my life. Eventually, I couldnt take it anymore, so my choices were run away, or die. I already had two suicide attempts under my belt and I was determined this third attempt was gunna be the charm. Thankfully I realised before going through that I didnt *really* want to die, it just felt like my only option to get out of a bad situation. Homelessness seemed like a better option than suicide after that realization. Partly because it felt like she'd win if I killed myself, and partly because though I'd be starting from the bottom, I'd maybe have a fighting chance. So I ran the fuck away, and I'd do it again. In a weird way, I flourished being on the streets. My time being homeless was some of the best of my life so far, I met some amazing people, and learned a lot about myself during that time. I think its because I no longer had my Nmom's negativity constantly feeding into my already existing anxieties about life. If I came to her with a situation I needed help with, she'd pick at any vulnerability and fear I had expressed, and by the end of the conversation I'd be so afraid and anxious of making ANY decision that I would be paralyzed into doing *nothing*. I used to think I was indecisive like she was, turns out she'd just trained her indecision into me by years of psychological abuse. To her if I didnt (over)analyze a situation like she did I was stupid, and I should be ""smarter than that"". But if I *did* analyze it the way she wanted me to, I was being too paranoid and needed to chill out. I lost no matter what I did. After a few months of being free and homeless, I already was seeing improvements in myself. I wasnt afraid to make decisions I needed to, at least not as much. I still heard her voice in the back of my head, but it was much easier to ignore it. Without having her negativity in stereo, both in my ear *and* in my head, she couldnt limit me anymore. I could just make my decisions and it really *wasnt* the end of the world if things didnt go as planned. I was independent, and I would even dare to say I had more confidence in myself than ever before, despite being a homeless person. Dont get me wrong, being homeless had its share of bad and sometimes scary times, but it was nothing compared to what I had to deal with at home. It was easy in comparison, honestly. Unfortunately though, less than a year ago I had to move back in with my Nmom due to an exboyfriend who was threatening my life and I had nowhere else to hide for a while. She was nice for a bit while I healed up from a fractured wrist my ex had given me, but it didnt take long for the 'honeymoon phase' to end after my return. She was back to trying beating down what little confidence I had gained, and keeps an even firmer grasp on me to keep me from leaving again. Even my cig breaks are monitered and if she leaves the house I *have* to go with her so she can keep an eye on me. Very quickly she's managed isolated me again, and has taken any semblance of a life outside the house from me. I'm back in my cage with no real freedom but there's one thing she cant take from me, and that is that I learned I'm one tough motherfucker, I *can* survive without her, and in much harsher conditions than she could ever handle. I chose being homeless over being hopeless, and I'd do it again."

She puts me under a looking glass at all times and ridicules me for the smallest mishaps, which, as you could imagine leads to some serious self esteem and social anxiety problems. I can only think of one example from the top of my head, I'm pretty sore rn. One time I moved a chord which she has been using and PUT IT BACK WHERE I FOUND IT, but didnt plug it in, she wasnt charging anything with the chord so it shouldnt have affected anything, and when she found it, she spent an hour screaming at me, calling me horrible names such as a ""bitch"". I've never told her anything personal about myself as I've never had such a relationship with her and never really trusted her, as anything I ever told her when I was younger because I'd always come to soon find that information in the hands of people who she told, and so I've learned to keep everything private. My dad on the other hand has always been a 'psychopath' (sorry, cant think of a better word for it) and all of my memories as a kid of him are of him yelling and screaming at me and my brother for even the smallest of mistakes. The difference between my mother and my father, is that if you take away all of the horrible stuff my mother did, there might be some sort of a relationship there. Everytime I am upset with my mother she brings up how she raised me and all the things she did for me and would say ""no mother would do for their children what I've done for you"". Now mind you, I've never gone without as a child, I've pretty much had all i wanted, but a normal relationship with my parents. The other day I was broken up with, and out of a moment of vulnerability, I told her not only about the breakup, but about several other things in the past and why i was so hurt. I dont know why, but I expected her to keep this in confidence, I should've known better. Come tonight, I was sleeping, and woke up from screaming and yelling, to find out my mom told my dad what I told her, and my dad essentially saying that I should've known and if I didnt make myself so available this wouldn't have happened and that I just let guys use me, pretty much implying that I'm a whore. (This relationship lasted months btw and I am still very raw at the moment). And when I started crying and telling her that she shouldnt have told him, she called me a ""Selfish bitch"" and has spent the last hour screaming at me calling me the same names as always and keeps saying ""fuck her"". I dont know what to do, I just feel so naked and so hurt."
112,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,ACON NarcMagnet,2,dh8b5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/dh8b5m/acon_narcmagnet/,2019-10-13 20:18:15," Replace Selfish Lover with \^Narcissistic Soul Crusher\^ The result of being a selfish lover is often either to find an extraordinary giver who can tolerate what feels like immense restrictive behavior or to have multiple superficial relationships. AKA a Narcissist can only handle a Self Esteem Devoid Doormat and/or a Harem This keeps the selfish lover in an unthreatened mode so they then can feel as though they dont have to answer to anyone. Perhaps the greatest obstruction to the selfish lover is that he or she is afraid to learn at a later stage in life. AKA Narcs get worse with age. They are accountable to no one, especially not those they are draining for supply. Selfish lovers are easily threatened, so complaints about them, to them, will rarely work. Talking it out in the usual way is not an option. Don't talk, don't explain, stop questioning and just RUN! &amp;#x200B; Solutions 1. Find other places to invest your loving energy besides the lover; this will reduce your own torture AGAIN if you can run! 2. Confront your own pain and recognize things that you need to develop. Often, selfish lovers will respond with affection when they feel your own emptiness as they will feel less alone AKA If you have low self esteem and porous boundaries you will be targeted, bombarded with intermittent reinforcement, until you are batshit, simply to amuse the Narc. None of it means anything to them. None of it is real. It is entertainment. 3. Differentiate between the need to resuscitate an internally dead person and actual love. If the selfish lover brings out the craving in you, do not think of it as life. Instead, recognize your own addiction to this AKA Narcs gaslight their partners and or children into believing the barrage of subtle and not so subtle abuses they subject their victims to are simply the price of being in a relationship; they normalize it. 4. When you do talk to your selfish lover, focus on their strengths as they are generally insecure. Dont let your anger get the better of you, but dont also pretend not to ever be angry or sad. Find the right balance for you AKA Gray rock, never criticize, or attempt to appeal to their non existent empathy. They have no empathy. None. You are only making yourself more sick and entangled with a demon every time you speak. 5. When you talk to them, help them find things in their lives that will help them feel more self-connected. This will pay-off in your own relationship. I'm not sure about this one. If all else fails, leaving is always an option, but with your addiction to selfish lovers, you are likely to find another or turn them into one. Some soul-searching may help you make better future choices. AKA you get one Narc per lifetime. After that, its your fault. RUN FAST AND QUIETLY, you might have to embrace having a record if you have children with theses beast and if they are in the position to file interference with custody or parental kidnapping criminal charges. Okay now here's some legit questions: How do you live outside your craving? This what I did, I stopped contacting him for 2 months, then yesterday i decided to pour through our court mandated parenting app record. And boy was it rough to relive. I had begged and pleaded with him long after I was aware of his affliction. And he was lapping every second of it up. It is very difficult to truly accept these demons for the worthless evil fragile sacks of shit they are without going full no contact. You might think you're doing a good job at Grey rocking. You're not, any contact is too much contact. What are you avoiding doing by being addicted to abuse? I;m avoiding acknowledging my tender heart and vulnerability. Running from the fact that being raised by narcissists and being raped as a child did change me for life. None of it was my fault but I sure was abusing myself like it was. Still am. How can you turn your loving energy into something that gives back to you? Create an in depth autobiographical history, and reference it often. Then learn to practice self love instead of self pity. Also no contact. &amp;#x200B; BOOM."

My stability in relationships is almost nonexistent because I cant even make words come out of my mouth when Im feeling insecure or jealous or worried or alone. You know how partners confide in one another? Yeah theres no chance id ever be able do that on a deep level, I cant physically speak the words. If I feel vulnerable thats it, Ill push someone away. I wont tell them whats wrong ever because its always been used against me eventually. And thats ironic because we live in a world now where people are obsessed with talking about your mental health but I feel like I cant even tell my boyfriend Im feeling insecure about his staff night out with girls, no partners invited because i know he will react like Im just so jealous and I dont trust him and that will make him mad. Hell say that Im just making problems. I dont want to be that girlfriend So Im not saying anything. I told him he should go. And part of me knows he should go. I want him to have a normal relationship and have fun and have friends and go out. I dont need reassurance. Except I do. But I cant say anything. My brains telling me to just distance myself from him now and on the night of it, just go out myself and turn off my phone, so it feels like I am in control and I have the power. I dont feel vulnerable. Because Ive been taught to play these mind games from such a young age. Everything is about power, control and mind games, right? Nothing could possibly be innocent? Ive been wired so I think that theres always a hidden meaning behind peoples actions. I feel so fucked."

My elementary years it was physical with a brief time of sexual. The physical were from step-brothers (2 of them) and sexual was from one of the step-brothers and two male cousins. After constantly being scared to go home, I decided that my sister and I should go live with my mom. It felt safer than continuing to live with my dad. My dad was never around and thought that boys will be boys. Though the sexual thing got the cousins kicked out. My dad says he did not know that one of the step brothers was involved. Any who, visiting my mom for vacations was very different than living with her. We made this transition the summer between my elementary and middle school years. 6th and 7th grade I was grounded all the time. Each time cane with hours of lectures. Several of these were for not doing chores. But a few were due to her jumping to conclusions, not listening, and going on those rants. The negativity experienced at that time from being told you will never amount to anything if you dont... or you are slow , you are lazy.... and for my sister she often heard in addition to those, you are fat. My sister and I talked about running away but got scared and returned back home. End of 7th grade my mom divorced that stepdad and blamed him for all the negative. My dad divorced that stepmom and the stepbrothers around the same time frame. From end of 7th to 9th grade my mom was not around much, it is in dispute as to whether it was due to narcotic drugs or her lupus. We had barely any food to no food in the house. My sister and I would often eat dinner at my best friends house. Eventually my sisters teachers paid for her lunch and my friends would all donate food to a pile for me to eat. At one point my grandma said with us for a little bit and another time my dad stayed with us for a little bit. It was awkward to have both parents under one roof. When my mom remarried in my 9th grade she the negativity returned. Always being grounded especially right before having plans with friends. She tried pulling that with my sister but I would take the blame so that she could still go out with her friends. We were always stepping on eggshells. The smallest thing could set her off on yelling and ranting. In the family I was the peacekeeper, advisor, caregiver, and protector. My sister often thought I was the favorite or goodie to shoe. I liked rules at school, school was safe. My mom liked me because I was passive and my sister was not. When I left the home for college, the family structure fell and my sister was miserable. So she moved back with our dad and new stepmom. In college I still did not realize that my mom was narcissistic and I felt pressured to try keep my sister with my mom. And one time I guilt tripped her and then later apologized. I wanted my sister to be happy and I knew how living with my mom was. My mom always had a public face, one that is sickly sweet. One that she always used a church. Pretending to be caring, loving, and fragile. With her it is hard to tell how much of her health problems was lupus or her milking the vulnerability. It was in college that my trust began to erode away or finish eroding away. It was in college that I realized that my mom based every relationship on who was submissive and who was dominate. She would always say that she was top bitch and brag about her violent past and run ins with the law. After college my sister broke all toes and I have respected that. I have passed over a lot of stories but this is the gist. I am still in contact with her but I try limiting it. I know that any contact could wind up in an argument. So I do not talk about anything of importance"
115,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My Cousin is a Sociopath,2,dkmplj,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/dkmplj/my_cousin_is_a_sociopath/,2019-10-21 04:28:49,"I'm not sure this post fits with the people raised by narcissists but I need some advice please. So i've (F25) known my cousin (F36) since the day I was born, and always was very close to her. We lived in different continents so the time when we were together was always nice. Lately I had been visiting the country to see my family and friends including her. She is known in the town and among my family as doing shady things financially and romantically (stuff I can't really get into on here). I never really thought about those incidents because I saw her as a friend. I started noticing her odd quirks and behaviors once I really started visiting the country, and I live here now so this is now an ongoing issue. This is what I noticed and experienced: * She is incredibly manipulative: Whenever I couldn't/ can't hang out she would turn on me and send me mean texts saying I always hang out with other family members and not her. Meanwhile, I visit her work place everyday. Also, an incident happened the other day while we were having dinner out. We eat out once every week, and when we do, she's usually 70% of the time on her phone texting or calling people. I called her out on it (nicely as I despise confrontation) and she completely exploded saying she can do whatever she wants when she wants because no one bosses her around. She used my vulnerability to scream at me for something so miniscule. I told her that when going out and someone's on their phone the whole time, it means they don't like the company. She said such cruel things that are complete BS, things she actually does. * She also has a grandiose sense of self and narcissism. She always brags about how guys think she's cute (she's married). Once while we were having dinner she went through her entire camera roll telling me how pretty she looked in her photos. She also says she's the smartest person in her town and people who don't like her are beneath her. * She also has lack of empathy. In January, I came to visit her and she complained that I didn't see her enough. I saw her everyday. She began to berate me and say such mean things that made no sense. She was so angry I didn't want to visit her on my last day. She seemingly forgot that she treated me like trash prior. She then said she was so sick with the fever she could barely type and that I was so selfish not to visit her. Being the bigger person and not wanting to be in conflict, I visited her. When I got there she was perfectly fine laughing and smiling. Psycho...She was just playing with my feelings and didn't care I was hurt. I told her how I felt and she told me to drink a beer to feel better. * She has an inability to keep friendships. She gets mad at everyone and lost all her friends. She claims they are horrible people, but if she lost them all, it's because she's the problem. She likes to talk poorly about everyone she knows behind their backs. * She's also completely delusional. She likes to give me lessons of morality when she herself, has done horrible things to hurt people in the past. She fails to see the damage she has done and inflicts pain on others. She needs to be in power at all times, and once that is questioned, she completely flips out into a spiral of rage. I could go on and on with more examples, but this is already quite long. We haven't spoken since the incident with the phone usage. I refuse to be the one who opens conversation, as I'm tired of being her little puppet and her hurting my feelings constantly. In my view, me speaking first acknowledges that she was justified in her reaction to yell at me and that I was in the wrong. This would leave her very satisfied with herself. But I also don't want to completely lose a family member/friend. I despise conflict so these situations stress me out so much. I just can't believe she would yell at me for something that small. When she's not her crazy self she can be so awesome to hang out with and funny. It just hurts that to know she could care less about what I feel and doesn't value friendship, but I hope we can still be sort of friends. What do you guys suggest? Have you had an experience with a sociopath? TL;DR: Cousin is a sociopath"

I know that I am more than what happened me in my past but my childhood is so ingrained in present me that I feel like I'll never not be that little girl who was always afraid and couldn't trust anyone There's this guy I like a lot but I've convinced myself that I'm not capable of a making it work. I think I'm just too messed up. I'm so afraid of opening up to him just for him to say it's too much and not what he signed up for. I don't think he'd do that at all, but if he did I wouldn't be surprised because I think it's reasonable. My fear is that this will be every potential partners reaction to my past for the rest of my life I'm tired of hiding the real me but intimacy and vulnerability scares me so much. The idea of being so emotionally raw makes me want to throw up. This guy is so nice and I don't want to sit here and call him normal because that's not a thing and he probably has his own stuff going on as well but idk. I've lost hope in having a happy relationship as I am today. I guess I'm asking for encouragement, to those of you I'm happy relationships with people who didn't grow up the same way we did, what's it like?"

I have been LC since 2016, and NC since 2017. I wrote this letter about a week after my eDad left her. I sent it to him, but never to her: *I did not w ant to have this conversation, because I have gotten burned by being vulnerable to you too many times. But here it is; this is my truth. You dont have to like it, you dont have to read it, you dont even have to acknowledge it. But what you do have to accept is the plain and simple fact these are MY truths.* *You were my very first bully, before the shitty relationships, before I fell into the games associated with social normality, before I got picked on in elementary school even. It was you. Ive never been able to understand how someone can hate their own kid like you do, and to say your treatment of me wasnt and isnt hate scares me. Ive spent lots of time believing I was terrible and awful because my own mother made it clear thats who I was. I was NOT special, I was NOT good, and I was just unwelcome. Its taken me a very long time to accept the fault was not with me, and that I am a good human being worthy of respect and love. I dont hate myself anymore. I dont let people disrespect me anymore. And I will NEVER allow anyone to shit on my kids again. The only person left in my life who got away with all that nonsense is you And I cannot express enough how much weight is off my soul knowing you cant hurt me anymore.* *I will no longer be forced to laugh at the jokes you make at my expense. They are mean and cruel. I expressed to you why I check out, when we were talking. You admitted you did most of the talking, and it seems the only thing that you heard me say was yes I check out. Shame on you for grasping to that to attack my weakness! You dont do it out of concern, because if it was out of concern maybe you would reflect on WHY I have walking depression, and not just that I agreed with you while exposing my vulnerability. Even in the letter you left me, you could not admit fault once. The entire thing was about me not talking shit and me getting help and me needing to step up and on and on and on. You express how deeply you love my father, but not once expressed I mean even a fraction of that to you. Your opinion of me no longer will have any control over me.* *I will no longer pretend like you are right just so I dont have to get screamed at. I will no longer be forced to suppress my thoughts because youll find them unworthy of your ears. I will no longer walk on eggshell hoping not to offend you and get blown up on.* *I also will not be reading those letters to the kids. They are not your pawns. Had you any interest in them, you would have shown it in the time since we have been literally under the same roof. You couldnt even make it on your last night with \[my son\] without trying to tear him down by calling him obnoxious. I see the same patterns of disdain you have for me being shown towards \[my daughter\]. She will NEVER be made to feel like an inconvenience, NEVER. Dont act like my kids mean a thing to you, just dont. They are an extension of me, you dont like me, and we all know how that story ends. Im glad this is happening now rather than later. I know once \[GC sister\] has kids, THEY will be the golden grands. I will love my nieces and nephews fiercely, and I will NOT allow ANYONE to make MY children feel like they are old news once her babies come.* *If you had taken 30 seconds over the past 30 years to do some self-reflection, none of these feelings would be coming as a surprise to you. You cried and cried about how Grandpa treats you, but never once took the time to see you have been doing the EXACT same to me my whole life. I will not grow to be bitter like you, nor will I continue the cycle of abuse. I catch myself falling into learned behaviors more often than I care to admit. Do you know what I do in those moments?? I think to myself what would mom do?, and then I do the opposite. Ive been doing that since I became a parent. I never want my kids to think I hate them, let alone dislike them. Thats why I make sure to tell them multiple times a day, every single day, how much I love them. Thats why I make an effort to come at them with love, not my adult frustrations and stresses. I am by no means perfect, but I try.* *You have actively chosen to NOT get to know me, and to have an automatic dislike for anything I like. Youve had almost 30 years to try to talk to me, and it took this for you to finally pretend like now you want to. Too late, Im no longer interested. I needed a mom when kids picked on me in school. I needed a mom when I had my first heartbreak. I needed my mom when I first became an adult. I needed a mom when I became a mom. I needed a mom when I was being abused by my husband. I needed a mom when I didnt know how to be a single mom to 3. You were not a mom to me then. You were a constant reminder that everything bad in my life was my fault and what I deserved, you were my lifelong bully. I dont need you to pretend to be a mom now.* *I have done a ton of research on what happened in my childhood and adulthood. I wanted to get to the root of this whole thing. From my research, I have come to the conclusion you have a Cluster B type personality, most closely associating to Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. With this information, I chose to find a support group, which I did. I have been involved with them for almost a year now. Adult Children of Narcissists, or ACoN, has become the most valuable group of humans I have ever met. Every time you chose to come at me with your finger pointing when I needed love, I talked to them about it. I heard story after story from people who have the same relationship with their parent. They are all at different stages of coping, but there is a common trend with the people who are no longer being hurt by their narcissistic parent: no contact. That has been my goal for a while. I wanted to move out, and never speak to you again. You are toxic. What hurt me most is that it would mean leaving my father and brother behind. But, my relationship with them does not have more value to me than my own sanity. Fortunately, I dont have to make that choice anymore. I do not need nor want a reply from you. I will not read it because nothing you could possibly say will make me want a relationship with you going forward.* Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope if you're considering going NC you do it sooner rather than later &lt;3"
118,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Divorcing myself from my abuser,16,dp0mz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/dp0mz0/divorcing_myself_from_my_abuser/,2019-10-30 13:32:29,"My mother was a monster. I was raised by a woman who treated me with complete an utter repulsion. As a young adult I am on my way to rebuilding a healthy life after the abuse. I fought like hell against but I shouldve fought much harder. Here are some tips on separating from your abuser. The tips are based on my reflecting going no contact what I did well and what I wish I did better. 1. First and foremost FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE is absolutely crucial. If you ever want to get out you must be financially independent. If your a teen start working as young as possible if your an adult pick up that extra shift. I had a joint account with my father as a teen but as soon as I turned 18 I opened a separate bank account. They are unaware this other account exists. Having my own money as a teen allowed me to pay for Uber rides and cab fare to sneak out to parties and concerts. Have my own money as a teen took control away from my nmom. Have a private bank account and have an independence saving. Your parents cant confiscate a car you purchased or ground you in your apartment. The younger you get out the less damage. Start building good credit as young as possible. Become financially literature and responsible. 2. Build a network. The less people you have the more dependent you are emotionally on your parents. You will need friends a partner or other relatives to get out. Social isolation is not healthy. I went through a period of friendlessness when I was young and spent a lot of time with nmom just to have interaction with another human. The biggest mistake I have made in my life was letting my nmom teach me my presence was repulsive and no one would ever want to be friends with me. I allowed nmom to socially isolate me so I did not form relationships with peers the way I should have. I feel I wouldve figured out how abusive she was younger had I spent more time around others and realized maybe I wasnt so horrible after all. Be as social as possible. If you arent allowed to go out sneak out. Get a secret phone to text the opposite gender. Do let them rob you of your youth. The more connections you have the less you need your nparents. Nparents LOVE to isolate their children DO NOT allow it. Socialize as much as possible while in high school and college 3. Have everything that belongs to you. Dont use them as a cosigner. Have all of your important documents such as social security card passport etc. they can hold these from you to prevent you from doing things like opening a bank account or renting an apartment. 4. PRIVACY this one is less specific but VERY important. Privacy helps to establish boundaries and prevents parents from interfering too much. Have a secret bank account. Dont give them your passwords. If your a college student dont give them access to your grades or medical information. Go to a different doctor than N parent does. Dont give them a spare key. Do give them more information then they need. Hide your money and things if you live in their house. 5. Do things for yourself. Be as independent as possible. LEARN TO DRIVE with or without their blessing. Take public transportation instead of asking for a ride. Cook for yourself. Go places without them. Know how the world works 6. Have a solid identity - my nmom wanted a certain type of daughter and resented me for being different then the nerdy overachiever daughter she dreamed of. She would gaslight me and assign me random personality traits. There were a few years were I walked around confused. Eventually it hit me I wasnt who he said I was. Be friends with who you click with. Do what you like to do. Wear what you want to wear. Do not let them chose your sport. My nmom forced me to join marching band and debate team both whichI hated. I didnt start cheer until was 16 and its hard to start at that age. Do not let them dictate who you are friends with or date. Do some self reflection as to who you are what you want. 7. Absolutely DO NOT let nparents dictate college or career choices. My father tried to convince me to major in computer science many times even know I have no interest or aptitude for computers. Choose what you truly want. 8. Tell everyone the truth - dont be shy to other relatives or family friends about the realities of life with your nparents. Do not downplay do not cover up or make excuses. You need people to believe you and be on your side. A teacher once inquired about my relationship with my mother and I responded everything is just fine. I didnt like getting into things with people so I keep it all in. I wish I had spoken up more when I was younger to draw more attention to the situation. 9. Collect evidence - keep old text messages, record nmom verbally abusing you, take pictures of your bruises. Get your nparents on tape. These can be shown to others or to the nparents themselves that cannot be denied. The best way to fight my nmoms gaslighting and lying was with hard evidence. 10. Know the law. Use the law to your advantage. If your a minor seriously threaten to report them for child abuse and do it if need be. If your an adult sue them if they damage your property or harass you etc. There should be at least one thing you can catch them on if you try hard enough. 11. Set hard boundaries - especially if your an adult this can be very hard as a teen living with nparents but as an adult it is much easier. Pretend to be asleep if they come to your house unannounced. Dont sleep in there house even on holidays. Dont answer the phone if they call you at night. Put passwords on all electronics. Lock your things with a padlock. 12. Do not confide in them - they will not change or feel remorse because you express how much pain you are in. Any vulnerability I have expressed to my nmom has been used to exploit and humiliate me. Again privacy is key 13. FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT - do not just give up or accept things. I was not allowed to go to parties in high school at all the jumped out a window and broke my foot. I left my phone in the mailbox of where I was supposed to be. Ask forgiveness just permission. At one point I said to myself this is wear Im going tonight. My mom can come to bar herself and rip me out by my hair if she has a problem with it. My nmom refused to let me have my car at college but after fighting about it every day she eventually caved by thanksgiving break. But I am ashamed that there was a night I missed my own party Becuase she demanded I bring the car home immediately for no reason but to make me miss the party and I actually listen and drove the car home. Had I refused she never wouldve come taken it. She is afraid to drive thru the city yet I still felt threatened enough to listen to her. I fought hard but I wish I fought much harder. Know your abuser if openly defying will make the abuse worse then sneak around them. In short do not give them control of your life. Unless they have actually chained you to your bed dont let them stop you from going to your party or date or job interview. Think realistically what will/can nparent do to me if I refuse to listen? And make the appropriate choice. Will they actually stop paying for college if you change your major? Or are they all talk? Fight with them prepare an argument, make a spreadsheet why one college is better than another. Use any bargaining power you have. Be your own lawyer when dealing with them."
119,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"Requiring assistance, unsure how to deal with the situation.",2,dp2kf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/dp2kf3/requiring_assistance_unsure_how_to_deal_with_the/,2019-10-30 16:42:50,"This will be a long post potentially, I apologize for the intrusion. &amp;#x200B; During a conversation with a good friend of mine about repeated issues I have with my mother and her lack of respect for me and my decisions, she suggested that I go through a 'checklist' of common narcissistic parent traits. Results of examining the checklist personally were as follows; &amp;#x200B; 1. Extreme reluctance to admit to being wrong; I wouldn't call it extreme, but she doesn't say she fucked up often. Normally just ""a little mistake"" or ""someone else fucked my shit, now I need to fix it"", or ""it just happened"" 2. Undermines/Criticizes/Denigrates; I mean she's more supportive than undermining. I always figured her desire for me to get back to college and study was just her parental view of ""I want my son to be a success"". She criticizes and undermines my choices with my fiancee, but outside of everything else she tends to be accepting and supportive. ... I mean except for working so much, and relaxing on my own. 3. Treats with contempt, disdain and derision; She focuses on me far too much positively to maintain contempt against me, that's more my thing against her. 4. Treats dismissively; I guess? Like she still values my opinions and ideas, but will still demand or order or ""encourage"" me to do something else and then wander off after stating so because she assumes I'll just do it. 5. Does not respect personal boundaries; Dear fucking christ no, she never has. I always assumed that was normal; aspie, she had to take a close eye on everything I do or I'd get in trouble and fuckin smack somebody. 6. Questioning Self/Off balanced/confused; I mean she attempts to, rather poorly, I tend to just ignore it and not care. 7. Gaslighting/questioning sanity; She hasn't tried that. If anything I remember things she appears to have forgotten, which of course she forgets shit, she's old 8. Prone to Jealousy and Envy; Dunno, I never actually looked into that. Maybe? Can't say for certain. 9. Vindictive; She doesn't act on it, but she can be rather poisonously ""revenge"" focused when faced with someone or something she dislikes. 10. Resentful and Unforgiving; Doesn't seem like it, but again never paid much attention to that. 11. Holds Grudges; Fucking duh 12. Deceitful and Devious; Not good at it, but fucking duh 13. Constant need to be center of attention; I mean she's a socialite, loves hosting parties and tries to put herself into community events constantly, I dunno if I'd call that attention seeking. 14. Center of the Universe; I mean I've heard her admit she's not, and she constantly says she isn't, so bluh? 15. Hypersensitive; **absolutely**. Despises me swearing or speaking on harsh topics, and I just tune that out like white noise. 16. Self Absorbed; ssssssssure? No clue, again I don't really look at her much to know whether she's stuck in her own little world, though I assume she does. 17. Emotional Terrorism; I wouldn't say she does, but from the outside one could call it that? I always assumed it was just overbearing/overprotective parent. Unrelated, fuck if she learned if I ever cross-dressed or showed feminine tendencies she'd just break XD. 18. Selfish; fuckyeahdud 19. Immature; Nah, too refined and self important 20. Petty; 50-50, give or take 5 based on the day. 21. Undermines and interferes with relationships; Natch 22. Prone to extreme aggression; Too reserved for that, she tends not to act angrily or impulsively to begin with 23. Exploits and takes adavantage of you; If she has, I haven't really noticed. I do chores around the house, that's normal shit. I pay rent, that's normal shit (especially in Canada, it's getting cold here, heating can get expensive fast). 24. Behaves without shame; I mean yeah that's obvious, woman wouldn't know shame if it shat down her throat and called her a bitch 25. ""Parentifies"" you; She never attempted to, although I was foisted with a lot of self responsibility and house/administrative roles around the house as a child, I just assumed that was normal teaching patterns for growing up 26. Oblivious to the sensitivity, vulnerability and feelings of others; Doubtful, she tiptoes around everyone she can until she's in their circle and knows the rules. 27. Blames others; Now and again, sure, but... alright fairly often actually, maybe more. 28. Unconciously projects her own negative feelings onto you; Pretty common, actually, I figure she's upset that she never completed college/university/pursued her writing career and wants me to succeed where she didn't. &amp;#x200B; After this and some more conversation, I grow concerned that my childhood wasn't as glowing or well raised as I thought it was, but at the same time I don't like the idea of calling my childhood traumatic or damaging. I'll admit there is some introversion, but I'm well and truly confused as to how to approach the situation. Is my mother a narcissist? She is actively trying to get rid of things that make me happy in life, especially if she perceives them as ""taking me away from her"" (specifically with my relationship with my fiancee, attempting at least once a week to lie, deceive or confuse me into questioning our relationship and trying to force me to leave her), but I honestly don't know how to approach the situation if that's the case. &amp;#x200B; I apologize if this is off topic to the subreddit, but I am unsure where else to go or who else to talk to about this."

Summary: he feels sorry for himself, and ""chances"" to be a good dad are my responsibility to give him and should be infinite. Also, my Emom says I said he hurt me, but no comment or apology or question about that. He just heard through the grapevine I'm saying I felt hurt, since he didn't notice all the hours of crying on the phone over the years. ANYWAY, one thing stood out. He said, ""we used to be close."" Really? This was actually surprising. I mean, you spent my whole childhood exploding at everyone, cussing out my mom, slamming doors, slamming walls, driving away, throwing tools, growling, being sarcastic any time I had fun, how the F do you think we were close? That phrase, ""we used to be close"" just stuck with me even though I ripped up his letter. It was so weird. It didn't make any sense with my worldview. But I've slowly realized that it's because as the golden child, or fawn, or I don't know what exactly cause my sister was the scapegoat and the ""always the problem"" kid, but I was the pleaser. I was the one trying to keep the peace. I still got lots of criticism and disrespect. My other sister is the golden child in terms of she-who-can-do-no-wrong and has cars purchased for her. I worked my butt off to keep everyone happy. I realized, that in working my butt off and performing forever, since my earliest memories, performing being the pleasing child he wanted me to be, saying things that kept him calm at dinner, never contradicting him so I wouldn't cause a blow up, hiding rather than confronting, doing everything right so I couldn't be one of the people he degraded (""slut,"" ""stupid b\*#\*, stupid c#&amp;$, fat lazy. . .whatever). In pleasing him for all those years I created this alternate version of myself. This ""me"" that he believed existed and was such a great daughter he was so close too. All those years, since as long as I can remember, my interactions with him were based in fear. But that fear created this alternate person, this other me. Not the real my, the daddy's girl. Which is really creepy and freaks me the F out to say that way but it's true. The problem is, other people believed in this me too! The rest of my family thought that's who I am, because that's how I acted all the time when he was around which was almost all the time. No wonder all my relationships with family have gone to hell as I've stopped being willing to act pleasing, and tried to just act like myself. I just never realized how powerful my pretend face was. I'm sure for my siblings it was real and it was obnoxious. Actually, I'm sure my scapegoat sibling knew it was pretend but she didn't see the real me either. It actually really makes me sad for my Ndad. It's sad that he thought he had this relationship and it's all fake. Which is totally not my fault, it's all his fault for not dealing with his own trauma and thinking he can get away with being and a-hole all the time. And my Emom's fault for giving him infinite chances so he could get away with being an a-hole all the time. But I don't know, I guess I always thought everyone knew I was creating a mask out of fear? I think as a child I assumed everyone knew that the circumstances were so f-ing scary that of course I was acting all the time just to get through safely. But they didn't know. So, I cannot say anything or be in contact with my dad because everything I say he takes as an attack. But. . .Dad, if you are out there, thanks for writing because that teeny moment of vulnerability on your part has given me some insight into my life."

Growing up, she'd force her faith and beliefs upon me, whether I liked it or not. I knew at a very young age that she was a very hateful individual. She'd use the guise of tough love to abuse me psychologically, and physically even when I was a teenager. Anything that I shared with her while I was at my most vulnerable would be used against me. I wasn't allowed any privacy in my bedroom or the bathroom. I was a gifted athlete, but she'd find ways to make me feel less than. She'd find small imperfections in my body and obsess over them. She made me very self aware of the slight pigmentation I had on one of my testicle and how undesirable some of my body parts were, most of which I had no control over. I eventually realized that I cannot afford to be vulnerable in front of her, even though she was my only parent. My girlfriend loves me for who I am but there are times I feel I am not good enough for her. Thanks for the insecurities, NMom. I'll end my rant here. Has your Nparent ever taken advantage of your vulnerability? P.S. English isn't my first language and I am using a throwaway account for privacy."

Schizoaffective Disorder. I've been on SSI since I was 18, and have been in and out of psych hospitals so many times it's hard for me to estimate. My mother has ""taken care of me"" for too long now. She has made me worse with her ""support"". She doesn't understand or want to understand my condition. She just wants me to pull myself up by the bootstraps basically and be a ""normal 29 year old"". Whatever that is. She doesn't listen to me or respect me as an individual, and she refuses to change her mind beyond mostly trivial things. She is constantly angry, and putting it out into the world. In my vulnerability, I have reached out to her so many times. She is unreachable if she refuses to change. It's hard to accept this. She was worst in the past, as she was addicted to meth when I was a small child. There's a lot of details I could share that I won't right now. She is still with her alcoholic boyfriend who wanted to fight me after getting drunk one time. I don't want to be around him. My whole family are not people I can talk to or be myself, minus my little sister. They are all very dismissive of me. I am the black sheep. I feel very alone, often. I am afraid I will get into a vulnerable state and get sucked back into my families dysfunction. It makes me dysfunctional. It's messing with my mind. I have a therapist, a case manager, a psychiatrist. I don't live with my family, thank god. I was placed in housing programs over the years. I'm in the best spot I've ever been, and want to keep it. I have no friends. I isolate myself. My family tries to make me feel horrible about myself. Sometimes it feels all I have is family. But I still feel so empty after I am done talking to them. When I assert myself, they try to shut me down. When I try to just be myself, they want me to be some dumb ideal they have. It makes me feel dead inside. I learned about dysfunctional families like in my early 20s. I'm 29 now. I feel like I will never escape the ""power"" of my family. They make me sicker. I want to get well and live a life of my own with some kind of family of my own."

I don't know what I want out of this post, it feels therapeutic to write out though and collect my thoughts. Any thoughts would be gladly appreciated! So my father is a narcissistic verbal/psychological abuser. I've dealt with this all my life, was raised poorly to be an unhealthy adult. Now at 34 I have trouble with other men. I'm not good at making male friends. It may be interesting though that I got along with females, particularly female coworkers, quite well. They are fun to be around, even hung out with some on occasion in social settings. I am a hetero male, but it seems I'm more comfortable befriending women. That may all have to do with the way I was raised, my father being the negative figure in my life, and my mother the positive. I want to have male friends, but I guess I don't go about it in the right way, I don't feel very comfortable putting myself into situations of social vulnerability around them I guess. In that way, I am also similar with potential female romantic interests, not comfortable with romantic vulnerability. Anybody relate to this?"

It is stated as if it is a serious disorder. I can think of many, if not most situations when it simply is strong and independent to avoid relying on other people. It doesn't mean you can't positively interact or contribute, just that you aren't vulnerable. Why is vulnerability presented as a quality?

Im a lurker on this sub and hope that yall dont mind the intrusion. I am 17 years old and have a Narc mother. I really dont even know where to begin, but Ill try my best to be coherent. Really, I still dont feel like it was all bad enough, so my sincere apologies if this is kind of all over the place. I have severe trouble with vulnerability and am questioning why Im still typing, but things culminated tonight and nobody I know personally could possibly understand. I believe that you have to be raised by a Narc to even begin to understand what its like. Let me begin by saying that I am not currently suicidal, though I have been in the past. When I am able, I do intend to speak to a therapist, but that is still some time away. My birthday is in October; Ill be turning 18. I dont remember anything specific from my childhood. I only have a precious little amount of snippets. Its as if it never happened. But I do know, all my life, Ive simply laid down and allowed my mother to emotionally/mentally beat on me. She has the most massive victim complex known to man and whenever she would cry in response to the most minor events you could imagine, I would apologize to her until I wasnt able to speak anymore. Ive been worn down until I became a husk of a human being. I no longer know how to interpret any emotions I have, which is a rare occurrence, since I would be punished for showing any outward signs of upset or happiness for as long as I can remember. So I just stopped experiencing them eventually. At least on a level that I could distinguish what they were. Whenever I displayed any sign of annoyance/anger, my biological mother would ask me if I wanted to hurt animals, telling me that I had sociopathic tendencies, etc. It eventually progressed to her telling me I was likely to become a serial killer one day. This started when I was as young as 6 - 7, I truly dont remember, and continued until the present day. I feel like that is the most pertinent bit of information to what Im attempting to convey, so Ill stop there, though I could cite many more instances of bipolar/narc behavior from her. When I was around 15, I came out. My biological father left the house for a few days because he was heartbroken and didnt know how to react. We have made amends over a great length of time and are now on relatively good terms. That was the first time one of my parents left me. I have a 14 year old sibling who Ive raised as my own, starting at the age of 3. She acknowledges me as her true parent and, to do this day, I still act as it. Ive taken an unimaginable amount of abuse from my mother in her place because I refused to let her have the experiences I did growing up. I never wanted her to feel the way I sometimes do. Im unsure how successful Ive been, but I have tried my damnedest. I know I cant protect her completely, given that we still live with our mother, but Id like to believe that Ive shouldered the majority of the bullshit away from her. I promise that most of what Ive said is relevant. Again, I was unsure of how to even begin to structure this post, and apologize deeply for its unorganized nature. Now to current events. My mother is 44 years old. This past Saturday, she was picking on my sibling, and I simply told her not to talk to her in the way she was. I am very protective of my sibling, given that she is effectively my own. Normally, I would have said nothing, but as I am so close to my eighteenth birthday, I decided that I no longer had to lay down and let my mother do as she pleased. I wasnt going to grovel anymore and allow things to continue as they were, so I have been much more cross with her than she is accustomed to. I believe that she realized she is finally beginning to lose her power over me. After this, she went into a major depression for two days, never getting out of bed and telling my sibling and I to leave her alone but ridiculing me for letting her sleep all day (she quit her last job around April and has been a financial and emotional deadweight ever since, even more than usual). She has a history of epilepsy and told me that she had experienced a massive seizure while I was at school. I later found out that she was only trying to see how much we really cared for her. Yesterday, she told me that she may not be here tonight. I told her that was fine, since she was a 44 year old woman and could do as she pleased. She chose to interpret this as me not caring if she left indefinitely. She is planning on leaving tonight because she cant take the abuse anymore and my sibling and I completely flipped on her overnight. There is much, much more context and history that I could detail to combat these claims, but it is 11:30 PM on a Wednesday night and Im exhausted. Ultimately, both of my biological parents have left me at some point in my life. Even if theyre both kind of shitty, it still hurts. I dont know what my mothers plans are, if shes coming back, where she is going, etc. But my life has been full of her bullshit for as long as I can remember. I was planning to leave home around my eighteenth birthday, and my sibling does not acknowledge my mother as her parent, so we are faring as well as can be pictured. Im still not sure why I wrote this post. Perhaps one day I will be in a place where I can properly structure my lifes story and the true history of being raised by a bipolar, narcissistic witch of a woman. Today is not that day but I hope to get there. Thank you for taking the time to read this far, and I apologize again for this posts disorganization. I just had to say something tonight someplace where people would understand because I know I will be doomed to never open my mouth again if I did not take action tonight. I appreciate the vulnerability that everyone on this sub exhibits; you have helped me more than you know. You are all strong, amazing people and I hope that, one day, I can reach your level. One day, when Im not simply surviving but actually living, I want to be to others what this sub has been to me. Your story is so important and I wish you all happy healing."
126,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Confused about what happened in my childhood and if my parents are narcissists or not. Could someone help explain what happened?,5,d9xh1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/d9xh1n/confused_about_what_happened_in_my_childhood_and/,2019-09-27 18:35:42,"Ok so Im a 20 year old male. Im just going to cut to the chase. When I was around 3 or 4, I remember my mom asking me if I wanted to be her BF. She asked it on multiple occasions and I think it made me uncomfortable, cant remember. I never knew why she asked me that but it might have been because my dad would work a lot and maybe she felt lonely, idk. I also remember sitting on her lap and my tongue touching hers. I cant remember what I thought of it exactly but I always remembered how it felt and still do. I dont know if it was her that did it to me or how it happened. During this time we lived in a 2 room apartment and me and my baby brother slept in the same room as my parents while my sister had her own room. I remember hearing my dad joke to my mom about how horny he is but he wouldnt say it explicitly. I could still figure out what he meant though, even though I was like 4-5(idk how I knew). I started to masturbate at this age too. I would like the way the water pressure in the bathtub and pool felt, and Id fantasize about my teacher and other older women I found attractive. I never thought anything of this until I got older and found out most guys started to masturbate at like 13. When I was around 6-13ish, my mother would sometimes jokingly touch my genitals and Id always get mad and tell her to stop or slap her hand away. And she would say that shes my mother and can touch me wherever she wants. I always questioned myself if this was sexual abuse. The answer is probably obvious, but its weird how something can bother you, feel wrong or stand out in your mind but at the same time feel normal. But yeah, ever since the age of 4-5, I was masturbating and having sexual thoughts. I even remember hurting my penis in 3rd grade and developing a red spot there. I also remember when I was 7, I saw my mom taking a nap, and I went up to her, pulled down my pants, pulled down hers and laid on top of her and started to rub myself on her. She woke up and asked what I was doing. I dont know if I said anything but I remember myself just walking out. This is so embarrassing and I dont know what I was thinking. This is the only time this happened but I still remember it. My mom is very social. Ive never seen her be shy at all. She easily makes friends and is always talking to friends on the phone. I remember one time hearing her say that she was gonna call someone because its been too long since the last time she talked to someone, something like that. It seemed weird to me. She would also always tell me how she wishes I was. Not in a spiteful way. But in a loving / I want the best for you type of tone. Shed say things like she wants to see me with more friends, talk to more people, go out more, dress better, cut my food right so when I go to other houses they think positively of our family etc. I wanna say shes a nice person because I always saw her that way, but Im kinda questioning it now. I mean shes always helping out at church, comes off as always wanting to help people, trying to lift peoples moods up when theyre very down. But then I also know that she loves to look good. Shes always told me that when she was younger she was tamer than all her sisters. That shed never drink or party a lot(guessing cause it goes against her Christian values). But my cousins have told me that their moms have said that my mom would love to party and always go out. And this one probably hurt me the most. My surname is different from everyone in my family. Id question my parents about this sometimes and theyd tell me that they made a mistake with the birth certificate at the hospital when I was born. Only once(when I was like 10) did my mom tell me that Id have to be sat down when Im older and explained why my surname is different. Well one day when I was 11 or 12, we were at some event and being signed up for something. The woman asked my mom why my surname was different, and I guess she saw the opportunity to tell me since my brother wasnt there(neither was my dad). She told the woman but I yawned out of nervousness and didnt hear why my surname was different. However I knew that she told her that the man who I thought was my biological father my whole life wasnt really my dad. She looked at me with a sad face and said shes sorry. It shattered me. I felt like my whole world was destroyed. I tried to keep my cool and acted like everything was fine but Id cry so much in private. I didnt know how to feel. Id ask myself if I should still love my dad even though I wasnt his blood. Id naively tell myself things like maybe some of his sperm got into the egg that produced me and I have a little of his DNA after all. I felt self conscious whenever I was around his family. So rejected. When we got home that day, my mom came to my room sat down and said she wanted to talk, but she looked and sounded happy, as if trying to make the situation not big of a deal as it was. I got up and told her I was going to the kitchen to get something to eat, because I felt too awkward to talk about it. She never tried talking with me about it ever again. The only thing my dad did was come into my room, give me a tight hug and kiss on the cheek and said he loves me. I know hes my step dad because one day when we were going through a border control checkpoint, he told me to say he was my step dad if they asked why my surname was different. I think the event changed me forever. People tell me Im cold, have a careless and cocky attitude, and that Im mean and aggressive. My older sister has even said that I was different when I was little compared to now. I dont know if she knows how I found out though. I also had abandonment issues as a kid. It was pretty bad in kindergarten and then again in 4th grade. I dont know why though. I was raised by the two same people my whole life. Never abandoned. In kindergarten i just felt like my parents would never come back for me for some reason. Id cry every day at school and be nervous when it was time for parents to pick up their kids. It went away eventually but came back in summer of 2008. They went me to a summer thing at school and that day it was raining. When it was time for parents to pick up their kids, my parents didnt show up the time they said they would. Eventually I was one of the last kids there and I asked a teacher if she could call my parents. She did but they didnt answer. At that moment I had convinced myself that they had died in a car accident due to rain. They showed up though but I felt traumatized. I cried and begged to be homeschooled and I remember my mom crying to my dad that she didnt want me to be home schooled cause her friends would ask questions. Eventually they agreed to put me in online classes after I was getting too nervous and nauseous at school(4th grade). I remember my dad angrily telling me he wasnt doing it for me, but for my mom. I had a habit of hugging and kissing my parents goodnight every day, but sometimes my dad would hyper focus on whatever he was doing, or maybe just ignore us. But sometimes he wouldnt listen when I said goodnight, and Id cry. Hed then walk by my room and ask why I was crying. Id tell him why and hed get mad and just talk away. I also had a major depressive episode late 2010. I felt fine before this. But one day I started to feel weird in a very bad way. The feeling wasnt going away and got worse every day. It felt like an extremely heavy ball of negative emotion in my chest that kept getting bigger and was about to explode but never did. I cried every day, had no appetite, felt guilty about tiny things, felt very suicidal, lost interest in everything. The feeling felt so overwhelming. I didnt think it was possible to feel that bad. It lasted a month and then went away. It came back in 2012 for a month also but not as strong. My mom would just say that we all feel bad sometimes and that she feels this way sometimes too but that you just gotta do productive things. Well one day at a doctor appointment years later, he asked if I had any mental health issues in the past. I told him about that episode I had, and my mom was acting like she didnt know what I was talking about. She acted confused. I got frustrated with her and she eventually said it did happen. I have no idea why she denied it at first. And whenever Id cry to her as a kid, shed always say stuff like you have to be strong, that Im a big boy and theres no reason to cry, stuff like that. And I think thats why I try so hard to come off as if I never get sad or bothered with soft emotions. As if nothing can ever emotionally hurt me. Even if it does, I can never admit it. Its extremely hard to show vulnerability. I suspect my dad to have traits of NPD or BPD. He thinks in black and white and I didnt realize this until I thought about the way he acts and thinks. If he feels someone betrayed, insulted or tried to mess with him, hell have them forever and have nothing to do with them anymore. I dont remember one time where hes admitted fault. Its always someone elses fault. Hes always paranoid and thinks people are watching or talking bad about him. Hell say inappropriate things. I used to think it was just him being a massive jerk, but now I question if he knows that what he said was very uncalled for. Hell talk about how pretty other women are to my mom. And stare at other women in front of her. But then he also tends to always wanna help people in his small circle of friends. So much that my mom tells him that he tries to help out too much. Hell always be fixing something for someone else and stuff. Hell also sometimes just give stuff away. It feels like he really wants to feel like a good person, or seem like it at least. And then theres me. Im very uncomfortable with getting close to people. When I feel like Im starting to bond with someone, I have a feeling of wanting to escape. Ive had two online relationships and theyre the ones that have lasted the longest. I think they felt more safe. But I always felt like half of me was giving and sacrificing too much for them, and the other half was arguing with them, not stopping until they admitted I was right, calling them names, trying to emotionally hurt them. In real life, I start to have feelings of oh my god this is actually real very fast, whenever I get into a relationship. And I notice that I tend to take the most interest in girls that i feel have emotional problems. I feel like my emotions are very shallow and like I dont feel as much as others do, except for feeling bored, irritated and angry. Whenever theres a lot of drama, ups and downs, or she has intense emotions, I feel myself wanting her more. Its as if shes breathing life into me kinda. I also realized recently that I tend to divide people into groups. Mostly always people that Id like to impress and befriend because theyre popular or assertive/aggressive, and then people who I dont care to impress and dont care how I come off to them. It was always automatic to me and I didnt realize it until I started to read a little about NPD. I also think I might have a false self. I dont even like admitting to myself in my head that I might actually be the complete opposite of who I like to think I am. One time someone was making me feel so stupid. I felt like they were intentionally making me mess up by confusing me, but I still kept trying my hardest, since she was assertive and I felt a need to impress her. I felt like i was being treated like trash. Afterwards I felt like I hated her, but then for 3 days I felt very down. Even suicidal. Id tell myself that it made no sense since it wasnt even that serious for me to be feeling suicidal. But I felt like I was stupid, incompetent, couldnt even follow simple instructions, and was just a complete mess up. I felt like I wasnt the person I thought I was. Im so sorry I wrote so much. Ive just always had questions relating to my childhood, my parents and how I turned out."
127,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,What was that quote again if anyone can help me with this?,2,dc3tyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/dc3tyz/what_was_that_quote_again_if_anyone_can_help_me/,2019-10-02 12:09:18,I was in here and I remember the quote that goes like  what helped you survive in the past is hurting you in the present which means like in the past being in the abusive environment and the present is escaping but those coping mechanisms and all those things you learnt while you were in survival mode is now effecting you now. Can anyone send me a picture or like write the correct quote? I want to save it on my phone. Because something Im struggling with is vulnerability towards people who didnt go through what we gone through. Its something I have to do in my English class and its extremely hard for me to do because when I was living with my dad i couldnt show a inch of vulnerability or he would take control of me so I always repressed and always had a mask around him. Now its turning on me and i had a panic attack right before class and I didnt go because our teacher wanted us to share something from our hw which made me scared .idk but yea back to my statement if you can write the correct quote ill look it up and save it on my phone thank you.
128,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My Nmom took my child from the hospital.,10,codkzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/codkzb/my_nmom_took_my_child_from_the_hospital/,2019-08-10 14:38:12,"My child was in the hospital for a mental health crisis, my Nmom found out (after months of no-contact from my child or myself) and had him discharged into her care! Shes not even his legal guardian, I am! This was not part of the discharge plan that the psychiatrist and social worker and I agreed on. I expressed my concerns about her and my childs safety. Yet no one phoned me to see if this was a safe option. How could this have even happened? The hospital said because my child is 16years old that he can make the decision who he leaves with. Yet I can see how my Nmom used the situation and my childs vulnerability as an opening. A way in. She has always tried to undermine my parenting and relationship with my child, and now my childs safety and mental health are at risk. She has convinced my child not to take his medication or see his therapist in the past. She has my number blocked and has moved, so I dont even know where my child is or have a way to contact them. I feel sick to my stomach. For context, when I was a teen my Nmom dropped me off at the hospital when I was suicidal. Left me there. And wouldnt let me come back home. I was homeless and had to find a family member to stay with."
129,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,feeling lonely,1,cp5nxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/cp5nxy/feeling_lonely/,2019-08-12 11:44:07,"this weekend has been so hectic, i was a victim of online blackmail/webcam sextortation and had to delete all social media, change my number, etc. i've calmed down about it though, im suppose to be getting the money back hopefully, due to a dispute on my card. but i sure had feelings of breaking no contact, and felt like going over my mom's house. I know for sure some of my feelings of insecurity can trigger my sense of missing them because when i used to live with them i would go to them in those vulnerable times of despair of different things. But this last situation was similar to which a situation I would have ran to them if I where still with them. It was definitely a wake up call for me and really kinda thankful the blackmail even happened to me (because im starting to realize how dangerous the internet really is and im thinking to stop some bad habits/behaviors). So this weekend I was able to help myself in the sense of knowing what to do in this situation, thanks to google, but as i was reading along I contemplated and going back to my mom's house for support and help, more importantly, because I was afraid that the scammer would use my mom's address information for something bad, but upon reading a scammer/online blackmail survivor website who work to stop these scammers, they are likely not willing to put that much effort into one single person and would just go on to the next victim... as they stated that many scammers can blackmail up to 40 people a day. So i was really worried about my family at first and even posted on their forum about this same situation and that's when a moderator suggested I sit tight and cut off as many online information that I could, making it harder for the scammer to find me. But I guess im okay knowing that if i ghost him like i did my parents they would just stop talking to me and go on to the next victim.. oh geesh. But man i really get a feeling of loneliness and just wanting to be around them whenever I go back to my bad habits, like porn, I always use to use them as a crutch whenever I relapsed, etc. this might be too much info but, this is the situation im in. I feel like going back to them but at the same time I think i wouldn't feel that way if i hadn't gone through this online webcam sextortion situation. Though I know I can grow from this on my own, I also noticed that, I guess my feelings of insecurity lead me to feel like i need them beside me, resulting in me feeling like I miss them. I know that this type of vulnerability is helpful for people who manipulate and I've heard my family say things and brag about how they manipulate others, so im kinda on the side of not going back. I also have a big time trusting people because of some childhood trauma and well I also know I sometimes have some kind of unconscious stockholm syndrome with narcissists. and well also they are the only family i really have here in the US. I am a first generation kid and man its lonely without family... I use to be all about my family and this big family guy and now I don't have any.. I fear trusting them again because this is sorta my second time leaving the house and if I go back I feel like its going to be harder for me to really let them go. My gut has also felt like the ""manipulation"" was going to get worse and I think it did get worse, starting my mom, my dad really kinda stopped and I saw him to pick on my younger brother more. This is my first time really leaving on my own though, I stayed at my sister's house the first time. Idk I have contemplated low contact but even then my gut tells me I would feel stupid to break no contact. I guess the problem here is me not having family of my own now, I know I could get my shit together and stop all the nonsense of watching porn cause i have obviously been in places that could teach me a lesson or two. Yes, no contact has giving me a healthy sense of reality now, I felt like my parents weren't good at ""letting me go"" if anything they used me as their punching bag, Ive realized that. My omg my dad would always try to drag me in the same work place as him (sudden realization). but yeah i feel this is healthy in that aspect, of having my own space to breath and really just discovering myself or living life my way. It feels like I'm picking life back up from the last time I remember really being this world.. which was like early highschool. Im totally grown up though I got to say, im not a kid anymore, I have goals I want to achieve, Im just a rock going downhill and once it moves it just keeps on going. I want good for myself, I just needed that push to get me going and I know I'll get there, I have more space/time to do so.. I just needed momentum to get me going. It was hard getting out of there thats for sure (moms house) it was a psychological trap that im glad ive overcame. now i can focus on my future instead of them hurting me. Im hungry for this journey of success. I want to be something that came from nothing. It's possible. It's easy. It just takes hard work. Maybe its my inner child coming out bc ive had a vision of myself owning my own business and living comfortable like the rich do. I guess growing up around that gave me that vision for myself. I want to be that person who makes something good out of every terrible situation possible. I'd like to reach success, then motivate others to do the same thing. Boy do I have stories of bad situations.. ive been through so much. I'm amazed how my body is still going, how im still here living on this earth. that how much ive been through. I know others have it worse, but my life has been some sort of spiritual attack on me. It sounds crazy but looking back i wouldn't doubt it.. tbh I think i just want to reach success to motivate others to do the same, but I want to go through whatever it takes to get to success first. Until then I won't have a story to tell. yeah it sounds pretty planned but like i feel like I can motivate people you know? money would just be a cherry on top, I mean I would only do it after ive reached success anyways. I just feel like i can reach this goal. it seriously feels like im trying to be a life coach of some sort and people always look at them as ""scams"" but im really coming from a place of hurt and personal experiences. i may not become a life coach specifically maybe just a speaker. i felt some type of way in front of people where i could feel like i can motivate them. (hopefully this isnt a bad charismatic trait picked up from my dad's personality). but i really have no bad intentions... it would only fulfill me as a person. I just want to see this come true because from where i've been, it would really be a whole 180 degree turn in my life. i know i would be saying to myself ""ive made it, i've overcome"" Idk what Im asking or wanting from this post, but I guess I just had to vent. Props to whoever read this far, god bless you."

My parents divorced when i was in 2nd grade and the conquering and dividing started swiftly after by both of my parents. my mother after some time just couldn't take it and literally moved halfway across the united states totally abandoning me. my Nfather has been at war ever since. i am now 50, and the anger and rage has been welling up since childhood. i have gone very LC and moved 8 hours away. it is a painful recovery. i have found that when i start to question that maybe i am not seeing things clearly, that maybe i am stuck in my head, maybe things weren't and aren't that bad....that's when shit really falls apart in my life and i start self sabotaging by using addiction all over again. i have been trying to get clean/sober for the last ten years of my life with some periods of success. i was able to put together 2.5 years of completely clean and sober time almost 2 years ago. during that period, i started trying to make amends with my Ndad and GC sister. what a frickin huge mistake that turned out to be. the narcissist smells vulnerability in his victim i swear and for that matter so does the GC sister. it was a mistake to reach out to them and i paid a heavy price for it. my self sabotaging began and i smoked weed for the next 21 months. i have found the strength to put down the grass and start over again in recovery. 21 days today, clean and sober. every time i come back from a relapse all that anger and rage that was being pushed just below the surface comes spewing out like a volcano. i am surviving it this time and i have decided that it is finally time to take a hard look at my dysfunctional upbringing and get to the core of my recovery because i know i deserve peace. I am going to stay very LC and may even resort to NC as my Ndad is now in his 70s and i don't want to make my life a living hell by going NC and not being able to go back to his funeral when he finally dies, as my GC sister loves to rip me behind my back to all my relatives. i hate how the ndad divides the family and makes his children believe they can't trust their own experiences. i have began journaling as a way to put down on paper situations that really happen so i can go back and read it later and understand that i can trust my instincts. so tired of being so full of anxiety and want to put an end to the voice in my head that says i'm not good enough. does anyone else feel that all they can do is barely survive and that you find it very difficult to thrive? that has plagued me my entire adult life. peace. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; s"

After years of emotional abuse I finally said it I will never have a positive relationship with her but she is a source of negativity. When I was in a mental hospital she called me to tell me I was failing in life and then acted like nothing happened the next day. This behaviour sums up the entire dynamic. She runs her mouth like a child and then pretends to not know what happened the next day . She doesnt like to be called a lair because its disrespectful  and finds it rude when I dont do what she doesnt want me to do. Im absolutely sick of being told everything is my fault when Im trying to live. As much as I will cry when she does it will be because we never had the so called mother daughter bond not because she will be missed . I deserve a mother who is a source of positivity. Not one who body shamed me my entire life and then lies about it when confronted. Not one who throws my vulnerability back in my face , not one who as a child would tell me she would send me away from my half siblings because she doesnt want me to turn her children against her. I am sick and tired of hearing about how she gave up marrying someone who didnt want me as a step child ,even though she married someone else and had two other children. I am sick and tired of being told she needs to be worshipped because she gave birth to me. I am fucking sick of it. I dont remember a time in my life when I didnt want to die and I swear to God I Think about doing it just to get back at her. Its the only way to get away from her. In her head because of her culture she can do no wrong and I have to take her abuse. I am tired of feeling like this. I am sick of her calling my friends whenever she sees Im having another depression session and telling them how much she allegedly loves me only to keep throwing my weakness back in my face . When she saw I cut my self she told me to stop because it was weird. Does this sound like someone who gives a shot to you? She has multiple personalities. She is a narcissist and I ducking hate her. Im tired of being told all I have is my family when both my parents dont give a shit about me and only pretend to care out of a sense of obligation. Each time either parent say they love me I have to force myself to say it back. I remember all the times my mom would lock me out of my room for not cleaning it as a teenager or slap me in public because I didnt do my homework. My house hold was full of abuse . It was a revolving door of being beaten with a belt by my step father for not making his bed and being told by my mother that I had to scrub the floor before I go out or having whatever I loved taken I away from me if I dared upset her. What a fun life I have lived. I look forward to ducking dying soon . So over these memories and trying to force a relationship with my siblings that I cant bring myself to care for."
132,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"guilty thoughts like ""i am the problem""",1,cu1dc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/cu1dc4/guilty_thoughts_like_i_am_the_problem/,2019-08-23 04:20:06,"I'm 17 (almost 18) and I've been going back and forth for years over the guilt that I have absorbed from living with a narcissistic mother. (I found out in 2016, had the worst year of my entire life.) I don't trust myself. I don't trust that I am not like her /even though/ I do everything in my power to be as respectful and kind as I can be, because of what I've been through. I don't think many people but those with narcissistic parents or people in their lives can relate to this feeling but I feel like I cannot trust myself. I feel like my thoughts are divided amongst the real me and the version of me that is traumatized and thinks that in order to survive I need to be like her, like a narcissist. For example: I don't act out these thoughts. I don't lash out at friends, I don't manipulate, I don't hurt people on purpose. But there's a part of me that is like, ""wouldn't it be so much easier if I did? Wouldn't I get that feeling of being powerful when I feel so powerless?"" And I don't think it's just me. A couple years ago when I first started trying to figure out what was going on with my situation and myself I figured out the symptoms of narcissistic abuse and fit pretty much all of them perfectly. But something I don't see talked about in depth enough is the bad of narcissistic abuse recovery. It feels like I have to second-guess myself with every decision, every breath, and it is suffocating. I get suicidal ideation pretty much every day, especially during my (diagnosed) anxiety and depression spells. In the beginning I suffered from very severe guilt that I couldn't look at myself in the mirror and if I did I would dissociate. Now, I feel like I am back to that guilty phase and It's probably a good time to mention that August is my mom's birthday month, and birthdays are really painful. In September, it is my own, which also leads to more guilt and unwanted attention (unwanted attention because I feel that my family apart from my immediate family doesn't trust me because I ignore my mom's birthday, which leads to more guilt, more suicidal ideation.) So, I don't like the vulnerability that goes with being in public (school). I'm not sociable, very lackluster, but I try my best despite my anxiety. But I cannot stop overthinking about what others think of me. I do not, ever, want to be associated with my mom. I do not, ever, want to be associated with narcissistic traits. I worry so much about the perception I put out. It's obsessive. And yeah, I know that that is a narcissistic trait. Trust me, I go back and forth with myself over and over about what constitutes as narcissism and victimhood. It's gotten to points where I don't trust self confidence to not be something that is narcissism. It's also probably harder since i'm a girl and am worried about my looks, my weight, and yet I feel bad that sometimes I actually don't hate my body or my face. I just don't want to hurt people. I don't want to hurt, either. That goes against a narcissists values but, like, I still get fixated on if I am one or not. How do I know I'm not just lying to myself. Because, like I said before, it would be easier to just let those dark parts of me play out. It is exhausting not trusting yourself. It makes actually trying to live and recover that much harder."
133,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"Is anyone else deathly cautious of people who use ""Loyalty"" as a bargaining chip to remain?",8,cukxfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/cukxfa/is_anyone_else_deathly_cautious_of_people_who_use/,2019-08-24 08:23:40,"Recently I made a friend through an app and she kept talking about how important loyalty is to her in friendship. I noted it and paid attention because coming from a narcy home, my parents both used loyalty as a bargaining tool and it worked, until i grew up. Over the first few months of knowing this friend, her veneer of niceness and charm came down gradually. Bits and peices of weird behaviour popped out. She is very much a social justice warrior and on one or two occassions embarrassed herself by wrongly inserting herself in situations where others had to tell her to back off. She woudl apologise in front of me and say she was just trying to do the right thing, but she was clearly embarrassed/angry. One day she was pushing me, to push my partner, to reply to her partners text about an upcoming catch-up. She was pushing to make them friends. So, I was befuddled when my partner told me a) he already replied and b) it had been just 1 day since their last text exchange. Also, her partner cancelled on mine once already, and my partner was totally cool with it. So, why the pushiness when my partner had been accommodating and not pushy to him? Noting also that we had absolutely 'shown up' for this couple, extensively, in a short period (minded their dog, done favours for her birthday, and i'd given her my time and energy regarding her past and mine, plus her new business venture). In the end, I set a boundary with her and called her on pushiness, and i was actually nervous to do so - she has a background of anger in her full-time, if it makes sense. it's like a passive screensaver on a computer but, on her face. At first i thought it was just anxiety but with time i realised nope, anger. Well, once i said my peice in a gentle way, she absolutely imploded. She blocked me on social media and WhatsApp, but not before sending a disgusting instragram novel of a text, saying I gaslit her, when actually SHE did it to me! She also praised herself intensely saying how much of a wonderful friend she was and she values depth and vulnerability and it's 'sad' i'm not up for that and hopefully one day I will open up...she also said she values loyalty above all else and tried to back-track and frame the exchange as us simply getting to know one another and it's normal. No, that reaction isn't normal. And I couldn't reply anyway even if i wanted to, because she blocked! I don't get that mental masturbation honestly... Well I was angry. Angry at myself. Because i felt something off in my gut but i couldn't put my finger on it. And i remembered recently that sick feeling i had every time she mentioned loyalty and deep friendship and so on. She took issue with me having a few friends who i don't live and die by but just, have coffee with sometimes, every few months. It's almost as if that insulted HER. I also recalled feeling smothered, where, I had only known her 6 months and somehow she managed to book my time weekly, with minding her dog last minute for days (even though i only knew her 1.5 month at that point!), or new business venture (she got fired) or something else. I remembered her evil eye looks on the two occassions i invited her to meet another friend of mine. On BOTH occassions she put both women down, as if they were boring to her. I remembered how judgemental she was , even with words i used! i.e. when she invited me to her place for a girls night of talking and movies, i referrred to it as a girly night, and said i wanna watch a chick flick, and she proceeded to send a voice note to educate me on feminism and how women don't only like certain movies. note: i am a feminist, i am a writer, i am a director. f\*ck off! i am not 3! I remember her and her partner simultaneously 'correcting' me, when I cooed about a nearby mans lovely melodic accent (Caribbean region), they both blurted (publicly mind you) 'DON'T SAY THAT! ' and laughed at me! Side note: my partner is from nth Africa and I have Italian, Irish &amp; german background so - what the actual f? How are you going to tell me i'm wrong in how i speak, as if i'm somehow racist or insensitive? So i tackled it head on and said to them both 'and what you have me say? it's a lovely tone of voice?' - they both went mute and laughed and i went to the toilet for a break. &amp;#x200B; Grr. Sorry. Just p'd off. I don't believe in loyalty. Not at all. I believe in, you treat me right, i treat you right. But you can't expect me to put up with your nonsense out of loyalty. Been there, got the shirt, it sucked, now i'm in therapy. I'm not adding to my sh\*tlist of topics in therapy just to make your ego feel good, that you have 'friends', when really, you have sources of supply."
134,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,You you should just leave when you are the scapegoat (cautionary tale),21,cvce87,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/cvce87/you_you_should_just_leave_when_you_are_the/,2019-08-26 04:43:47,"Took me a while to figure out my family's weird situation, this is the closest I've gotten to it so far. My mother has always been her side's scapegoat (or one of them) because she is one of the youngest. On my father's side, I am not entirely sure what the dynamic was but I do know my uncle has always been my grandfather's GC and the family's baby. My grandmother kind of looked like she saw my father as her GC but I have heard complaints that she was always much more attentive to my uncle. What I think happened in my father's case was that being the eldest my grandfather felt threatened by him. There were other signs that my father didn't feel comfortable with his side of the family as he was much closer to some distant cousins on my grandfather's side. I know that side never liked my grandmother's side, and my uncle doesn't have a whole lot of contact with them, nor does my grandfather. I know my father did (he died when I was 8) and this added to things I've heard growing up makes me think the relationship with his side of the family was strained. &amp;#x200B; My parents left their families and built their lives more successfuly than the rest of the family. Unfortunately, they didn't leave. Instead they liked to show off to each side and irritate both the GCs and the head narcs. After that everything became a pawn in their attempts at getting revenge or approval from the narcs. My father ended up dying from burnout, before that my parents' relationship was strained and just for show, and I grew up feeling rejected and never good enough like my only purpose was to get good grades and be good so they could rub them in the family's face along with their money and success. The result was envy, hatred, increasing pressure on the part of the family (they'd nitpick at everything), gossip. My parents also always treated each other as objects (my father treated my mother as a trophy to be paraded around, she only valued him for money and for showing off) which contributed to the strain in the relationship, along with cheating and triangulating with meddlesome relatives. &amp;#x200B; The result was that as soon as my father died, the rest of the family swooped in like vultures and did everything they could to hurt, manipulate and sabotage me and made me into the family's eternal poor orphan, with relatives getting close just to get gossip under the guise of ""charity"" after my father died and others trying to take advantage or me and my mother's vulnerability to sabotage us. To this day my mother still keeps poking the bear and tries to make me into my father's replacement. I am working on getting a degree so I can leave. &amp;#x200B; Lessons I've learnt from this: * Narcs will never like you if you are a SG (or a GC). The more you try to ""show"" them how much better you are than their GCs the more anger and envy you cause. * There is nothing wrong with you. I don't know if this is true for all scapegoats but in my parents case, they were scapegoated because they made the head narcs feel threatened in some way. * Leave and move on as soon as you can or if you must settle the score don't drag other people into it, much less children. * There is no ""I understand they feel threatened but if only I can make them see past their insecurities they will see how good and useful I am and like me"" with narcs. Because it isn't true. If they scapegoat you it's because they know you are better than them. With people like this you either stop being better, which shouldn't be an option, or you leave them. * They will never take you seriously no matter what you do. * When you try to escape your SG role by beating the GCs, what is going to happen is that they are all going to hold you to very high standards and nitpick at everything you do while holding themselves to completely different standards. It's their way of showing you that, because you are flawed in some way (being the SG) you have much more to prove. Playing along only makes them believe this more strongly and it's another way narcs have of controlling you. The only way out is by not playing. * Don't tell them anything about your life or accomplishments if you are in this situation. They will just distort it or accuse you of lying and then will use this to keep you trapped further in the cycle of ""proving yourself"" to them. You have nothing to prove. * Don't try to show to the narcs that you don't mean to threaten them, that you are just doing your own thing. They won't believe it (and they are likely right) and even if they did and it was true and you really only meant to help the family and make the head narcs proud, they don't tolerate that sort of competition or they do, but only when they have you completely under their thumbs like a pawn. * GC or SG, narcs will make your life hell. The only ""better"" option is leaving them to stew in their own misery. * I know this is a cliche but, playing into a narc's games will make you into a narc sooner or later."

This is my first reddit post and I have been using reddit since last month, so I hope my mistakes are not too much for the mods. English is my third language, but I feel like there is no hiding it. I didnt use this language for quite some time and would appreciate any correction of my worst mistakes (you can always learn). The first part is about society (my life outside of my family) and the latter part is about Nparents and shitty relatives. Hopefully do you have the time and interest to read the full version (maybe I should write about family first and then about my life...) This text is version number two I tried it yesterday but was unable to make it while being overwhelmed by emotions, feelings and memories. Some parts are omitted as a result of severe gaslighting, other parts are omitted to make it shorter but most of my life is written down (at least the worst parts I omitted some bad parts and mostly the good parts of my life or myself, or else do I fear will it be possible to recognise me). I hope not to hurt the feelings of anyone but will write down things in my subjective opinion it is likely to be not objective and/or could be different in your opinion. Some background (it will matter later on): My parents (mid-twenties) as well as other family members immigrated in the 90s and had to struggle (and do it even now) with discrimination and the like. (Funny fact, same color of like everything, same religion, same worldview but other nationality). The worst is the matter of their education which was mostly dismissed as rubbish with the only option of relearning starting from zero (with language courses and so on about ten years of studying). Both of my parents had to work as blue-collar workers while having finished university and in my nfathers case, having two degrees with summa cum laude. Another matter is, my parents marriage was a result of my mother getting accidentally (no shit, both didnt want a child and both were just casually dating each other) pregnant with my brother. Kindergarten: We were living in some satellite smalltown and as such did I feel the burn of discrimination in kindergarten. My educators where harsher to me, as an example, while other could even play while not eating their food I had to eat all or else sit at the table. We had some group works like baking where I wasnt allowed to participate in more ways than watching and we had toys for which we had to wait (going by list) which were mostly taken by other children from me after which I tried to talk to our educators which called me an selfish bastard which should learn to share with others bla bla and so on. The result was quite the fear for these educators and me even pissing my pants out of fear being unable to ask for permission to use the toilet (we had to ask they would open the door, let us in, close the door and wait, in my case did they start to scream why the hell Im taking so long). Elementary school: It was shitty as well. My PE teacher was an old perverted lady. She would always go through the boys changing room after waiting for some minutes until most of us were in nothing but underwear. Mostly did she just ogle, sometimes give a comment and in worst case slap an ass or touch (no genitals but like everywhere else). Boys had to always wear short pants and tight-fitting t-shirt for PE-class while girls could dress however they wanted. So many red flags... at least here was I intelligent enough and made it seem like Im as slow as hell when changing just to not be touched (but got disciplined for being late with running some laps and the like). My class teacher was the real monstrosity, she made fun of me during class. I remember even now how she said just before starting a test why the hell I even try if Im such an imbecile. Funny fact with the exemption of her subjects (only F) where most of my other subjects A or at least B graded. She used to make me to sit right next to our problem children (to help you make some friends ;) these friends where mentally ill and attacked children as well as adults (drawing blood) before one day being dismissed from school to get some professional help. I feared them but manipulated them enough to be accepted as a ""friend"". My real (and only) friend at that time did start to ""blackmail"" me just before switching to middle school (we chose different schools as a result of distance) .... I was stammering in elementary school but more about this topic in nfather and grandmother (fathers side). My only ""sexual abuse"" was in elementary school with the neighbor child pissing against my leg (we were playing outside and he asks me: ""I must piss right now and cannot make it till home what should I do?"" Well I tell him ""just piss here"" \[it was some field\] he does it but then did he turn to my side and pisses against my leg \[clearly intentionally and I think he even laughet\] I was weirded out as hell and do think even now sexual abuse is worse than mental and physical abuse \[or I got too much of the later more in nfather\]) (Why didnt you talk with your parents/relatives? In their opinion is there no bad educator but only bad children) middle school + high school + university: Was shitty as well. My first years were mobbing and the like. I had been told to be like everyone, but none of the other children behaved like adults as such stood I out like a sour thumb. Even some of my teachers called me mister and not just by name. \* 1(teachers see at the bottom) I was mostly apathic and expressionless (I heard the words ""like a doll"" not once in my life) at that time until maybe 14 years old. With 14 started drastic changes over the time until 21 did I switch from one addiction to another or all together. Ranging from cigarettes to alcohol, to funny stuff (everything except for the use of syringes). I wished to control my life and to no longer fear and as such started to make myself an influential person in the shadows of society. Which I accomplished, by the time of my graduation in high school was I a person feared by all (young people plus/minus 5 years my age) without ever overstepping my moral grounds (or even fighting once with my own hands) then again its not like I could put a stop on many things. The worthiest I accomplished was ordering a head hunt (""just arresting"" him) after sightings of a pedophile trying to kidnap children in our region (he got away but his van got smashed). I realized that I felt hollow and like shit. I stopped all my contacts and switched towns for university (I wished to go far but my nfather manipulated me in staying next door). I do not take any shit, drink, smoke, I do not even drink coffee daily to stay clean of all (I wish to life one day unfettered). My metamorphosizes left quite some scars (taking into consideration the one right now maybe five times?). Mostly in being left alone (again) and losing most of my friends or me closing any possible connections (I do not use Facebook and other social media any more just to be left alone from my past). Those which I called once friends and try to be a friend to should be categorized in a. accomplished a normal life (yeah, they are married and having children) or b. they fucked up completely, are ill (addictions, depressions other), in prison or dead. Again, I stay clear from b. and have nothing much to say to a. but some small talk about life sometimes. The time after 21 while studying wasnt used the intellectual way as well but escaping in games, anime, porn and other lesser devils but devils non the less. Im trying to live this time conscious, doing sport and whatsoever, while staying far from my escapism and challenging myself like right now. How could I do all this shit with a controlling nfather who was only interested in appearance? Yeah, thats a good question. Smoking was a problem, you smell. Alcohol with vodka is better to hide and the funny stuff is mostly a matter of not showing your eyes. My free time (while going to school) was used the most cost economic way with me saying Im staying longer to play soccer (if I already had PE and have my sportswear does it seem like an solid lie, even more so with telling when Im coming home via bus so as to not trouble him). We sometimes even played soccer... for some minutes... if I had to be taken home by car. A quote of myself (about five/six years old just before falling in oblivion): It was an summer evening with the suns afterglow painting the sky in red and purple (I like this sight even now...the twilight \[never read the novel or watched the film\] I think its kind of like me, somewhere in between but always there, neither light nor darkness, but at the same time beautiful, a spark, a moment, like a life) back to the quote: ""Oh how beautiful this world is, with all these creatures and people"" (I do not remember the remaining part)....but it was long before reading ""the tempest"" or ""brave new world"" :P \---------------family members------------------ grandparents (mothers side): My kindergarten time was mostly being in the care of my grandparents (my parents working full time plus weekends plus holidays plus overtime plus at night....). It was ok. Apart from always telling me to be like all and to integrate into society. My first worsening was my grandfather almost choking me death while snapping after me starting to cry about something (I think I was unable to complete some homework after being ill and as such not knowing how to make it) with my grandmother stopping him in the last moment screaming ""you are killing him"".... my grandmother was trying to help me with my abusive nfather or so I thought until 10 plus years old as I understood that she used me for her own agendas (she hates my father and he hates her). I just had to listen to understand it isnt about me, its about nagging about his income, or how he does this or that or whatever but I and my abuse was left alone as long as it wasnt used as the first wedge only to switch to worthy topics. Thank you for nothing... my situation got only worse as such as I was used as the shield which could be left there (to feel the thunder and wrath) while going on with her own life like everything is normal. nfather: The problems arise with him losing his job while I just started school. What begun with disciplining (the ""normal"" way) for ""real"" mistakes, became harsher, increasingly regular and plainly ridiculous. I do not remember when I was first beaten with a belt but I feared the word ""bring me the belt Im going to discipline you"" I froze with the belt in my hands on more than one occasion only for him to start screaming and beating me up worse. All these fucking mind games, like you hurt me, and it hurts me to hurt you and other shit and these endless talks... first talking (screaming) then beating and then again talking (screaming). I hated this shit the most. I felt like losing consciousness, like ripping myself apart from within, like screaming but having no mouth. And then, answer, answer me, answer, why dont you answer me? fucking answer my question or do I have to beat you up some more....and it was so obviously...these fucking questions where impossible to answer in any satisfying way. I lost my words. And I started stammering as a result of beatings, fear, and other. Most psychologists couldnt find any explanation (see grandmother father side to learn how I healed). I was terrified. He watched some shitty documental film about Chinese military prisons and learned about the good sides of beating up people with bamboo and we had some bamboo just next door. And I learned the fat on my ass was helpful in diminishing the pain. But my feet, legs, hands and arms didnt have as much fat (I was for as long as I know myself lithe). The worst was the beating without any reason which was something I only got with bamboo rods. And I saw the sadistic look in his eyes when beating with the bamboo rod, no disciplining, no anything, only personal amusement. In my teenage years did he start with punches in the stomach (I felt like throwing up and did throw up after getting some after eating just a moment before) and finished the whole story with punches in the face (lips heal very long after cracking and make many problems throughout the day). There was ripping out my hair (while grabbing by my hair) as well as other shit (which I do not remember clearly and maybe should not remember). He was only interested in himself he was only interested in making it seem perfect for outsiders he was always interested in shaping us however he wanted. He was never satisfied, more, more, more, better, better, better... not even once did he say to me you did good or good work or anything but dissatisfaction. Shouting, screaming, worthless, imbecile, .... ""you got an A? so what why are you unable to get an A in every subject?"".... ""I was the best in my class, I was the best in my university I I I I I and you?"" ""Why are you unable to accomplish the same?"" Controlling, everything had to be controlled even my thoughts (he studied psychology for some semesters as well). God dammit I remember even now how I heard him shouting (in my mind) even in my student flat sitting alone. Fearing this do that do this. I remember how I was unable to eat at the same table as him without feeling nausea. Oh, and the table, my childhood (if talking about my ""free time"") was sitting at my desk staring out of the window. As long as I did anything I got beaten up for god knows what so I sat....and sat... and sat... and sat...even now do I feel like using an axe to crush this desk (but not the desk is to blame). He was always observing...often like in some horror movie...silently...sneaky....looking what Im doing....while I start to sweat hearing the breathing in the background before he comes ""in"" (all the doors where open and my desk was in the living room which used a see through glass door). ""You have to write better""; ""you have to learn better"", ""you have to do your homework exceptionally"", ""you have to read all of your schoolbooks"" (I did start to read them later on out of boredom while sitting behind my desk). Oh, the ambiguity. Today its ""why dont you make some friends"", tomorrow its ""why do spend so much time with friends"" oh and ""this friends are shitty friends better make them your friends""....girlfriends is the worst topic...I had to hear more than once ""are you gay? or why dont you have some girlfriend?"" hahahaha Fuck I mean, I was already tearing how could I bring an girlfriend into this shit....I declined all the girls no matter if had or had not any feelings for them. I felt my responsibility as a human being to not fuck them up with this shitload of insanity. My nfather would always come in when friends stayed at our house (and not the mother way with tea and cookies) but just barging in ""So, what are you doing? let me take a look."" and all this shit...and he would start to talk about how great he is and how shitty I am, for like an full hour. older brother: I always thought my brother was escaping but after reading in this sub reddit and thinking a bit did I understand that he was the goldchild while I was the charcoal. As long as I remember was my brother always somewhere but never at home and dumb me thought when I become older, I will be left alone as well. Fat chance! He could lock his door. I wasnt allowed (was some time ago at home and tried it, the result was as expected). He could make jokes, I wasnt allowed to even breath too loudly. And some of his jokes where fucking hurtful. He mostly made fun saying shit like I was switched with his real brother in hospital or Im the son of another father and something like this. He could stay out, I had to tell every time where I am, what am I doing, why am I not at home, updating like every two hours. We had two telephones at home while using one could you listen what is spoken in the other and my father would always listen in when Im on the telephone. My brother could stay by his friends or girlfriends I had to ask for a long time to get permission for a sleepover only to be taken in the earliest morning. (I had more than once the situation of him taking me home even before my friends parents got up like 7 in the morning on Saturday or Sunday). My brother could stay away for prolonged times without telling where he is, what he is doing, with whom, or when he comes home. Then again, he became the submissive one of us. He would uphold my nfathers rules in absent of my father (the prisoner game or what was it called) and he did not even once care for my problems or my life (not a complete asshole but we are not much of friends even now). He fell from grace with his marriage (very toxic with him bearing the brunt) as being spineless and idiotic. Not like I wished him such an outcome. I told him more than once there are other woman out there and even marriage and children do not shackle you completely. mother: Id like to omit this part. At least my mother didnt do anything wrong she tried everywhere and with all, but she is just one human being and against everything and all. She didnt know of most shit as I was silenced (he told me he would make my mothers and my own life hell plus punishing her for overstepping her boundaries, later was it more manipulation like Im the real problem). She did try when I was younger (after I talked with her) but got screamed at and my father threatened her with killing her. I really wished to escape but even talking with her about such topics didnt help, like ""how will we life?"" ""He will come after us"". And other such things. Foster family and the like where no option to me a. my father would never allow to leak anything to society and b. I had two children in my class from foster families and let me tell you their life was even worse than mine (mostly the same (or not) but massive sexual abuse)... thinking about foster parents is like thinking about sexually deviant creatures (in my opinion). My mother should be called a lightning rod or the glue holding together these fake relationships. grandma (nfathers side): The true light in the shadows of my life. She came for some weeks/months when I was .... in elementary school and stammering. Watched for some days how our/mine life looked like and then told my father (I remember this scene even until today) ""Should I see you touch/beat my grandson even once more while Im staying here then I will kill you"". He didnt beat me up even once for the next weeks and maybe didnt even scream on me and I lived the life of a child (wow such a life exists). I would play, laugh, run around and make many other funny things together with my grandmother AND look here I stopped to stammer! It was not much time we spend together, but I wont forget this fierce and loving woman which saw things in times of war which broke many other but not her. May she rest in peace. Her credo: Be flexible if you wish to live for another day. other relatives: Funny fact but most of my relatives are shit. They knew what was going on but didnt care. The greater part is selfish, narcistic, jealous, manipulating, uncaring (even to their own children), bla bla and so on. The purest are the poorest as I should call it. The others always try to use their relatives in their own interests (we got used as well for a very big sum). So, its real shit and I should care even less about these assholes. Another interesting matter was a wedding like ten years ago where my aunt (godmother) sold me out (not the only time in my life as she doesnt care for relatives who arent members of her pre marriage family) to make an acquaintance of my.... hell, some uncle (which is one of the rare diagnosed as mentally ill family members) only to make him fuck of from her. Well this uncle as crazy it might seem told me some interesting things (or he was crazy/or me/or both) but yeah it was mostly about do not let you be oppressed in the family and to fight and bite to survive or as he told me to LIVE!. There is nothing worth more than life and we should never let anyone destroy this life of ours. In the next moment came my nfather shouting to me he is crazy, do not let him manipulate you, what did he tell you, well I told something like ""he asked who I am"" and stuff like this. Do I hate them? I do not really care (about them \[except for my mother\] but I DO CARE about myself). Should I really go all the way to severe all my connection and start my own dynasty, then so be it. I will be free of them and wont shake them if they stay away from me. Hating takes so much from us, but gives us just about nothing, but a belly full of cold flames which eat one from within. Thats a clearly unhealthy form of stagnant energy. My status as of now? I do not talk with my father with the exception of some rare occasions (we are talking less and less with every year which makes me happy as sardonically as it might seem, I understand many problems were results of societies well...shit but then again why I should I the child bear the brunt?). I try to stay away from my relatives and communicate mostly with my mother, sometimes with my brother or one of my cousins. After the ""disgrace"" of my brother did my father start to be better but we know them, there is no better. Nonetheless did I felt quite tense while being at ""home"" and quite relaxed being back in my flat, university and so on. Oh yes, I do live in an student flat since my second term on my cost (after long fights and many concessions). So why do I rant? Thats the real question! Its mostly on the topic of dating. How do I make it? I mean I do not wish to let anyone experience this shit ever again, but I do not wish to experience anything of the like as well. Most of my family members as I see it, find themselves the perfect partner (worst). The normal relatives find partners with immense issues and the ones with issues find themselves normal partners. Everything goes shit. I should take a moment to describe another aspect of me. The last or maybe first time I felt.... good, no thats not the right word maybe secure, better, unfettered, relaxed, almost flying or dreaming. Was with a one-night stand (we have known each for quite some time in distinction to my other one-night stands). So there was I lying with her afterwards and I felt like melting butter, like a weight was lifted from me, like in this moment exists nothing but her and me, nude, with all our scars, beauty and ugliness and nothing more, no nfather, no society, no stress, no anything and I knew, this my friend, is bliss (not the sex, Im more the sentimental/emotional type, sex is good/great but my needs lie even more elsewhere). Bliss which I havent felt for oh so long. So, the question is, as someone who has never dated, what do I do with my baggage? How do I find a girl without issues? How do I prevent myself from going n or starting with jealousy, insecurity, controlling and the other problems gained through nparent lifestyle? (You should love yourself.... yeah, I did read all this but what if I start it after getting in a relationship? I would say everything is ok but lets be fair there is nothing ok with nparents and even more so with their children). Therapy is not an option; my future job could be infringed, and I do not like the thought of someone decoding me. Im no master but I fought more addictions then most people in their whole life so Id say if Im man enough then I should find the will to fight my way through storms and blizzards. The other question is about me describing my childhood. Should I like what, wait a hundred years and one day before marriage say, ""You know, I had nparents and it fucked me up"" or should say well hello there, ever dated a nparent child?. The topic of vulnerability is quite problematic for me. I could say it quite early, but how many people accept it? Some, none? I had mostly friends (male as well as female) from abusive families or other shit without ever staying in touch with ""normies"" as I felt misunderstood and partially spiteful about them and their ignorant bliss while... yeah. What did I learn? I know for sure licking wounds was in many occasions not the best option. I should be able to move on, be true to myself and so on.... but even then, I do have needs which are running quite deep.... security, vulnerability, to love and be loved. Id say its better to know there is someone right next to you then doing whatever superficial stuff. So WHAT? Yeah all of us have needs and there is nothing bad in it as long as we stay healthy and the ones around maybe do not even benefit form it but at least do not get harmed by it. The real question is ""Why do I wish to date?"". ""You wish to change your life and as such start do date? WTF"". No, Im planning to use the time until the new year to change (mostly sport and more socialize, less bad (escapism with help of XYZ) behavior). But theory is theory and practice is practice. As such would I like to implore the ""successful"" members for tips and opinions about dating, romance and relationships. I see at least two problems in this ""rant"" the calculating part (parts which seem like Im talking with someone and the use of friendlier words in some instances, not about the readers but less cursing of my relatives) \[Fearing to be not enough for others? Fearing to be worse than other? Fearing to be unaccepted?\] and the broken communication (arguing, defending, explaining) \[Just about the same as before mentioned? Fearing to be unable to communicate? To build emotional connections. Understanding without having the need to explain to fear rejection or worse punishment\]. There is another question as well. How I do rewire my personality archetype? I was an extravert molded into an introvert and stay as of now as an extraverted introvert or introverted extravert about E40/I60%, I have both systems running ""parallel"" to each other with one active and the other one inactive and gain energy from people or have drains trough people. Its mostly a question of mood or in what modus Im operating. I can like party for a week, going out, talking whatever but need a week of self-building afterwards and need after staying to long introvert some energy from people. The other matter is my sensory system? The problem is, I was a feeling type but had to rewire thinking (or else break) right now Im somewhere in between switching here and there and ask myself if it is for the best or not? I cannot really go back to the feeling type as I lost my hope in people, I do not see them as good beings but a mix of the best and the worst (mostly bad). Okay, the real question is about accepting or rejecting. Do I accept what was made of me or do I wish to bring back what was lost (thats going to need professional help and quite some time, if its even possible). I think I should be able to move on if I rewire myself to be happy or more so to be positive, that should be enough. Many thanks in advance, TooLateForUsername There is need in editing, but Im too lazy right now. This ""opus magnum"" (\^\_\^) took much more time than I anticipated and is as of now not even completed... how could it? My life is only starting as of now ;D shiet! do I really post this bomb? I feel like I forgot something very important. There might be no bermensch, but if we try to be a bit better every day, then we are at least making progress and live consciously about oneself. Afterword: I hope you could refrain from slandering my relatives. Even if they are assholes, the one punching them is going to be me and not some one other (not, as if, I have got better to do). Criticism is encouraged. \*1 most of my teachers where real assholes. One telling what the fuck Im doing here. Another telling my mother he wouldnt give more me than a D even if I only made As. The next one waiting for payment (yeah, this asshole gave me worse grades should I not help out \[which I did not\] but most others did) My school where places of corruption and decadency, some teachers were ok or great but most should be sent to prison. Even one of our teachers which was disclosed as a real Nazi (he made his classes great him with HH and the hand up and so on) was only suspended for half a year before getting back to work."

Karla Grimes ""A Narcissist Can Disguise Themselves as the Perfect Partner One of the most perfidious things about narcissists is that they can camouflage themselves as being the nicest person on the planet (its the so-called honeymoon period when they present themselves as absolute delights).

Alexander McCall Smith Love doesnt die a natural death. Love has to be killed, either by neglect or narcissism.  Frank Salvato The narcissist devours people, consumes their output, and casts the empty, writhing shells aside.  Sam Vaknin Have you ever been in a relationship with an individual who demands your attention incessantly and becomes depressed, sulky and even full of rage if your attention goes elsewhere? This is one of the earliest warning signs of a narcissist. Please understand healthy adults do not behave in such a way. This is where people who know the difference turn their back and walk away; they know that any person ringing them 10 times a day and demanding attention is not well. Unfortunately, many individuals, as I did, can mistake (or delude ourselves) that this high need for attention means we're loved, missed and adored, or maybe we felt wrong in leaving or speaking up, as a result of our own deficient boundary function. Please be assured, this is not love; it's the deadly calling card of the narcissist.  Melanie Tonia Evans Narcissists have poor self-esteem, but they are typically very successful. They feel entitled; theyre self-important; they crave admiration and lack empathy. They are also exploitative and envious. The malignant types never forget a slight. They may kill you ten years later for cutting them off in traffic. But they act perfectly normal while plotting their revenge.  Janet M. Tavakoli Withhold admiration from a narcissist and be disliked. Give it and be treated with indifference.  Mason Cooley Narcissism is a grave condition of insecurity and desperately feeling unloved and unacceptable. An individual with Narcissistic Personality Disorder inherently believes they are damaged goods' and fears other individuals will discover the truth: that they feel powerless. Thus the narcissist invests a great deal of energy into gaining the upper hand', to hide feeling vulnerable, insecure and broken. When they are getting what they want, the charm is flowing and plentiful. When the charm doesn't work the intimidation begins. Narcissism is categorized as an unhealthy level of self-absorption and a lack of empathy regarding how their insecure, aggressive and damaging behavior affects the world around them.  Melanie Tonia Evans ""Relationships with narcissists are held in place by hope of a someday better, with little evidence to support it will ever arrive.  Ramani Durvasula Sadly, when many individuals realize that the narcissist is insecure and isn't reassured, they try harder to love this person. Additionally, the narcissist blames his her behavior on something that you are or aren't doing, and a hooked person we may try to do it better' or get it right.' Your increased efforts to love and fix the narcissist only lines you up for more abuse.  Melanie Tonia Evans Relationship with a narcissist in a nutshell: You will go from being the perfect love of their life, to nothing you do is ever good enough. You will give your everything and they will take it all and give you less and less in return. You will end up depleted, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and probably financially, and then get blamed for it.

I came up with this, and I noticed it's all rooted in how I was treated at home. * I'm a social outcast because something is wrong with me; * I'm worthless as a person, all that gives me worth is my skills, my achievements and my possessions; * Love and friendship have to be earned and upheld by providing; * A social environment that doesn't turn against me and bully me to hell and back is a precious achievement that has to be carefully maintained; * Getting bullied has always been my own fault (thanks parents *and* teachers), and every second of vulnerability, feelings, emotions from my true self will be used against me. It has turned me into a harmony-seeking, harmless guy who is afraid of hurting others, who wants to make everyone's life a little better, but can't figure out how to do that for himself. It has also turned me into a deeply cynical nihilist who has come to the conclusion that everything with the risk to complicate things or make a situation worse is not worth risking because it'll need energy to fix. I'll only get hurt anyway, right? Why risk the ""social peace"" by making myself vulnerable (which in my experience gets me bullied) and trying to get closer with people?"
140,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"Am I the asshole for not ""saving"" my brother at his lowest point?",4,ccmera,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ccmera/am_i_the_asshole_for_not_saving_my_brother_at_his/,2019-07-13 16:58:13,"I considered posting this in /r/AmItheAsshole.. or in /r/relationship_advice.. but the amount of words I'd need to describe the family dynamic there... I think in this subreddit, I can suffice with: My father is a narcissist and alcoholic. And you all will know what it means. Also, my mother has autism. Although she can sense other people's emotions, she does not understand **why** people feel the way they do and can therefore not respond appropriately. She is not able to see people's inner drives and motivation. And needs. Although she worked so so very hard at being a mother, and I have come to see what a kind soul she is, she was emotionally not attuned at all. In my family, I was the golden child, and was sucked into a covert incest relationship with my father. I don't know how or why, but I made it out. Not unscathed, not by a long shot. I realize now I have severe CPTSD and am very codependent. I've been working on healing myself for a decade. But I made it out without a personality disorder. As my therapist said: ""You didn't go crazy. You're intensely damaged. But you didn't go mad."" Not an achievement, or a medal, but a remarkable feat of my mind. Somehow, I made it. I have a younger brother. Younger by 4 years. And I remember the day he decided to stop crying. I remember that very day. I watched as his face contorted in anger and he swallowed back his tears. He was a sensitive child. Very sensitive. Both of us were. I think him even moreso than me. He was abused and neglected in a way that absolutely destroyed him. My brother was the scapegoat and utterly alone. I was pulled into a parentified relationship with my father. My mother is not capable of emotional reciprocity, so my brother was truly alone... Over the years I have observed how he *didn't* make it. Inside of him, something broke. And a couple of years ago, I realized that the disease my father has, had taken hold of my brother. My brother shows signs of narcissistic personality disorder. I have come to see how he tried to put me down to feel better. How his anger can burst out and lash out at you. How he has belittled my husband, and previous partners. You see, I was always the shock absorber in my family. And for a long long time, I worked to keep my brother stable. He could vent with me. I would listen, and try to guide his anger back to see perspective. And I was very very good at it. But slowly, I stopped. I had to start taking care of myself. I had to get out of the family system, even though they tried to pull me back in. My brother at some point expressed that I had been the only one who was there for him, when we were kids. ""If I hadn't had you, I wouldn't have made it."" I feel like my partners feel like a threat to my brother, because he wants to reach me. Through them if need be. He has copied their hobbies and would feign interest in the same subjects. My brother was fired from his job about a year ago and moved in with my parents. He lied about it to me, he said he had quit his job. But when you quit, they don't give you extra money... I told my husband how it worried me. It wouldn't go well. Fast forward to now.. Last monday, my grandmother died and my mother has been overwhelmed with grief, of course. On the day she texted me, I told my husband: Shit will hit the fan now. Two narcissists in one house and it's not about *them* now. The most important story of the day is how my mother's mother died. They both can't handle it, I predicted. My father would start drinking and my brother would explode in rage. Within 12 hours, I got a text from my brother. If he could sleep at our place. No explanation, no vulnerability. Just that. ""Can I sleep at your place tonight?"" A question. I told my husband that I was not capable of taking the family dynamic into our own house. We have had a personal crisis at the start of this year that I have not recovered from yet emotionally. It has put some strain on me and my husband's relationship, although we are handling it well, as a team. I discussed it with my husband and expressed how I need to stay out of the family dynamic, whatever it takes. We talked about the things that happened over the years, and discussed possible outcomes of taking him in, versus not taking him in and alternative things we could do. We also discussed how he has shown no vulnerability and that I have a tendency to interpret and read between the lines. But that I am actually very tired of doing that. So I simply responded, ""sorry, that's not possible"". I have not heard from my brother since. Yesterday, the funeral. My brother was not there. I asked my parents and my father said ""He's not doing well at all. It's very bad."" and looked pained. At the end of the day, my husband said that when he had told my parents to give my brother our regards, my father looked very troubled and said ""if I can reach him.."". I do not know where my brother is right now. I don't know if anybody knows. I suspect he left on Monday. I do not know if any of his friends (he did used to have a big social network but it started to show cracks earlier this year) took him in. This morning, I cried. I do not know if my parents have heard from my brother since Monday. Part of me wants to ask them. And I am going through all the bad scenarios. What if he is missing? Have they called the police? I'm sure they haven't. Did he attack my father? .. Is he going to hurt himself? Is he going to hurt me, or my husband? Did I do the wrong thing, by abandoning him? I know how he feels about me. Ambivalent. He wants my approval and support, and resents me for having received, in his eyes, support and validation when I was a child. I know how his mind works. And I can't do this anymore. But I am very afraid that I did the wrong thing. I, somehow, feel responsible for his well-being. Codependence. Dear /r/raisedbynarcissists, am I the asshole?"
141,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Narcissist elderly mother and possible alzheimer driving father....help!,1,cdbmge,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/cdbmge/narcissist_elderly_mother_and_possible_alzheimer/,2019-07-15 12:16:46,"So the penny has dropped (with the help of a psychologist) that my mother is in fact a Narcissist with Gaslighting as her preferred method of torture. So much of my life has fallen into place since reading about gas lighting and the narcissist. My parents are in their 80's now and moved to where I live a few years ago, as they figured they would be needing my help at some stage. They don't ask for help, she drops passive little comments, knowing I'll run over there and help, then pretends to reluctantly take my help. Asking for any sort of help or showing any sort of vulnerability is beneath her. My mother told me my father was forgetting things and she feared he had the beginning of alzheimers. She had given me many examples of things that sounded like some sort of dementia. I had seen his driving decline and when I saw him driving the wrong way up a residential street, I took steps to have his license put in for review. The family sat down and my mother said the best way would be to do it behind his back rather than confront him. So that's what we did. He received the form in the mail, had his medical and they said he had cataracts which needed to be removed and cancelled his license. This is what I was eventually told by my mother, she is very cagy. He has now told me he never wants to see me or my husband and our children ever again. He said it was a relief no have us out of his life. My mother has allowed him to focus on us and threw us under the bus as the ones who ""dobbed"" him in. My mother only speaks to me when she wants something, which isn't often. Even then she rings and pretends there was a missed call and she's checking if it was me. They are not growing old gracefully and are mean and nasty. He's behaving like a child and she's into full blown manipulative behaviour. I spotted him out driving on his own, so she's not stopping him from driving. I can no longer deal with either of them. I am an empty shell. Is there anyone out there with a similar experience?"
142,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,It's really emotionally taxing to be here everyday,6,cdh9kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/cdh9kc/its_really_emotionally_taxing_to_be_here_everyday/,2019-07-15 23:08:44,"I wouldn't label my mother (and sole parent) as narcissistic entirely. But after seeing posts on this subreddit I've come to feel I have things in common. Every interaction I have with her is emotionally straining, to the point where I feel irritation at the prospect of talking with her. This has in turn prompted me to say damaging things towards her, perhaps even abusive.. but I would stress that everything I said is emotionally genuine, at least.. &amp;#x200B; I'm 17 and an only child, if that's relevant. I find everything taxing, mainly because I don't know what to do when it comes to dealing with her. I won't label her entirely guilty, and me entirely innocent - but I wouldn't consider the other extreme either. But my responsibility in all this will not affect my preference, that I want to keep my interactions with her as minimal as possible. This is because after every conversation, I feel frustrated, severely interrupted or even disturbed (in my emotional state) and I sigh with my face buried in my hands. I laugh it off, as I do every other emotional problem.. ""This is the worst drama movie I've ever seen!"" you know? But even that has its limits. &amp;#x200B; As to what's actually ""wrong"" with my mother, well maybe concrete examples partially represent what I feel. I've been told I was really mature for my age, and have been joked ""I don't know who's the parent here"". Well, the more I grow the less I can laugh at that joke. If anything it's extremely annoying from day one. I don't know what it is that family friends and dinner tables bring out in visibility, but almost all of them had this original joke. Basically, my mother has no qualms relaying her emotional burdens on me. &amp;#x200B; I'm also incapable of holding a mature conversation with her. I don't know if that's on me or on her, but I don't care at this point. If I say ""Can you not do X, because Y?""; She will lash out, saying ""I won't ever do X"" - which sounds fine but not really when you find out she's immature enough to hold off doing X, regardless of context Y, for a few hours/days. She seems to hold enough awareness to come apologizing later, but not enough to not repeat it. It really cheapened what an apology is for me, since these conversations aren't the only instance where I would get an apology later. &amp;#x200B; The extreme examples are obviously during my childhood, during when I took her more seriously and took heed of her say. Things like ""Why don't you go out and find foster parents?"" or ""Why don't you get out of the house, everyone tells you, you're mature enough to live alone."" or ""Everyone's putting on a face, in reality they're all annoyed by you"". It's basically a variation of taunting me to own up to the claim of maturity (save that I don't care for such an honorary title) or discrediting everyone's claims and compliments (save that I can differentiate between pleasantries and compliments like everyone else). &amp;#x200B; All of this isn't my main problem, I've then since been able to deflect the strain to some extent. Since calling out on her BS and relaying my emotions onto her, portrayed me as the bad person, gave me guilt or generally wasn't worth it. But I can sense myself going insane. When I see someone cry I feel almost nothing. My reaction tells me to laugh it off or not pay attention to it. I almost never want to burden anyone else with my emotions, nor do I feel I have anyone to. It's as if the next partner I have, will be drowned as the valve loosens in a long time. Also, it's not as if I don't feel guilt for deflecting most of what she has to say, either. It's true that I have a decade's worth of evidence that tells me it is not worth the effort, but it's also true that the reason it turned out to be so, is partially my fault. She has told me about my harsh language that I don't exert anywhere else, depressingly reminding me I may have mistaken authenticity for harshness (But I don't do that now. I can say I love you as fast as I can say the opposite.) &amp;#x200B; I'm just really tired. I don't care to determine the responsibility in all of this, it's a task of moral abstraction I'm just not seeing the worth of. I don't care to find out if I love her or hate her in the end, either. Again it's not that polarizing nor enticing to find out. It's really emotionally taxing to be in the same house with her (it's not to say I don't have plans for the future) and I generally keep my distance, putting on headphones, in my room, doing hobbies. Since I've never been told the value of chores (my mother seems to love taking the role of the victim of distress, that may give you some hints) I'm learning how to manage around. It's funny how she often said why didn't I do chores myself, but never actually told me why I should do them nor taught me how. I've scraped off knowledge from relatives and friends, really nice people. My mother always ""educated"" me in this way, she would tell me, ""why don't you do it alone, since you're you?"", and so I did. It worked out in the end, but it would never be how I would do things. Especially since I don't like expectations of others, I also don't like being valued &amp; appreciated at the expense of the other's integrity (which I often confuse with healthy vulnerability). &amp;#x200B; As I've said I'm tired and I'm happy with my decision on how to do things from now on, but I still have surprises like when my childhood friend (she's an angel, honestly) talks about HAVING TO WORRY about her mother sticking around when she's out buying a surprise Mother's Day gift. At that moment I could not comprehend the sheer level of relationship that I was being presented to, it's as if I was incompatible with it. I laughed and smiled at the sweetness of it, though. But then when she passed on the baton, saying ""Maybe try buying a Mother's Day gift?"" I graciously lied, saying I will. Next time I'm going to try to be more honest in all relationships with people. &amp;#x200B; Does anyone have similar experiences?"

I can only remember two people (a teacher and a friend) who saw through the performance and recognized the abuse that was going on. And even though it took me years to see the truth for myself and process it, their reaching out to me was a ray of light, even years later. It affirmed to me that my parents behavior was wrong, and, even if other people didnt see it or believe me, that my experience was real, that I could create a healthier life for myself, and I could live my truth. Family is who you choose, and But theyre your *parent* is not a reason not to empower yourself and improve your life. After I went no-contact, the only thing that was hard initially was when other people didnt fully believe me. It was rare, but some people who were not familiar with abuse would project their experience onto mine; or they might have simplistic, black-and-white beliefs that didnt leave room for my truth. (Yes, I appreciate some things about my family of origin; and yes, they were abusive, and going no-contact is the healthiest way for me to live my life.) &amp;#x200B; I was watching S4E4 of *Queer Eye* today; its an uncomfortable episode, and it brought up very mixed feelings. Still, I appreciate seeing more of these nuanced stories appear in the mainstream. (Disclaimer: I am not trying to diagnose the subject of this show. I'm simply saying the episode was triggering to me, as the womans behavior that was shown was similar to my parents.) &amp;#x200B; The episode is about a drill team leader with two adult daughters. At first, the story seemed to be, Shes so dedicated to the drill team that she doesnt have time for herself. I was afraid thats as deep as the episode would go, as the whole time, her mannerisms were raising red flags to me. A key part of the show is the one-on-one sessions with the five. Usually, the subject opens up about different parts of their life and gets vulnerable. (Sure, this could be uncomfortable to do on film, but its a feel-good show that aims to be more than a makeover, so sharing some parts of your life story are understood to be part of the deal.) While she was charismatic on camera and basked in positive attention, she was deft at avoiding questions about her personal life. (Are your students afraid of you? Do you make time for your daughters?) I was seconds away from turning it offI didnt come here to see that be enabled and celebrated. But it got to the section with Antoni, and he actually confronted her about some of the behavior (20:28). You remind me a lot of my mother. And I dont have a relationship with her. We were afraid of her. It was neat to see him own that part of his own story to connect with the subject; his vulnerability was his strength. During Karamos section (26:02), he asks the adult daughters to sit down with the mother to talk about the distance between them. He says, Your daughters have boundary issues (28:18). She responds, But I thought we were all girlfriends. The daughters make one request, that she ask more questions about their lives. She responds, So are you just saying that Ive been, like, *boring?* The episode presents her as unable to hear her daughters perspectives and request. The daughters are gentle but firm, good models of not letting her derail the conversation. Its an uncomfortable episode, and I dont necessarily recommend it. (Im also a bit uncomfortable with the ethics of using peoples real lives for TV.) However, I felt the show held its subject somewhat accountable while still being on-brand and compassionate. Its not perfect, but they at least tried to work in a grey area: a woman can do good work in her community without being treated like a saint. And, people can survive suffering or abuse and are justified in choosing different responses, from enforcing boundaries to going no-contact. On the bright side, I liked seeing other people own their truth and be believed when they choose to share it. Our stories are our own, and when we own them, its empowering."

And my life honestly feels like... Idk how to say it, so analogy time! Ok so you know how the N will gaslight you and say that its your fault and what not. In this case, it feels like the N won. I dont have the spirit and joy in me anymore, heck its not even depression. Like some dude said that being in an N relationship is like a black hole. The closer you get, the more taxing and hard it is and the more depressed you get. And at the singularity your entire worldview is warped to the N. Its like the singularity for me, an endless gray area of resignation and indifference. And because of it, the crazy thing is *I dont mind.* Specifically, I dont care, why would I (at the singularity remember?). The only thing stopping me from becoming a TOTAL N clone is the simple fact in my head that she's an N. And heck, over here, that fact itself might dissolve away. I generally feel I CAN be self aware, at some point I could make *rational* decisions emotionally. Well that's gone, and none of the shit matters. RN its just some memorised set of ""protocols"" which work to an extent. These also have been corrupted and dont usually produce what they normally would have. A side effect of this singularity is that what was once abuse seems normal now, since of course, *its the kid's fault* or some other ad hoc explanation. My mom sometimes abuses my brother aswell, and that doesnt ""feel"" like abuse, even though it matches the textbook definitions in my head. Its great and all that I atleast know this much, but all this is the logic bit of me, but if my entire mindset is ruined, I'll doubt my (correct) logic and before we know it, I'm an N too. Writing it down really has helped a LOT, but definetely more is required to help. ALSO, my brain has this rather unrelenting ability to kill any good and helpful (ie anythng that makes me content and more intelligent emotionally) I've actually pondered this situation though back when I could do some decent stuff, and IIRC the solution is to drop everything and start over. There are just a few issues: a) the bit in my head (the one thats responsible for this shit) really goes off on a show on how I'd get rid of all this shit, all the ""good"" bits of me (and throw ad hoc explanations with it). This of course, is easy to fix, I know HOW I ""got here"", and even if that was wrong, I have some ideas that work (I know THAT bc they bring about a good feeling and ""spirit"", not a high mind you, but one where you can actually be ""mature"" or whatever. Its hard to explain, put it as a mix of contentment, happiness and success? Oh and throw in the maturity shit aswell). This ofcourse, is met with more ad hoc shite, but i find it easy to deal with, to return to the analogy, when not IN the singularity. (At times, like right now writing this I feel that I get out enough to find a way to go all the way out, just that I dont exactly know how, or that I even will with the shit in my head. Not how physics works but ok) But the big issue is issue b) When I drop everything (and it has to be everything, nothing can stay) I become vulnerable as hell, and thats a REALLY big issue when you have an N. Ill try to remember how I pulled it off last time, but any advice on this (and issue a) would help. Just saying, some might be inclined to say ""well keep some bits to reduce vulnerability and drop the rest"" that wont work. To really achieve a decent state of mind, you need some good values and ""rules of life"", plus an empty canvas (or a workable canvas, ie practically most people). Anything in it, thats THIS ""impure"" (now I sound like a buddhist), or anything for the matter wont work since I have a feeling the bits of ""invulnerability"" in me really arent conducive to what im tryna acheive. So yeah, abstract question but advice would be appreciated. &amp;#x200B; Also for flairing, idk if it comes under Rant/Vent; Advice Request; or Support considering what actually is in here. So yeah, mods plz dont kill me"

From an early age I strive to be exceptional enough to be praised and loved. I was the scapegoat and I was never enough. Those who don't think I'm exceptional are the ones with power to make decisions in my life, like the uni probation officer who punished me for failing a class in my first semester when I was without a doc or meds due to no fault of my own. To put things in perspective, I'm an almost 40 year old disabled but not sick enough for disability transguy. I have severe behavioral health issues, partially due to abuse, but I am high functioning otherwise. I'm a modern renaissance man, engineering, inventing, painting, illustration, 3D art, coding, mathematics, theater, costume design, writing, I can do it all and have won accolades for things I've done but nothing I do is good enough. I am an older college student majoring in engineering but dropped out of a top eng school due to mental illness and will be moving to a new uni eventually. I am thinking about a double major--adding an art major but my perfectionism sabotages me. I have no portfolio and I can't bring myself to start one. Nothing I do will ever be good enough for me. My nmom and edad discouraged my art and I internalized it. I need external praise and compliments because I hate everything I do. I am broken beyond repair. I want to make art but I can't bring myself to do it because anything I make will be garbage. The worst part is that the ones who do see me as exceptional often take my lack of expressed insecurity (I hide vulnerability out of habit because narcmom feeds off it) as confidence and self-assuredness, so I don't get the external support I need because people assume I don't need support. People tell me they are intimidated by my talents and stoicism. Ergo, I'm left with the internalized nagging voices of my parents saying I'm not good enough, what I make is worthless, and I'll never amount to anything in my life. My perfectionism sabotages me so days pass me by with nothing to show for it. I'm so depressed. Does anyone else deal with this type of bullshit?"
146,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"It's not my parents but my closest friend who, until very recently, I looked up to and tried to emulate. Recently found out he's a narcissist. I think I've been getting gaslighted for the past four years. How do I bounce back and reverse the emotional damage?",6,cikxq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/cikxq3/its_not_my_parents_but_my_closest_friend_who/,2019-07-28 04:19:56,"I met him about 4 years ago, after which we hit it off considerably. We'll call him A. We had one other person in our squad, who was a textbook narcissist. Let's call him B. I never liked B and that distaste grew over time. I kept trying to initiate conversations about our clear animosity but each time I'd get told, both by A and B, that I was overreacting to what was normal, everyday 'banter'. 'A' would always vouch for 'B' and tell me each time I tried to cut him off, that maybe he has changed. Eventually, after 3 years, I stopped caring and cut off B completely. Thing is, since 2016 I had gone from a relatively easy-going, carefree person to an almost obsessive, perfectionistic person. Everything I said had to sound 'proper', so as to avoid A and B poking holes in how I phrased something, instead of them actually addressing whatever I said. Everything I did had to be perfect, because anything less was a sign of being 'mentally challenged'. Showing any sort of vulnerability wasn't welcomed but taken advantage of and used in later conversations. Anything I had to say was not at all as important as what they had to say. It had gotten to the point where I was convinced I was an idiot. So convinced that whenever I was with them, I'd do stupid things out of sheer anxiety, creating a kind of feedback loop. &amp;#x200B; While I didn't like B, for some reason I always liked A. Even though he was a dick and super egotistical. Stuck by him, even offered him support when he'd get down about his old friends 'abandoning' him. I grew to immensely respect him and even tried to emulate him. After a while, we had a **fourth** person join our group. We'll call him M. This man is an immensely passionate, emotional man who, when we met him, was an utter sweetheart. After he started hanging out in the group frequently, he became more and more mentally 'confused'. See, M would try to explain himself when he did something and A would continue to interrupt and berate him over something petty. And then claim that he wasn't arguing but simply discussing. Each time. I'd try intervene but M would tell me to let A finish, hoping to get some good advice from him. 'M' would go on to then doubt himself and would overthink to the point of social paralysis and would blame himself for things that were out of his control. When he expressed these things to me, I couldn't help but feel a bit dumbfounded. Why? Because I knew *exactly* what he was feeling. I looked back at everything over the past 4 years and realised that my dear friend A was a narcissist. He'd be nice when needed and will even give you gifts and be charismatic but any challenge to his ego and he wont even look at you. Anything you say, he wouldn't acknowledge. And he would look for any chance to insult you. Just as he'd talk down to M, he'd do the same to me. When I'd defend myself, he'd get louder and eventually ask me to repeat and rephrase (even if it is as clear as possible), until I start to stutter, after which he'd laugh and say I don't even have a point to what I'm saying. Recently, since I figured out he was a narcissist, I'd be more certain of what I was trying to say. At first he'd tell me I'm remembering it wrong, and emphasise that point repeatedly, but when I replied with absolute certainty, he'd change course and say ""Ah, of course! That's what I was saying, we're on the same page."" It was infuriating. Thing is, anyone we meet, instantly likes him. He'll talk over you until he's the one commanding the conversation, but will be respectful and nice to the new person. He'll remember names, give life advice and act all-around like the 'perfect person' but despite this, I can't help but see this insidious, nearly sinister side to him. It just exposes itself more, the more time I spend with him. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, I thought about this particular aspect only recently - **gaslighting**. Earlier I mentioned my friend, M, who was having trouble with overthinking and confusion. He quite literally described it as 'feelings of insanity'. Now, I did my research and realised a lot of these thoughts, emotions and actions can be attributed to gaslighting. Essentially, gaslighting is making someone question their own perception of the events around them. It's interesting to me because it ticks every box. Every symptom I've experienced; Anxiety, confusion, indecisiveness - occurred *after* I met A and B. And yes, they did slowly become the only people I hung out with regularly. Yet even though I cut B out, the symptoms persist. When I told M to try spend less time with A and B, he said it helped when I checked in a few months later. I fear even after I cut A out, the same symptoms will continue to happen. Needless to say, I feel immensely betrayed by who I thought was one of the most reliable, trustworthy people in my life. I don't see any other way except cutting him out completely. ***So how do I bounce back?*** To stop doubting myself, to stop becoming overly conscious of tiny things, to stop believing I can't do something without someone else present? I feel sometimes like I've forgotten how to live. This is certainly gaslighting, right? I don't see what else could be driving these symptoms. I'm sorry for the wall of text, I've just given this a lot of thought and felt like I needed to give you a lot of the details to get a good suggestion as to how to deal with the problem. &amp;#x200B; tl;dr Closest friend turns out to be a narcissist, I suspect he's been gaslighting me for four years. How do I bounce back and revert the emotional damage?"

Recently things have gotten very rocky and uncertain so I started staying with my mom. She welcomed me with open arms. She started getting inside my head even though I could see it happening and thought I was deterring it. She still somehow found a way to take control of my mind and my actions right in front of me. I started acting and sounding more and more like her, ruining my relationship. Now my boyfriend is moving states and states away to go to school and be closer to his family, and now that Im officially living with my mom, the nice loving mother act has been dropped. She wont stop telling me how shes works so much harder then me (she works about 5 hours a day. I work 8 hours a day), she gets mad at me for not doing anything for her. I tell her theres nothing to be done right now and she says its because she does it all. ????? The fuck you mad about then? My dad is taking me out of the house today (theyve been separated since I was little, for context) and when I told her she said since you and your dad have so much leisure time maybe he can figure out how to pay for your school since I do everything else. She gets mad at me at 8:30/9 in the morning for not being as productive as her when Im just waking up and having coffee to start my day. Shes always insulting me, always berating me, making me feel bad about myself. When I do the things she asks or more than she asks me to do, she doesnt even care. Sometimes she says thank you. And if she doesnt, and I ask her for a thank you, she tells me shes not gunna kiss my ass for doing simple things. Fine then Im not gunna help you out then. She literally cannot accept the fact Im going through a hard time. I tell her that and she says Im going through a hard time too yet I still work every day. I dont get to swim in my pool. Funny because several days ago she got through telling me how good her life has been the past year and she content. So this was news to me. I ask her what shes going through and she says working. And the pool thing. The other day she said this to me and I said you get out at 4 everyday. Go swimming then and guess what? Topic change!!!!! She swerved that comment. And part of her same rant to me the other day also included and Im out of moisturizer. I cant even moisturize for 3 days that was laughable. I told her I think shell live. &gt; Nothing I do is good enough. If I do as much as I can to help her instead of myself while still helping her here and there then she gets irate and wont stop bitching at me. Basically she wants me to forget me and my feelings exist and do everything for her. She just wants me here to be her emotional punching bag it feels like. No matter what I do, its never good enough and she finds something else to get mad at me about. She literally will not accept the fact Im hurting right now, any time I show a shred of vulnerability she whips out her victims cars like were dueling in YuGiYoh. She has been the least helpful person during this process in my life. Dont be surprised if I kill someone lol"

For years I thought it was me. I've been putting off making a post on here for so long. I'm a lurker, but I'm finally posting. I have so many fears that my situation does not fit the bill, or that I'm just attributing these experiences to ""narcissism"" but they're mislabeled and I have no right to call them that. I've been afraid to share details of this in a more public way for years. I think this is abuse but i really am looking for validation. I've been so terrified for so long that this is all just 'my opinion' and 'my side' and that its not the 'real truth'. I know that I need to continue finding validation in myself (and finally, this past year ive been developing it!) but im also looking forward to professional validation from a counselor. My partner introduced me to this subreddit a year ago, and since then, Ive been coming to terms with admitting this is abuse. I hope me sharing will help someone else. (Tl;dr; at the bottom) I want this to be pretty long and detailed, for my own sake. I'm terrified of missing something and that one detail that I accidentally left out being the one thing that proves I wasn't actually abused. (If that makes sense). But since I can't cover everything as extensively as I want (due to memory being faulty on some experiences) , here's a general rundown (and what I know I remember perfectly) I tested the waters a few days ago with this post, looking for validation. [URL \----Timeline ---- (age 4) Approx 2003- NDad got full custody of me from BioMom, cuts contact 2007- NDad marries Mom #2 2009- NDad and Mom #2 divorce, he enforces no contact between us 2010- NDad marries NStepMom 2010- NStepMom gives birth to twin siblings (age 17)2016- I move out of the house and learn that people don't all think Im this awful creature, even when I tell them everything that happened. 2016- NStepMom gives birth to another child December 2018- I get back in contact with Mom #2, very beneficial, she tells me she loves me like a daughter. June 2019- I contact BioMom, very beneficial, she shows how much she loves me. (age 20)July 19, 2019- LC with NDad (age 20)August 1, 2019- LC with Nstep-mom To give some context, on July 19th I went LC with my father after one of our countless phone calls where he gaslights me and degrades me to no end. I told him that I had taken this call because I thought maybe it would be different this time but it wasn't. And that hurt. He told me, word for word, ""I dont care about you emotionally."" After I expressed to him how it hurts that he can't be emotionally vulnerable with me. ""That really hurts me dad"" and he responded with ""Im sorry it hurts, Im a logical and fact-based person! You need counseling, I cant help you"". This interaction drove it in deep that this isn't healthy for me. Throughout the entire conversation he kept gaslighting me with things like this; ""Im telling you a fact versus what you think was said"" ""And THIS is a fact"" ""Heres the reality"" ""I never said that"" ""Well there's what you think happened then theres the reality"" ""You just don't remember"" ""You're getting a lot of bad information"" ""Shitty information"" When I mentioned how I dont think its fair for parents to expect children to act better than their example/environment (when they have no other frame of reference), he said ""That's an excuse."" ""You were a problematic child"" ""How often would it take for you to just do simple tasks?"" ""You had a lot of crazy emotions"" Like my emotions are a bad thing. We had you in counseling, you just wouldn't change He said that my bio-mom was a waste of breath and of no value."" when I mentioned how beneficial our relationship has been for me and how much were healing. Biomom was in my life until I was four when my dad got full custody. (I re-established contact with her in June 2019) She was an addict at the time and she abused me physically and verbally, and neglected a lot of my basic needs. NDad always told me when I was growing up how awful she was to me, how he saved me from her and how big of a deal it was that he won custody over me, ect. Despite hearing this my whole life, and having memories of the abuse, I decided to contact her in June to see for myself because I believe in giving someone a chance to communicate. Ndad hasnt so much as spoken to her in 15 years. And Ive come to find out that this woman has been searching for me my entire life, and that she's been sober for over a decade now. She has an amazing job making six figures, and two amazing kids that she treats incredibly well. When I explained to him that this has been a very beneficial thing for me and how we're working through her past abuse, and how healthy this is for me, he said ""I'm sad she lies to you that way. She's a manipulative nasty woman. When I tell my dad my NstepMom favored her children more than me, and I always felt like I wasn't part of the family, he said, well you didnt act like one of our kids. I tried to talk to my Nstepmom on several occasions about this as a child, and she just brushed it off every time saying weve never treated you that way! Theyd force me to walk around the neighborhood block (if I had argued with them defending myself), more than once for 6+ hours at a time. And theyd sit on the front porch and watch me and laugh at me when I passed. When I mentioned the time he threw my laptop over the stairs (because I ate food in my room when he asked me not to) he justified it to me with ""Minors don't have property rights"" and ""It didn't belong to you."" My Mom#2 was very beneficial to me, but she and my NDad divorced due to his narcissistic tendencies and he cut all contact with her. I never knew what happened between them until I talked to her myself. I was told she abandoned me when in reality my NDad thwarted all of her attempts to contact me. I reached out to her myself in December 2018. She recently gifted her engagement ring from her marriage to my dad to me, because she believed it would mean a lot to me. It did, and it does. More than anything. They divorced due to my Ndads narcissistic tendencies and he cut all contact with her and I never knew what happened between them until I talked to her myself. I was told she abandoned me when in reality my Ndad blocked all of her attempts to contact me. We re-established contact in December 2018. Their marriage (when I was 7-9) was the most beneficial part of my childhood, and she was the most compassionate and understanding mom I couldve asked for. My dad's response when I told him about the ring was ""You weren't a child of our marriage. It doesn't belong to you"" That really stung, because he knows how much their marriage means to me. He then continued to say that any vulnerable conversation I had with Mom #2 about their marriage was ""not vulnerability, that's crossing a boundary"". BTW, Turns out Mom #2 bought the ring for their engagement because he refused to get a job. My NDad never told me this. So technically, she has a right to give it to whoever she wants. He also said a lot of things like ""Don't interrupt, you're talking to an adult"" and then proceeded to interrupt me. I don't mind being interrupted, it's part of a conversation and im okay with that, but he's a bit of a hypocrite. Somehow we got onto the topic of how im not conservative or christian anymore like him; and he said ""what do you live for"" and I said, ""I feel like life is pointless..."" (I was about to talk about optimistic nihilism) but he immediately responded with ""I can tell"". When I said ""Wow, that hurts"" he said ""Suck it up. Be a fucking adult."" I had earlier been talking about how I have depression. That seems a bit insensitive to me. When we talked about the abuse from my NStep-Mom, he says ""Well, you survived it."" and ""You were a problematic child, what do you expect."" He also said ""She's owned up to her abuse. And here's where these messages between her and I come in. After two years of me making it clear I didn't want a relationship with my NStep-Mom because I felt like she was abusing me, I sent her a friend request on facebook (so I could save a few photos from my childhood). She sent me a message and I wanted to give her a chance to have a vulnerable conversation (thinking in my mind, maybe it will be different this time?). It didn't go well, and she blocked me as soon as she read my last message. Like instantly. (Just a moment before, she was telling me how she was there for me and then \*blocked\*) She blamed her abuse on everyone else but herself, contrary to what my dad has told me over and over and over again these past two years. I go into a bit of the abuse in our conversation here. But I have a list below of everything else that I can remember. [URL Heres the audio of the video I sent her. \[TRIGGER WARNING: VERBAL ABUSE\] [URL \------NStep-Mom abuse------ She used to call me a deer in headlights and shame me for taking more than two seconds to think. Then on another day she'd say ""think before you speak"" and shame me for responding quickly. Every action I did was shamed and she contsantly treated me like I was retarded. ""When I was your age I cared about others. I would never do the things you do to my mother. When I was your age I worked hard "" -Nstepmom They called a cop on me once because my NStep-Mom was screaming at me and I screamed back in defense. She slapped the hell out of me. That time I was fed up and scared and I didn't know what else to do and I felt the only way I could deal with the situation is to scream to defend myself. They then called law enforcement. I was very polite to the officer and very scared and I told him how she slapped me and pulled my hair and he didn't believe me. He said, There are two sides to a story, this is just your side. Your parent very clearly loves you because they have you in counseling and called law enforcement. When I asked if hitting their daughter is legal, he said Its not illegal, and remember, its just your side of the story. You should listen to their side. That really fucked me up. And reinforced their abuse and the idea that I was the main problem all along. I was fifteen. When I told my NDad I was suicidal, he forced me into a vehicle and pretended he was driving me to a mental hospital in the middle of the night. When I was crying and telling him how badly I was in pain, how I just needed someone to talk to and how I didnt feel like I was a part of the family, he said, ""we'll call the pastor's wife and if you talk to her and pray with her we can go home."" Everything Nstep-mom did she justified with ""It's tough love. I'm telling you this/doing this because I love you"" NStep-Mom would also throw fake slaps/punches at me and when id flinch and back away in fear she'd laugh and say ""you really think I would hurt you? It's called tough love kid"" She did slap me on other occasions. And hit me, and push me. There was one time her and NDad pushed me against the wall and screamed at me. I couldn't move. She pulled my hair and twisted my ears, and threw/kicked things at me. Shed grab my arms and twist them behind my back and hold me there. NDad did this too. Shed squeeze my wrists so hard they left a red mark. I was salutatorian in high school, .03 GPA away from valedictorian, and graduated a year early, grinding out both my junior and senior years in one; and I didnt feel like it was enough. Straight A's, thanks to constant work to live up to their expectations. And when it came to scholarships I wasnt enough for NStep-mom because I couldn't apply to valedictorian scholarships for a full ride When I was a teenager I couldn't be touched (on the arm, shoulder, knee etc etc, anywhere) without shaking and getting hysterical, while feeling extremely violated. I think that has to do with sexual abuse as a child (I'll make a post about this later). My NStep-Mom would intentionally poke me and squeeze my limbs while I was crying and shaking and asking her to stop over and over and she'd just say ""you're exaggerating, you're fine, get over yourself"". My cousin was telling us how she was excited because she got accepted for a study abroad trip. NStep-Mom looked at me and said ""that should be you, why didn't you work harder"" That really stung. Then she said, Well, even if you got in you dont have the work ethic for it. My NStep-Mom forced me to take a drug test when I was 16, saying that they didn't suspect me of taking drugs but its due diligence. Then she continued by saying your dad thinks youre sleeping around because they didn't have access to my 2nd email. I had told her years before that I was Asexual and I dont want to have sex and she just scoffed and rolled her eyes at me. I didnt lose my virginity or even kiss until I was 18 and I havent done drugs once in my life. The drug test came back negative, and they then continued to accuse me of being a whore around school because of a second email. (my first email was heavily surveilled by them- keep in mind I wasn't allowed to have a phone until college, and I only had an email and a laptop that my dad smashed). She told me that shes the only woman whos ever been a true Mom to me. She did this a lot when I mentioned how she made me feel awful about myself. There was one time where she sat me down and asked me Im a good person, arent I? and I was 14 and I thought so so I said yes. You don't have trauma, no one died in your arms Good people wouldn't treat you this way if it wasn't you You don't take responsibility for your faults I became a very apologetic person, and every time I would apologize for accidentally doing something wrong, defending myself, or saying something that they deemed as argumentative deceitful undermined their authority triangulated or ''crazymake I would say, Im sorry. Theyd then say thats not an apology You need to ask for forgiveness So id say Im sorry, would you please forgive me and theyd say THATS NOT A FUCKING APOLOGY, repeat after me Im sorry for doing such and such, I wasnt thinking, I was being \_\_\_\_(selfish, any other synonym)\_\_\_, would you please forgive me? Id say that, but then theyd say Youre using a sassy tone with me! This happened consistently throughout almost every day. My Dad constantly forced me to apologize to NStepMom (instead of letting me take the time to apologize on my own, it had to be instant) just because she demanded that he make me. Even on something small like I accidentally didn't clean one dish right. She told me that my tears are fake and made up. Constantly. Every time I cried. You dont have empathy, youre selfish Once, I recorded a video of her abusing me verbally, and she found out and I told her it was because I didn't feel safe (I was also wanting to show it to my counselors, I needed help). She said it cant possibly be about safety, youre clearly safe here. Youre just victimizing yourself! At one point, I believed I was satan/the antichrist because they treated me like such a shitty person. Your feelings aren't true Youre challenged, change isn't possible Every conversation, felt like a debate I dont have any better examples because I deleted so many threads years ago when I moved, but here are the examples I could still find: [URL Youre driving everyone out of their minds Youre a black hole, a crazy maker, a triangulator When I would go to a counselor or my grandparents, and tell them what was happening so that I could get some help; NStep-Mom would hear about it and barge in and tell me I was triangulating and turning everyone against her. Before my last year of highschool, I had a problem being honest with NStep-Mom (little white lies when she asked me simple questions, I just wanted to protect myself)... this turned into her screaming at me and calling me a pathological liar. I didn't realize until I moved out at 17 that its normal for children who are fearful to lie, and that I hadnt ever lied in a way that was truly detrimental or antagonistic. I just wanted some sense of safety and self. I just want the best for you, its called tough love Why dont you fucking think normally I know in highschool I had two counselors that told me that my parents were not healthy. But I didn't get how they could say that. I believed it was all me. However, every time I'd go to a counselor. My Nstep-mom would run in and make sure to ""clarify"" immediately after my session was up if she felt like i hadn't put her in a positive light. She would yell at the counselors and tell them how much of a problem child I was and how I was lying about everything. She'd then interrogate me on the way home and scream at me if I defended myself. Id go back in the next week and the counselor would treat me like my NStep-Mom was right. Both my Dad and NStep-Mom would drop me off on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere and then 10-20 min later drive back, yell at me to get in, and drive off screaming at me. Ive developed migraines due to the trauma from my childhood and the trauma from my Nparents, to the point where my body numbs out and I cant comprehend/read/speak when Im in a migraine. It disables me completely, I cant feel oftentimes through my hands or face or anything that goes numb. I have my worse migraines when the words of my Ndad, Nstep-mom and Ngrandparents circle in my head. When I would self degrade, have a lack of confidence, or lack of faith in myself, things like that come about. things like ""you're not passionate"", ""you have no responsibility"", ""you should be doing \_\_\_"", ""Why arent you doing x instead of y?"" ""you have no self awareness"", ""You never change"" you dont care about anyone, youre a selfish brat . ANd when there's a lack of acknowledgement for all the beautiful things I've been doing for myself. it gets to the point where I feel like I you havent done anything good for myself or made any progress at all. I think I havehonestly, I know I have. The people around me now validate that and help me work through anything Im struggling with.(All of the growth, the development, the progress Ive made emotionally and how self aware Ive become. I have gained tremendous amounts of self confidence this past year, thanks to people around me and the work Ive done). My Dad told me that my migraines are only emotional and when I was in highschool they completely denied that I had migraines. Theyre triggered by just slight amounts of stress, and Im completely disabled when they start up. My parents always called that an excuse and deny that they exist to the intensity that they do. I have extreme grass and pine allergies even when my face was puffy, eyes were red and swollen, and I could barely breathe, theyd make me mow the lawn and theyd say youre exaggerating youre victimizing Now, I have LC with both my NParents. I left email open for them because Im afraid of completely cutting it off, but both of them are blocked from my phone, so no phone calls/texts. I did tell them that I cant ensure a response through email but I didn't feel like I could completely leave them without a way to contact me. Theyve blocked people in our family out in such a dramatic fashion (and for irrational things) and I dont agree with that; I don't want to be like them. It doesn't seem real writing this all down; but I know it happened and I think my brain is just second guessing because of all the gaslighting I've been through. I have people who support me and love me. Two Aunts and Uncles, some cousins, a really supportive partner, My BioMom and my Mom #2 everyone has been very good at helping me think through painful things and supporting me with finding whats best for me. Both my aunts (NDads siblings) experienced similar things with their father. My NGrandpa abused the family in the same way my NParents abused me. My aunts are wonderful examples of people who are breaking that narcissism chain and are working hard to get rid of the same patterns that run in our family. No one has pressured me to do things I dont think are right; and they have all been blatantly honest with me and shown me how much they care. These relationships consist of both people caring about the other, and that's such a beautiful change for me. Everyone is really good at healthy communication (another amazing new thing for me) and for 3 years Ive been growing and learning to become a more self-loving and confident self aware person. I have a long way to go and a lot of counseling to go through, but regardless I know Im finally on the road to recovery. I've tried my best these past three years to be vulnerable, honest, and self aware; and my new family and friends tell me they can see how much ive grown and changed into a more stable/solid/self aware person. I can't thank them enough for their support. I've talked through so many things with so many friends and family members in my support group. Im putting myself back into counseling in a month to help myself even more.This past year has consisted of me coming to terms with the fact that my parents are narcissists, and I hope youre able to confirm that too. (Tl;dr; coming to terms with my parents being narcs looking for support)"
149,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,This quote from John Carptener's The Thing perfectly describes the narcissist,39,cm0ddi,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/cm0ddi/this_quote_from_john_carpteners_the_thing/,2019-08-05 05:21:30,"I was watching *[The Thing](URL last night; one of my favorite films, I highly recommend it. MacReady's analysis of the Thing is captured here (emphasis mine): &gt; I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human. **This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.** This applies to every N I've met and read about. They seek to assimilate, to copy individuals and groups as a way to hide, but their poorly structured and destructive selves allow for neither authentic nor healthy social cohesion. So, they're either exposed or infect those around them. Vulnerability ""out in the open"" resonates with my experiences, too. While some Ns I know are social butterflies, all of them harbor darker traits that they fight to keep hidden; e.g., wearing proverbial masks, maintaining a small digital footprint (no social media), refusing to be in pictures that will be posted online, and so on. In this way, the N and Thing are not so different."
150,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I can't stand this anymore.,6,cmaeaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/cmaeaq/i_cant_stand_this_anymore/,2019-08-05 22:32:23,"20 F here living in a 3rd world country. I just can't stand this anymore. It's a long read so buckle up. I'm still living with them. I can't get out or I'll end up on the streets deprived of any emotional, social, and financial support. My sister says shut up. Don't talk back. Don't hurt your father's feelings. He'll hit you while calling you selfish, evil, and disrespectful. Your culture requires of you to respect your parents at all costs, to never say an ""insulting"" or ""disrespectful"" word to your parents. Your culture forces you to give unearned obedience to parents who don't know how to parent. ""My father doesn't let me.. My mother tells me.."" ""Why are your parents like that?"" Anyone who cares asks me. ( I have few 'friends' because you must be an obedient and good girl and only choose the friends that I want or you stay with no one.) Why do I seem to mention my parents a lot in my conversations with people? Why do I talk about actions they did to control me instead of fun activities we have done together? (Activities which never happened) I craved love so much. True genuine love. I wanted someone who loves me for who I am. Someone who loves my vulnerable little self. Someone who will give me the acceptance that I crave. Someone who loves me without any ulterior motives. Someone who will teach me how to survive and thrive in life. Someone who will acknowledge my humanity and my innate weaknesses. Someone who isn't ashamed of being human. Who doesn't shame me for being human. But nobody came. And now I don't think I can be human anymore. You know.. I still crave love. I still crave genuine acceptance. A healthy life with no prejudice or shame. But it still feels foreign to me. I can't understand or relate. All I know that when I think about it I cry. My father only wants the best for me. He wants to raise me correctly and instill discipline into my life. You see, as I child, I can't laugh or joke near him. My father works really hard in this company and I should give him the quiet and peace that he wants. Maybe his workplace stresses him out to the point of hitting me but it is okay. It's my fault because I snapped back at him. I was isolated and my place was at home. Good girls don't go out alot because it is immoral. You were small, weak, and gullible and I can't let anything hurt you. I'm so protective of you that I don't trust you to have friends and go out with them. Your mother was a stay-at-home mother because she didn't trust nannies taking care of you. Your mother has a university degree unlike me, who is a simple mechanic. She could have worked in a more luxiourous and stable job than me, but I didn't let her. It was all because of you. I needed to protect you eitherwise you will turn into a degenerate brat who does drugs, goes to parties, and neglets her studies. You need to study and get good grades because I was spolied as a child and I don't want that for you. You see, extremes are the way to go. My way or no way. You choose. We can't have a healthy middle ground because I, as a father, care more about me being right that doing the right thing. It's no big deal. I (the daughter) can be bad too. I remember lashing on my younger sister all the time. I didn't hit her. But I would always criticise and shame her constantly. If she did one simple mistake or dropped something, I would yell at her. Funny how this reminds of how my father violently lashes on us for doing a simple mistake. Also I don't like hugs. Physical touch discomforts me immensely. Displays of affection makes me feel weird and makes me experience something that I don't want to feel. I can't sleep properly. I have weird obssessions. Maybe because I am on the spectrum, but nah, my father believes I'm perfectly fine despite having a crippled and autistic sister himself. Research this neurological disorder, I say. He lashes at me and starts making fun of me. See? You're selfish, mean, and heartless. Why don't you treat your siblings well? Why can't you express your joy for their happiness? Why do you always criticise them? Why are you so emotionally unavailable? You are fickle and weak. You have a weak connection with God. You don't have feelings and you don't care about anyone around you. You only care about yourself. I can cut your connection to God if I want you. Unless you open your heart and obey me, you will suffer in life and no one will accept you. God won't be happy if you are selfish. Stop disobeying me and just do what I say even if you don't want to. I know better and it's for your own good. Stop scowling all the time and be helpful in the house. Why can't you be like normal children? You're so stupid and useless. I need to discipline you more! Look at your sister she's eating alot and now she's overweight. It's all your fault. You're the eldest sister and a role model to the house, if there's a bad thing in ypur siblings then they have picked it from you. The shit that appears from them are all because of you. You're an antisocial, stupid, and naughty girl. Why are you always staying on that computer? Are you trying to distance yourself from spending time with me. What's wrong with me? I'm your father and I love you. Harsh discipline and care are needed because you need to know that the world is cruel. See all those mischevious girls and boys who are always failing in school and are spoiled as shit? They weren't raised correctly, but you are. I say that there a lot of nice and smart people who like to have fun as well. He dismisses me then continues: ""Now, I know I criticise you and emotionally abuse you all the time.. and I know that I always say that you are a selfish daughter and a loser, but what matters is that I'm raising you correctly according to my own rules."" I'm raised so fine that I was constantly bullied and isolated at school. I'm raised so fine that I don't have any friends because of my belief that I didn't deserve any due to my unlovable personality and not because having friends requires vulnerability which I was deprived of as a child. I'm raised so fine that I started binge eating when I was 8 in order to escape the neglect and cruelness of my surrounding. I'm raised so fine that I believed that standing up for my self is wrong and that having boundaries is something selfish. I'm raised so fine that I'm a quite peaceful little thing in the class and I didn't engage with anyone to the point I was called a mute. I'm raised so fine because I wasn't deprived of food, shelter, education, and clothing. Because physical needs are the only thing a child needs. Being emotionally satisfied and healthy is not. I'm raised so fine because I wasn't allowed to get fashionable and cute clothes as a girl and I had to wait 3 years until I got a couple of shirts and a jeans, and one pair of shoes. 3 years. And I got them after constant nagging and resistance from my parents. I'm raised so fine that I was afriad to voice any opinion of my own and defend myself against mean people. I'm raised so fine that I became a dormat and spineless codependent piece of shit. I'm raised so fine that I don't have a personality of my own, I feel fake and feel like forcing any happiness and enthusiasim in social situations. I'm raised so fine that I learnt how to mask correctly and appear as If I have the best parents in the world. I'm raised so fine that I always feel hollow on the inside, because I have no opinion or hobbies on my own. Maybe playing videogames. But my father always tells me that I should just clean the house instead of playing stupid games. My mother? She's a spineless maid. She has no opinion of her own and always agrees with him. She punishes and berates me just like him. But she's a little warm-hearted and lean with us. She lets things slide. Like when I vent my frustrations which is a normal human emotion. Or when I calmly point out that there is something wrong with something she does where she self-reflects instead of dismissing me. Or when she stands between me and my father when he tries to hit me. Or when she tries to diffuse a situation and keep things calm. My mother, I love you for that and I'll never forget. But, this is unhealthy. And you are a codependent. You always think that you are responsible for his outburts and that it is your job to accomodate his emotional swings. They say men are logical and are always right. Logical my ass. They are as much as ego-sensitive and irrational as we are. Damn this fake people and fake belief. Religion is not geniune anyomore and is used to abuse and control people. And despite all of that, he always tells my mother to be harsher on me, claiming that she is too kind-hearted in handling me. I don't know if I wanna cry or laugh. I feel like a starved animal. Today I had enough. I'm a 20 year-old university student for gods sake. Why do I have to respect a cruel 50 year-old man? Why do I have to give unquestioned deferance to a spiritual narcissist and a codependent mother? Last year, I had a wake-up call after going through a harsh, shamefull, and eye-opening experience. They say that university is where the brainwashing begins. I started meeting new people from different backgrounds. I noticed some who are like me and some the opposite. I met sociopaths, narcissists, and normal people. I started joining the dots and analyzing my life back then. This was coupled with my professors' attentive remarks and care which made me realize toxic aspects about my personality which I though was normal. You know, no one really directly asked me if I was alright, as I was good at hiding it. But my seemingly peaceful, reserved nature didn't fool the keen eye of the older teachers. They noticed the anxiousness, sadness, and isolation coupled with it. I told them I was a bit shy so that's why I didn't engage in class.. but they told me this is no good because you need to work in the future. Then they started to hint to anecdotes about abused people. I unintentionally found myself in them and I almost teared up. To this one professor, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I may have felt some shame from you figuring me out, but I know that it was needed in order to wake up. And it may seem that I don't like it, I will be forever thankful for your attention. My awareness brought me to reddit. Then I found this sub and many others. The ugly truth started coming out. It is harrowing, horrible, and uncomfortable. To realize that you were denied of your childhood and that it may never come back. That's disturbing. My head hurts. I couldn't stand it anymore. I gained awareness and I cannot respect my parents anymore. I cannot feel any empathy for them. I want to hurt them as much as they hurt me. I want to humilate them. Now I am much smarter than them and I know my rights. So what I did is.. I gave them a piece of my mind. And then hell was set lose. I started telling them what I read here. I don't know if it was a good idea but I really wanted to vent away. I was made fun of and shamed instantly. I was called sensitive and a liar. You have hit me in my childhood and that's why I'm unable to keep close friends. My father denies that I was hit as a child. Crazy, right? I still remember it like yesterday. My siblings remember nothing. Maybe because because they weren't subjected to it as much as I am. Or maybe bacause there were no scars. Who knows. So the whole house thinks I'm mean and cruel for inventing nasty stuff about my good father. I started criticizing my parents for their hypocritical behavior. Any hint of criticism in my tone of voice is percieved as disrespect from them. They accuse me of being disrespectful, and my father as always threaten me with a slap or beating. They became more annoyed with me and craved the time when I left them. They started pitting my siblings against me saying I was a miserable and hateful person who hates the ones who have took care of her. Then I started telling my sister of something called narcissistic abuse and I think she's getting it slowly. My parents started claiming that I'm leading my sister to spiritual degeneracy and immoral westernized behavior. ""AmbitiousDelay, that selfish and stupid girl who knows nothing in life. Why would you listen to her?"" They say. Yup. I am the scapegoat of my family. All this years I was convinced that I was a naughty, immoral, evil child who was secretly conspiring with the devil. Today I was casually eating grapes on the couch. I already see my father coming through the hallway and from experience I know what will happen. I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it will be a kind of shaming. I was correct, and he passive aggressively talks to my mother infront of me about how eating alot of grapes are bad for your stomach or something. I loudly state that if he has any problem with me eating grapes. He responds that he is not talking to me, but my mother. He then continues passive aggressively ranting about me while ignoring me. I had enough of this shit. I cannot take this anymore. I cannot take this immature behavior anymore. Why are you allowed to hurt me and I'm not ? Why impossible rules and standards are imposed on me while you have nothing to stop you ? In what way this is a normal game? In what way it is a fair game? This a game I don't like playing because I'm the loser everytime. This is called the narcissist's game. Immediately after his remarks I retorted louder that I'm not hurting anybody by eating these grapes and I accused him of talking to me in a disrespectful way. He tried to play dumb and said that he didn't disrespect me in any way and that I must not eat all of grapes because others want their share as well. I say that that this a small chunck of grapes and that there are more in the fridge. He dismisses me and continues ranting about how selfish I am and how I'm eating unhealthly. I tell him that he is unreasonably rude to me and he is extremely negative everytime he enters any room. He gets angry and kicks the bowl of grapes in my hand and they all fall onto the ground and get squashed. I do not flinch and I stay strong. I claim that he shouldn't throw food like that. He advances at me threatening me with his fists and I started getting away from him while he follows me spitting ""What did you just say?"" while holding his fists to hit me. He looks at me with crazy eyes then spits at me to clean the mess. I say that this is YOUR mess that I am cleaning and why should I clean after you. He says because it is to punish me for insulting him like that. Fine. I go clean up the mess as he sits on the couch watching me. I shamed him and told him that his outburst is not about actually caring about who eats or who doesn't, it's about controling me and forcing me to do as he wishes. He then says if I want to be beaten infront of people. I say you can do it here when my sisters are here and my brother returns from his job in order for them to know how much evil you are. He then says that I am the evil person, and that my siblings will hit me as well. He specifically said that my brother, who is 15 years old, will hit me. I finished cleaning and refused to eat the fallen grapes then I spat one last thing :"" You are a miserable person and you want others to feel miserable like you."" I told you reader, I say the truth when I say I had enough. That was the first time in ages that I spoke the truth to a narcissist like that. I felt relieved, but it soon turned to terrified as he followed me to my room and started hitting me on my head. A grown ass 20 year-old. I started screaming and crying and my mom, as usual, tried to stop him. He yelled at me to say sorry. I said that he must say sorry to me. He got crazier and started hitting me with more intensity that my head started to twirl. He repeated his request and I said no. He hit me more. My mother started blaming me and urged me to stop talking to the people who are protecting you like that. I said sorry and he feels satisfied. He then proceeds to assure me that he'll hit me like this everyday until I know better. He says that because it is his duty. Fuck your duty. I hate you so much. And I don't want your care. This happened today. He thinks this is normal. That this plays some part in raising me correctly. He genuinely believes that hitting is a good teacher. He also thinks that shaming language is normal to others but not to him. He thinks that being a parent makes him an untouchable figure. Disgusting. The tradition of hitting me somewhere stopped between 17-19 when I became more spineless and depressed. (the lowest points in my life and where I was bullied the most as school) In these years I discovered I had several digestive, hormonal, and nutritional issues due to my eating disorder. Who knew. Pcos. No one cared and BC pills where shoved into my mouth with resulted in more gut issues. Going to any doctor or health expert was shamed by my father as he blamed every sickness in me and my siblings due to eating junk food. My mom had to secretly have an appointment with doctors and take us there in order not to hurt my father's feelings. She would always tell him later when he is in a good mood. Pcos made me bald a bit and caused more depression. I complained to my father about it and he literally said that it was because of my selfishness that my hair is not strong. I feel extremely angry as I am typing this and I wish this is a joke. My father pretends that he is a good father to his friends but I know that he is one big loser and a liar. I told him once to check up on narcissisim on the internet, but he refused and made fun of me. He was kicked out of his work 10 years ago and he is still unemployed till this day. He puts the blame on the other workers with him. The reason why we're still eating and learning is due to my grandfather's savings. Reader, I hate myself. I realized that I have these same narcissistic tendencies. I realized that sometimes I have treated others in the same way my father treats me. I regret my actions deeply and I'm working on myself bit by bit. I'm educating myself more and trying to focus on my health more by exercising and eating well. My head still hurts and I feel a bump on my forhead. I'm crying as I write this. The world is unfair, I know. And I feel with everyone who has narcissistic parents. It's like living in hell. What I know is that I cannot avoid or change my past. What I know is that I need to focus on the present. Work myself to getting my degree and work. As a women living in a traditional household it will be 10 times harder, but I need to accept the cards that I've been dealt with. The only thing that has kept me alive is awareness. And a bit of hope. Thanks for listening. Just needed to vent."

I feel that my N has always viewed me as a threat. Like my presence was wrong. When I tried to engage with others or be a normal child in public, that would unintentionally draw attention to me, and away from her. I saw that this made her upset, even angry, so I shut up. Closed myself off from my emotions, and interacting with others. Never developed an identity of my own. I never saw making friends as *the human need that it is.* I've avoided romantic relationships because I genuinely feel that I cannot function in them. Overall, I'm very avoidant. Which is sad. Because I *WANT* these things. I love people. But my level of trust is gone. It will take years to develop a stable sense of self. I feel stunted and robbed of good social skills. It's frustrating to me when people write it off as ""shy"". I understand that I'm quiet and that can be intimidating or off-putting. But it's not because I'm shy, or scared of you, or have trouble expressing myself. It's about growing up alone. So I'm sorry if I sound like a nervous wreck. Or if I fall silent while trying to find the right words. I'm sorry if I share too much too soon because I'm just desperate for a connection with someone. I'm sorry I apologize for no reason too often. (Small extra rant) In media, these traits are played for charm, sometimes as a joke or cliche trope. It's not the traits that are attractive. It's the vulnerability they ooze. This is terrifying to me. I've had people point out to me that my body language alone is basically a huge beacon saying ""Hey I'm a weak and injured baby antelope, come get me!"" Overall I feel terrible that I wasn't aware of this as a teenager. But I must say, learning about body language is very interesting."

One was a cold, covert narcissist who avoided me and used me for gratification. The other was the classic ""my needs matter more than you do"" and I basically parented him in order for his childish needs to be met. I was neglected for my childhood and emotionally abused in adolescence. I was also molested at 9 years old by an older neighbor for a period of about 2 years. It wasn't every day, but it happened frequently. All of this has really taken away my ability to engage with other people deeply. I realized recently that because I never had a childhood or an adolescence and was so concerned with surviving what I was going through at home that I never truly learned how to be intimate with other people. I am terrified of vulnerability and still don't know how to engage with other people authentically. The level of shame I experience just from being me is immense. I have been an addict to many things in my life (alcohol, drugs, sex, food, tobacco, etc) all of which stemmed from a fear of intimacy with other people. If I did those things to drown out my feelings and to go inside myself I would never have to be vulnerable with another person and they would never abandon me like my mother did. I am sure this isn't uncommon in the families of Nparents. How have you learned to be intimate? I want to finally conquer my addictions, but I realized I have to be able to come clean with other people about my past."

So finally I got kind of annoyed, and I was like, ""I was hoping for a direct answer to whether you could hang out Saturday. I didn't know you were trying to ignore me. I thought you tried to call but my phone was broken like you said. It's important to me to be upfront in my friendships."" Complicating this, I keep flashing back to this time my sister, probably 14-16ish at the time, said she wanted to go to a movie with me, 18-20ish, but then she changed her mind and didn't tell me. So I was waiting for her and kind of wandering around the house, and every time I ran into her, she'd say she was almost done with something and would get ready right after. Finally, I went to find her and was like, ""Are you coming or not?"" and she was actually hiding and then she went and told our nmom. My NMom made fun of me for being a needy, creepy loser who wouldn't take no for an answer and never let me live it down. What's wrong with me and why do I feel like such a pushy, needy, creep? Is this vulnerability and rejection? Objectively, I rarely push people, so why do I feel like such a loser? Why does this one memory keep popping up when it's clearly a problem with my NMom and not with me? Is it because I really love my sister and I loved my friend? Can I bring this up in group therapy or will it sound like I haven't moved on in 10 years? Relatedly, I try to hide my friends from my roommates. It brings up feelings of my mom mocking my friends as a kid. But my roommates wouldn't do that...!"

Raised by nmom, I'm a complete pushover, wanted to raise my children differently than I was, and it's backfired.",10,c067vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/c067vv/advice_raised_by_nmom_im_a_complete_pushover/,2019-06-14 00:04:21,"Here's a little back story before I ask for any advice. And I want to mention that my kids are NOT nkids. Im only asking for advice on how to control my tendencies to not be a pushover. I was raised by a nmom. I made a vow to not raise and treat my children how I was when I was growing up. But, from her constant noxious behaviors, especially manipulation, it proved to be detrimental to my self-esteem. I'm now a push over. I'm working on it with a therapist. I've constantly lectured and discussed any wrong doings my children have done. I thought through discussion, reflection, and understanding they'd have a level of repsect for me because I'm showing them some respect and empathy in regards of their feelings and thoughts. I'm slowly realizing that it isn't viable in terms of discontinuing their bad behavior. But at times when I'm trying to be stern with my children, I will tell them sorry afterwards, eradicating the reprimand I set forth. I feel guilty any time I have to discipline (not spanking), I imagine that they feel like I did as a child. They learned I can yield easily, and I recognize I've created a bigger problem. They identified my vulnerability, being manipulated. They don't know what manipulation is, but like any kid they will find ways to get out of trouble. They are eight and six. I acknowledge the fact, that if I stay malleable, and don't create resilient boundaries that don't bend or break, they will eventually relinquish any respect they had for me. I had one punishment that I didn't falter on. I felt like a crappy parent, and I was being too extreme. I was filled with self doubt and intense guilt, that I was a bad parent. My oldest had been lying to me incessantly, and I reached a breaking point and told her she couldn't go to a friend's birthday party. She was highly upset, and continued to apologize so I could exempt her from any punishment. I had multiple lectures and discussions for months about lying. She continued to do so. I know narcissists can damage any self esteem. It all stems from being raised to believe it's all my fault, self criticism and self doubt. And to avoid any rejection. Relationships with any narcissist is volatile. So boundaries aren't stable, healthy, and established. Does anyone have advice on trying to establish unwavering boundaries? And how to not be a pushover? Any self affirmations to battle self doubt and low self esteem?"
155,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"Father and ""Best Friend"" are Narcissists -- analysis of Narcissism after 30 years of ""exposure""",2,c1gt1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/c1gt1y/father_and_best_friend_are_narcissists_analysis/,2019-06-17 10:03:48,"Hi all. I've been deeply impacted by narcissists and I'm formulating a written ""piece"" of some kind on the subject. Here is a super rough draft. # My name is ____ and I am here to save you (but in a totally non-grandiose, not-narcissistic kind of way) A proper thesis statement for this paper might go something like this: There is an epidemic of narcissists in our world, and more than ever, the abused are seeking help, healing, and answers. What follows is an attempt to shed light on this issue - and offer a healing repose for those who have been shattered in the narcissistic wake. I am here to wake you up from the trance - to illuminate the path to freedom and relief. But I promise, its not about me, its for the sweet, kind souls amongst us who have been deceived, abused, and betrayed in the way I have. For starters, a person with Narcissistic Personality Disorder does not simply refer to a person who is self-involved or puts themselves first. We all are self-involved to some extent. Its simple evolution. So dont go worrying if you are a narcissist. If you ended up on this article, chances are you arent. Narcissists are not ones for self-reflection, and frankly, trying to understand a disease of the spirit like narcissism is not something theyd likely do to occupy their time. They have places to be, people to manipulate, money to accumulate, and empaths to leech from. They are busy vampires people! Ill be honest with you, reader - I am not a trained psychologist. But Ive had the displeasure of being raised by a narcissist, being best friends with a Narcissist (notice the quotes) for nearly three decades, and having a former boss who was a Narcissist. Additionally, I have spent countless hours reading scholarly articles about Narcissism and listening to interviews about narcissism. But frankly, no amount of reading or listening can compare with the direct experience of being close to narcissists for all of my thirty years. Heres the rub - in more general terms - about what a true narcissist is: \~ The Narcissists true self dissolved long ago, or is in full dormancy. Instead, their sense of self is derived entirely from external sources. Adulation, control, money, and material drives are the blood that gives them life. In a sense, they are the anti-monk. Rather than deriving value and contentment through inner peace and harmony, the Narcissist will do anything - whatever the cost - to avoid their constructed persona from crumbling, or being exposed. This false self is not unlike a house of cards, or a carefully placed stack of Jenga pieces - one pebble thrown at it, and it crumbles. This crumbling may describe what some call narcissistic rage - a sort of uncovering of the small, weak, insecure person hiding within. \~ Its critical to realize that the Narcissist operates using a mask, or persona. Whereas a normal person is more or less his or herself at all times - with slight variations depending on context - the Narcissist is more like another species pretending to be human. They have studied the habits, formed an understanding of charm and charisma, and often employ these learned behaviors seamlessly into the current of everyday life. Not only do they not appear troubled or manipulative at first glance  they tend to be particularly magnetic, charismatic, and likable. But, like a chocolate cake, the first few bites taste great, but after a while it makes you feel sick. While normal people feel empathy for other beings and creatures (observe any toddler anywhere for proof) the Narcissist can better be described as having the ability to convey empathy. They are not truly empathetic; rather, they adopt empathetic behaviors when it is deemed convenient. But know this: a Narcissist isnt going to save the spider in the shower when no one is looking. And maybe you, reader, dont either - but we wont hold it against you. Because Narcissists prey on others for their needs (external validation  or Narcissistic Supply) they tend to be socially dominant and socially able, using their powers to engulf a wide net of people into their spider web of deception and false praise. Even the most perceptive of people often fall into this trap, as I did for thirty years. But whereas a true friend is genuinely happy for you when *good things* happen to you, a Narcissist can only convey false happiness. Inside, they are bitter. They want to be the star. They want to have the attention. They are the center of the galaxy, which is at the center of the cosmos. The rest of us are objects for validation and disposal - to be used and abused as the Narcissist sees fit - until hes bled you dry and has nothing left to gain. At which point, Discarding ensues  which is the friendship equivalent of squeezing all the juice from an orange, then throwing the remaining fragments away. And often, those who get discarded *are* fragmented, due to the confusion, turbulence, and general sense of unease that is created in the Narcissists intimates. The day I had my first nationally published article, most of my friends and family expressed great joy and achievement. When I saw my best friend in person, he didnt break a smile, and merely asked, Do they know you still live with your parents? Ah, and there it is. One surefire way to get discarded by a narcissist is to stand up to them. Generally, Narcissists are the kind of people who are liked and admired, yet being around them feels like walking on eggshells, like at any moment, if you utter the wrong phrase, or daresay *defend* yourself in a particular matter, the Narcissist will respond angrily and personally - as if their very being was called into question. And in a sense, when we finally grow the courage to take on their massive constructed ego, we are, in a sense, calling their very being into question. To do so takes either courage or desperation - because in addition to angering the one who we must not anger or offend we also risk alienation from the Narcissists Army - generally a subset of people that are wooed and charmed and adoring, and completely oblivious to the hidden, insidious nature of their Superior. Of course, this superiority is a facade - for deep within, the Narcissists true self is anxious, insecure, and in a state of perpetual arrested development. My best friend and I have been in a friendly fantasy baseball league for years. When our teams play each other, its always a close matchup in the spirit of friendly competition. The last time we matched up, I won. At the end of the matchup, he texted, welp, I guess I cant have it all The specific behaviors of Narcissists vary from person to person. Some may be overtly giving and kind, while some may be cynical and critical beyond measure. The styles vary widely - but one truth remains: the Narcissist uses a constructed persona throughout all of their life, and in all forms of human interaction. They are drawn to empathic people like a sponge to water, and while they may resent you or envy you deep down, they feed off the empath with relentless vigor. Because the particular behaviors vary and are hard to quantify, I find the following to be a decent Narcissism test, if you have an inkling that someone in your life is cursed with this affliction. 1. Has the person ever taken full responsibility for something they did wrong? If not, can you picture them doing so? This is a helpful litmus test because Narcissists will go to great lengths to avoid fault of any kind. They are the type of people who would drop a rock on your head and blame it on gravity. 2. Listen to your instincts. I like to refer to intuition as squinting with your gut. Does this person *genuinely* care about you? Is there genuine love? Furthermore, how do they make you feel? Can you talk to them about anything? Can you give them friendly criticism without them overreacting, taking it personally, and being immediately vengeful/hostile? Another litmus test is gauging your own sanity - do you feel a bit crazy around them? does it feel like something is, for lack of a better term, *off*? Do their words and promises not match their actions? Listen to your gut. Rarely, if ever, will it lead you astray. 3. Try being vulnerable. I believe that vulnerability is one of the most powerful things in the universe - and a rare commodity. And frankly, narcissists *loathe* vulnerability. They detest it. It makes them squirm like a worm in the presence of a sparrow. Try being vulnerable with them - spill your heart out. Better yet if its public. Closely gauge their reaction. Is it unconditional support? Or do they somehow try to detract from what you are saying, devalue your words, or ignore it altogether? The narcissist is, in essence, the opposite of authentic. They are an avatar on a screen - a fragile ice sculpture that melts at the slightest wave of warm authenticity. Because Narcissists tend to be such powerful, cunning social predators, they prefer to surround themselves with those they deem inferior - often, those who lack either the powers of perception, or the inner strength - to stand up to them or call them on their hypocrisy or bullshit. If you do so, you not only mark yourself as a threat to their power and control, but a threat to the very false mask which they wear every day. By standing up to Narcissists, we are, in a sense, saying I see you. The last thing the Narcissist wants is to truly be seen. In their world of deep anxiety and self-loathing, nothing could possibly be worse. If a strong-minded person - even for a moment - is able to lift the veil - that person must be extinguished from the burning logs that fuel the Narcissistic fire. ***Part 2 coming soon.***"

I was granted a final restraining order against her in court last year on June 20 for harassment and stalking. My life has greatly improved, but I feel overall like this time of year is stirring up a lot and I've been thinking about the years that I lived with her in adulthood. She's never been right; my parents divorced when I was 12. And for many years I only saw glimpses of her behavior, but when I turned 22, her behavior pivoted and I seemed to become her primary focus. I am now 26 (basically 27), and moved out when I was 25, so I was steeped deeply in the abuse for 3 full years of my young adulthood before escaping. At the time, I didn't know it was abuse. My mom's tendencies are/were covert and subtle. One example: she'd suggest something strongly without specifics, and then when I'd draw a conclusion based on her vagueness, she'd tell me it was *my* thought. Does anyone else feel like their N's abuse was so subtle that it almost didn't feel real? I feel like over time my 'self' was just disintegrated, but I couldn't trace back how it happened. I almost feel stupid trying to articulate it. We'd have these conversations that were long and drawn out, but they always felt like she was trying to find a weak spot of mine to exploit. Meanwhile, she'd have me in a place where I was willingly volunteering information because somehow I was conditioned to believe I was safer if she knew everything even though I knew that I paid for it every time I showed her vulnerability. Is anyone else familiar with this type of subtle narc-behavior? Like mind-ninja level stuff? Also, has anyone had experience with an enmeshed nParent? Rather than an outwardly hateful one? Almost like helicopter-parenting on steroids disguised as love for you? You all are great and I appreciate any input you have for me."

Id cry at movies and maybe at funerals and stuff, but never full out sobbing or uncontrollable bawling. Im not sure what the exact root of this was, but I eventually internalized it as part of my character and that I was always good at keeping it together. and that no one would ever see me totally lose composure like that because i am SO STRONG. Weird looking back that I was proud of this? That Id only had mini crying sessions and only a small handful of big ones? I even remember justifying them in my head, like oh well that was my first breakup, etc. It was a big part of my identity all the way into early adulthood. Now that I have this new therapist, I started thinking back to times when I was sad around my nparents and I realized that I dont have any memories of being comforted or soothed when I cried. They were very matter of fact and detached. It was about solving the problem or giving me privacy or whatever. If I had to speculate, this early-on lack of comfort taught me that it wasnt safe to cry in front of my parents. And if it wasnt safe to cry in front of them, then I probably shouldnt waste anyone elses time crying in front of them, either. If I was sad in elementary school and someone asked me what was wrong I would lie (badly) and say it was allergies. I didnt believe I would be listened to or comforted. I thought (and probably still do) that my vulnerability would be used against me somehow. I remember finding out some sad news unexpectedly when I was with my SO several years ago. He just gave me a hug and held me. It was so nice. I didnt know how to react, Hes so (and still is) healthy and normal about that kind of stuff. When we lived apart and I was crying in my old childhood bedroom after I had to say goodbye to him, my ndad was like did you have a fight? like there wasnt any reason for me to just be upset if there wasnt a direct and linear problem. I guess the problem Im having is I can cry a little bit but I always stop myself. Its like I dont have a choice and I cant bring myself to cross that threshold. Does that make sense? I can hear a voice saying that its really not appropriate and that I should get it together. That Im not going to get what I need from this and so its not worth it. Now that I know thats a wrongheaded way of thinking, how do I let go? I cant just like listen to Adele or some shit. Also I have a LOT of anger, like a lot a lot. So its like this fun little crme brle of hard shards of brittle anger sugar on top with mushy custard grief underneath. if id just been born in the UK it would be perfectly acceptable to be this repressed all the time! even patriotic! Oh and I use humor to deflect, its very original of me. /s My therapist wants me to write a letter to my ndad and then rip it up or burn it. I know intellectually its a really smart idea and this new therapist is gonna help me a lot, but I am scared and I dont know whats waiting for me on that page. Has anyone else done this? Am i the only one who feels like its a little late to be having these big emotions, and that no one has the time for me anymore? Why does being vulnerable make me feel like such a sucker? anyway this has gotten long enough."

This post is going to be fairly multifaceted, due to the different variables and layers of it all and the weight of it that I am dealing with. &amp;#x200B; As a background, going to be vague with genders/ages/relationships in this post for privacy as one of the people involved uses reddit and I do not want them to find my post. So I will differentiate between Narc Parent, Narc Housemate 1, Narc Housemate 2, Normal Parent. &amp;#x200B; Narc Parent and Normal Parent had me two decades ago and got divorced quickly due to domestic violence and child abuse. I went to live with Normal Parent while Narc Parent was in and out of my life, also on and off crazy but not as crazy as when they were together. Eventually Normal Parent ran into troubled financial times when I was in middle school, I went to live with Narc Parent since they are well off. However, Narc Housemate 1 and Narc Housemate 2 intended to move in, so Narc Parent more or less disowned me and I had to move back out with Normal Parent. All throughout middle and high school, I was treated like shit by Narc Parent the few times they were around, all of which were traumatic experiences. Narc Housemate 1, who also stirred a lot of shit since moving in, has done many sketchy things, like fake calls to children services, adult services, fake police calls, all to harass my family and I. I was also treated like shit by everyone at school as we all know, people can smell blood a mile away off a child of a narcissist, they can sense the vulnerability and the broken shell of a person. &amp;#x200B; Here is the catch. Eventually, I mustered up enough self-awareness, curiosity for knowledge, sense and pursuit of justice, and establishing a value system for myself when the world changes every day and night in the narcissists home. I decided to confront Narc Parent head on at the end of high school and decided to move back in, much to Narc Housemates' dismay. &amp;#x200B; From then, it has been an insane couple of years. After working my ass off to get into a good school, I am now graduating at the end of the summer with my bachelor's degree. I am even interviewing for numerous entry-level 9 to 5 positions, with good salaries and benefits, and roles I would love to be in. All the bullshit the narcissists caused me to go through all turned out to make me stronger and more resilient in the end. I went through harassment at a previous job, I went through and won two lawsuits, I battled grief and depression and anxiety and managed to warrior through it, never giving up, even when I was homeless at one point, got injured and broke a limb, got in debt, had to withdraw from school, now I have put all that behind me at 23 and there is a light at the end of the tunnel. &amp;#x200B; The problem? I am severely in debt. I used to have a $20,000 savings fund I had stashed away, hidden, in case they ever kicked me out or disowned me again or if Narc Housemates got Narc Parent involved in any actual criminal shit, or anything compromising anyone's health, life or livelihood. I would be able to pack up in the night and run away, safely, and secured until I sort out a contingency plan for my life and future. However, 5 years in university and all that life threw at me, in addition to Narc Parent's and Narc Housemates' continued abuse in and away from the home, and untreated benign (at best) to crippling (at worst) mental illnesses, and a long bout of unemployment for 3 out of the 5 years of undergrad, and lack of meaningful support from Narc Parent, my savings got wiped out, my GPA took a hit, school scholarships office did some weird shit and I am now graduating with $40,000 of student loan debt. Narc Parent does not know, neither do Narc Housemates. If they any of them found out how deep in the red I was, I actually think they might hurt me in some way, or things would get very bad for me very quickly. &amp;#x200B; The silver lining is that, they don't know yet, but I also do not have a car and will most likely rely on Narc Parent to pay for that expense as they are insisting, which is usual when it comes to their need for control. I am not trying to be ungrateful, as I have stayed out of trouble, I have kept up on my health, and all the expenses I have had over the past 3 years have been education, medical, recreational and personal expenses that have kept me afloat and alive through the most darkest periods of my life thus far. I wish I did not have to justify myself but I have gotten so much hate from other family members and people I have sought support from and it makes me feel like I am choking and drowning. I know what I am capable of. I have done and pulled through so much in life's most pressing circumstances, all while keeping my dignity, keeping my values, sticking to my word, and never giving up hope in the face of adversity. That is why instead of being out on the streets as this family would want me to be, I am crafting a new world and reality for myself and finding a way to integrate myself into this world rather than let it crush me. &amp;#x200B; So the question is, to what extent should I give up my autonomy for the sake of financial security? So far, I have weathered and resisted all that has been thrown at me in the home of the narcissist and outside in the real world. Moving back in means, aside from my debt, I have a fresh slate. I will have a degree. I am competitive for salaried jobs. I have not even asked Narc Parent for a bailout. I want to be able to live in this house, in peace, without jealousy and resentment from Narc Housemates, who have ulterior motives in their proximity and desire of acquiring Narc Parent's wealth. I want to be able to live in this house, drive a car, go to work and be a workaholic as I am, finish up, have the rest of my day to use as I wish, whether it is to go to the gym, cook, spend time doing something fun, socializing, working more, or what have you, and come back home and sleep in peace. Rinse and repeat. Would it not be completely feasible to then, be a well adjusted person, in addition to paying off my debts in a reasonable, honorable and punctual manner? &amp;#x200B; Before I became unemployed and before my savings got wiped out, before life got very crazy, I had about a 800 credit score. I was VERY smart about my finances. Almost OCD level conservative. I never enjoyed myself. My credit score, due to my current debt, is 650. It is ONLY because of my high balances. I have never missed a payment, have no inquiries, no derogatory marks, no collections, nothing. &amp;#x200B; Basically: if it were not for my high balances and my resulting low credit score, I would have a blank slate at life at the moment with no other expenses or obligations or responsibilities. Or even dreams or goals to pursue that I have not already as I got to fulfill my dream of going away for university, of traveling and working in exciting cities, and finding warmth in the hearts of many I met along the way, that I never would have been able to if I had at any point given in to the self-doubt and hate that the narcissists filled me with. I can do WHATEVER it is I want to do, take whatever risk I want, anything. The thing is, I am making choices exactly as best as I could and as autonomously I could. I am willfully choosing to live at home and find a job in the area. I am willfully forgoing some goals and dreams to achieve other goals and dreams, and that's ok. I am not bitter or think my negative past forced my hand in this stage. It is partially true, but not all the way. I am healthy, I am able bodied, I am intelligent, and I can persevere even through something like this. &amp;#x200B; So what I fear is: I fear being disowned. I fear being kicked out. I fear Narc Parent having a mental breakdown if they find out about my debt or Narc Housemates using it against me and holding it over my head as proof that I am worthless or irresponsible. Narc Housemates are dangerous people."

Heres how Ive learned to get through the day: 1. Stay away from social media. Seeing others celebrate the love and care they received from their moms brews so much resentment, I want to explode. The posts stick around for a couple days after so I just cant even... 2. Treat yourself. Heres the time to get a massage, eat your favorite foods, visit your favorite places... 3. Wish the moms you admire a happy Mothers Day. At least they are not traumatizing their children, so its nice to reinforce. Practicing gratitude for them also tends to make me feel a little better. 4. Caution your loved ones that this will be a tough day for you, and let them know what you need. Maybe thats to leave you alone. It took a lot for me to share my vulnerability about how awful this day can feel but its led to some very touching efforts from them. Ive gotten sweet messages of support today. They also take special care to not rub in my face how they are celebrating which has saved me some grief. 4. Check out this [special card for people with imperfect mothers](URL It reminds me how much Ive mothered myself. So, in some ways, this is my day too. 5. Dont feel obligated to go to your in-laws celebrations. Practice healthy boundaries. Its painful enough to know what Ive missed without needing to participate in celebrating how much more loving my significant others upbringing has been. Although its been tough to draw the firm line, eventually theyve learned to assume Im not joining them without my needing to reiterate that as much as I appreciate my in-laws, I need to prioritize my well-being today. 6. Journal out what you feel. Maybe thats a fuck you letter for everything youve endured. Maybe its a wish list for what you couldve had. Maybe its a plan for what kind of mother you want to be. 7. Know that you are not alone. I am so grateful for this subreddit because it has been the only place Ive found that acknowledges that moms dont always deserve to be appreciated. 8. Cry if you want to. Stomp it out if you need to. Scream to the mirror. Theres no way youll get through this day without accepting that painful memories and feelings are going to come up, and thats okay. 9.

160,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Thoughts from experience,2,boz1a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/boz1a1/thoughts_from_experience/,2019-05-16 01:04:29,"Much of this will not apply to everyone. This is just my thoughts that I've garnered from my experiences. If you relate to any of this, great. If you don't, that's okay, too. Maybe your parents realize their bad tendencies, too, but push away vulnerability so they don't feel like they have to apologize or change for being shitty. Maybe they are easily irritated or confused and feel misunderstood by you as well and they deal with that by being shitty. Are you shitty back? Shittiness can often fuel other shittiness. When I was a young teenager, I would make little shitty comments and my mom would lay it back on way harder. I would get called names, ridiculed for crying, guilt tripped, gaslighted. 30 minute rants about what I did wrong, its 1,000 cascading effects, and why I was horrible. She would leave and come back 20 minutes later with another comment she thought of. And so on. I could never say anything right, so I learned to go silent, instead. That wasn't okay either. She'd get over it just as fast as the storm came, while I was still reeling. I didn't want her to be angry again, so I kept my feelings to myself, and at least consciously moved on from it. Ultimately, I've self-sabotaged myself a lot in my youth in quite major ways, and my relationship with my parents (mom) has only recently gotten better because of it. Maybe other people might find instead that their self-sabotage only adds fuel to their parents shittiness towards them. This was often the case with me as well. My mom has been through a lot of shit and successfully managed a lot of responsibility, too, which I believe led up to all this shittiness and it's a defense mechanism for not understanding or gaining control. Not an altogether abnormal reaction. Many people don't practice self-awareness or reflect on the impact of their behaviors. Some just plain don't care. There's nothing I have to say to or about those people. This post is not about people that just truly and genuinely don't give a shit underneath it all. Despite how shitty my mom has been, I know she's not a narcissist even though I ended up on this subreddit. This post is about giving pause to reflect on your situation. Some people either have little or no empathy, or lash out while keeping their emotions under lock and key, maybe even from themselves as well. On the other hand, some parents, caretakers, whoever, are really just shitty, horrible people. I'm sorry for all the shittiness you've experienced. I still believe that it is no excuse to be shitty yourself. I don't believe in excuses. I do believe in explanations, because they come with a proclamation of understanding your error, accepting responsibility, and working to be above it. No matter how many times you fail, as long as you keep trying, eventually you will get consistently better. If someday you'd like you relationship with your parents to be less shitty, unfortunately, you will likely carry the burden of being the less shitty and more respectful one. That can even mean respectfully telling them you do not want to be in contact with them or giving them respectful ultimatums with explanations for why you feel it is necessary at this point (if you haven't done so already). They will likely be shitty about it. Don't be a victim of abuse for too long. It's okay to feel sorry for yourself for a lil while. It is healing. But in the end, you need to gain strength and character in order to fully heal. There are many different paths that can get you there with the right mindset."
161,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,A Partially Consolidated History of my Abuse (need to vent),2,btd3j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/btd3j3/a_partially_consolidated_history_of_my_abuse_need/,2019-05-27 06:53:54,"Hi guys, I came across this subreddit a while ago and it has been extremely helpful in me slowly, and painfully discovering how my childhood trauma has affected me. I've been reading this book, **The Body Keeps The Score**, which if you are not familiar with, I urge you to read. It's a fantastic book about how Trauma affects us in mental, physical, etc ways. I wanted to take this space to address all the ways I feel I've been inflicted trauma upon, because I understand it is my minds way of suppressing memories that are uncomfortable and I need to jot them down so I can address them with my therapist. I'm breaking this down into two sections: **Abuse** and **Neglect** **Abuse:** My parents have always informed me they loved me as a kid, they told me my our entire family did, and to some extent still do. However around middle school things changed drastically. I was beaten a lot if I didn't perform academically well in school. In high school, once I gained weight, my mother told me ""***I'll never love you until you lose weight.""*** She told me nobody would love me because I was fat, ugly, and stupid. My parents would bring up my weight, talk about how ugly I am, for hours every day, in addition to how ashamed I make them feel. They would at times point out specific parts of my body they didn't like and lecture me for not working on them. That affected my confidence a lot, and in high school I was bullied a lot, but I didn't have a safe place at home to express myself. As is typical, music, television, books, all became a part of myself that would allow me to subdue the pain I felt on a daily basis. My mother once beat me so hard, my entire right side of my face was red, like sitting on top of me and slapping me, pinching me, biting me, etc. My mother would also yell at me for hours in high school. Probably why yelling, screaming, etc are such trigger warnings for me. They dig deep like a dagger into a wound just starting to heal. To this day (23, working an internship at a large tech firm), I get beaten when I act erratically to what is (to my understanding) a trigger. **Neglect:** The neglect is more subtle for sure but I haven't been able to talk to them at all about anything. If I bring up my trauma, or my insecurities in confidence, they'll use it against me later in a combative manner. They usually yell at me if I confide in them. There is no way in which I can ever be open with them. When they ignore me, or are busy with other work and don't talk to me, those are my **golden moments** but even then there is no peace because I'm dealing with my mind on fire. I'm seeking therapy because to be completely honest with you, I do not know how much longer I can continue. It doesn't help that my father works at the same place I do and keeps tabs on me, which are followed by consistent lectures on how he perceives my performance to be. **I'm at the point right now where I'm rejecting any and all romantic endeavors because I can not subject myself to anymore possible abuse.** I constantly crave emotional attention, but also deny it out of fear of getting hurt, or worse, hurting someone oblivious to my trauma. Another thing I've noticed is how I struggle to have a conversation with my parents, I can't express myself regarding anything. Their measurement of my success and how well I fit into their idealistic perception of what a son should be is what is consistently hurting me. It comes off in abusive comments or physical harm. I have always felt that no matter how much I tried to open up to my parents throughout my life, they have always kept me at an arms distance, just an inch away. Their reasoning for this is because I do not live up to their expectations. My emotions, my vulnerability, is always shut down and somehow my inferiority and failures are increased. **As they have said to me, if I become their idealized version of a son, they'll love me openly. All I've known is conditional love, can I learn another way?** &amp;#x200B; Thank you for letting me express myself here. I've been meaning to do this, it has just been something I've been putting off because digging through the memories isn't exactly a walk in the garden. For those of you who suffered from childhood trauma (or are still suffering), what enabled your survival and what advice would you give me?"
162,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My story,8,buig7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/buig7j/my_story/,2019-05-30 04:41:09,"Im 26 now. Currently I live with my partner (26f) in her family home with her parents and grandma. They are all inter generational abusive narcissists. We used to live close to nc across the state, until we were illegally terminated for being queer, robbed, evicted, and assaulted where we lost almost everything. It was either here or the streets. And to be honest, it was a really tough decision which should say a lot about her parents. At the same time, I called my mom who divorced my dad when I was 16. I asked if I could borrow like 1-200$ to help since we were robbed. At the time, she was like oh lol I am borrowing 1k from my mom, so sorry good luck. She has a gambling addiction and has taken out the max possible for my student loans so that she could manage the money, but she just spent it all on gambling. Now Im around 80k in debt to the government. So I wrote her a long ass email after speaking to an addiction counselor. I told her she could contact me when she was in treatment for her addiction, and until then I just couldnt have that in my life. It was so hard. She still hasnt responded, though she did of course have to mention she was paying 100$ month for my health insurance until I was 26. You know how parents are supposed to  I didnt realize I was abused until I read a thread on tumblr about how abused kids are very good at moving through the house with no sounds like literal ninjas, as to not incur their parents wrath. I still walk weird TO THIS DAY as a result. Im nc with my dad and havent spoke to him in earnest since I was 14. Hes the worst person I ever heard of. No exaggeration. He is a retired high ranking cop. I want to share with you all a memory that really hurts for me. I grew up food insecure, which means no one cooked for me, prepared me food, or bought me food growing up past the age of 11/12. I was expected to just starve or fend for yourself. When I was about 14, I asked my dad for food or if he could help. He said no of course. So then I got the phone and started to call my mom to see if she could potentially pick something up on the way home. My dad who is over 6ft and a literal bodybuilder then decided to take the phone from me by force. I tried to fight him off to no avail, I was an anorexic 14 yr old against an overgrown man of course. He got on top of me and was punching me and apprehending me. He eventually got off and told me to clean up the mess he had just made. I started walking towards it and then just booked it for the door. I ran for my fucking life, and ended up climbing a fence and hiding behind a neighbors trash cans. Of course it started raining. I was so scared and cold, yet so strong and determined. I was crying yet I felt dignified. I look back at this as my strongest moment. I walked around for a few days, stole food, slept on the side of the highway, and even tried to get a job lmfao. Eventually I had to call my mom from a local McDonalds to pick me up. She blamed me and the first thing she asked is why I would do that to my dad. I felt my whole world sink. I just felt so powerless and that there was nothing I could do. I was extremely suicidal from age 9-16. I tried telling them once, and my mom multiple times. They just said why would you say that. I was never allowed to see my friends or leave my house. I was grounded for almost all of my youth. People wouldnt bother inviting me anywhere bc they knew I couldnt go. I was so so isolated and alone. I just kept trying to kill myself and wouldnt be able to and then just hide how injured Id gotten so they wouldnt lock me up. They regularly threatend to send me away to military school, as if I was this misbehaved bad kid. Nah, I was just starving and sad and unloved. Well, I tried rekindling with me dad over the past 5 years. Hes still the same person. I sent him the hospital bill I had from being assaulted out of desperation since he has heaps of money and Im literally impoverished. He just had my sister send it back to me. Yet he has the audacity to be entitled to me and that I have to give him attention, affection, and myself for literally nothing in return. I am officially nc again for the foreseeable future since it is unfair to myself to expect him to be a different person. I moved to San Francisco when I was 18. I got on the honor roll in college every semester, graduated with honors, and became a mental health worker for youth who experience similar things to us on this forum. If I had one single caring adult in my life to just treat me like I was worth ANYTHING, my life wouldve been so much easier and who knows whered Id be. I accept the way my life is now, but I make it literally my JOB to make sure these kids (poor poc) have mentors and learn how to use peers as support. I am in a long term, loving, HEALTHY partnership and we are both np survivors. We are powerful together in our vulnerability and toughness. If you are going thru it with nps, I just pray to God that you know you are loved, are so worthy of all of the good things, and more than capable of taking small baby steps to make yourself happier and independent. Surviving these people makes you stronger than anyone else. Yes, we get a lot of baggage. But what Ive noticed is that most of us here are empathetic enough and willing to do the work and self reflection in therapy so that we end this inter generational trauma once and for all. Please, please never give up on yourself, especially when its hard. You can make a life for yourself that is fun to live, an. You can build your own self worth to the point that people are inspired by your confidence, toughness, and high levels of compassion because we are all honestly the biggest threats to ourselves. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing your stories and feelings. Thank you for taking the time to read mine. I feel so much less alone and this has been bothering me a lot and word vomiting this has been amazing."

But I wanted to get this out, because this decision didnt come lightly. Please excuse the long post, theres just a lot I want to say - my advice request is at the bottom. &amp;#x200B; So here's the situation: My mom is a covert nparent. Some or most of you may already know, but this is a particularly sinister brand of narcissist, because on the outside she acts as a loving, caring, oscar-winning perfect mother. Under the radar, however? She likes to take knives and re-open old stab wounds festering on my back. Hiding behind the guise of everything she isnt, shes made it abundantly clear that my life can never be about *me*, it has to be about *her.* &amp;#x200B; I.e. : \- I lost a lot of weight recently, and have been making continuous strides to get healthy. Her response? *Shes* going to feel so self-conscious around me! \- I had a short period of time where I was seriously feeling depressed after I transferred colleges, and I was almost going to drop out. Her response? I was just feeling like that because I didnt have *her* more involved in my life! \- I went through a nasty custody battle in my senior year of high school, where my father - who Im lucky to have because hes an incredible person - saved me from living under her roof. Im sure you can already guess, but she blames my sibling and I for that, and sometimes when it suits her she solely blames me. To this day, her response if its brought up: S*he* didnt do anything to deserve it, that whole thing was just a shitty way to spite *her*! &amp;#x200B; Hopefully you get the point, I dont really want to go into more details. &amp;#x200B; Ive been dealing with the same bullshit for years, even at LC. And when I *do* spend time with her, she doesnt care to actually hold a normal conversation with me. My older brother describes it as she treats her kids like snowglobes - likes to show us off, but doesnt want to interact. Everything always has to be about how *we* make *her* look, (which better be good,) whats going on in *her* life, and how *she* feels above all else. Its never about how she lies, manipulates, guilts, and guerilla-style attacks us in front of others. Shes done despicable things just to get her way. And Ive finally come to accept the cold, hard truths of this. &amp;#x200B; I dont know what it feels like to have a genuinely caring mother. I have a reflexive distaste for mothers and motherhood because I was raised to believe that its a selfish relationship, where you exist for her sake and have to *earn* love by doing things that are praise worthy - and if you dont, you wont have earned the right for any attention, affection, or care when you need it. So Im left with an admittedly prejudiced resent. And because she failed at teaching me something so critical, I have a lot of damage to repair, including issues with anxiety, self-confidence, and trauma - not to mention a severe lack of trust, and a habitual fear of showing any emotional vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; After so many years of this, I've finally had enough. I'm going to face my issues, even though they're very painful, to start truly healing from them. And in order to do so, I have to first face the fact that I dont want this woman in my life. So Ive made the decision to go NC. Yay! &amp;#x200B; ...Easier said than done! &amp;#x200B; What terrifies me is that shes unpredictable, and in order to protect myself, Im waiting until Ive built up a double life to do this - that is, Im waiting until Ive moved from where I currently live, changed my number and email, deleted my social media - the works. I dont know if she has the resources to hunt me down, but if she does, Im not going to make it easy on her. This, unfortunately, is actually the easy part. The hard part is that I have an internal battle I ~~am going to~~ AM facing. Biologically, I crave her. I want her in my life *because* shes my mother, and the child in me simply does not want to believe that my mother does not actually love me, much less that she doesn't see me as a person. In fact, the child in me doesnt even want to believe shes done anything *bad enough* to warrant this kind of decision. But abuse is abuse, no matter if its extreme enough. Rationally, I accept that for my own sanity that I need her out of my life, because shes too toxic for me to handle. Im already anticipating the opinions people are going to have, and the scorn I may receive. And Im anticipating Im going to doubt myself a lot too. But you know what? *Bring it on*. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I am more than my pain. I am more than my past. I deserve happiness because Im working damn hard to earn it. And the only person who can dictate my life, as well as who is in or out of it, is *me*. I dont exist for her, I exist for *me*. And no amount of love-bombing, hurtful jabs or sickening lies she uses can ever change that. So, I'm going NC. &amp;#x200B; I just don't know how I'm going to tell her yet. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; So, if anyone has any advice for going NC with an Nparent, such as how they did it or phrased it, or even how they felt in the aftermath, I would very much appreciate it!"

In January my narc father strong armed me into going on vacation with him to visit his sister (my aunt) in Aspen, CO. Mind you the last time I agreed to go on vacation with my dad it was a camping trip last summer with my brother and my brother's girlfriend. We shlepped upstate to the campsite. My dad was 2 hours late and then 20 minutes after arriving said he had to leave because of car trouble. I had dinner with my dad in December and every time I see him he takes it as an opportunity to get me to commit to seeing him again which is something that I've learned NOT EVER TO DO with him because in the past he'd get me to say ""maybe"" or ""yes"" to things that conflict with my schedule. Then when I cancel, he'll freak out and try to convince me that the reason he's so angry is simply because I ""broke a commitment."" So anyway, everytime I see him, he's like when do you want to have dinner next? When do you want to go skiing? When do you want to go paintballing? When do you want to go camping? When do you want to fence? The man is in his early seventies (another reason why I empathize with him) but he can't sit still. Dinner every now and then is not enough. So finally I'm like yeah, okay, let's go to Colorado and visit Aunt Lily in the first week of March. He books two plane tickets using his points (mind you what could be a 6-hour trip for just like $150 more is going to be a 12+ hour trip because he booked the cheapest flights possible with a layover in Chicago then to Denver and when we arrive at midnight we're going to rent a car and drive four hours to Aspen). So I'm ANXIOUS as hell. I start working with my therapist every session on emotionally preparing for this trip and while preparing for it I also realize MY AUNT IS A NARCISSIST TOO but whatever I said I'd do it so I'm going to do it. I call my aunt to check in with her and make sure she knows where coming. Sometime after booking the flights my dad asks if I want to get dinner. \[when my parents were getting divorced, he moved to florida because ""there was nothing for him in New York anymore"" when in reality he just moved to Florida because of their property laws/to protect his assets\]. Since then he comes to NY for work and lives with his girlfriend so he's always around. He's also a self-employed ""entrepreneur"" who used all of my college savings to invest in one of his business ventures. Point being: he has a ton of free time on his hands. So he calls to asks if I want to get dinner. I tell him CLEARLY, we're going to spend a whole week together in March I'm not going to see you before then. Then a week later he texts me: Dinner? I say no. \[my dad LOVES forcing me to reject him\] A few weeks later he texts again: Dinner? I say no. My birthday rolls around in February and every year he insists that he's entitled to see my on my birthday since after all he's my father and he gave me life. I always say no. And historically this has sparked many spells of him ignoring me as punishment (like I care. It's a fucking gift when he leaves me alone). This year, a few days before my birthday he texts me: Dinner? I say: Can't. He says: Name the day and time. And I just ice that text because again, I'LL SEE YOU IN A MARCH AND YOU WILL HAVE MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION FOR A FULL WEEK. He doesn't call me on my birthday. But my aunt does and I say see you in March! Great. About a week before the trip my brother texts me to ask if I want to go skiing upstate with Dad next monday. My brother has CP from birth trauma, thus he doesn't understand the relationship between past and present, cause and effect, patterns of toxic behavior, etc. it's quite nuanced. but anyway I'm like: AREN'T DAD AND I SUPPOSED TO FLY TO DENVER MONDAY MORNING? he's like I don't know. So i text my dad: is the trip still on? No answer. I text him again a couple days later, no answer. I call him, no answer. But these flights are booked so I figure we're going. I think okay maybe he's just testing me. He's going to fly to Colorado without me and blame me or something. Preparing for this, I get off from work, I don't go to Vermont the Sat-Sun before with my friends because it'd just be too much to shlepping. Then sunday night I'm still trying to get in contact with my dad. Still nothing. I call my aunt. I text her. Nothing... FINALLY I get a call from my aunt. She's all like ""When was the last time you spoke to your father?"" And I'm like I don't know a couple months ago. And she's like, ""Your father didn't feel comfortable doing this trip considering the state of your relationship."" At this point I LOSE MY SHIT. Like major flashback to all the times he did this throughout my childhood. Punished me and turned people against me for setting boundaries. My aunt, \[who by the way my dad DIDNT SPEAK TO FOR THREE YEARS FOR REASONS THAT CHANGED ALL THE TIME\] is all like: ""when was the last time u saw ur father?"" And im like december. And she's like ""you really think that's enough?"" And I, in disbelief at this woman who literally only appears in my life once every few years to tell me about how her mother was a narcissist and my dad was the golden child and how she went to therapy for a few months and is all enlightened now, I'm like: THE MAN IS TOXIC! Who are you to tell me how long is enough. She's like tell him, not me. yada yada don't shoot the messenger kind of bullshit. So she thinks she's this neutral party. OH and then she's like listen forget about the skiing I want you to come visit my in Arizona for my birthday you haven't seen ur cousins in a while. and I'm like in Arizona? and she, thinking I said in Aspen, yells at me ""Forget about the skiing!"" I'M ENRAGED at this point. I hang up with her and call my mom who thankfully is FULLY aware of my father's narcissism. I text my dad this one line: ""You have no respect for my time, and deserve none of it."" Then I block him. A week later (after my aunt has the nerve to forward me a newsletter from her own company celebrating her on Int'l Women's Day, this woman voted for Trump and probably will again, just saying, and after she sends me an email asking when do I want to fly down for her birthday) I'm like Aunt Lily, I cannot come to your birthday. If you want, I'll add our email exchange to this because it's fucking insane and only further proves to me she is as big of a narc as my father. She also ends with her classic refrain, ""I'll always love you, after all, you're my one and only niece."" Like give me a break. She doesn't give a shit about my brother, her only nephew. Recently my dad tried to enlist the help of my brother in getting me to talk to him. My brother called me on the phone to discuss it and I gave my brother as simple an explanation as I could re: why I am no longer speaking to our dad. it turns out my dad was listening on speaker the whole time. I haven't unblocked him or heard from my dad since then and every now and then I feel a little guilty in a nostalgic sort of way. but mostly I feel relaxed knowing that I don't have to reject his phone calls or ice his texts or worry about whether he's mad at me. I feel like I finally had the proof that I needed to validate my feelings. An indisputable way for me to see that this person has no respect for my time and thus deserves none of it. If he weren't my father, he would've had far fewer chances. I feel like I've leveled up like 200 stories and now understand so much of my reluctance to see my aunt and dad as a kid, too. My child self couldn't articulate it, but I knew that if I was around them I'd have to perform vulnerability for them so that they could feel close to me. It was like that my whole life and i don't miss it at all. I know I'm going to have to see them again eventually. It may simply be at a funeral. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Thanks for reading and and for sharing your stories. My friend told me about r/raisedbynarcissists and it's just so nice to read other people's stories about realizing they're not crazy!! &amp;#x200B; TLDR: Dad and aunt are both narcs. No longer talking to either."
166,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"You have to demonstrate some level of vulnerability in order to listen to another person. You have to relinquish or share some power.

Yes, you allow yourself to be vulnerable to them but, they relish the idea that they've dominated you. What you want is to listen to what they are saying about other people; especially the insults. This is the thing they are trying to shield others from seeing in themselves. If the narc is discussing the ""Fat, bad bodied, broke hussey"" in church ( a series of words my mom used often in my life), this person is experiencing shame about their own body. Why is this important information? Because, you can learn their triggers. If said narc is experiencing body shame, you can get revenge by being obvious and successful with your own health journey (of course, prepare for the inevitable vengeance) OR you know what to hide from them and slowly slide of the radar. A narc isn't interested in a person who doesn't have what they feel they deserve."

I remember pleading with him to stop only raising my voice due to the fact he told me he couldn't hear me then turn on me about being the one being too loud. &amp;#x200B; I was demonized about how when I get excited i get very loud. I was very ashamed of that trait of mine then one of my guy i am interested in said he loved that about me even when another friend said i was getting too loud with a disapproving face- at least it wasn't possessed by disgust or disdain, but i still see that in his face and it hasn't left. I hate I cannot let it go. &amp;#x200B; Never the less, I never expected that someone would love that about me. I fell apart that way. I felt that no matter what happened in the past the fact that one guy told me he loved that about me lead me to have the most genuine smile; one that showcased vulnerability. He looked incredible scared when he said it thou when he saw my reaction he was shocked yet awestruck at the same time. He totally didn't expect my reaction to be that way and it was incredible sweet. I saw a lot of innocence that day and it was dashing, I dare say. I think this is one of the most meaningful if not the most meaningful thing a person has done for me with only words. &amp;#x200B; ""Mere words"". &amp;#x200B; Oh do I hate how both my parents told me to get over myself over mere words. How they had so much worse... we have always heard it before.... &amp;#x200B; OH do I wish i met someone like him sooner. The few emotional moments I had between my dad's constant episodes showed me that my father would have been the father i wished for if he didn't have his abuse; what would my mother be without depression or the abuse she went through. Instead i pushed the responsibility of them on myself that what happened to me wasn't as bad, so I continued to help them even when they weren't helping themselves; give them everything with nothing in return. I thought this is what i should expect in the word, but when I gave who I am and more importantly, my trust in the one who told me he loved that about me... showed me that I was wrong. &amp;#x200B; Never have I felt so happy for someone proving me wrong. &amp;#x200B; Thank you Joe."

TBH I doubt it'll happen, it's always brought up but it never happens. If it does happen I do worry that this will only be counterproductive. I don't doubt that therapy is a excellent tool. I just doubt that showing vulnerability to my nmum will do any good. Every time I've opened up about how I feel it's always been disregarded and it makes me feel really pathetic opening up in the first place. (BTW every time i've shared my feelings with my family it's because they've wanted me to). Another reason is that she gets really pissed off when I cry when she's upset. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, I'd love to hear everyone else's experiences. Negative/positive I don't mind."
169,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Archived email helping me identify patterns of abuse from 12 years ago,4,bhrjiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/bhrjiy/archived_email_helping_me_identify_patterns_of/,2019-04-27 07:14:10,"Hello fellow RBNs, Long-time lurker and occasional commenter here, but this is my first real post delving into my personal experience of having been raised by narcissists (NM &amp; ED), a concept Im still very much coming to terms with (TL;DR at the bottom as this will probably be longer than planned). I think like many ACoNs who find themselves waking up to the abuse they endured at the hands of their own parents and caregivers, one of the hardest parts of the process is undoing the years of manipulation, gaslighting, projection and blame that made us not only accept our dysfunctional and abusive home environments, but rendered us incapable of even *recognising it* as being abusive. As such, the effect such abuse has on ones sense of self is utterly catastrophic. Narcissistic abusers violate and rob you of your ability to trust your own instincts, gaslighting you in order to destabilise and control you by making you doubt your own memory and reality. Im learning for myself that simply *knowing* this fact, understanding at least on an intellectual level how narcissists work, simply isnt enough to repair the damage and prevent me from falling, time and time again, into the same distorted and self-defeating patterns of thinking. No matter how much knowledge and awareness of their tactics I have built into my armour, they still seem to creep out of the cracks and attack me from within. The damage they do to our self-worth is what gives them their man on the inside, and even if I know rationally that its *not* all in my head, Im still haunted by that voice that tells me it wasnt abuse, its all my fault, my memories are false, my parents were right about me, and I should be ashamed of myself. I dont know if this is a common experience, but I often struggle with being able to pinpoint concrete examples of abuse the further back I look. This is a tricky one because it could be due to me blocking out painful memories, or that the behaviour was so normalised at the time I havent yet recognised it as abusive. Worse still (and probably the reason for this post), is the dreaded fear that the reason I cant recall many examples of abuse is because there actually werent any, and Im simply making this all up. Ive been having several recent epiphanies over certain episodes that with hindsight clearly werent normal (or at least healthy), but when I have difficulty identifying much outside of the past couple of years thats when the doubt starts to creep in. Interestingly, while searching through old emails the other day I came across something that gave me a tiny bit of validation for my experience, and I thought Id share. **SKIP TO HERE FOR THE MAIN BIT** Ive just started seeing a therapist a fortnight ago, to help me work through my issues stemming largely from my upbringing - which is nowhere near as bad as many have experienced here and elsewhere, but involves significant emotional abuse and manipulation. Its the first time Ive spoken to a therapist about this, however the decision to seek some professional support jogged my memory about an incident back in 2007 where, following a huge argument with my NM, I sent an email enquiry to a local therapist for help. From what I can remember, the decision to approach a therapist was planted by my NM whilst in the midst of one of her vicious outbursts, usually characterised by intense rage and what Id best describe as an all-out character assassination. You know, the type where they tie you up in knots with circular arguments, contradictory statements and attack your deepest insecurities to then exploit your vulnerability so you submit to their ridiculous demands, whether out of fear, confusion or quite simply exhaustion. I dont remember much, but it did involve her accusing me of needing professional help for being cruel, heartless and incapable of loving your own mother, after ALL IVE DONE FOR YOU yep. I probably dont have to tell you that I was *none* of those things, but that was the Gospel according to NM, and sadly at the time her words got to me, leading me to believe I was the sick one and prompting me to seek out a therapist as a way to make amends. Anyway, I managed to find the original email enquiry, and while I regret not pursuing it further at the time, I found the way I had written it to be quite telling: Dear Therapist, I am writing to enquire about your services, as I am interested in exploring the benefits of therapy in order to resolve certain issues in my life which I am struggling to make sense of myself. There are several aspects of my life which need attention, however the most significant of these center around sexuality, feelings of inferiority, and (more recently) strong feelings of either emotional indifference or anger, specifically towards my parents. This situation in particular is causing me distress, as I don't understand the root causes of such behaviour, and **I cant see what my parents have done to deserve me feeling such anger towards them**. It's now proving very destructive, which is what has compelled me to seek some sort of professional help. The first thing that struck me was Holy shit, this has been going on WAY longer than I thought - but what *really* unnerved me was the part Ive put in bold. I realised in reading it back that even though I was the one who sent the email, *it wasnt me talking* - those were my NMs words, programmed into my consciousness. Realising this and actually having concrete evidence of it was a bit of a game-changer for me. Not only did it show how memories of abuse can fade or become suppressed over time, but it also demonstrates just how insidious emotional and psychological abuse really is, in terms of actively distorting and manipulating your own childs mind to conform with the narcissists narrative. This discovery felt like a kick to the stomach, but it also gave me validation that this isnt all in my head or something Ive just cooked up to justify going NC for the past 18 months and punish my perfect parents. Its emboldened me to keep pushing through the guilt and shame, and not accept their skewed reality over my own identity. Unfortunately I never followed up on the email, as the cost was too high and I was on a low income at the time - perhaps if I had I would have come to this realisation a hell of a lot sooner. But even so, it proves to me that even back then I knew that something wasnt right, although I couldnt put my finger on it. It may be a small thing, but its helping me to learn to trust my instincts again, after a lifetime of being conditioned to trust my NMs perceptions over my own. I just thought Id share by way of offering some small encouragement to other RBNs, who are also struggling to shake off their NParents false reality and learn to trust their intuition and recollection of events. Thank you for reading this far - just typing this has helped me put some of my thoughts in order, and i already feel like a weight has been lifted. TL;DR - Recently coming to terms with having been emotionally and psychologically abused by NM, but still plagued by guilt and doubting my own memories, specifically whether they actually constitute abuse. Found an email to a therapist from 12 years ago, recognising family dysfunction and demonstrating how deeply conditioned I was by NM, with her words coming out of my mouth. Alarmed at the discovery, but using this experience to regain trust in my recollection of abuse, and learn to heal and recover."

Captions from an article i am reading and they truly describe my case: ""The fear of intimacy, also sometimes referred to as intimacy avoidance, is characterized as the fear of sharing a close emotional or physical relationship. People who experience this fear do not usually wish to avoid intimacy, and may even long for closeness, but frequently push others away or even sabotage relationships."" ""Fear of intimacy can stem from several causes, including certain childhood experiences such as a history of abuse or neglect, but many other experiences and factors may contribute to this fear as well. Overcoming this can take time, both to explore and understand the contributing issues, and to practice allowing greater vulnerability."" At least now i know what is wrong with me blowing every possible relationship i could have had, sending the wrong signals when i was interested *sigh* I am not sure if it is allowed to share links, otherwise i would edit with the link later."

The scene where Thor travels back in time to the day his mom died was heartbreaking for me. I know it's a movie, but the fact that his mom was simply there for him without asking questions further proves that I was raised by a Nmom. She didn't ask questions and didn't make him being there about herself. She saw her son was in need of support and she gave that to him. She told him to be the person he was always supposed to be. It broke my heart that I will never have a maternal figure like his mom in my life. Someone that unconditionally loves and supports. The entire time I was waiting for her to turn into the bad guy, to say something belittling or use his moment of vulnerability to squash him down even further. Then I realized how sad it was to expect that..."
172,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Help understanding trauma defense mechanisms with pushing away love interests (with mutual attraction),5,bjrx5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/bjrx5a/help_understanding_trauma_defense_mechanisms_with/,2019-05-02 16:57:02,"In a nutshell, NARC father physically and emotionally abused me growing up. Abuse was specific to expressing my opinions or contradicting him. My mom did nothing and as a teen she revealed that she felt I deserved this treatment. My siblings dealt with significantly less of these issues. The world in my childhood home revolved around my dad and I had to learn to anticipate his abusive triggers and psychotic counterintuitive thinking. I always hated and did not trust my father, those feelings came later for my mother. I haven't spoken to either in over 10 years, perfect arrangement. I spent the last 4 years in therapy making great progress. I got over my fear of expressing myself (I'd get panic attacks), started being vulnerable/open with people (appropriately with strangers, friends, that sort of thing), starting experiencing emotions/feelings other than extremes like anger or sadness, started taking care of myself and caring more for others, set boundaries with people that empower me, overcame of a lot of other childhood baggage that came from having absent parents and parents I couldn't trust. Anyway, all these changes have led me to crave, or realize that I crave, intimate romantic relationships, and I feel like I'm at a place where I can do that. In the last few years, I've met women where there's mutual attraction and the women are sending signals loud and clear (I'm a lesbian so there's usually a hurdle with ""is she into women?"" and then the hurdle of women being super passive in expressing interest, so a clear signal is an accomplishment) and consistently push these women away. I will be in the presence of someone where there's mutual attracted, and in the moment it feels right, ie comforting being wanted and nice being attracted to them, but then out of no where some unspecified trigger interrupts these feelings scares me into avoiding them, which in turn pushes them away. I get distant, avoid their sexual or loving gaze, get cold, ignore them. I will try correcting the behavior afterwards, then it reads as mixed signals, which further pushes them away. Usually, I just abandon the relationship after enough self-sabotage and rationalize the loss with an excuse. For the last 10+ years that I've been doing this distancing behavior. I've up until the last week, unknowingly made excuses for my conduct. Blaming circumstances related to the other person or my life for making distance or being rude rather than a defense mechanism stemming from childhood trauma. Someone I've been attracted to for the last six months has been escalating things and I'm excited about it, but struggling to reciprocate. I caught myself falling into the same pattern of pushing away, but this time I got frustrated with the feeling of fear getting in the way of me asking her out and started to think through my reactions, which lead me here. My experience of this fear is hard to pin down, but it's like an acute fear of vulnerability (which I don't have platonically anymore) and extreme discomfort with being wanted so much by someone. I am trying to work backwards to process these feelings, but need help finding my way. I've found a few pieces on what is going on [section 1 on this site](URL and [section 1 on this site](URL but neither really explain how to work through this. Any advice, stories of personal experience, or resources others have used would be extremely helpful."

Two years later I still dont, because I wouldnt be taken seriously. From 2016 to late 2017, I dated this guy who was my first everything. At 21, I had never been with any guy until my ex. Unfortunately, meaning, I was naive and easily blindsided by his unfamiliar but desired attention and affection for me. Little did I know that he had a narcissistic personality, thus it was programmed in his brain that, with the knowledge of my vulnerability, he could control me in every aspect. Note: Im almost 24 now, and disabled from birth (much healthier now but I am termed handicapped by the state) with makes the situation harder and more difficult to confess...because Ik the consequences. For the first 7 months out of the 12.5 we were together, it wasnt perfect but it wasnt a nightmare either. He and I had a lot in common so we did things we both liked to do: mini golf, movies, arcades, video game nights at his place. We fell for one another hard. Or at least in my 21-year-old POV. Sadly, as I looked back after the breakup, I realized - although I did love those activities - how little I had a say in what we did. Hed become so bitter for a few hours if we did something I wanted to do. I ofc saw it as being a boy and ignored it. Until my ex began to show me his true colors in ways that I wish I could forget... He became sickly over protective of me, not letting me use my phone while on a date, go out with my girlfriends on the weekdays or weekends or grabbing my body in a tight grasp and holding it close to his side if we walked by a group of people who to him appeared to be harmful. He then turned horribly defensive and angry whenever Id try to talk with him about something that was bothering me. In public hed humiliate me on purpose and then laugh, say it was a joke and to not be so sensitive. Then the emotional abuse and shaming of my looks, goals, lifestyle started. Lies. Gaslighting. Then, one night...and this is the night that comes and goes in a blur...I was sitting on his mums couch, watching TV with her. My ex was somewhere in the back doing something. Suddenly, he calls out down the hallway and asks me to go into his room. I wish I hadnt moved. But I did. I stood in the middle of his bedroom floor, waiting. (Was wearing jeans and a t shift btw) My ex comes in and has this grin on his face. Like a sensual yet (now) mischievous... Why do you want me in here? You told me to go in the living room. (thats what he did toward the end of our relationship, told me to not go into his room without him there etc) I wanted to see you. Thought we could have alone time. Isnt that enough? I sighed and agreed. He then leaned in to kiss me. Ofc I let him, although I admit I was upset at this point by how he treated me - yet, I didnt understand what I do now to put two and two together. I tried to pull away though because he became way intense, which was abnormal for him as of late. When Id be be affectionate, hed respond for a quick second and then tell me to take it easy... He ignored me, saying that this was overdue and picked me up, put me on his bed. I said Not now and that we were upset at one another still, that I didnt want to be intimate like this. But he chuckled and said that I did want it and that make up sex was fun... Like an idiot I let him take my clothes off except for my undergarments...He began to try foreplay, slapping my ass and kissing my neck...which he knew was my soft spot. Mind you, he was a 50 pounds heavier than I was (I was 86 at the time; very lightweight IK...). He had pinned my arms over my head when I went to put them on his shoulders to push him off. This wasnt what I wanted... I couldnt breathe; I am convinced to this day, I almost had a panic attack.... I felt his fingers on my legs and this shiver came across my spine, but it wasnt like past sensations that I had when we had sex. Suddenly my panties were off...and I said his name and before I could say anything else, he took it as a cue and put himself in me... I gasped but he thought otherwise... This went on for a few seconds. I struggled. A bunch of nos escaped my lips; I pushed his hands off of my wrists somehow and with my knee, I shoved him hard where it hurt most. He instantly got off of me, choking at the pain.... I didnt feel bad. I and ran out to the bathroom, clothes in my arms and called a friend who lived nearby to come pick me up. Made an excuse my ex wasnt feeling well and didnt want my Nparents involved...theyd only make it worse... I regret how long I let myself stay after that, but psychologically, I was not in the right mindset with him. He had taken capture of my emotions and my love for him so I would be afraid to leave. Every time Id plan on doing so, hed find out and guilt trip or force me to feel lonely by leaving me alone in a room for hours, or saying that without him Id be nothing. Fear was implanted in me until I had enough and broke the chains. Two years later, I know he did a horrible thing. In his sick mind he was giving me what he knew I usually wanted from him. But because of how my Nparents are in terms of telling me Im being dramatic about anything and everything, I have kept silent. The fear of seeing him again in a courtroom or a hospital bed because my Ndad punched him to a pulp, it pushes down that memory and forces me to smile to cover up the pain."

She is coming the final days as she has been taken off all treatments and has opted for comfort-measures. I have been in frequent contact with her, both on the phone and in person. It has been pleasant to reconnect with her after all these years. I am finally seeing her vulnerability and all the good traits she never showed often, the ones I yearned to see more of through my childhood and my adulthood. In this moment, she is completely her. She is not the hurt she has caused me. She is not the anger. She is not the monster I have known her to be. This palliative experience has been a journey, in itself, for me. I have had ten years of neglected grief resurface. I have come to know forgiveness. I have come to know peace. I have come to realize that I focused so much on myself and my life that I never saw the other side of her life up until recently. If you asked me years ago, whether I would care if she died, I would have gladly offered to make it happen... but today, I sit across from her now in the hospital. She is bed ridden. She is thin. She is infected. She is suffering. She is dying. I am grasping on to any minutes and hours I can get with her before they are no more. What caught me off guard was the apology she gave me a week and a half ago. It was meaningful, it was honest, and it was reflective. An apology that was the complete opposite of the half-assed 'apology' I got years ago. An apology I thought I would live an entire lifetime without receiving. But I did receive it. I felt the truth in it. And I'm okay with it. It is a strange feeling what death brings to people and I am relieved to know that we both have found that peace before she is finally at peace."
175,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Email from former best friend - what am I to think?,5,b09lgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/b09lgp/email_from_former_best_friend_what_am_i_to_think/,2019-03-13 03:13:44,"After doing therapy, I started to examine my relationships and friendships with people. It sucked realising my best friend was quite like my mother, as my mother would minimise and invalidate my thoughts and feelings. She was competitive, I was parentified, and never felt 'seen'. She admitted once that she never let me be myself - that was huge. &amp;#x200B; My best friend was a gay male and older than me (i'm 32 he's 36), so I felt 'safe' in that outwardly he was nothing like my mother. But after therapy I realised he was definitely like my mother, in his personality. &amp;#x200B; I was talking to him on the phone one day, sharing how Alice Millers *'the gifted child'* book touched me and made sense. He wasn't 'in' the conversation and kept bringing it back to him. He also wasn't happy that a few weeks prior, I had told him my true thoughts about his behaviour (he had become 'the other man' to his friends partner). &amp;#x200B; I realised he was doing the very same thing my mum did to me. He would change the topic when i spoke authentically about where I'm at with therapy and my growth or obstacles. He'd say things like 'oh dear, you're *still* there in that place, i passed that a lonnnng time ago thank god i'm so much happier now - but aww, poor you, i'll try to support you as best i can but I really can't do much I'm pretty busy'. But it's said in this, competitive spirit, it doesn't feel genuine and gives me the heebie-jeebies. a) I wasn't asking for squat - i was sharing a little more than usual instead of being his gramophone b) it felt like he's just keeping score, he'd frequently say 'i did therapy for 7 years' in comparison to my 2 years. Like it's a race or a competition. &amp;#x200B; In the end I had a call with him a few weeks later after reflecting. I realised he had always been this way, I had just woken up and stopped excusing the shitty behaviour. Going no contact with a few family members aided in me seeing clearer too - getting 'out of the fog' as they say. On the call I shared with him that it was clear there wasn't much space for my vulnerability and authenticity because every time i'd try to inch forward a part of me, it felt like he'd slap it down or compete or brush over it. It honestly felt like me being me just irritated or infuriated him. And I couldn't stand it any longer. I also felt that because I didn't agree with his personal choices, and was honest when he kept drilling me about it, he pulled away and it was harsh. He always does this when I need him or am going through something, he'll disappear and reappear and it's not okay. I tried to put it politely i said 'i think we are going in different directions, growing apart' he sounded angry and said 'yeahhhh, i've been thinking that for a while actually', shock to me! I said ' okay then, it sucks you know? i don't want this it's not what i had in mind and it makes me sad' he just flipped it off and sounded energetic like 'oh well, so you take care then ok?' - i was at a loss. he sounded happy?! &amp;#x200B; I grieved for about a month honestly. I was really heartbroken and sad. I questioned my choice but then i remembered all the times he'd compete or invalidate or just talk about himself. I remembered how he'd pull away anytime something good or bad happened in my life. How when i met my SO he was suspicious of him and tried to inject himself ito our relationship to make drama, how he ignored me for a month as i prepared to move overseas, how i had to support him when his dad got cancer, how when my dad got cancer it was 'too much', how after i was assaulted he went quiet and told me to just 'see the beauty in life!'. I finally realised **I** had changed. And that's okay. &amp;#x200B; Today he emailed me this, after not talking for about 5 months: *Hey \[my name\]* *I know this is out of the blue but I just wanted to let you know that if I died tomorrow I would be absolutely grateful for the friendship we had and that I just want the best for you.* &amp;#x200B; Is it just me, or is that melodramatic? I really hate how he does this. It has happened a few times. He is completely cold and detached and competitive, or almost putting himself under and acting like a victim. One of the last times we spoke, when I got angry at how he kept reverting the conversation back to him, he said 'you're scaring me - this behaviour is scary'. And i thought what?! This is EXACTLY what my mother does! Show any real emotion, attempt any boundary, and suddenly you're weird, scary or sensitive. &amp;#x200B; I feel like I made the right choice to end this friendship. He has some wonderful qualities which I haven't talked about, like he *can* be very giving, he can be generous, he can be fun, but goodness me, he can also be very dark, depressing, cruel, competitive and invalidating. For where I am at, I just can't do it anymore. Any advice? I hope I am not missing something here but in my heart of hearts it just doesn't feel right anymore. "

I understand the dynamic at play and can relate painfully to a lot of what stories are shared here. I'm 36 and have spent the past 10 or 15 years learning about myself and overcoming some of the obstacles in my life. I consider myself aware and accountable for my own thoughts feelings and behavior and am proud of how hard I have worked to be a better version of me. My 4 year old son is everything to me and I think a very big part of why I am so motivated to protect him from having to experience some of the avoidable struggles that result in being raised in a narcissistic family. The problem is that while I am doing everything possible to protect him, I am in a very challenging situation with his mother and grandmother. Let me start by saying that I have known his mother for 19 years and until 2 years ago during a very intense, confusing, and traumatic separation, thought the world of her. In my eyes I never felt good enough for her as if it was too good to be true how much she loved me. She was so honest and kind and open enough with me about her life that it was evident that she had a very invalidating and traumatic environment full of abandonment and emotional neglect most of which was directly related to her mother. I was supporting her in starting to work through this in therapy but knew that she carried A LOT of guilt and shame that made it very challenging for her to accept her mother as the covert malignant scapegoating perpetual victim responsible for gaslighting and destroying any self worth or esteem that she deserved as a child, rather than the blameless and idealized version she was clinging to. My ex remembers little from her childhood and felt safe enough to admit she struggled with her feelings and impulses, was aware that she cared too much about how others saw her and the shame that came with this. She had trouble with vulnerability and perfectionism but I never saw any of this as reason to avoid the very growth and healing orientated 5 yr relationship we had. Her and her 2 daughters, myself and our son were a family and a very loving and safe one at that. She was able to see what she needed to work on and I did as well and we were accomplishing it all together. We were happy and unfortunately her pattern of self sabotaging come full force in a storm of intense anxiety and rage. At the time, I didnt know her mother was encouraging her to destroy everything we built and due to a lot of false accusations and gaslighting, I am now barely clinging to the only relationship I have left from our family with my son who she is trying to alienate from me. This has been so traumatic for me and all about her projecting her shame on me and avoiding the mistakes she made. By all means I would bet my life on her experiencing psychosis and I think her aversion to me is more about the emotional flashbacks and trauma I triggered. It would take a lot to explain it all but I am stuck trying to coparent with someone who is not the woman I knew for 19 years and has convinced the courts I am abusive with a lot of help from her mother. In fact, I made the mistake of asking her mother for support in getting her help because of how scared I was by her rage and that is when everything got distorted. I am convinced her mother played on her insecurities and shamed her into falling back into the angry, scared but compliant little girl that is now recreating the same traumatic childhood for our son that she had. This is the mother wound of all mother wounds and regardless of diagnosing or hope for our relationship, I am terrified how she is hurting our 4 year old and am powerless to stop it because of the smear campaign and reality distortion that resulted in the court believing she needed protection from me. I am hoping I can get truth and justice and protect my child from what is taking its toll on him already but I am so torn knowing how important she is to him. The court will not understand the depth of this pathology and trying to explain it will only hurt me. My question is whether anyone here has been so deep in the brainwashing and mind control that they were stuck in this level of denial for years, yet able to get themselves out of the fog. I am only focused on myself and my son but do I really have no possible way to have that include a mother that I know he loves and needs? Any insight or experience would be welcome. I know my son is my priority and have managed to find some hope of revealing truth and justice, just want so badly for it to include his mother. Is there a point of no return? She is acting NPD but it is 19 years of knowing her that thinks it is complex ptsd/trauma that will end in devastation if she cant distance herself from her mother. She is exposing our son to everything she was learning the truth of and seems completely unaware of it all. I think it is more just her being completely under the control of her very toxic and manipulative mother."
177,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Boundaries - first draft,11,b24ogm,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/b24ogm/boundaries_first_draft/,2019-03-17 23:28:33,"Draft of an email I plan to send to Nmom and enabler dad (see post history for context) with boundaries for our relationship moving forward. Not an option to go NC right now bc not willing to sacrifice my relationships with dad and brother. Dont super expect anyone to get through this whole thing but if you do thanks and would love feedback! 1. I will not enter into any discussions about past events, including and especially those we remember differently. 2. I will not respond to questions like Why dont you love me? or accusations of marginalizing anyone out of our family, as these are both hurtful and untrue. 3. I will not tolerate being spoken about negatively to family members or shared family friends including and especially with false narratives of my attempting to marginalize anyone out of or refusing contact with anyone in our family. 4. I will not tolerate having stories about any of my past struggles shared to family members or shared family friends without my consent. This is a violation of my privacy and causes me to feel unwelcome, uncomfortable, and defensive at family events, especially because I feel they have been historically mischaracterized. I have the right to my own story and who I choose to share it with. 5. I will not tolerate either of you requesting information about me or my life from family members or shared family friends. I have done nothing to refuse or limit contact with either of you and am happy to discuss with you directly how Im doing and what is happening in my life. Therefore it is both unnecessary and anxiety-inducing for me for you to attempt to gain this information through outside sources. 6. I will not tolerate either of you instructing family members or shared family friends to behave in any uncharacteristic way around me, including and especially in the alleged service of my safety. I am not fragile. I do not need, nor have I ever needed, anyone to behave differently around me due to any past or current life challenges. In fact, I need and have advocated for the exact opposite, and historically this need has not been respected. Characterization of me as fragile and unstable was and is harmful to my recovery, and I will not tolerate any attempts to retroactively, currently, or preemptively perpetuate this characterization. 7. I will not tolerate any explicit or implicit attempts to interfere with or in any way jeopardize or limit my relationship with family members or shared family friends. I will also not tolerate being accused of any ulterior motive based on whom I choose to share information with, reach out to for support, or spend time with individually. Any effort on my part to strengthen relationships with other family members, including my father, are unrelated to the status of my relationship with my mother. Mischaracterization of any such effort as an attempt to hurt or ostracize my mother, or as anything other than fostering closer relationships with the family member(s) in question, will not be tolerated. 8. I will leave at the onset of any emotional outburst that jeopardizes my emotional well-being. I respect everyones right to their feelings and am not denying their validity; however, if they cannot be expressed in a respectful and appropriate fashion I need to remove myself from that environment. Moms behavior at Christmas was traumatizing to me and I will take steps to remove myself from exposure to instances like that in the future as necessary, as they are contraindicated to both my mental health and ability to maintain positive relationships with family members. Should this need arise I will not tolerate any characterizations of my choice (to me or to any family members or shared friends) as resulting from a lack of empathy, compassion, or concern towards anyone else, or as anything but practicing my right to self-care. 9. I will not be kept away from, nor tacitly or directly encouraged, not to attend any future family events, nor will I tolerate any attempts to dissuade family members from including me in these events. 10. I will not be held responsible for any decisions made by either of you in regards to your contact with me. If you are unable to respect these boundaries and decide to limit your contact with me, I will not be blamed or made to feel guilty for that decision. 11. I will always be polite, civil, and respectful of all family members during all future interactions and will show emotional and physical affection/intimacy to family members to the extent that I feel comfortable doing based on my last interaction with that individual and/or my current mental state. If recent violations of boundaries by and/or negative interactions with a family member result in my feeling uncomfortable displaying emotional or physical affection with that family member, I will prioritize my emotional and mental well-being over their desired perception of our relationship. I will not tolerate any characterization of this to me, other family members, or shared family friends as coldness, lack of love, or anything besides necessary for my emotional health, nor will I tolerate having aspersions cast on my character directly or behind my back as a result. 12. If any of these boundaries are violated, I will remove myself immediately from the situation. I will respectfully and privately inform you why I am doing so and will not initiate or respond to any further contact with either of you until I feel comfortable and can trust that it will not happen again. During a no contact period (which I hope will not be necessary), any subsequent violation of these boundaries will, by necessity, prolong the duration. 13. While I will not require this as a boundary, I would feel much more comfortable having a relationship with both of you if you were undergoing individual and couples therapy from a licensed clinician besides [former family therapist]. Due to his pattern of unethical and unprofessional behavior, including but not limited to: derisive comments during peer group about suicidal ideation I was experiencing, prior denial of my rights under mental hygiene law, and the fact that his license to practice would be revoked were anyone to report his past indiscretions with his now-wife and former client, I feel very uncomfortable with the prospect of either of you continuing any personal or professional relationship with him or any staff at [former IOP treatment center]. However, I do not wish to deny you any sources of emotional support, so I am not stating this as a boundary but simply expressing my feelings about what would make me feel more comfortable in your presence. To that end, I would feel emotionally safer knowing you were receiving treatment for issues that affected me throughout my childhood and adolescence and continue to affect me to this day. I believe both of you had very difficult relationships with your own parents which resulted in unresolved trauma you have projected onto me. Of course, this is a non-professional, non-clinical opinion, which is why I feel you would benefit from getting professional help, as I can only speak to you from my own experience and an almost-completed B.S. in the field of Psychology/Applied Therapies. Nonetheless, I will share my experiences and how it has affected me in the hopes of illustrating why I feel this would benefit our relationship. Mom, I know you had a very difficult childhood, and I believe your experiences of alienation from your own mother and mother-in-law are correlated with a hypersensitivity to rejection that has resulted in my feeling frequently on-edge in your presence for fear of triggering an outburst like the one on Christmas. From my observation it seems to be difficult for you to feel that you are loved/accepted when you are not needed. I believe this has created a toxic dynamic where you dont feel close to me unless I am dependent on you, and therefore have felt rejected or distanced by me at the times I have been most healthy and have asserted my independence (e.g., when I made the choice to move to [city] and recently as Ive begun to move past the cycle of suffering into a stage of personal growth) and closest to me when I have been mentally unwell to the point of being unable to take care of myself (e.g., you shared that the last time you felt close to me was at [conference in my new city Nmom attended], when as you know I was extremely depressed during that time and didnt leave the hotel room for almost the entire weekend). I cannot enable this further by stunting my own growth or enabling the unhealthy ways you choose to ask for the love you need and deserve, by engaging in outbursts that are honestly frightening and traumatizing to me. As a teenager I feel I picked up this behavior and perpetuated it with outbursts of my own, but fortunately working through these issues in therapy has enabled me to more appropriately respond to situations. However, when I am around this like I was at Christmas, I risk losing that progress. I am not blaming you for what I have already apologized for and acknowledged were hurtful and inappropriate actions, and at the same time, from my knowledge of child and adolescent development, children learn their coping skills from their parents. Because beginning to work through my unresolved trauma has been helpful to me unlearning this, I believe it can be helpful to you as well. In addition, I believe you may be suffering from Orthorexia nervosa and other obsessive/compulsive behaviors. Your response to my consumption of any food you deemed to be unhealthy in my childhood and adolescence and exertion of control over my diet and your own has caused me a deep sense of shame and issues with self-control around food I struggle with to this day. Again, I do not blame you for issues that are my responsibility to seek help for (and I am), and you may not see your relationship with food as a problem, but the fact is that it has affected me. It is my hope that by speaking my truth about how these issues are harming our relationship I can encourage you to reach out for help. Dad, you keep saying that I have no reason to feel as though you are not proud of me, or that you dont appreciate my accomplishments, but the fact is you have never said it to me, and dont seem able to. To give the most recent, small-scale example, you couldnt say the most basic good job or express any kind of excitement about my improvement when I sent you that video of me playing the guitar, even after I told you directly that was what I was looking for. When I was trying to tell you about [art as social change project I started combatting campus sexual violence] you could have said any number of things indicating you appreciate all the hard work and original ideas that went into it, and yet instead you chose to tell me that my calculation of statistics (statistics I had both researched extensively and experienced personally) was probably wrong. I cant express to you how hurtful it was at Christmas to hear you say that you both loved me, especially [Nmom]. I believe that your relationship with your own mother, in which you experienced pain and suffering over any vulnerability you showed or emotion you expressed, has contributed to you having difficulty expressing your feelings, and you cant seem to understand why I might not feel or know something you have never said to me. This has affected me in that I am constantly searching for the approval I never received from you, both from you and from all male figures in my life. I gravitate towards other emotionally unavailable men in romantic relationships, and struggle to be vulnerable and authentic with my own feelings in both personal and romantic relationships. By sharing all of this with both of you, I hope that you will see that not seeking help for unresolved issues can and does unintentionally impact people you love (a lesson I learned the hard way that recently gave me the final push to take my mental health seriously) and, if you want to build a better relationship with me, seek that help. I know that it can seem overwhelming and difficult to know where to begin, but maybe sharing this letter and your thoughts and feelings about it would be a good place to start. Tell your therapist Im being condescending and full of shit if you want - thats the wonderful thing about therapy; you can say anything and not be judged, while learning more about yourself than you ever thought was possible. So I hope that both of you will choose to go to therapy, but I do not feel it is appropriate for me to require that as a boundary for us having a relationship at this point. I will simply say that I feel it would make it easier for us to have a better relationship. "
178,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"I'm not sure if this has been asked before but, do any of you recognize the narc in yourselves, also?",140,b26o2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/b26o2a/im_not_sure_if_this_has_been_asked_before_but_do/,2019-03-18 03:06:26,"So, both of my parents are narcs but, I was mostly raised by my mom. One of her signature behaviors was to suck people in with the promise of unconditional love and kindness, unlimited forgiveness, and adulation unbounded. However; once you got comfortable, she'd begin to have a negative, overly emotional response to every little thing you did. At some point, there would be nothing you could do right and it seems the only time she really loves anyone is when they are inaccessible. &amp;#x200B; As a young adult, I've seen myself behave this way alot with girlfriends. I'd be in tears over girls who wouldn't give me a chance but, the moment anyone began to love me or show vulnerability, I would slowly grow disgusted with them; often getting bored, making our relationship about me and my life problems, and blaming them for my new lack of interest in them. It took an ex-girlfriend exacting revenge on me and the resulting broken ego and recovery that brought about the insight I needed to observe these behaviors in myself and make a bit of a change. To this day, I still catch myself, right when I'm comfortable with others, looking for a reason to distance myself from them or get upset with or bored with them. I'm 37 years old and learning basic human bonding behaviors that I absolutely abhorred and saw as a sign of weakness not too long ago -- such as showing genuine interest in others and working to harmonize myself with people I like and value, and even recognizing that I like and value people. I fear how much emotional damage I can do to others if they get involved with me even though I've grown out of those previous behaviors and I see myself reflecting my mother sometimes and it can cause interrupts in natural processes between myself and others. What do you do when you reflect your narc parent(s) and what are your fears? "
179,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Is this common with NParents?,3,b46h2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/b46h2w/is_this_common_with_nparents/,2019-03-23 02:34:03,"It happened recently, and opened up some old put away memories that I had repressed / tried to hide for years. &amp;#x200B; Here's some backstory before the question: &amp;#x200B; &gt;I had a fight with my mom: the only difference was now our fights are starting to take a drastic turn. Ever since my therapist has been helping me build my boundaries and self esteem, my awareness of my abuse at home has been getting even more and more prominent. Which sucks- because now I'm aware of something abusive happening, yet still feel helpless to do anything. These fights are an example, except i've now taken it onto myself to collect my emotions and calmly point out what I am seeing. This throws my mother through a loop and she cannot try and win the argument this way (which is funny in it's own sad way). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I had finally broken through to her a few weeks ago and told her just how bad it's been going for me. I called her out on her constant comments on my eating habits, my diets, my food, as well as (and this is a big one) her blatant avoidance about the topic of my sexual abuse at 16 by an ex girlfriend. She blatantly ignores it. She avoids the topic. She blasts the #metoo movement on all of her social media- yet ignores her own trans son and his history of sexual abuse and trauma. Isn't that cruelly ironic. When i was forced to tell her that, yes, my ex has raped me many times, she didn't even offer a hug. She just- had a half assed ""sorry"" and let it go. It's been killing me ever since, 3 years later. &amp;#x200B; We had another fight the other day, but this time it was like all of that exposing, that vulnerability on my part was for nothing. She was back to her old ways. Even going and trying to hurt my feelings and get sarcastic with me in the long run. When I tried to bring up ""please stop saying these things"", she would accuse me of it being my fault that she was doing it, or getting sarcastic and going ""**oh you do no wrong**!!!!"". &amp;#x200B; This is a trend both of my parents use when I try and stand my ground and ask them what I'm doing / or tell them what they're saying is mean. I'm 22 now, so I shouldn't even have to do this but it's like I'm the parent here and they're the child. *The only reason i was over there was to update my laptop's apps bc I don't have wifi*. &amp;#x200B; For the next few days my mother blatantly ignored me. Where she would bother me via Polo videos or texts, now she was ignoring me. This happened a lot in my childhood, except she wouldn't physically talk to or acknowledge me for a day or so. This really fucked me up, obviously, and it still does. Because I'm so used to the abusive treatment, when she ignores me I grow scared and paranoid. She hates me! This caused me to have another serious breakdown. &amp;#x200B; Then, a full day and a half later...she messages me like nothing ever happened. Which is something both parents also did as a child! And as this was happening, esp after my years in therapy, it was almost too much to bare! I was now fully aware of these tactics they used, and understanding that this was my norm as a child up until now made me have a breakdown! &amp;#x200B; God- I noticed i was rambling. I'm sorry. &amp;#x200B; &gt;**I just wanna know- Is this common with NParents? Is this something they use a lot? Or is it not as common as I'm letting myself believe?** &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

Before I went NC, nmom had driven by my bus stop and given me rides before (her job is very near mine). After I went NC, I would shake as i walked to my stop with the fear shed pop up there and try to contact me. Today, almost 3 whole months after going NC, she finally did it. I was at my stop pulling up my bus pass on my phone when I hear a honk as a car I dont recognize slows down next to me. At first I think its one of my coworkers since they always offer rides. I think I visibly jumped back when I realized it was my nmom at the drivers seat, holding up her thumb the way hitchhikers do in the movies. I thought about turning my back at her, but her voice saying youre so dramatic as she always did whenever Id cry rang in my head, so I only turned my body 3/4ths away from her. She asked do you want a ride? I shook my head. When are you gonna talk to me? Give me a chance. I felt really sorry for her for a second. My mind was racing and I was shaking and I couldnt think of what to do. My instinct wanted me to, as I had always done in the past, turn around and tell her everything shes done to push me away from her. Thankfully, Ive been on this sub long enough to know better. Nothing I say could change her mind, any attention is narcissistic supply, dont JADE, anything I said shed use to try and turn my dad against me. This time I didnt even shake my head. I just looked at my phone. You dont want to? (I must note here that she was speaking Spanish and said no quieres? Which could either be her asking me if I dont want a ride or asking if I dont want to talk to her. Idk which she meant) Again, I did nothing. After what seemed like an eternity, she finally drove off. Did she really think I was gonna put myself in such an unbalanced situation? Put myself in HER car listening to HER talk without having a safe way for me to leave, and at a moment where I was completely unprepared both mentally and emotionally? She really thinks the way you show people youve changed and truly care about them is by cornering them and trying to use a vulnerability of theirs to give yourself a platform? Like the title implies, Im moving this weekend and I wont be taking that route home. Even if my dad told her where I moved, she cant know what route Id take home since there are so many ways now. I just hope she doesnt go crying to my dad and I wont be receiving some lecture from him about how I need to forgive her. Sad thing is, theyre separated. He pays for her rent because shes been lying to him about how much she makes specifically because then hed ask her to pay her own rent. Idk how to bring it up to him without sounding like Im trying to manipulate him. Shes got him wrapped around her finger somehow even though he used to call her crazy and constantly complain about her. Maybe he feels guilty. Idk. "
181,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My dad was a bully and I was his favorite target,13,b7s3zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/b7s3zj/my_dad_was_a_bully_and_i_was_his_favorite_target/,2019-04-01 07:09:58,"Hey, so I was recently disowned by my parents. At first I felt mostly sad, angry, betrayed, and afraid. But undergirding all of that was an immense sense of relief. I wasn't sure why at first, since I thought my relationship with them was fairly typical, but I've been reading a lot about emotional and psychological abuse, and it has resonated. This might get long, but I think it will be good to get it out, even if the length isn't appealing to most readers. Before I start talking about my dad, I need to talk a little about myself. I'm a 32 year old trans woman. Transition has improved my mental health immensely, but I still have a lot of hang ups, triggers, and anxieties. I'm starting to see why. The first thing you need to know about my dad is that physical boundaries were not a thing you got to have around him. If he wanted to goose you by pinching your ass, he would. If be wanted to ""teach"" you about pressure points by using military holding techniques on you, he would. If he wanted to play a pain tolerance game where he squeezed your hand until you begged him to stop, he would. If he thought it would be funny to pull down your pants in public for a laugh, he would. If he wanted to mess with your food, but putting something nasty in it, he would. The second thing you need to know about my dad was that he liked attention. Sometimes, he wanted attention in the form of sympathy. He'd ask if you wanted to do something when you were busy, and then act sad when you said no. You had to provide an appropriate amount of sympathy to end the interaction. If he came home from work, he had to be greeted at the front door by every member of the family. If he shouted for your attention across the house, you had to come see him instead of yelling back. If he wanted to talk about a political issue, you had to listen and respond at the appropriate points, sometimes for an hour. The third thing you need to know about my dad was that he liked to say racist, myognistic, homophobic, and transphobic things. If it was a joke he said, you needed to laugh. If it was a serious complaint, you needed to agree. If he told you and your sister that all women had penis envy, you had to nod and agree. If he wanted to give you a sexist pickup line to use about a woman, you had to squirm, because otherwise he might actually use it. If you saw an interracial couple at the mall, you had to hope he didn't see them too. If a gay couple was on TV, you had to listen to him gag and cover his eyes. If he heard a story about a trans woman, you had to listen to him dehumanize her. If he made fun of you for liking something girly, you had to swallow that and be less girly in the future. If he told you that he would disown you if you ever dated a black person, you believed him. The fourth thing you need to know about my dad was that anger was his. You could object to the boundary violations, but only while you had a smile on. If you got angry with him, and he saw, then he got angry. Then jovial bully dad would leave, and scary shouting dad would arrive. He might just yell and get red and slam his hands against a surface. He might find some creative threat, like telling you that you're ""getting on his dark side"" or that you better hope people don't find out about ""the real you."" He might just tear out your heart by finding your biggest vulnerability and showing it to you in the cruelest way possible. If you're really little he might spank you, maybe even with his belt. He always used to snap it as he walked down the hall for maximum intimidation. The fifth thing you need to know is that the anger cooled down quick. Once he was done he needed reassurance that all was forgiven. He wanted hugs. Even if that was the last thing you wanted to do. You could be sad or scared when he was angry, but once he was done you had to be done too. The rules were: Your body was his to poke, pinch, prod, and humiliate. His opinions were right and good and true, and they should be yours. Only his anger was allowed, and your reactions to it were tied to how long his anger lasted. If you disagreed with these rules, you could be put back into place. It's not normal for almost every nightmare to you have to be about your dad, is it? It's not normal to have a list of things your dad doesn't get to know, is it? It's not normal to worry when friends are over, because they don't know the rules, is it? I stand in the corner of elevators, so no one can pinch me. I wear a belt too tight so my pants cannot come down. I guard my food whenever I'm with other people. I cannot have a confrontational conversation face to face. I have to work hard to share the things I like, for fear that I will be mocked. I'm proud to he trans, except when I can't be. I don't think the relationship was normal, now that I really look at it, and maybe getting disowned was a very, very good thing. "
182,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I am concerned my sleepwalking was hidden abuse,5,b85kmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/b85kmb/i_am_concerned_my_sleepwalking_was_hidden_abuse/,2019-04-02 04:35:04,"Throwaway account I am going to mention possible sexual abuse (because that's where it started) But there arent graphic details So basically when I was about seven or eight my mother told me to start sleeping naked if I wanted because it was hot out...as a child I didn't think it was weird for her to suggest that, I slept with my underwear on that night, but woke up at 1am bent over backwards on the arm rest of our couch. I was embarrassed and so I ran back to bed and didn't say anything to anyone. A few years later I learn my stepdad, who's lived with us since I was 2, is addicted to porn, like will watch it in the living room on the phone and just tilt it away. Whatever, gross, I didn't even think about when I was younger. Around that time I was a good kid, always stayed home and read or played outside, my parents would make fun of me for not having friends, the usual. Fast forward another few years, I decide im a democrat and start cheering for the LGBTQ community, my parents are republican and very conservative. My stepdad starts ranting about how he hates transgender people to my face so I excuse myself and go to my room, 2 minutes later he throws open my door and starts screaming at me that hes smarter than me and, at this point raising a fist to my face, if I dont admit that hes smarter than me he'll beat me black and blue. He then made me keep my door open so he could watch me cry. A week later I am suddenly ""sleepwalking"" again, this time im sitting up in bed and slamming my head into the window next to it. Every night. for days. The one time I woke up, I tried to pull my head back to stop from hitting the window and I couldn't stop. After that night it stopped, after I moved out I've never ""sleepwalked"" again. I am scared because the sleepwalking was so irregular, and always put me in a position of vulnerability, or pain. My mother is always nice to me now, however every time my step dad appears he tells me im not a real adult and maybe I'll get my life together some time and be like him I basically just want to know, do you think this was just a coincidence, or was I abused and coerced by my parents to think I was sleepwalking?"

I came clean to my best friend about my family's abuse some time ago, mind you this person isn't particularly empathetic and has a hard time with people showing vulnerability. Humor is their coping mechanism and I realize my story wasn't exempt from this, as she didn't take it particularly seriously and her response was to say how ""when I grow up a bit more"" I'll have a better relationship with my Nmother. She's drawing on her own experience since she had issues with her own mum growing up but I always felt her response was condescending and awkward, since her situation is very different to my own (she still lives with her mum). Very rarely my best friend will come into contact with my parents nowadays since I rarely see them as well (on purpose). I've been pretty honest about my own disdain for them and how I can only deal with them in small amounts before it becomes too much and I have to leave. My best friend grew up around my family so she knows what they are like. I always liked her sense of humor as it allowed me to 'escape' my family growing up, if that makes sense. She was always fun. My best friend's boyfriend is also the child of Nparents so he tends to be more empathetic to my cause then she is, we have often shared stories and I have heard from my best friend how awful people they are, so I just assumed she also understood my situation. However, a couple weeks ago my best friend sent me a message about going to visit and stay with my parents (without me) as a mini-holiday since they live on the coast. The idea of this made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable especially because my mother is known to tell stories and gossip about me behind my back, something which she did as recently as last Christmas to my relatives, some of which don't speak to me anymore partly because of it (she denies this, however the things they later recanted to me where things only my mother would have known, so gee who else could it have fucking been I wonder). Still, I didn't know how to say this without coming off as an asshole so my response was more 'ask my parents yourself' in the friendliest way possible. I don't believe she ended up going but the whole thing has left a sour taste in my mouth. It might be silly but I feel a little bit betrayed. I told my best friend about how my Nmother did not get me medical treatment when I was 8 for a broken rib, and I almost died. I told her about how my Nmother insisted I kill myself after finding a journal entry about my depression when i was 14. My best friend herself has witnessed my mother's cruel outbursts growing up, even in one instance where my Nmother screamed at and embarrassed me in front of her, calling me names, ending up with me crying into my best friend's arms. I suppose in this instance I just assumed 'loyalty' but it still seems like, she just doesn't get it. I almost wonder if she believes that I made the whole thing up. My relationship with my parents and my Nmother is still rocky and I am still working it out, especially in my own therapy. When we meet up we often act as if everything is normal but I believe even subconsciously my family knows everything isn't 'right'. Perhaps my friend sees us acting 'normal' and believes all is forgiven (despite me saying very clearly and often how it is not)? What do you think, am I overreacting to this situation? Should my best friend be able to pursue a relationship with my parents separately from me? She has known them for a while. The idea of my best friend hanging out with my Nmother without me still makes me feel a little bit sick in my stomach. I don't know the ethics or the normality of this situation since I've never been in it before. Thank you for reading"

One was people pleasing and squashing my needs completely. Another was striving to always be self-sufficient and strong, given that vulnerability made my parents angry and anxious. &amp;#x200B; 2 years of talk therapy (psychodynamic) has revolutionised my self-talk. The inner critic is vastly 'turned down' and has lost credibility (unless called on for protection or boundaries). However I am concerned (purely because it's against the social norm.) in my current situation. Right now I am married to a wonderful man \[5 yrs married - he's same age as me\], yet i don't actively nurture any friendships, nor blood family connections. This 'phase' has lasted about 4 months now. &amp;#x200B; I elected to remove myself from contacting my family anymore, as it was really hurtful and harmful to my mental wellbeing. My mother and father used to 'use me' as a sort of, unqualified 'out-of-their-depth' child-therapist growing up. and it really hurt me a lot because i constantly had to put my wants and needs, fears and worries aside to ATTEMPT to relieve their never-ending saga's and drama's. &amp;#x200B; Even though my parents are older now (and ironically divorcing now too), they still refuse to see me as my own person and try to coax me into this awful, un-ending listening role. So, i said, enough and I'm the popular termed 'no contact' although i take little pleasure in it, i wish it didn't have to be this way, it's just that i am wary that if this keeps up i'll become extremely angry and resentful for taking MORE of my time in a way that doesn't respect me or my own limits. &amp;#x200B; Sadly my 3 siblings now have mental health issues of their own. I have tried SO hard over the years to be some kind of example to them - leaving the home at 19 off my own back and funds, creating a life in other cities and moving abroad (now in uk - origiinally from Aus). I'm far from perfect, I've been open about my own issues with PTSD and recovery after an assualt in my early 20's, but i like to think that openness about pursuing therapy has hopefully inspired some seed of thought in them that, if they need support, they CAN get it, even if mum and dad are incapable of it - others can. &amp;#x200B; Now it seems 1 sibling is following my old role and is super-close (over close) to my mother. I have warned her about this 'role', how it seems like a fix, but actually it does harm in the long-run. She's pursuing it anyway and i respect that but it means basically she has no respect for me at all becuase i left 'mother'! My other sister has bulumia and does things like pills and cocaine. Last i saw her, she visited me in the uk and stole some of my jewellery. since then she has blocked me after i confronted her about the missing items (it's not the first time, it happened on her last visit 4 years ago too). &amp;#x200B; Finally- my brother, he's 20. He still lives with my mother too. And i no longer hear from him. Normally we do a b'day message or general messages through the year and a phone chat, but in the last 6 months, he didn't reach out or reply to my messages, so i have had enough. &amp;#x200B; I am sick of being 'silent treated' by my siblings. They've said they're angry at me, hung up phones etc. My patience has worn thin and thanks to therapy i've finally got in touch with anger and i no longer give a sh\*t the way i used to. Don't get me wrong, i love my family still - but i can't say i want to be around them and it's only safe to love from afar and with massive boundaries. &amp;#x200B; So, lonnng story short, is it strange that i'm enjoying my own company right now and just - waking up, spending time with SO, working, going on walks, and doing therapy? I know it probably sounds lame and not enough, but, it's all i want right now. Until i know how to be a friend to me, i don't trust myself to develop friendships with people. Because i noticed that before therapy, i seemed to gravitate toward personalities like my family, and it never felt rewarding for me, not in the long-term anyway. I'm trying to change my state, and this is the only way i know how. Step by step, slowly, like a snail, Slowly but surely. any advice welcomed..."

They are both very toxic narcissistic people. My dad was/is emotionally abusive to me and now he and his wife are targeting my teenage stepbrother. This poor kid- its sick. Im getting a Masters in Psych and my program is VERY small and experiential. Basically, the different cohorts take classes together and we practice therapeutic techniques on one another. I love the program and, because Ive shared quite a bit about my experience growing up with a narcissistic parent, school has become a safe place for me. A few months ago, I walked into school and saw my stepmom sitting there. I asked her why she was at my school and she responded that my dad was meeting her and she was applying to my program. I was blindsided and walked off stunned. Later, I had to leave class and had a panic attack in the bathroom. I knew that the only way to communicate with my stepmom was calmly and rationally so I worked with my mom (not a narcissistmy savior) and my therapist to come up with a clear way to set my boundaries. I calmly expressed to my stepmom why it would be a conflict of interest for her to take classes with me (vulnerability, frequency of speaking about personal family dynamics, confidentiality) and requested that she apply after I graduated in a year and a half. The woman didnt hear me at all. She told me that there was nothing I could do to keep her from applying and that she wanted what I had (what the actual f*ck??). She then hung up on me. Weeks later she is texting me saying that its hurting her that Im mad at her for something that she didnt participate in. SHE FULLY PARTICIPATED IN THIS?? I feel violated but I also feel scared that someone like this could become a psychologistshe doesnt understand/respect boundaries and has been pathologizing and emotionally abusing her teenage son since he was a small child. I wont even get into my dads part in all of this because it is equally as vile. I talked to the faculty at my school (all mental health professionals) and, although many of them agreed that this was a gross violation of boundaries, they told me that legally they couldnt keep her from applying unless I had a restraining order. Sadly, the thing about emotional abuse is that there isnt really a leg to stand on when it comes to the legal system. Sigh. "

It wasn't a big adjustment since she seemed friendly and easy to get along with. I thought she tried too hard to be my mother, especially in my dad's presence. I didn't necessarily mind it since I never really had a maternal figure in my life. There were some positive aspects to the relationship, like encouraging me to get into shape and adopting a healthier lifestyle. My father passed away untimely when I was a senior and that's when our relationship changed. She sought comfort in my company and sometimes it got a bit uncomfortable. At first, none of the infractions were big enough to be alarmed. We were both grieving and I didn't make much of it. I vividly recall her seeing me change after a shower while having a conversation about university. It felt ashamed since she had never seen me undressed before. There were times when she'd compare me to my dad, and insist on being pampered (with food and movie dates). I had an idea that our relationship wasn't normal and that she was walking on a very thin line. That being said, I didn't have anywhere else to go and a part of me craved for her attention. In retrospect, I wonder if I would've reacted any differently if she weren't attractive. I feel shallow for giving into her. Now that I am more informed on the issue, and independent, I try to maintain healthier boundaries with her. I don't want to go ""no contact"" yet."
188,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"My mother was a drug addict, alcoholic, narcissist and the day she overdosed my childhood ended. This is the story of the second time I did mushrooms in Vietnam.",13,avq62g,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/avq62g/my_mother_was_a_drug_addict_alcoholic_narcissist/,2019-02-28 22:41:22,"The second time that I did mushrooms in Vietnam was possibly the most intense and simultaneously profound thing I have experienced in my life. I thought that the first time was life-changing, which it was but the second experience gave me insight into something that has haunted me for over 20 years; the day my childhood ended. **DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BUY ILLEGAL DRUGS IN VIETNAM.** *Drugs of any kind outside of alcohol and pharmaceuticals are highly illegal in Vietnam and unlike The United States where you might get a fine, lose your license, or thrown in jail. In Vietnam, a joint could get you a decade in one of the worst prisons on planet earth. A bag of mushrooms might get you incarcerated for life. I do not recommend doing illegal drugs, especially in Vietnam.* The octopus is likely the most intelligent animal in the world. It is capable of camouflaging itself, solving critical thinking problems, and has three hearts. It is also an animal that freaks me out, but that is just because everything at the bottom of the sea freaks me out. Between things that glow in the dark and Xenomorphs, the ocean scares me I typically stay on land. The first time I did mushrooms I found myself protecting a small child version of me and promising to take care of him and keep him safe. Psychedelics may have opened a new door to discovering the vulnerability in myself. During the space of time between dosing, I felt most in tune with myself mentally and emotionally. It was like a new better version of me emerged from that trip. I felt more willing to be open to possibilities and more clear and concise in what I wanted in my future. It also gave me an added sense of self that I had not previously had. I dont want to use the word enlightened because that isnt really what happened. It was more like a newfound feeling of compassion and trust developed. The things that I used to lack were self-love, happiness, and respect. That sounds odd to me in retrospect in consideration that I have led what I can only call as an exceptional life. I have traveled the world, fallen in love, ate Portillos chocolate cake and yet there has always been a sense of depression and anxiety that sits with me. It doesnt matter what I do or where I go I have ever had an impending sense of doom and a crippling sense of not good enough lingering over me. Death... As a child, a sense of fear came from my step-father, my asthma, and my mother, as an adult that came from my autoimmune disease. I dont talk about my sickness very often but I will soon. The feeling that at any moment I will die does two things: inspires me and terrifies me. I always wonder if today will be the day I die. Ive been on my back on a hospital bed more than once looking up at the white lights knocking on heavens door. The first time I was 6. I was in Kentucky with my mother. She left me with a stranger that I had never met to go to a wedding. By the time she loaded me into this person's car, my mother was three drinks in; it was 11 am. I begged my mother not to make me go with the strange woman but she didnt listen, and by the time the car hit the corner to wherever it was we were going I was in full on hyperventilation. I have no reason to believe that I was going to be harmed by this person, but I was 6, in a city Id never been, my mother was gone, and I was scared. I woke up in an emergency room hospital bed with my grandma by my side, and she was holding my hand. My mother was in the lobby on the phone with the insurance company. My arms were laced with I.V. Tubes, monitors, and another one of those little plastic ID bracelets. By this time I was collecting them like baseball cards. My hyperventilation sparked an asthma attack that was so bad I passed out. I overheard the nurse telling my mother that if I wouldnt have had my inhaler in my bag that I would have died; one of the few times my mother was responsible. I spent the next 24 hours in that hospital bed. My grandma didnt leave my bedside once except to tell my mother how irresponsible she was. I could hear her from the hall. For years I thought that this was the day that caused me to be a hypochondriac. It made sense. Facing death as a child fucked me up and it kept happening. I was the person who called 911 when my grandma had her first stroke. I called my aunt first. Grandma yelled about me saying she couldnt afford an ambulance and that my aunt should come and get her. I called my aunt, and he told me to call 911. Grandma yelled, but I did it anyway. I was also there ten years later when she had a stroke that put her into a coma. Death is everywhere, and I rationalize that as a part of being a human being. We all will die. I will die. You will die. I dealt with death like I worked in a morgue, but it wasnt my mortality nor my grandmas that set me up for a lifetime of fear and self-induced sickness. I recall the heat of the day which was unusual for mid-October Indiana. I couldnt wait to get out of my uncomfortable church clothes; I always hated wearing them because I hated going to church. We had just come home from an afternoon Mormon church ward meeting. I sat in the back with my recently newborn brother. He was seven months old. My mother drove, and my step-father sat opposite her. My two younger brothers spent that weekend at grandmas. I slide out from behind of the folded passenger seat of the black Chevy Cavalier. The car was covered in dents and rust. Most of the damage had come from my mother driving intoxicated. My step-father took my baby brother from the car seat and handed me the keys to the front door. My job was to hold the door open for them and to make sure that nothing was in the way of the path to the bedrooms. There was always something in the way. I opened the door and walked in to kick the shoes that lined the now blackened white carpet out of the way. As I reached down to take off my amazingly uncomfortable church shoes and replace them with my tattered Goodwill purchased L.A. gears, I heard my step-father screaming for me from the driveway. Michael call 911! His voice carried past the front porch and into my ears. I laughed and poked my head out the door to see what was going on. He and my mother often joked about calling 911. In retrospect, they were like the boy who cried wolf. Between the violence and threats they shared and the times that they play fought I never knew which way was up. My step-father caught my joyful gaze as I stepped down from the front porch, but his expression didnt mimic mine. As he rounded the back of the car to the driver side, my mother was planted back down on the gravel driveway convulsing as she choked on her own vomit. One of her legs caught in the seatbelt that was attached to the open door and her other leg hung on the steering wheel. She had taken too many pills again, and this time she was holding on for her life. Call 911 you little retard. My step-father screamed as he pulled his wallet from his back pocket stuffing it into my mother's mouth to keep her from swallowing her tongue. Does it look like Im fucking playing? I was caught off guard by what I was seeing. To say I was caught off guard would be an understatement. I was in shock. I couldnt think, speak, or move. I was frozen in time as I watched my mother writhing on the ground next to the Cavalier. Go call 911! He screamed again propping my mothers head into his lap. The second scream brought me back to consciousness, and I sprinted back into the house. I grabbed the white brick cordless phone. I pressed the power button. It flashed three times and the little red light faded. It was dead. I ran to the kitchen to use the phone that was mounted to the wall. I picked it up and put it to my ear, but there was no dial tone. I set the phone back on the hook and took it off again  no dial tone. I unplugged the wire from the base and the wall and plugged it back in  no dial tone. Two days before that phone was broken. My brother was in the kitchen calling my grandma to come and take him from our house after another vicious beating at the hands of my step-father. This one was worse than usual. My brothers and I examined each others bruises and welts trying to take care of each other the best way that we knew how after being beaten. My step-father heard my brothers conversation with my grandma, ripped the phone from his hands, pulled it from the wall and slammed it to the ground, and threw my brother across the kitchen into one of the cabinets. The cordless never worked because that battery was always dead and my step-father destroyed the phone in the kitchen. There was nothing I could do. I ran back out and told him that the phones didnt work. This sent him into a fury. Call 911 you stupid ass! Now. Get the fucking phone and call 911! He screamed. I tried to explain again that the phones didnt work but was interrupted by a voice coming from behind me. Our neighbor heard the screams and yelled that they had called 911. They never called for the cries of children. I guess thats just how it goes in 90s Indiana. Despite the middle of the night beatings, the pleas to stop, and the little boys walking around covered in bruised no one ever called 911 for us. I could hear the sirens coming from down the street. We lived less than a mile away from the fire station, and I could hear the sirens all the time. Medics arrived first and helped stabilize my mother. A ladder of firefighters followed shortly after and I stood on the porch paralyzed watching every second. One of the firefighters walked over and asked me if I wanted to wear his helmet. I said no. He wondered if there was anything that he could do for me. I asked him to take me with him. He patted me on the head and told me that he couldnt do that. This wasnt the first time nor the last time that my mother overdosed and I asked someone to take me. My mother's overdose would be the beginning of a significant period in which my brothers and I would stay with countless families and friends of families from the Mormon church and our neighborhood. After the 30th different family I stayed with I stopped keeping count. Sometimes I was with my brothers, but most of the time we were separated. The compassion and open-heartedness of the Mormon community is not lost on me. They didnt have to take in abused junkies kids, but they did it because thats the kind of people they were. That didnt make living out of a backpack and on occasion sleeping in worse conditions than my own home better; it just meant that I wasnt homeless, at least during this period. Are you trying to keep me from finding the truth or are you trying to keep the truth from finding me? I asked the Octopus as I laid in a pool of water looking at the stars. An hour prior I had taken a bit over a gram of mushrooms, and they were entirely taking ahold of me. I came into my second experience in the same way that I had during my first with psychedelics. I was willing to allow the universe to bring me whatever it was that I needed to see and feel. I accepted the fact that since I was taking a larger dose than the first time that I could end up in a dark place. What I didnt expect was that this experience would give me an insight into my life that I had been seeking for over 20 years. As I laid in the water and looked up into the dark sky stars began to appear. Each one sparkled brighter than the one next to it, and I felt a calm fall over me. My body felt heavy, and all the tension seemed to melt away. I felt peace. The sky looked familiar, and two stars start came together only inches apart. Then they became encircled by a collection of more bright shining balls of fire. From there long strands of stars joined to create a multitude of arms. Each going its separate way. The illusion became real as the Octopus emerged before me. The Octopus was beautifully translucent yet shimmered in the night sky. The light reflecting off of it shot back into my eyes and suddenly the pain that has been in my stomach for the last five years, the very same pain that was the catalyst for me getting sick went into overdrive. It felt as if my guts were being ripped apart from the inside  a familiar sensation to say the least. Suddenly, I was transported inside of my body while somehow watching myself from the outside. I was tripping balls. I could see the darkness that lived inside of me. It was the blackest black that I have ever known. That darkness had rendered me as a slave to its will for five years, and I was coming face to face with it for the first time. As I stepped towards the darkness, I asked it why it would not let me go. It didnt answer. I stepped closer. Why wont you let me go? I asked again to no response. What do you want from me? I screamed into the darkness but still no response. As I stepped closer, I felt a wrenching pain in my gut. It was much more than even on the worst days before. The pain was so intense that it shocked me back to reality. I reached my hand back and placed it on my stomach and closed my eyes. I wasnt done, and I wanted an answer to my question. I slowly began to fade back into the darkness. I stepped towards the darkness again and as I did was pulled into the depths of the water. I submerged and began swimming. I could see a small glimmer of light far below me. I swam closer and as I did the light became brighter as if some kind of beacon guiding me to what I needed to see. I came close enough to see that the light was being expelled from a chest not much unlike that of a paid bounty to a gallant envoy of a kings vessels. It was covered in gold and jewels with a lock that looked like it belonged on the outside of Fort Knox. I edged to the lock and felt the weightlessness and pressure of being submerged rush over my body. I reached my hands to the lock and as I did the octopus appeared wrapping its tentacles around the chest throwing me back into the depths. I gathered myself, and as I approached the chest again, the octopus wrapped itself tighter and tighter around the chest. Are you trying to keep me from finding the truth or are you trying to keep the truth from finding me? I could hear myself saying the words out loud and as I did the octopus and I locked eyes. Somehow I could tell that it was trying to protect me. I wasnt sure what could await me in that chest. I stood fists clenched and pleading with the octopus to open it. It looked at me with weary eyes conveying its concern that whatever was inside would forever change my life. It slid its now dark blue and glowing tentacles away from the chest. Slowly in a way that made me think the octopus was giving me one last chance to say never mind began to open the lid to the chest. As it did debris from the bottom of the sea started to build up. Then like a light switch flipped, I was transported to the sidewalk of the house on Allison Ave. The octopus was trying to protect me from a memory that haunted me. I never forgot what happened the day that the phones didnt work and how it set up the next couple of years of my life for pure chaos and insanity. Watching my mother overdose has played on repeat in my head since the first time I witnessed it  each time since was like bricks being stacked on top of each other. I stood and watched the memory play again and again. I heard every scream and felt every emotion. I felt the helplessness of not being able to help my mother. I felt the put fear of my step-father's voice threaten me and break me down. And I felt the real raw emotion that I had not experienced when I was a child. Tears streamed down my face as I witnessed the young version of me that I had promised to protect watch terrified and afraid. The pain of that moment was buried so deeply that the octopus began to pull me back to reality. As I was on the cusp of being pulled back in, I told it that I could handle what was happening. I was ready for whatever else would come. I laid in the pool of water grabbing at the pain in my gut - tears rushing down my face refilling any water that had splashed out. The vision was so vivid and real. It played through me a million times over but at the same time felt like only a second had passed. I had experienced watching my mother nearly die on more than one occasion, but I had never honestly felt the emotion attached to those moments. I cried for what could have been an hour or 10 seconds. I have no idea. I could feel the pain begin to subside but not entirely and as I tried to allow myself to go deeper the octopus appeared once more. This is all for today. The Octopus spoke to me in a booming and compassionate voice. There will be more. As it spoke, I was shot back to reality once more, and in an instant, I was a million miles from what had just happened. My face hurt from crying and I felt an instantaneous shift of self-acceptance. Something happened that I didn't expect. I was always the person that didn't care, and at that moment I felt acceptance for myself and my mother. Her drug addiction was more than just what came from getting high. She, like me, was in a tremendous amount of pain. I let the tears dry on my cheeks and thought about the strength of my brothers and sister who for better or worse keep my mother in their lives. They had something that I have only just discovered, that is empathy. I realize that these dark places Ive been shown recently are being shown to me because I have been disassociated from them. Maybe I have convinced myself that they arent that bad, I mean, after all, no one ever called the police to help me. Is a child being beaten until he passes out that bad? It is. I know that from first-hand experience. Maybe my darkness meter is skewed. Thats the result of trauma. Perhaps these are merely memories of times that have impacted my life so profoundly that they require a reexamination from my subconscious. I believe that becoming associated with the memories of my past is the gateway to my future. That darkness was the epicenter for my neurotic obsession with death, my hypochondria, and the day that my childhood ended. I used to think that it was the night that my step-father beat my brothers and me in the middle of the night for putting away wet dishes, but I am confident that watching my mother almost die was the catalyst for the next 20 years of my life. It was more than just her fighting for her life; it was everything that happened in those few minutes. My self-worth, identity, and capacity to not follow through was likely spawned from that very incident. Or maybe it wasnt; I am still trying to figure it out. I know that the octopus has more to show me and I am ready. *The Temper Trap - Miracle* *Something else comes over me* *Grace has come to set me free* *In your hands, you hold a new forever*"

Full stop. Subject line was simply ""hey."" Side note: I've never shared anything on Reddit (long time lurker) because I have a very critical inner dialogue that despite liking myself can also make me feel like I don't deserve to have a voice. So I'm sharing for catharsis, community, and to not feel crazy in this period where I'm part in and part out of the FOG. Background: My (29F) edad was long haul truck driver, which meant that my mom was effectively a reluctant single parent to me growing up, which she resented. She got pregnant with my half sister when she was in high school, and her emotional growth was stunted from there. I didn't grow up with my sister, as she was much older. My mother hated her lot in life, and I was the target of her rage. I became an expert in reading the moods in the thumps of footsteps. Brat may as well been my nickname. I remember her throwing my Happy meal on the car floor when I (a kid!) accidentally dropped her drink. She tossed all my toys and board games across the room - tiny pieces skittering everywhere - when my bedroom (as a kid!) wasn't clean enough. My feelings were always minimized, dismissed or deflected growing up until I had none. I should mention that I also cut myself as a teenager. The only time my self harm was addressed was when she said it was not her fault. In my head, I never expected to make it to 20. It was an isolating, hopeless time for me. Fast forward to today, and I am livin' it up. I just got married to a loving and stable husband, I have a dynamic job in a big city and a generally great life that I created myself, based on my own principles. And now my mom wants credit. She wants to be friends with me now that I'm an adult and she has pushed away most of her own. Im the first person in my family to go to college, to make a good salary. She thinks that she's done her job and, since I'm a success, it was a job well done. I understand that she's not all bad - and that's the tricky part of emotional narcisstic abuse. But to be directed to tell her that I love her is beyond the pale. Never once can I recall a moment she's said that to me growing up. If she felt disconnected, a simple, ""checking in on you,"" is a more appropriate response from mother to child. Frankly it's not my job to read into her alluded-to needs. She certainly didn't read much into mine as a helpless child. It was a wild realization to be told in therapy that I don't owe her anything, that deciding to keep a child means that you sacrifice without expectation, that you give love and vulnerability freely and offer money, if willing and in the position to do so, without strings attached. Not resent them until they're old enough to gossip about all your other family members to. Im not spoils to be reaped. What I got from her was table stakes parenting. I'm still working through a lot of hurt and not ready to play peer with her. Clearly my grayrocking is taking its toll because she simply cannot deal with me not feeding into her reality of having this great mother/daughter friendship despite her being incapable of meeting even halfway between her reality and mine. I deleted her email without responding. "
190,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My mother is emotionally manipulative. I have beared with physical abuse as well as molestation at her hands,2,ax092o,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ax092o/my_mother_is_emotionally_manipulative_i_have/,2019-03-04 10:47:39,"I think the best place to begin is at the start. I'm not too sure if my story can fit in the context of this sub, but I'll give it a shot anyways. I'm going to preface this by giving a few possible tw mentions; emotional manipulation, molestation, and abuse As you can already tell by the disclaimers I've given, it's a bit of a heavy story. I'm not going to go into too much detail, only where I feel is necessary. To give immediate background about myself, I am 16 living with my father and sister. The parent who I will be referring to as 'narcissistic' is my mother. Currently, my mother lives in another country, but my sister and I have recently began a routine of visiting her annually during the summer for two months. This trend began two years ago and is still continued, unless something changes. My earliest memory was of my mother at around the young and ripe age of three or four. As a young child, I wasn't gifted with a blissful childhood. In fact, it was quite the contrary. I was introduced to the most depraved nature of the human condition at a critical part of my development, and there was nothing I could do about it. I can only remember fragments of these experiences, but from what I can recall and based on documents created on my behalf to allow my father to have custody over my sister and I, it wasn't all that great. From the segment of the events that I can clearly recall, my mother had introduced her boyfriend to my sister and I. In a way, he had always intimidated me from the very beginning. I remember when I used to not act accordingly to his rules, he had enforced his authority by coming up with the most bizarre tactics to overcome this. Besides the classic beatings he'd give to both my sister and I, he would often tell us to do push ups. To stand by the wall for five hours until my mother came home without looking down. To not go to the restroom more than once. Feeding my sister and I nothing more than one meal a day. Forcing me to eat expired stew, causing me to throw it up and then telling me to eat the remains of what I've regurgitated. My mother would sit there and watch. At night is when it got worse. That's when he would inappropriately 'touch' me, causing me to feel an overwhelming guilt following that. I can't blame my mother for this trail of events. I remember seeing bruises littered all over her chest. The screams I'd hear at night. The crying that pieced my ears. It was so overwhelming. I can't change that, and neither can she. I've accepted that. There's no reason for me to blame her for that. My blame lies in the emotional manipulation tactics she's used in the past and stilll continues to use now, to garner my sympathy. By nature, I've always been slow to express my feelings. Even as a child. I used to be and still am, somewhat socially incompetent. This may be due to bullying and all that, but that's not really important. Fast forwarding to my first encounter with my mother. This happened just before I turned 14. Currently, my mother abuses alcohol. I don't think it's emphasized enough how such behavior can effect a family- as if it weren't doomed from the beginning. She also abuses cigarettes also. While there's nothing inherently wrong with that, it's always just been a pet peeve of mine and it doesn't fail to further add to the toxicity of her behavior. Out of all the times she told me I'm petty. That I shouldn't feel sorry for myself because her childhood was worse. Of all the times that she's used the 'little secret' of my father's as a weapon to appeal to my emotionally vulnerable sister. The moment that stuck out most to me was when out of the heat of the moment, told me that she knew I used to see a psychiatrist and that I'm pathetic for it. Telling me I am wasting my father's money (despite it being a free service in the country I live in) and that I'm not worth that much. She then proceeded to try and use my sister's emotional vulnerability as a weapon against me by saying to her that I'm 'pathetic'. That I should be taking care of her, as her second mother. (yet she proceeds to act offended whenever she sees me trying to nurture my younger sister who is a year younger than myself, mind you) I have never felt so much guilt and self loathing as I did that day. Despite being aware of how being a 'hormonal irrational teenager' is like, at the time, I couldn't help but draw myself to the idea of drowning myself in the pool that I sat by on that fateful day. She became irritated when I didn't cry when she wanted me to. She thought I was devoid of all feelings. She wanted to see me break. She thought it was abnormal for a girl my age to not crumble at her feet. In a way, I suppose it's not her fault. Maybe her childhood was that damaging to her character. That being said, I don't think that excuses a lot of her actions. She is an adult, and it isn't my responsibility to be stepping in egg shells constantly just so that she doesn't have a breakdown and attempt to make me do the same. It's mentally exhausting for me, as a child, to be babying my mother. It's difficult for me to even address my own feelings, let alone anyone else's. I suppose I'm just looking for advice, I think. Most of us are. I won't let this situation mold me. I am doing my very best to overcome all my afflictions. I have distanced myself from my background, and I won't let this bring me down :)"

But I ended up ranting at them both when they were on the phone to each other one night. I had a breakdown, and instead of actually helping nMum called my nDad to blame him. I ended up screaming at them both that they were both to blame, that their whole obsession with their endless fucking war and using me as pawn was tearing me apart. Suddenly, they both went on the attack. laughing and mocking me after I said I would go kill myself. because at that time I had no friends, no support and was drinking everyday. (All things I had mentioned to them) I remember the horrible snicker as my father said ""he always had a tendency for the dramatic."" And when I got home nMum screamed at me for 20 minutes. Calling me weak, calling me pathetic. The fucked up thing. I resolved at that moment not to harm myself. Because I realized how fucking evil and toxic these people were. That incident opened my eyes to how callous and nasty they could be. Whenever I expressed any vulnerability, they exploited it. I was not going to let them win. I am doing a lot better these days. Life is still hard at times, but I do want to live now. I am far from that point, and sadly, it was no thanks to my parents. "

I can't even be mad. Let's be realistic, I'd probably do the same thing in their position. I always end up on the edge of the group, alone, observing, trying to figure if there's some kind of secret handshake that would grant me access.

I know not to show vulnerability as much as possible, but I also try to keep the peace by answering their questions and being open with them. This morning, I was just trying to get a cup of coffee when my Ndad asked me why I was so stressed out. I couldn't help but get tearful when I explained why. I wasn't bawling or having a mental breakdown, but I had tears coming down my face--not that it should matter either way. He proceeded to say a bunch of shit like: ""I don't understand why that's so stressful. Is that really all that's going on?"" ""I have to fire people at work soon and you don't see me getting all emotional about it."" ""Do you get emotional like this a lot?"" ""Are you PMSing or something?"" I explained to him that it's really rude to ask someone if they're PMSing. I told him he was being condescending. I told him that I was having a normal emotional reaction to stress, and that it's okay to cry sometimes. I told him that if he put himself in my shoes, he'd understand what I feel, because that's what empathy is. He responded by saying ""I'm not being condescending. I'm a guy and guys don't do empathy, they just fix the problem. But your (N)mom doesn't even get this emotional. Our emotions don't swing around like yours. You are being REALLY emotional."" I had to spell out for him that his word choice and behavior were hurtful to me, and that he should at least acknowledge that and try to stop. He told me he can't help it because he's from New Jersey which made him naturally ""raw and honest."" And that he's my biggest fan; friends come and go, but my family will always be there. I'm proud that I stood up for myself, and can thank therapy for my ability to self-validate. But I still can't help but let his words get under my skin. I get lost in trying to absorb them. I don't understand why a parent would try to make a child feel crazy for being human. Obviously I am working on getting out of their house as soon as possible. And in the meantime, I am seeing my friends as much as possible (who are supportive and actually validate my emotions). Do you ever stand up to your Nparents? Does it ever have any positive results whatsoever?"
194,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Five years later,1,ahna1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ahna1l/five_years_later/,2019-01-20 03:03:45,"Hello everybody. I've been thinking about writing this for a while. ^(Context : I went NC with NMum, siblings and the rest of her family exactly five years ago. I'm still in touch with my dad and everything is well, he's been asked to answer that he doesn't know when asked about me. I was her first born, a brilliant student + pianist, which fulfilled her desire for success/power. I was expected to be the best, obey orders, take care of everything + everybody in the house (bc I was female, ha!). I had two golden brothers (while still bullied into fitting in, not hurting her ego etc could never be wrong + didn't have chores). Depressed dad was childfree, removed himself from the situation by never being available - they divorced when I was 14. He's better now.) ^(The violence I faced was sometimes physical (slaps, lots of screaming, pushing around etc) but mostly emotional. She stalked me (I had second secret accounts), read my diary (stopped writing), used my confessions against me (stopped talking), kept going in my room (starting using passwords, carrying stuff with me), pushed my friends away (she'd ridicule them), destroyed my projects (wanting to play the guitar, choosing a career in art...), lied about me to her friends and family (about how I treated her, didn't help around the house, etc). She also had) [^(incestual)](URL ^(behaviours (wanted to sleep in my bed, touch me, decide how I should look, always needed me to massage her, etc). I knew from age 8 that one day I'd leave the house forever. Being a sick, lonely minor without resources, I waited until I left HS to move and until I got my first job to go NC (she was to send me a monthly allowance she received from the govt for me but wouldn't if I angered her). From all that I developed an anxiety disorder (mostly gone, I just have grey hair as a reminder), depression (genetics, heh), a sleeping disorder (still kicking) and an eating disorder (again, mostly gone).) ~~^(The contextualization is now over.)~~ This post is about the tricks I learned over the years in order to make my situation more livable, to deal with narcissism without losing my mind, to remember why I had to stay NC when I had doubts, etc. Disclaimer : I'm not a scientist or a therapist, this is just a series of notions that are there to help victims. I'm not pretending it's true (the 'can't get better' part specifically), I'm saying it helps surviving abuse. (Disclaimer 2 : I'm french.) * See a narc like a sick person with symptoms. If someone is an asthmatic, you wouldn't get mad when they have an asthma attack and need to use their inhaler, right? A narc can not feel empathy. But instead of being surprised when facing someone else's weakness (think of Dexter or Sherlock's cluelessness), they are happy about it (ie [pervert](URL who will use the tools you hand them to destroy you). If you know that your narc has been, for example, mocking you when you've shown vulnerability, make it a symptom. Well of course they did. Of course the asthmatic friend having an attack used his inhaler. He's an asthmatic. *Of course my mother used a sad memory to hurt me. She's a narc. That's what they do.* You can't expect them to change. They can't get better. (Maybe they can with a lot of therapy, but the main issue is their huge ego, how would you get them to admit they have a problem? And see someone about it? Do you really want to try to go there, knowing that not only there isn't a lot of hope, but it's going to destroy you even more in the process? Is it worth setting yourself on fire to *maybe* warm someone else?) Stop being surprised when they do what you've known them to be doing. Stop hoping for progress. * No is a complete sentence. When they ask something or just act a certain way just to anger you, remove yourself from the situation by saying no and stopping there. By smirking, by asking why, by requiring reasons, by shouting, by calling others for help, they're setting an emotional trap. Because *whatever it is that you say, you'll be wrong*. They'll transform what you said to satisfy their fantasy and will, at the end of the conversation, still be convinced that they're right and you're wrong, because you haven't given them anything they weren't able to destroy. Just say no. Just get up and leave. You don't owe anybody shit, and if that means they're going to talk shit about you, be it! (PS : they're probably already doing it anyway). Don't fall in the trap. * A narc is what you make them. I've already mentioned that in the first part : in order to be able to hurt you, they need tools. You give them tools every time to show vulnerability, every time you forgive them, every time you try to get closer to them by admitting very personal stuff hoping they'll be nicer this time. It's a(nother) trap! Stop trying to humour them, stop explaining in detail how they managed to hurt you, stop answering questions (go for one-word answers), don't listen when they're shouting (try to remember the names of the ninja turtles in the meanwhile), don't try to prove them wrong using logic. It's not going to work. They are not trying to debate. They are not trying to make a point. They are not trying to have a polite conversation. *They are trying to troll you*. Treat them like you would treat the devil's advocate in a conversation about political issues. You nope, you laugh at them and you leave. *A narc is what you make them*. Stop giving them importance, and they will deflate and fly away. * One can have remorses. One can miss family celebrations, memories, members. One can have to deal with one of those ""family is above everything else"" people who can't admit that there are other truths. When facing doubt, I have two recommendations. Number one is that *you* *document what happened*. In detail. You write it down, you go back to it when you remember more, you get friends involved, you keep it safe. And you go back to it when you're unsure if you're been unfair or not. This is what your life was. Do you really want to go back there? Number two is that *you place that story in the mouth of someone you care deeply about*. Can be a friend, a celebrity, who cares? Someone you wish the best for. Someone you would never to be hurt. If all that stuff was to happen to them, what would you tell them? Would you say forgive and return to hell, or would you say forget and keep walking? I hope this will be helpful and wasn't too long. It's been flying in my head for a few weeks and needed to get out. If anyone needs more specific advice, make sure to dm me, I'm never very far. Good luck, my dears, you're doing well! "

I got that it meant to suppress them, but I didn't really grasp how that worked, or whether I was engaging in it or not. Now though, I think I was engaging in something along those lines. For years and years, I never let myself be vulnerable. Ever. Not when I was by myself, not when I was in public, and most certainly not when I was with family. Instead, I was always on guard. Always ready for a confrontation. Always strong enough mentally that I didn't have to back down from anyone or anything if I didn't want to. This meant that I never gave myself a chance to be weak. To be vulnerable. To just let my guard down mentally, and not be scanning for trouble and ready to verbally fight, or to not replay arguments in my head searching for weaknesses and refinements. It also meant there was no time to experience any emotions that would lead to me being weak and vulnerable. No time for sadness, real fear, or anything else. Just emotions to be covered by rage, hatred, anger, numbness, or displaced by a dull, emotionless void, ANYTHING where I retained some modicum of control. Primarily, anything that allowed me to avoid being vulnerable. Avoiding the emotions themselves, at least from my perspective, seems to have been incidental to that. It was okay, for instance, to feel some warped version of them while simultaneously mixing in copious amounts of anger. That meant I wasn't weak. That meant I could still fight back. But feeling just the emotions, without anger, would lead to vulnerability, which meant that I might lose an argument, and be manipulated by nmom into believing everything she said again, which might lead me down a rabbit hole where I believed that all this stuff about narcissists was just made up, and that I should hang on her every beck and call, and give up thinking for myself to follow her every opinion and idea. And I might never come back from that. So I always had to be ready to fight. Any vulnerability, I feared, would give nmom the path into my mind she needed to make me back into a good little golden child, or mere flying monkey, or empty mindless drone, or whatever she wanted. Something that wouldn't be me. Even after going to college for my first quarter, I was still always on guard. Always preventing myself from being vulnerable at any time. Recently though, I realized that I was safe. College is at least an hour's drive from home, and I can hide from nmom effectively if I have to. I realized everything I just wrote, and that I could let myself break down and feel those emotions. That I could let my mental shield fall by the wayside for a bit, and finally process the years of backlogged feeling. So I did, to a point. I let my shield down, and felt some of those feelings more than before. I feel like crying would help, but I still can't seem to do that. There's still work to be done there. I also still seem to go back to being overly on guard after having my little break-down time where I just lay in bed and let the feelings wash over me. I need to try and loosen up a bit at some point. I feel like I've let a lot of tension out though. Like before I did that, tension had been building for a long time, and every time I avoided vulnerability, I wound myself up that much more, like a spring being compressed closer and closer to its breaking point. Sorry that the format of this is a bit messy. Anyway, now that I've written all that out, what do all of you think? Am I misinterpreting something, or being melodramatic, or is this probably accurate? All comments are greatly appreciated, and thank you for taking the time to read this post."
196,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Reasons I was lucky to have an Nparent,1,ak8xnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ak8xnz/reasons_i_was_lucky_to_have_an_nparent/,2019-01-27 15:38:30,"1. **I'm paranoid.** I mean, I never post anything particularly private anywhere. My Facebook is almost entirely my puppy, trees, deer and birds. There are cute comments, but I grey rock the whole world because I grew up with a parent always trying to spy on me and constant flying monkeys. I never say a bad word about anyone, and am super aware of who might be listening to private conversations. Because of this, I have never in my adult life had a friend or acquaintance hear (or have misreprented) anything negative that I may have said. No one would believe it if someone said that I was shit-talking them. And although my social media seems to be a sincere window into my life - and to an extent is - I have never posted anything that a future employer or potential relation would reasonably find objectionable. 2. **I am brilliant at recognizing manipulation** Because of this I have been able to help steer friends through relationships with narcissists, and I have avoided a lot of traps myself. This one is double edged. If I ever wanted to be, I could be a master manipulator, which brings me to my next point... 3. **I am brutally honest with myself, so I do not become the monster that tormented me** I watch myself for manipulation, because I would be good at it, so I do NOT do it. It's like the talking shit thing, I'm very upfront with people about my motivations and any agenda. This means that every interaction I have (to my best ability) is transparent. People like working with me because they know exactly where I stand, and since I am brilliant at recognizing manipulation almost any transaction with me is fair. 4. **I see vulnerability and pain** Is there a guy harassing you at a bar, and everyone else thinks it funny? I see how uncomfortable you are. I will help you. Is a little kid honestly afraid in a shopping mall, I can tell the difference between that and a kid having a fit. Are you having the worst day of your life? I know and if I am in the position I will buy your coffee to make your day. I see all the pain I had when I was young, and do the things I always prayed someone would do for me. 5. **I can take any situation and get something positive out of it** I'm like a tree that grows where literally nothing else can. No moisture in the ground? I'll find moisture in the air. Atmosphere too thin? I can find oxygen regardless. My bike's tire popped, I was happy that it was close enough to home I could walk and that the bike mechanic patiently walked me through how to replace the tube. Bad date? I find a redeeming moment, or at least a good story. I am Miss Bright Side. Nothing can permanently hurt me, because I found resilience young. Something tried to crush me -- and did -- I. Got. Better. It. Got. Better. And if you are my friend, and you are suffering like you never have before, I will help you see past the horizon line to where the land is. I will get you home. There's more. I'm self reliant because no one was reliably there for me, independent because I don't like having people control me, and confident because I survived things at 10 most people would be afraid to face at 40. Am I happy I had an Nparent? That's not the title of my post. I said I'm lucky, the same way someone who gets a deadly disease and fights it off, and is able to have serum formulated from their antibodies. I'm lucky because now I'm immune, and I can help other people get well too. How are you lucky? How did you get that way? "

Cold, insensitive and unsympathetic. Accordingly, I tried to stick to dispassionate facts when recounting my history, including the time that my N-Dad had arranged for me (back then, f/25) to stay with his friend (m/40s, let's call him S) for a couple of weeks while I was waiting on keys for my new place. When we had almost arrived at S's house, N-Dad suddenly announced that he need to talk to me before we got there. He went on to calmly warn me that I should be on my guard, that I should avoid S when he was drunk, and that I should try not to be alone with S at all because he was known for 'being a bit handsy with women'. Having said that, he then concluded that if I was 'careful enough' and 'sensible' I would be 'fine'. With all my stuff in the car and already pulling up to the driveway, it didn't feel like I had much choice. After unpacking the car, N-Dad also took S outside for a private chat, where I overheard him warn S to not try anything with HIS daughter, before merrily leaving me alone with a sexual predator. Predictably, that night S ignored N-Dad's warning and sexually assaulted me. At that time I had no understanding of narcissism or psychological abuse, and I felt too ashamed of not being 'careful' or 'sensible' enough to tell anyone what happened to me. It was at this point that the thus far completely silent doctor stopped calmly taking notes, looked me in the eye, and said with genuine shock ""And your father just left you there?"" Well yes Doc, yes he did. Because 'helping' me was an irresistible opportunity to play the benevolent father at no cost to himself, to demonstrate his genius problem solving skills, and to control me in a moment of vulnerability all at the same time. And why on earth would he give up such a juicy morsel of narcissistic supply just to protect his child? Anyway, most importantly he had told S not to. So that would obviously be enough, because N-Dad's ego knows no bounds. It's only since that appointment a few weeks ago and seeing the expression on that doctors face that I have finally been able to admit to myself that what happened that night wasn't my fault. It's also the first time that I've been able to admit to myself that N-Dad leaving me there wasn't just misguided or naive - he knew full well what might happen, he just didn't care. "

I am not a therapist however i've discussed their behaviour at length with my T and he's made it clear my mother definitely has *something* going on and my dad too (but lesser degree). This speaks to my gut, as when i was little (eldest of 4 kids), i could sense that a lot of parenting duties lay on me. It was just a no-brainer and automatic. mum would be catatonically depressed, in bed all weekend sleeping, avoiding us, and i'd be trying to make do with little food and no supervision. &amp;#x200B; Fastforward and skip a lot of important points for brevity, i'm married and moved to another country 5 yrs ago. I've never been happier, yet i've also never been more vulnerable (emotional intimacy deep-dive with partner and 2+ yrs of weekly therapy). It feels amazing to not have to be 'the strong reliable one' anymore and let myself cry, feel, get angry. It honestly feels like a holiday for the little me inside - i can die happy! &amp;#x200B; Anyway, for context i want to rewind a moment. i moved out of my family home at 19 with $20 in my pocket. My nmom stole $1000 from under my bed (my younger sister told her it was there). I didn't let it stop me though my mother made it extremely hard to leave. Fastforward to today, i'm happy, i feel safe being far from them all, and they've kind of deleted any trace of me from their lives. All of their fb and sm profiles show nothing of me. And there's no more b'day messages every now and then, or calls when they need me to listen to their issues. It's bittersweet. I'm glad to no longer be the designated 'family therapist' (as it was exhausting and there was no room for my problems or needs), but, the last thread of what i had with them is obliterated and it makes me sad. &amp;#x200B; A year ago, my sister \[26\] (the one who told mother where the $1k was), visited me abroad. She brought a big photo book with her, it's one my former best friend gave to me after a trip overseas. I was never a big fan of the photos (as i was overweight and depressed after a sexual assault), but, my heart was warmed by the gesture of my ex-gay best friend. he really put time into creating the album and it must have cost a fair bit printing those photos too! Anyway when she brought it, i was touched and confused. She told me our mother recommended her bringing it to me. But, my nmother knew i hated those photos, i told her privately, due to the reminder of the rape. So when sis arrived with it, and my SO went through the album, i felt very, very vulnerable. He didn't make me feel bad in any way and just asked about the trip. But, my sister could see i wasn't that glad about it and said *'what - don't you like it?'* and i said ""i do but it reminds me of a very, very painful time in my life too, so it's confusing' and then she proceeded to flip-out *'great so i did the wrong thing. god \[my name\], i just wanted to do something nice, forget about it'.* So then, as usual, i had to soothe her. This is what my parents do too. You're not allowed to show emotions you're not allowed to be vulnerable or have your own anger, upset etc. your job is to always be ok. Even my dad has said this to me many, many times 'i need you to be okay'. They DON'T like vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; So after my sister just arrived, after not seeing her for years, she went outside of my house to smoke a cigarette. When i talked her down she came back in. Then we were having a few drinks and dancing, my SO was happy to see us both happy and watching tv. Then he says to me 'hey be careful with the noise' and points to downstairs. And my sister gets irritated, even though he did not say it to her, he said it to me, partner to partner. *There's a single mother downstairs with a young boy around 4 and it was around 1:00am.* Then, being sensitive about him having seen my 'fat photos', i got all in my insecurity, especially seeing my sisters reaction too. I was like 'what are you saying?' and he's like *'just keep the noise down babe, the baby downstairs you know'* and then my sister grabs my hand and it feels weird, like she looked at me as if he was the literal enemy. She was like in my ear saying 'what does he mean to say'? and then i took the bait and said to him 'are you saying i'm fat?' and she had her arms crossed waiting for his reply, and he laughed and said 'what!? no! babe, don't go too far...'. So my sister takes my hand and takes me to her outside smoking spot. She's like *'don't you EVER let ANY man make you feel unattractive!'* and i sit there in shock, watching this 'movie reel' that i rememebr SOOOO well from home dramatics with my parents, and inside i say **no. i am NOT doing this dance! Not in my damn house.** so i say 'hey \[sister name\], i just overreacted because i am sensitive that this is the first time he's seen my *bigger* photos from the past'. But she's not having any of it. she goes on and on how i am so beautiful and never should let anyone make me doubt it. And she throws in some jabs there too - backhanded coments like 'even when you are bigger you are beautiful!' and so on. &amp;#x200B; The next day, she wakes in a bad mood and because I'm not giving her the deep, intense, energy she wants, she flips out. My SO is there and hears and sees it all. She's literally screaming in the house, saying the same things she said last night like 'how can you let him speak to you like that' and i am absoliutely perplexed. She's making it out as if i am with an abusive, mean-spirited, callous man, when in actuality, he didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable by saying 'guys there's a kid downstairs you need to be quiet' so he directed it to me instead. &amp;#x200B; Maybe I am missing something, but i don't think I am. I think my sister, the one i trusted, the one i hoped would also break free, is actually too far gone and so alike our parents in fact, that she's mad I got away. I could be wrong on that conclusion of course, and i know she's hurting too and it's complicated and hard, but i really didn't like the way she brought her baggage here and attempted to dump it in our house. &amp;#x200B; To make it worse. She wanted to go to mcdonalds one day after shopping, i was broke (we're living paycheck to paycheck) so i said i'd come with her but i'd eat later at home and besides i am celiac (can't do wheat etc). She exploded again at mcdonalds because i wasn't giving her the level of communication she wanted. she bought a meal, and exploded and left it there uneaten. then she expected me to 'chase her'. Instead, i just let her go cool off or whatever, but honestly, i was crying and walking home thinking pleaaase, just leave. &amp;#x200B; When she left, a gift from my SO went missing. I got these beautiful pearl earrings from him that he sweat and saved for on minimum wage and then - gone. This is the second time it happened. First time was a few years prior when my watch went missing right after she left. &amp;#x200B; I didn't even have the courage to confront her after she was back home. I left it for 8 months. Finally one day when she sent a barrage of late night texts about a problem, i confronted her the next day. I told her how she treated me and my so was not okay and disrespectful and that i was aware that every time she came, something valuable and special of mind would go missing. She went silent and said a lot of abusive things and said 'we're supposed to be best friends' and i said bf's don't act the way you act. After that, she blocked me. So actually, i'm not NC with her. She's NC with me. &amp;#x200B; Anyway. With my family, it's such a tornado feeling, that in the moment, sometimes it can feel 'magical' and you can be charmed. They offer things at times like deep listening - but it's rare as rocking horse shit. So it's like this stockholm syndrome with constant baiting to excuse terrible behaviour. &amp;#x200B; I can't handle and don't miss the tornado. For them - arguing, screaming, swearing, abusing is the norm. and if you don't engage, they feel threatened. THIS is why I give up on the illusion that my siblings will 'get it'. It's a type of grief i never expected. But i accept it. &amp;#x200B; If there's anything anyone wants to highlight that i am missing or not getting please do. Sometimes being so close to it makes it hard to see. I could be seeing this wrong that's why i am checking. "
199,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"The need for rest, quiet and 'nothingness'",1,anu92a,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/anu92a/the_need_for_rest_quiet_and_nothingness/,2019-02-07 06:11:02,"This will be an odd post probably but I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced what I have. Basically I want to do 'nothing' a lot. And I don't *feel* depressed (plus I'm in therapy so I'd know if I was), but I do feel tired in my soul, and this 'rest' I've had since I met my SO 5 years ago feels like it makes sense, even if, from the outside, it doesn't make sense... &amp;#x200B; I can't blame my behaviour on my childhood but I wonder if it plays a role. I grew up in an extremely hostile, stressful house where my mother ran her daycare business from. Every day there were 5 to 7 children at the house, plus me, my parents, and my 3 siblings. It was beyond busy or hectic it was honestly incredibly stressful. &amp;#x200B; A lot of responsibilities fell on me when I was home from school, however I also had a ridiculous extracurricular schedule thanks to my nmom. I think she wanted me to be some kind of celebrity as i was enrolled in ballet, singing, acting, tutoring for classes and choirs and more. In childhood, I don't remember 'playing' that much. But I remember a looooot of rehersals, performances, practice and training. It was like, go to ballet in the morning, then school for 8 hours, then to a 2 hour swimming training session, then tutoring, then home, relate with family and siblings and possibly put them to bed, then i'd sleep. Often though, i'd be recruted to listen to my mothers complaints about my father (who gambled for a hefty period of time). I was her 'partner' emotionally and it was f\*cked. &amp;#x200B; Fast-forward to now, i'm 32. Between leaving home at 19 and now, i fought and hustled my ass off for freedom, independence and finances of my own. I still am not 'doing well' financially, but i'm also not in huge debt so that counts, right? I run my own business but it's a constant application and takes time. I have a lovely SO and he's exploring who he is (he's from a conservative country), I do therapy weekly and i try to take life one small bite at a time. But given the way i was raised, sometimes i can't help but think i am lazy. Some days i won't even go outside, I'll stay at home and work from there (it's winter here), and i'll just watch tv, tidy the house, do work and read on reddit. And I don't feel 'sad' with that, I feel good with that. &amp;#x200B; I have no other way to say what i mean other than I just like being in quiet, safe, peaceful places, and too much stimulation doesn't feel good to me. Before, when I moved out and was 19, the challenge of the big city and meeting lots of people was inviting - it was like channelling energy to a positive place. But now, I just feel like, I'd rather read books, 'be boring' as my nmom would call it, because ironically, i never get bored! i enjoy it! &amp;#x200B; Maybe i'm simply introverted, maybe i can finally be myself away from my nmom and the pressure for perfection. But I'm so far from who I was before, the stage, the performances, the feigned confidence and so on. I guess being raised in a dysfunctional house leaves little to no room for vulnerability - it's not safe. Though I do hope at some point, a bit of my bounce and energy comes back so I can enjoy some new things too. I also thought maybe it's down to the fact that now, my SO is my best friend. It just happened naturally and gradually. "

One instance of vulnerability. And when that opportunity arises, they will waste no time, striking immediately to destroy everything that I have built in one foul swing - and then I'll be captive again in that old, cold prison, reliving the biting shame, excruciating anguish, and dread of my failed and burdensome existence. There is a worldwide conspiracy against my personal happiness, because I am denied that privilege. Wherever I go and whatever I do, they're always watching, always lurking in the shadows. They see everything I do and they're already plotting the destruction. It would be better for the sun to swallow the earth than for me to have even a small success or moment of joy. They observe me as I scale the ladder, but only so they can get the perfect shot. Or at least that's how it always feels. Every success and moment of happiness I have are always plagued by the distant thought that, one day, all these things will be brought crashing down. It could be tomorrow; it could be in ten years' time. Soon that day will come, and they will shriek with laughter as the flames rise, and the smoke consumes the sky, filling my life with a blinding darkness, once and for all."
201,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Letter to Ndad - 6 months NC,1,a56mkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/a56mkq/letter_to_ndad_6_months_nc/,2018-12-12 00:05:26,"Letter posted at the end. I'm posting this here because I still feel like I'm struggling with the total lack of resolution I got from confronting the narcissist. I wrote a letter to him, but I'm not going to send it. **Background:** There was a series of incidents early this year where I'd calmly asserted my boundaries with ndad, and was surprised to be met with an acceptable response. Meanwhile his behaviour against my partner was getting more aggressive and ended with him trying to bully her at a cafe, with him throwing an aggressive tantrum involving a show of physical force and going off in a huff. &amp;#x200B; He didn't speak to me for days, giving me lots of time to google his behaviour. I pretty much had a full breakdown as I realised how much of his behaviour was abusive. It opened up a lot of confusing childhood pain, as I realised I was a scapegoat for his sensitivity. I used to stand up to him when I was 5 or 6 and he'd tell me I was too sensitive while he called me all kinds of horrible names and subject me to violent and humiliating punishment. Now when I think about a 40 year old man treating a 5 year old that way it makes me sick and I can never have a relationship with that man again. &amp;#x200B; All this was coming to the surface, and I was really struggling with the reality, but I knew our relationship was over unless he changed. I started by asking him to examine his behaviour and described to him how it is abusive. He put up a brick wall, and after a series of exchanges where he kept treating it as game, I broke contact with ndad, caling him ""an insecure loser who plays power games to assert your 'dominance' over other people and not the kind of man I want in my life"". I know that going NC was the best choice, but I've learned that you can't change other people, and wouldn't recommend putting narcissists in a corner or try to change them, as you'll be disappointed and it might make things harder in the long run. Ultimately there is no resolution with narcissists beyond learning to love and accept yourself the way you are, and focusing on other more fulfilling relationships. **Letter:** Dear Ndad, &amp;#x200B; I am writing to let you know that I do love you and I'm sorry that it's come to this. &amp;#x200B; The ferocity of the reaction you received has a lot to do with our history. Over the past few years I've witnessed you bullying E-Step-mum when you feel small, and you've even brought that out in front of My Partner's Parent. Now I've witnessed you bullying My Partner because you feel small, and that's where I draw the line. I realised that I've seen this behaviour time and time again and it revealed to me why you act the way you do. &amp;#x200B; Your behaviour is dictated by your emotions. Your needs come first, always. It's at best unsatisfying, and at worst downright traumatic to be around. That is why its called emotional abuse, and I don't think you're aware of it. You don't accept that other people have opinions or emotions that are just as valid as yours, you try to make other people feel small to make yourself better, and your behaviour is generally geared to making sure your needs are met at all times. It's as if you've skipped a key developmental stage in your life. &amp;#x200B; I recognise it because that's how I used to behave as a teenager before I learned to listen to and understand the origin of my emotions in order to regulate my behaviour. &amp;#x200B; I'm telling you this in the hope that it is of some use to you. You are a highly sensitive person, just as I am, but that vulnerability can be a real strength in relationships if you allow it. &amp;#x200B; I'm far from perfect, and I shouldn't have sent you those messages - you're not a loser - but unfortunately there is no trust left in our relationship. You'll never understand what you've put me through this year, or throughout the rest of my life, and I no longer wish for you to try. You have acted directly against my best interests too many times, and sadly that door is now closed. &amp;#x200B; I wish you and E-Step-mum all the best in your future endeavours, please love yourselves and each other with everything you have. &amp;#x200B; Kind Regards, Me &amp;#x200B;"

My mother isnt a narcissist (well I havent decided if I want to use that label) but shes emotionally abused me and my family for my entire life. I grew up in a pretty dysfunctional family. For a couple of years, there was a big conflict between my parents that led to a lot of shouting and slamming doors. I was around 7-9 when it started. I think it finally ended when I was 13 or 14. I always thought that dysfunction was normal for families and that everyone pretends to have a healthy home life. I thought it was normal for my mom to try and alienate me from my dad. So for the longest time, I thought that I grew up in a dysfunctional atmosphere and that I wasnt emotionally abused by my mother. I really dont want to believe it. It feels like the ultimate betrayal. I was never physically harmed (although at times I was afraid she would hit me). It was all emotional and verbal abuse that eroded my self esteem from the earliest age. I dont even know myself. All I am to her is a talking board that she can criticize whenever she wants. I dont know what I want out of life (other than to be happy). I have been gaslighted, mocked, had my emotions minimized, been publicly embarassed, and had my property taken away without my consent. Ive had lies spread about me, had sensitive information spread around, and been made to feel guilty for wanting things. I dont want to believe it. I grew up thinking this kind of relationship with your mother is normal. I thought every child got criticized and mocked. I thought every child was supposed to listen to their mother vent about her marital problems. I have fucked up expectations of what a marriage should be. I expect a divorce in my future if Im ever fortunate enough to get into a relationship with someone. Romance is a euphemism for servitude (I know its not, but its been ingrained in me). I never share my emotions or let myself get attached to people. I act like a parent to my friends but I never let them emotionally support me. Im accustomed to believing that if I do one thing wrong then I am a failure and dont deserve love. Im accustomed to believing that I dont ever deserve love. I fucking hate it. I hate being raised this way. I hate that I hate myself so deeply. I hate that my attachment style is fearful-avoidant because my mom never bothered to comfort me as a child. I would be berated for crying. I fucking hate it. The thing I hate the most is that there are moments where I genuinely enjoy being in her company. I have the belief that I can make her better (I cant) and make her see me as a person and not an object (impossible). I am so afraid of becoming like her because I can already recognize the signs. I can recognize how I minimize others issues. I recognize my victim complex. I recognize that I make others feel stupid during conversations. I dont want to abuse my future husband or kids. I want to give them a house full of love where they can be who they want to be (Im transgender) and do what they want to do. I dont want to believe that my mom fucked up my emotional development, but the evidence is there. Im so afraid of vulnerability that I dont want to post examples here, but I do have a list and it goes on for multiple pages. Ive posted here before and then deleted my posts because I rationalized everything away. I feel guilty even posting this on here. So Im kind of beat up right now. My therapist said that I need to reach out to others for support, but its so difficult that my mouth clamps shut and I cant make a sound. Im going back home for Christmas in a couple of days and I dont know how Ill handle it. Shes going to bring up my transness and ridicule me when I least expect it. Just a heart emoji is fine. I feel so alone right now. Anything would help. "

I'm not sure if my parents are truly narcissists, but for so long I've been so attached to a skewed version of my parents telling me that ""they love me"" when in reality, they assert a lot of control over many facets of my life. I've got the whole package here: anxiety, depression, low-self esteem. Passions and hobbies that I truly enjoyed such as drawing or sports were ridiculed by them and were taken away from me. Getting a Facebook in high school to connect to peers and study resulted in my parents refusing to acknowledge me for a solid week. When I had my first relationship in uni, they decided to micromanage every aspect of my relationship, and like every other time that I argue for leniency, I get slapped with the line ""our house, our rules, if you don't like it, then get out"". Their reactions to any of my relationships ended up with me getting more consistently yelled at, emotionally ruined. While, I toyed with the idea many times when I was at university, I had no form of transportation nor did I have a source of income (I had to eventually unlock my own debit card account when I ran away) because despite allowing me to go to driving school, they deemed that I would just drive recklessly and up their insurance rates. I've been in two relationships: in both of them, my significant others deemed me ""not ready for a relationship"" due to my complete dependency on them transportation-wise, financially, emotionally and mentally as well. Others argue that it's not a fair reason to get broken up with, but I can see why they would; they're not dating someone with a future....they're essentially taking care of a child. And in my weakest times of vulnerability, I would tell my parents that I've been broken up with and they would say these awful words of ""Where are your friends? See? Family is always going to be there for you."" It's been roughly 3 months since I've been broken up with my second ex, and it's really fucking tough. I lost the niche of friends that all ended up hanging out with my ex. I'm really learning about how painful it is to learn to be okay/comfortable with being by myself. I think things are getting better. I've been going to therapy, talking to a psychiatrist for meds, driving with my own car, sustaining a life on my own by living away with my parents. I'm still under 25, so I'm still maintaining the minimal of contact with my parents so I can reap the benefits of their insurance. I finally befriended a really great friend who encourages me to be more emotionally honest with those around me. And I think for once, I won't lose this friend because in the past, I feared any confrontation/serious conversation with my friends which resulted in me building up resentment that exploded into harsh words (from me) and hurt feelings (by both parties). My therapist is really helping me take small steps to be less afraid of serious conversations because not all of them will end up with me regretting being honest with my discomforts. I'm going to see my parents/family again for the holidays, but I know I'll be strong enough to withstand their harsh words. I still resent them for ruining some very important friendships and relationships I had, and maybe I won't ever forgive them; I'm definitely taking responsibility for hurting those around me, but I'm finally on a clear path of being the reliable, strong person I've always aspired to be. There's still a long road ahead of me. Thank you for reading this, thank you for being a source of comfort to me, Reddit. Hope everyone has a safe and happy holidays."

I need to vent. When I was still living at my Nmom's house, it was just her and my younger sister and I. My Nmom, using terms from a book about narcs, was somehow both engulfing and ignoring. She engulfed when you did what she wanted, or wanted to feel power - and she ignored when she didn't want to think about us. She kept me very isolated. Whenever I made a new friend, she would accuse me of developing an attitude, disrespecting her and her rules (which were constantly varying to meet her current wants), and would tell me I wasn't acting like myself. So, with each new friend I made, came a horrible power struggle. I made about one friend every year, and usually that friendship would end within one to two years. She would scream at me, instigate fights and egg me into fighting. She would abruptly create strict rules that I had to adhere to, or else I would have ""privileges"" taken away or get grounded. Constantly changed goal posts. She wouldn't rest until all of my ""privileges"" were gone and I was stuck at home with her beside her. Every time. I fought back a lot. I had a strong sense of justice as a kid, and knew that my Nmom was a batshit power-tripper. First, no going out to see my new friend/s. Once I was stuck at home, then no computer - she would bolt down the stairs to the computer and take the internet cord, run upstairs and hide it somewhere (later in highschool I would just find it and put it back before she got home, or some bold moves - would still use it when she got home). She would tell me I wasn't allowed to be ""antisocial"" and go online - though online was the only place I ever got a taste of a social life. Eventually I'd end up stuck beside her on the couch, watching whatever TV she wanted to watch, listening to whatever garbage she felt like shoving down my throat. ""See? Don't you feel better when you're not on the computer all the time?"" I was horribly anxious in highschool. I couldn't speak - I would freeze up when people spoke to me. I made friends with the worst people to befriend. They seemed to pick up on my vulnerability. Eventually by grade 10 I didn't care anymore and didn't even try making friends. Then I entered an abusive relationship with my firsf boyfriend, but that's another story. "

Now Im faced with them and I just have vague memories of being alone in dark rooms in the house by myself a lot like from day to nightfall. I can see this pattern play out on its own in my adulthood in ways and from what Im told of my family forgetting or leaving me alone with my older sister or under porches in ditches, and in general not allowing me to leave the house or be with friends and beating me then leaving me to cry myself into night time in bed. I feel stained like Ill always be alone its hard to relate even in relationships. I was always social fun loving but have been punished by family for it shipped to boarding school in Mexico and literally had my life and social life taken apart and future prospects sabotaged. Everyone kept saying Im young I can start over and meet new people and forget it all and then theyd take from me saying Im young I can recover. No one ever listens when ur saying stop no Im me and this all matters to me this is my time leave me alone let me be me.

I was an intellectual student interested in building my art portfolio, I was a prize artist voted by peers at a good school, I was into philosophy and very smart just rebelled against my familys lifelong g abuse and oppression which resulted in them sending me to Mexico to be tortured for a scam boarding school and then for years after they sabotaged my attempted to escape and succeed or work and save up and also have lied and hospitalized me which only triggered my ptsd until I was thrown out. My mom hyperextended my thumb so I cant even draw anymore. I waste my days doing nothing. All my life they turned me against people I loved and friends so now its just a lonely life. My days of wanting to create and make art and learn and further myself or earn a degree are long gone all for their validation and approval. Mom are you happy yet?"
208,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Generally good mother with narcissistic tendencies. Looking for advice,1,a95b3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/a95b3j/generally_good_mother_with_narcissistic/,2018-12-25 01:16:54,"My mother genuinely loves me very much and did her best to be a good mom. In most respects, she is awesome. She always made sure I had everything I needed and most of the things I wanted. As a young adult she (with my dads money) supports me financially. In terms of my education and life skills, I was definitely set up to succeed. Because of this, I have a hard time making sense of the more toxic aspects of her behavior, of which there are many. My mother is a functioning alcoholic who cannot own that her addiction and its behavioral changes lead to most of our family problems. Because of her alcoholism, shes a horrible communicator. We hardly talk about real problems in our lives and even when we get along our relationship is superficial at best. She hasnt worked in ten years (before that she had a career). She always has some excuse, but the truth of it is that she thinks shes too good for any job shes actually qualified to get. Before this period of unemployment she would work at places for a few months or a year before being fired, I think because she probably caused a lot of drama and/or sucked at her job. A lot of my moms insecurity seems to come from the fact that she knows deep down that her life is very unfulfilling. She is devastatingly insecure and will start drama over a perceived slight that really came from nowhere. She is profoundly passive aggressive, so usually our conflict involves me being horribly stressed and uncomfortable for hours or weeks because I can tell she is mad until she inevitably blows up, says horrible things, and starts screaming. She is incapable of producing the level of healthy vulnerability and discussion required to maintain a relationship. I am always stressed and fearful of upsetting her and often feel like she is looking to take something I say the wrong way. Shitty little comments and looks here and there have an amazing ability to destroy any family function for me. Its the worst when shes drunk. She treats me setting boundaries as a personal affront and stomps right over them. Whether its regarding my health issues, my struggles with college, or me telling her she is making me feel bad, she minimizes and invalidates me repeatedly, often with a hefty side of gaslighting. When I told her last night that I had a right to politely ask that she not grab my wrist tightly while crossing the street, she said Im your mother, its not like I abused you. She will offer to buy me clothes but only because shes embarrassed by the ones that I wear (Im punky and shes an upper middle class white lady). She picks friends of mine to randomly not like (sometimes its because they are openly gay or clearly lower class, other times its because they dont do anything ie dont have professional careers which btw neither do I). She helicopter parented me for my first two years of high school and made it hard for me to have a social life at times. She certainly has never modeled a healthy relationship. This all matters because I believe it really formed the person I am today. From a young age I have let a lot of toxic relationships go on for far too long because I was bad at boundaries, leading to compounding trauma. I live in extreme fear of conflict or disapproval. I have a victimhood complex and often make excuses for my shortcomings. These things are huge struggles for me in young adulthood. Going no contact isnt an option I want to pursue yet, but Id like to do something about this given that my mothers past behavior is really shaping my life in the present tense. Im tired of being manipulated. Im struggling to understand my mother given that a lot of our relationship is good. "

My whole life my mother has abused me. Through my twenties I was groomed to never betray her. I paid to have a new roof put on her house. Paid to have the house painted. Paid the have the house renovated and a new bathroom put in. Throughout my childhood I was not a boy, but a man child. I was always doing something evil. I was thrown out on Christmas Day when I was 12 years old for not changing my older brothers nephews diaper as my older brother was 12 when I was born and was made to change mine. Fast forward. Around 30 I began to wake up. I had panic attacks and CPTSD. I began to work on myself and break free. I became my own person. A man. But to my mother, I was crazy. She made sure to influence my siblings. Back in 2015, I became ill as I moved down from NY and had a mold infested apartment that debilitated me. For almost a year I was sick. I reached out to my mother as I had no one else at the time when I entered the hospital. When I got out of the hospital that is when all hell broke loose. My mother had cleared my apartment. Wouldnt allow me in her house. I couldnt wrap my mind around it. The cops did nothing. I didnt know what to do. I was so worn down from the hospital. My mother took my vulnerability and exploited it. She made sure to tell everyone I was crazy. Then she started calling the cops. She refused to tell me where my things were for more than 2 days and I snapped and threw water at her.. I couldnt handle her taking control of my life and the cops told her to tell me where my things were.. She called the cops then had me thrown in jail. She left me there. Never being in trouble with the law I was having seizures. I was in jail for 30 days.. lost everything. A friend who was looking for me bailed me out. I couldnt think. I didnt know any phone numbers and last my friends knew I checked into the hospital. For 5 months she kept the charges going. She was going to show me to never live my life again. She ended up getting a restraining order, where she knew I had nothing due to how I was made out to be.. The judge told her to take my 2 dogs. The only thing she knew I loved more than anything then she gave them away. Separated them. That was this past May, 2018. I have been sick. I have migraines. It eats me alive to know all I have worked for is gone and she is living with all of my beautiful things and more than anything my dogs are gone.. not just mutts but a beautiful show dog and a rescue. Well behaved, so loving... Today I called and said I trusted my mother with my life. I am a grown man and she took my vulnerability and used it to destroy me. The cops told her to tell me where my property was and give my keys back to my place. Today I sleep on an air mattress. She has been charged with child abuse and neglect from when I was a child. I am telling the truth. I sobbed. I have not been able to cry since I went to jail. I have been numb. I told victim services I am a grown man and could never hurt anyone more than I hurt. My mother is who she says I am. I am an adult male who was a victim of his adult mother. It took every bit of courage I had... "

Since I was a very young child I remember not liking her, at all. She was mean, spanked me, I remember her being cruel to me. When I was a tween things got much worse, I was grounded, I wasnt allowed to have fun like normal tweens would. I was mostly locked at home, didnt have many friends, didnt go to parties. Nmom turned my adolescence into hell. When I was a young adult Nmom was even worse, I started discovering the world and myself, making new friends, living new experiences. Nmom hated it and was even more controlling than ever. I didnt trust her anything, I never talked to her about anything. When I think of the past I try to remember the best (when shes not there). I see my friends being happy with their normal mothers and I just cant relate. To be honest, I dont think I know the feeling of having a mother. Worst part is that sometimes I needed someone, there, in that empty space. Even tho Im 24, some days I need someone to hold my hand when Im scared, to stroke with my hair when Im sad, to tuck me into bed when Im tired, to listen to me when Im stressed. And honestly at times it was only me to me. And sometimes I see older female figures come into my life, hoping to find Her, my real mom. Someone who can take care of me and make me feel loved and who I can trust, someone who can comfort me when Im troubled. I hate that feeling of dependency and vulnerability, I feel like independence is a bit too much for me at times. Does anyone have any advice to stop looking so desperately and learning to live with that empty space? "

My dad, totally vacant. Never stuck up for me, never will. I find myself always slipping in to habits that enable her narcissistic personality and leave feeling totally depressed. Recently I called... It must be that sixth month mark. When recovering from addiction they say watch out for the 6 and 12 month mark... I don't know why I would think she's changed. ""You should have kept your job at Woolworths then you'd be able to move to the UK."" That was ten years ago. I want to backpack, not relocate to the UK (parent's country of origin, oldest brother lives there). ""That was ten years ago. Even when I had two jobs and pulling in $1000/wk you didn't support me at all. I had a $15000 car loan and not one clue."" ""Oh, I don't remember that..."" ""We would just go shopping because you wanted company and I didn't have any executive functions."" ""Oh, I don't remember that."" I can't filter out the things she says. I feel like I have to stand my ground. Watching YouTube this morning, I was reminded about grey rocking. I don't think I've even tried it. If anything I wanted to post the video ""Ten things toxic parents say..."" Anger, even if passive, is still the wrong kind of vulnerability. Not being heard after being so hurt makes me feel like a grey rock indefinitely. She gossiped to me about one of her friends who is really hard on her 15yo son. She does all the things to her son that my mum did to me, just in a different fashion. After saying all these wonderful things in favour of the young man she then says me ""it's hard having a baby at 36, I should know. It's not easy."" She was referring to me, while talking to me. Any empathy she had for this poor boy who isn't even allowed to walk 50m down the road alone was stricken from the record when she worried about the most superficial element of the situation; sharing it with me like I'm her father. In the past when I might let her know her comments are a bit on-the-nose: Do you mind?! Am I really the person to share that with?! ""You are so sensitive!"" So I don't say anything and allow myself to be vulnerable to a leopard that won't change it's spots. I had moved to Cairns - had to fight and argue to justify moving away to improve career prospects for my chosen path in tourism. 2 years later, I made a tragic error in judgement when I was 25. I called her about a relationship breakdown and needing to move out (just talking) and a new job starting she says: ""sounds like you're chasing your tail. Don't you think you should come home?"" And I did. Four years ago now. I was/am emotionally stunted. No/low self-esteem. So I didn't give a single thought to the 2 years of effort I had put in, abandoned my belongings and left. I had one friend there - the one who wanted me out of his house. When I told him I was leaving it was like he knew I was making a mistake; I could see it on his face. He was exhausted by my codependency and was relieved to not have to support me anymore. If I was a genuine person he may have. Coming home at the age of 25 was the worst mistake I've ever made. The last 4 years have felt like a 19yo trying to get life on the right track. Can barely hold a job. My brother is trying to start a business and I need to write the business plan but I can't get to it without cleaning my house first, which I also can't do because somewhere in that four years I started hoarding and now I have to deal with it. I just pace around my house talking to myself trying to process. Sometimes for hours at a time. Reading the internet is about all I can manage, often for hours and hours at a time. I have had a friend or two be able to provide support and hear me out; but when it came to being physically there... Especially to help with the hoarding... No. Nothing. I don't have any friends here. I'm terrified to ask my family because they'll say ""you know what you should do?!"" I'm not allowed to have emotional needs. Material is manageable, though. Not that I need it. I want no contact but I need to hold out so I can get my British passport renewed. I can't do that until I have money. I need my Aussie passport too, need money. I've always wanted to travel - it was the one thing I always talked about growing up but it threatens my mother's self esteem, so I wasn't allowed to go. I'm the kind of person that really does need other people - share insight, opinions, conversation. I adore constant change and thrive on it. I know who I am through other people and experience. Not a bad thing, but so hard if you have no baseline self respect or esteem. Impossible if you were raised to be an employee of a narcissist. Now I'm 29 and the prospect of getting a job, saving, backpacking is not impossible but the timing is so tight that it might be. I gave my life to be my own mother's father. I don't even feel bad about being mostly a drug addict anymore. That's what my life was set up for. "

As the title suggests, it's ""Narcissistic rage"". Had a google and one site defines it &gt;Narcissistic rage can be defined as intense anger, aggression, or passive-aggression when a narcissist experiences a setback or disappointment, which shatters his (or her) illusions of grandiosity, entitlement, and superiority, and triggers inner inadequacy, shame, and vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; It also gave examples/scenarios of narcissistic rage. &gt;1. The narcissist doesnt get his or her way, even when its unreasonable. &gt; &gt;2. The narcissist is criticized in some way, even when the critique is made diplomatically, reasonably, and constructively. &gt; &gt;3. The narcissist isnt treated as the center of attention, even when there are other priorities. &gt; &gt;4. The narcissist is caught breaking rules, violating social norms, or disregarding boundaries. &gt; &gt;5. The narcissist is asked to be accountable for his or her actions. &gt; &gt;6. The narcissist suffers a blow to his or her idealized, egotistical self-image (such as when being told he will not be given exception to the rule, or be granted special treatment). &gt; &gt;7. The narcissist is reminded of his or her charade, manipulation, exploitation, inadequacy, shame, or self-loathing. When I read these, I was just gobsmacked.

213,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,[TW physical abuse] When the golden child shows their true colours,1,9xq2co,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9xq2co/tw_physical_abuse_when_the_golden_child_shows/,2018-11-17 07:49:50,"So, both my parents have been in hospital this last month, largely due to alcohol induced problems. During this period, Nmother has been saying to my younger brother (the golden child) that she's frightened I'll come in and yell at her. This is because she knows I'm the only person in the family able to get real with her about the drinking. (She's still repeatedly telling everyone, including the doctors that told her how bad her liver function is, that she's not had a drink in months and that she doesn't need rehab. Sure, Jan.) I have very little time for my mother, as she was abusive to me for most of my upbringing and even now is desperate to hold onto me because she thinks I'm going to 'leave' her. (I left home mostly permanently around two years ago for grad school.) I have profound mental health issues that have nearly ruined my life on multiple occasions, mostly due to the trauma of my formative years. She's also the reason my dad's in hospital in the first place: she was informed a couple of years ago, after he had a series of strokes, that he couldn't be allowed to be around alcohol and needed to stop smoking and cut his cholesterol. She ignored this, and for the last six months has been ignoring me telling her that my dad's lost weight, seems slow and is clearly physically worsening. I was proved right when the doctors told me that he's probably declined enough to develop vascular dementia at the age of fifty four. So, despite the fact that I *detest* my mother, I've been visiting and helping get the house sorted (despite it being disgusting and a cause for concern to the nurses my dad now needs). I've been having to talk to my brother a lot, who is generally an avoidant motherfucker, and refuses to see that my mum is the evil narcissist abuser she is. He's been continually lecturing me about being nice to her. I've ignored it. Now begins the saga. Earlier this week, my mother got transferred to a different hospital. My brother, the denial-ridden creature he is, tried to tell me that she was improving and better in of herself. Ohhh, no. When I visited, the bitch was confused and delusional (and her usual bitchy self to boot), and the nurses could only tell me that it was being investigated. Cue me telling my brother that this is the case, and that sorting out their finances is going to be harder as she isn't of sound mind. He, naturally, denies it, just like his stupid mother. (If in doubt, both of them will respond to something they don't want to hear by shouting 'shut up shut up shut up' like the children they are.) I mention the fact that my mother refuses to accept treatment for alcoholism, which the social worker described as essential to making sure my dad doesn't get any sicker. He starts off telling me to stop 'having a go' at her. (Classic misdirection when he hears something he won't accept.) I respond, telling that 'she's ruined my life, and *I* have it in for her'. And this is where the fun begins. We are from a fairly well-off family, and have our university educations and living costs paid for by a trust left by our paternal grandfather, which our mother has nothing to do with. My brother tells me that I can't have had my life ruined, because I'm at a top university and have a trust fund. Now, this is exactly the rhetoric my mother has always used. ""I'm not abusive, I drive you to school."" ""I pay for your clarinet lessons, so I can punch you in the head if you play the clarinet wrong."" (She doesn't play an instrument, and I had my grade 8 by 18.) Etc, etc. I remind him of the abuse I suffered at home while he was at an expensive boarding school, and the damage it did to my mental health. He repeats that I have a trust fund (not in the way he thinks), and that mum has 'always given you money'. I remind him of the daily bullying that he didn't see, of the times she told me to die when I was sixteen and vulnerable, the way she beat me. He responds: 'she's sick, if you're keeping on with this I don't care'. I, of course, have to poke the snake, and keep pushing him about why it's so unfair that I 'have it in for her'. He snaps, telling me that she's frightened I'll have a go at her, telling me I'm 'so aggressive' about her. So far, he's not gad any rebuttal to the abuse I suffered. After a short debate about her culpability in her own and dad's illness, he tells me: 'You know, I work with people who are on minimum wage and have debts bigger than that trust fund. And you say your life's been ruined'. By this stage, I'm furious, and I inform him that life is more than a trust fund, and he responds 'your life is far from ruined'. I go off for a long period explaining in more detail the shitty state of my mental health, more than anyone in my family knows -- a moment of extreme vulnerability. And then I do the unthinkable: I call her a narcissist. He ignores *everything* I've said about seeing a psychiatrist, about the flashbacks, about the constant fear, and gets *incandescently* angry about me calling her a narcissist. He says 'she's not a narcissistic \[sic\] in any way', and then tells me off for 'talking down to him'. At this point in the conversation, he tells me to fuck off, and leaves me in a state of disbelief. My brother watched me at weekends being beaten, being threatened with a knife, having my diary read by my mother... He watched her smash a hole in my door to get into my room to hit me in the middle of the night. He watched her drag me across the floor by my hair because she decided that I must have failed an exam I took that day. (I hadn't, for the record.) But he has *nothing* to say about the abuse I suffered. For hours I felt devastated. I was amazed. I started to doubt everything I'd experienced. He'd successfully gaslit me like my mother always did. But after a while, I've realised exactly what the deal is. He's just the product of my mother. My partner read the messages and said he types exactly like my mother. And now, I'm about out of sympathy for him. Now, my brother is a bright kid. But mum brought him up as the 'nice one' and me as the 'clever one'. And he's never learned a work ethic. I'm in the second year of my PhD at a top British university. He's nearly failed out three times from his very-low ranked university. He has always been jealous of me, and blames me for his lack of success. He's constantly in denial, unable to handle anything emotional, always flying off the handle at tiny things. And he's slavishly devoted to that woman. He's been texting me since then, trying to act like nothing happened, and trying to pass all the responsibilities for handling out dad's care to me. Carers call? He passes them to me. Electricity fails? He tries to make me leave work to make the call he's free to make. Incredible."
214,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My parents (47/49) hate my (21) girlfriend (21) and playing diplomat is driving me crazy,1,9y38ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9y38ko/my_parents_4749_hate_my_21_girlfriend_21_and/,2018-11-18 15:38:36,"(Also posted in r/relationships, was reccommended to post here as well) My parents and I have had a strained relationship my whole life largely as a result of any struggle with my mental health. Not that I'm crazy, but I have depression and anxiety and I am not the best at handling it, mostly because it isn't something my family is comfortable discussing. In high school I briefly tried to get help through therapy and medication, but it didn't help because my parents basically grounded me while this was going on. All of this culminated in a screaming match with my mother where I ended up telling her that she was making my depression worse. After that point they backed off, but I stopped going to therapy and taking my meds, partly because I seemed to be improving, and partly because we just went back to not talking about my mental health. Freshman year of college, I tried to reach out to her in a moment of crisis, and she basically told me all my issues were my fault (I may have had some blame for my lot at the time but there was also a lot I could not control). I was going to tell her that I had been sexually assaulted a month prior during that phone call, but her reaction to my other issues made me hold my tongue, as I felt she was likely to blame the victim. I feel like my mom wanted to just ship me off to college once I graduated so she could just tell herself I was doing fine, and her decision to force me into college has been a point of contension for me over the past few years. While ""away"" (about an hour and a half from their house) at college, I started therapy again and met my girlfriend ""Nicole"", and that's where the story really starts. Nicole and I have been dating for over two years, met my parents within the first month, and for the first year and a half of the relationship, it seemed as if my family had accepted Nicole into the dynamic. Here's some things you should know about Nicole. Nicole identifies as genderfluid, and likes the term ""girlfriend"" but other than that prefers gender neutral language. This isn't particularly relevant to the story, just to the storytelling. Nicole is also a highly passionate person who is not afraid to defend their beliefs, which is the main thing I love about them. Nicole is also from a state on the other side of the country, but due to strained familial relations and financial conditions stays in my state most of the year. This all started last march over sping break, when Nicole accompanied me on a visit to my parent's house. My dad, Nicole, me, and my brother (16) (side note, brother is trans and parents refuse to acknowledge it but that's a whole other issue) had lunch at a resturaunt, where the topic of triggered jokes came up. Disagree with me how you will, but I don't laugh at trauma. My father, brother, and Nicole all agreed that those kinds of jokes were not funny. It seemed pretty clear to me. Later that night, my family is trying to pick a movie to watch together. My brother, father, and Nicole were in the room with me for the selection process. My father suggests a movie that deals with sexual assault. As Nicole has personally been the victim of sexual assault in the past, they asked to watch something else. My dad then made a triggered joke. Normally, I would just brush this off as different humor styles. But the fact that this happened right after we had all agreed that those jokes were cruel and not funny really got to me and Nicole. Nicole and my father then ended up in a verbal altercation, and I found myself trying to mediate (my go-to in stressful situations). My mother then came into the room and without even knowing the situation, joined my father in yelling at Nicole, who had to leave the room to cry. The gist of the argument was my parents telling Nicole they were being too emotional and unreasonable, and Nicole trying to defend, as I tried to get them to understand why Nicole was upset. Things were tense for the rest of the night, and we all hung out separately until bed. The next morning before Nicole and I left to drive back to the apartment we share, my mom asked me to go on a walk with her. She told me she had found a six month old tweet on Nicole's account to the tune of ""my relationship with my family is bad and so I have to ruin my boyfriend's good family dynamic so I can have him all to myself."" I asked for a screenshot of the tweet, and it still has not surfaced (not like I asked more than once though). The thing is, if that tweet exists, my mom would have had to mine for it, as Nicole tweets a few dozen times a day and things get buried fast. My mom also told me that Nicole was a selfish, rude, and cruel person who wants to isolate me from everybody and keep me in a little box. She told me that she's ""been around the block"" and ""knows how these things go"". Her manifesto was basically ""Nicole is evil and wants you to be a subservient slave, and I can see this because I am older and wiser than you, silly little boy who knows nothing about human relationships"" I feel like this isn't as much about Nicole, but it has rather become a proxy conflict about my own emotional vulnerability. My mom is very tough, and has the idea that because I am more gentle and empathetic, I am weak and nave. Since that conversation, Nicole has become a taboo subject between me and my parents. Mentioning their name is a great way to get any subject dropped. Communication was low before this, and worse now. Nicole wants to be on good terms with my parents again, but I know neither of them wants to apologize. Even if they did, my parents would say something to the tune of ""I'm sorry you got offended"" but an apology in passive voice isn't apology at all- it's condolences and it's bullshit. I don't know what to do here. I value my relationship with my parents, and my brother is one of the most important people in my life. But I also need them to respect my relationship with Nicole, who I consider a crucial part of my life. But how can they respect that relationship if they don't respect my autonomy? How can I make this situation okay between two parties who don't want to give the other any ground? Nicole and I would prefer to spend Christmas together, but I feel like that's not an option because no matter where we go, it will be a problem with my parents. Tl;dr: My parents hate my girlfriend as a result of an argument six months ago over trauma and jokes. I am becoming increasingly frustrated by this feud as it is making it difficult to keep both parties involved in my life, and I am looking for advice on how to make amends between two parties who don't want to apologize to each other "

Let your daughter breathe."

I wrote some of mine down, recognized so many ways I was trying to make less of things. And to many extents, my mom is a walk in the park compared to what I read on here. She has a heart. She's just spent so much time convincing herself what a terrible person she is that now she believes it, and that's all she is. &amp;#x200B; Anywho. Was (Am still, I guess) supposed to go to the West Coast (US) for my cousin's girlfriend's baby shower. My aunt is hosting and could use support. But I just saved up 2 weeks of PTO for a trip to Europe. And I made damn sure I had a good time. But that took reallll work, considering how miserable my mom was. Every. Single. Day. In a beautiful, food-filled, sun-filled foreign country that we used to live in. No nostalgia, no joy. After committing to the baby shower, and thinking ahead to Thanksgiving and Christmas, I had to ask myself.....why? Why am I taking my time for this? A weekend? Sure. I waste plenty of those. I'll give those to my miserable parents. Not a lot of them, but a couple here and there. But my hard-earned time off? When I want to be taking a break from the stresses of work? Why the fuck am I wasting that on people who only seem to be comfortable when everybody is silent and/or miserable? I love my dad, and I love my mom, but I asked her to leave him years ago. He is a rock. He sits still and would be content doing nothing for the rest of his retired life. Give him a wheel to run on (or not, he won't care), and he won't notice if you call or not. But my mom has life and curiosity and interest in her. Or she did. Now...... &amp;#x200B; I called her after my uncle dropped me off today. Asked if everything was okay this weekend. Asked if she thought yesterday was normal, because I thought it was weird that we almost literally didn't talk all day. She thought that was fine. We used to spend 1.5 hours on the phone. And she thinks it's normal to go an entire day without making eye contact or talking. I tried to explain how frustrated I was, because for me, a relationship is one with emotional connection and vulnerability, and I was having trouble doing any of that with her. She called me emotional, said she couldn't talk with me shouting at her, and said she couldn't talk about it. I said I was here when she was ready. She told me not to hold my breath. &amp;#x200B; I have no idea if she and her acquaintance are still coming down in 2 weeks for a Christmas fair. I have a feeling she will, and will pretend like things are okay, talk to me about it, without really saying or meaning anything. Although, when she finds out I cancelled my flights out West....which she will once I tell my aunt....I guess I'll see. &amp;#x200B; But my time is valuable. I'm not going to waste it on people who aren't interested in anything that I'm interested in. That's just silly. "

I'm an intelligent person, and feel fairly strong and resilient inside. But on the outside, I am a timid personality, who will put everyone else's needs before mine, will barely have a presence, and no demands from the world. It has become a theme in my life for people to tell me personally and professionally that I am meek, a pushover, not assertive, a follower etc. Success at work eludes me. My husband is contemplating leaving me; even though ""I am such a nice person"", he just doesn't love me. I'm afraid that over the years, I have withdrawn much of myself from the world to minimize vulnerability, and I've only focused on pleasing others and lost myself somewhere along the way. Looking for advice on how I can dig myself out of these (somewhat true) labels and have a fresh start. I have no support network, so I really need to become a better version of myself. "

I dont know if ill ever have the courage to send it, but ill always have this to pull myself back down, to reaffirm my emotions and actions. It just felt good to get it out. I wouldnt be the person I am today if it wasnt for you. Because of you I am the strong, resilient, level-headed, kind, capable human being that I am. I learned how to be empathetic, to love, to care, to be kind, to be patient, to hurt, to understand, and to forgive. I couldnt have learned it all without you. You showed me what life looked like when you lost the game, when you failed in all aspects possible- as a dad, as a husband, as a son, as a businessman, as a friend, as a neighbor, like I said, all aspects possible. You showed me how much power we hold as emotional humans, and how much pain we can cause with that power. You showed me what it felt like to feel so alone and so hopeless, you showed me what the darkest depths of depression looked like and because of that I learned sympathy and kindness so that anyone who felt that kind of pain didnt have to be alone, that I could be there for them so that they wouldnt have to feel what I did, because no one should have to. You showed me what love should never look like, and how important the welfare of the human soul is. You taught me how important it was to show people you loved and cared for them, and that even the smallest of my actions had the potential to hurt others, and I never wanted to ever do that to anyone the way you did. You showed me to never settle, you showed me what could happen to someone when they lived a life they hated, and I thank you for that. I spend my days actively looking for happiness in human connection, the natural world, music, literature, and even though I never really find anything that sticks, I am still glad to be restless rather than complacent. You showed me how important it was to be healthy. To always take care of your body, and you showed me what it looked like when you didnt. I dont know why your obligated friends (employees) encouraged you to pursue such habits. Youd come home from holiday parties with case after case of Johnnie Walker, and youd brag about how expensive they were and how everyone loved you so much they would just give you such lavish bullshit. You drank yourself into oblivion, to a point where someone else came and took your place. You went from harmless incompetent narcissistic egotistical bastard to crazed wide eyed psychotic sadist. Nothing was your fault during these times. You loved the taste and feeling of scotch but I think what you loved most was its forgiving nature. It was there for you when no one else was, it would hug you close and ease your pain. You got to go on a vacation while your doppelganger took your place. The things you did to me, the things you said, I wont ever really know if you were even aware of them. Alcohol turned you into someone I didnt know, and it turned me into someone you hated. Youd take your belt off and youd beat me until I couldnt move, and then youd lash my hands together to the frame of the bed. I couldnt find you in your eyes so Id just close mine and count. You never remembered what happened when you were drunk. Youd come home the next day and talk to me with such normalcy and happiness in your voice that I became certain the true you became prisoner as soon as you drank, and your pain and sadness crippled you and you werent yourself when you drank. Your liver thanked you a decade later with yellow eyes and a tired face. The smell of tobacco still makes me sick. You would chain smoke in the house and I grew to hate that smell. I remember tying old t-shirts around my face while doing homework so I wouldnt have to smell that shit. I still cant stomach that smell, cause all I can think about is when youd come into my room to lecture me, yell at me, fight me, beat me, or mess with me and youd always sit in that blue chair first and youd smoke and that smell would stick to me to my hair to my skin and I could see that ember glowing and I remember your brow. You looked happy, I remember your eyes had this sadistic glow to them. Youd walk over and keep talking, and youd eventually reach down and grab my arm and I would struggle but Id never scream because I knew J was in the room over and I didnt want him to be like me. I didnt want him to be anxious and depressed and suicidal, I wanted him to have a normal life. Even if that meant his entire world would be a facade. I decided early on for him that ignorance was bliss. So I never made a sound, Id just struggle. And I was strong but you were stronger, so youd just press that ember into my arm and youd keep it there, as if it was some kind of game to you. Then you would use my recovery time when I was defenseless to do whatever it was you wanted to. Youd beat me so badly sometimes that I would just regain consciousness on the floor but be too tired to get up so Id just fake it while you kept belting me. You taught me how to grit my teeth and persevere through pain. I scare my friends still with my pain tolerance, and it scares me too. That time Julia dropped a bottle of wine from the top shelf and didnt do a good job of cleaning up, and I stepped on a giant green shard and I just reached down and pulled it out while S almost threw up. Or when I got tattooed on my ribs, and the tattoo artist asked me if I was sure, cause its a painful place to be tattooed. Especially cause the tattoo was so large and dark. But more so because I looked like what I was- a small Asian 17 year old girl with a fake ID. I said I was sure and he told me that it would hurt a lot and I said it was fine. And then I got the tattoo and he said he said of all the people hes tattooed on the ribs I was the best one to have ever taken it. I laid there and I didnt flinch I didnt bat an eye I didnt let out a sound. You taught me how to discipline my mind and my emotions so that pain never got in the way of the important things. I remember the morning of that competition I did sophomore year when you caught me stealing your pot. I was a bad kid, Ill admit it. I deserved most of what I got by being foolish in the first place. But you didnt take it well. James and I always liked to chill and sesh to blow off steam after shit, so I was stupid. I took your pot and I looked in your things. But you didnt have to choke me, you didnt have to restrain me. You were on a bender that week because you lost a client, and according to you, none of that even happened. But your denial didnt take any of the pain away. I had welts for weeks after, I could barely get up when you untied me. But I still had a competition and I wasnt going to let you ruin that for me. So I went, and I played, and I won, and nobody couldve guessed. You taught me how to hate at such a young age. Seeing you hit mom, yell at her, berate her, you made her feel like she was nothing. You taught her how to turn off her emotions and to stop feeling, you taught her that her only escape was to paint a fictional life for herself. That was her escape, to just pretend that it was all okay. I hated you and I hated her. All she did was cry to me and use me as some emotional punching bag to vent all her hatred towards you onto me. Id take this information and hate you even more, while feeling sorry for her. But looking back, she deserved hate just as much as you did. She let you almost kill me, she let you bring me to your parties, she would pretend that I wasnt struggling to walk, and shed just sit there watching netflix on my account while I threw up in the bathroom ten feet away. You taught me how to truly be humble, but almost to a fault. I couldnt take compliments for years, and my friends would be so frustrated about it. Theyd say things like Id tell you you were great, but its not like youd listen anyways. It hurt, and it made me sad, because those words meant the world to me. I took being humble as never caring for myself and only caring for others, when you would beat those ideas into my head and recite on and on that humility was the most important of all. Then youd go and do everything the absolute fucking opposite of whatd you preach. You taught me how important it was to appreciate those around you, and you taught me just how much words can destroy a human soul. You rarely laid a hand on J, but you attacked him verbally like nothing else. Youd always call him a girl, a weak wimpy little girl who could never do anything. I remember when J and I were making cookies and when it was time to put the pan in, you made him do it. He couldnt even lift up the tray, and the oven was 400 fucking degrees. But you still made him do it, you told him to stop crying and being a girl and to man up and be strong but J was only 4 years old and so small. Or that time when you checked his bags before we went on a trip and you were going on your power trip rampage as you usually do, going around the house yelling at us all for being slow and behind schedule. You made all vacations such a fucking stressful situation, you taught me how to hate traveling and how to plan the absolute best ones to avoid terrible experiences. You taught me how much my demeanor and overall attitude can affect those around me. You would march around on those vacation mornings and youd scream and yell and we would all pile into the car crying and you yelling while we pulled onto the highway for the next eight miserable hours. You checked his bags and determined he didnt need to bring so many jackets, so you threw it at J and he was so sick of you and he threw it right back, but you didnt like that. And you lunged at him, you went right for his throat and the rage in your face was unmistakable. You held him down for what must have been less than a second but felt like an eternity and when I jumped in between you and slapped you across your face as hard as I could, you threw me across the room. I got to my feet and ran up to you and got in your face, and I remember pointing my finger in your face and telling you that you dont ever hit J, no matter what. You dont touch him, you dont even think about him. And that was supposed to be our agreement. But you just looked at me with cold, hard, drunk eyes and then grabbed Jethros leash on the table right next to you and almost killed me. I looked up for some kind of forgiveness in your eyes, but there was none. I looked around for J and Mom but I couldnt find them. Its okay, someone had to be the whipping girl and if that was me, and that made them safe, thats okay. You taught me sacrifice and compassion. You taught me how heavy the act of true sacrifice was, and how much that actually required of the human soul. You taught me true love and what it meant to give everything up for someone you loved and cared for. You taught me to hide my pain, you taught me to be strong and unfeeling, and you taught me how to live life through even the worst of circumstances. I wish I could say thank you for such an endearing skill, but after I left you I realized none of those are qualities that I need to move through life. The ones I need I do not have, because you taught me how to get by in a post-apocalyptic scenario. I wish I could say that being those things helped me in life, but it has just made me realize how broken I am and how much of a lie I lived. But these are things you will never know, because right now you are depressed and that is all that matters to you and the whole family. People forget the case that almost went to court and the amount of pain we suffered. They only care about your well-being. They forget that Josh and I are struggling through school, that I send him half of whatever I make and that we have to go to our schools food pantries. They forget the bruises on my arms and Js timid demeanor, and they so conveniently forget even harder when you would bail them out of whatever situation they were in, cause you were so charismatic and well-connected and you needed everyone to love you. You taught me the darkness that humans are capable of and how to expect the worst of people. You taught me how to survive in the worst of situations, and you taught me how to gather my strength to get through the most extreme of pains. What you never taught me though, was how to live life and thrive. You never taught me what it looked like to interact with people around me and hold fulfilling relationships with them. I had to figure all that on my own and those growing pains were so real. You were a character in my most immersive of books. You represented hatred, anger, lust, narcissism, evil, vulnerability, sadism, violence, rage, fury in all shapes and forms. But when I think of you, I can barely put together a face. You dont hold any space in my heart. You take form in tears and anxiety and flashbacks and traumatic episodes and nightmares, but when I speak of you from a clear mind you dont wrestle any bit of emotion from me. I cant bring myself to feel pain when I talk about you- I am struggling to even find words to say about you now. You occupy such little space in my world and life, but at the same time you hold the key to so much that I stored away without ever looking at. I hope you know that your life was wasted, and that you failed in all aspects. Even when the bond of blood forced innocent people to have to try and love you, you still found a way to turn that into hatred and darkness. I spend everyday trying not to feel guilty for the way I do. But then I realize that your conscience is about ten times darker than mine. I hope you lived life the way you wanted to. I hope you understood how many chances you were given and how much obliged and pity love was offered. I hope you live to see me live my life and exclude you from every aspect of it. I hope you live to see me have a happy family and be with someone who I love and who loves me. But then again, I hope you dont, because I dont think you could handle it. "

I got a Reddit username just so I could comment here. I am not sure why I picked this title for my post. It was the first thing I thought of about a year ago when I first started thinking of posting to this subreddit. I know very well that I have two narcissistic parental figures, a mother and a stepfather. I guess I'm asking if I belong here, although I'm sure I do. I will describe my Nparents below so you can decide what to tell me about that. Actually I ran out of energy and just described my Nmother. I guess I will have to talk about my Nfather some other time. I am getting good at noticing narcissists thanks to this forum and other websites educating me on narcissism. Sam Vaknin and (Dr. Ramani)\[[URL are good. (Check out YouTube videos with them in it, and their websites.) I have noticed some narcissistic traits in my mother: * She cannot ever really apologise or admit that she's done anything wrong that is her fault * She thinks way, way too much about money * She makes everything about her, even when she pretends to admit she's made a mistake or done something wrong * I had to feed myself when I was about 4 years old * She reacted to me telling her that she's a narcissist and should get counselling with great contempt * She has a habit of making me live in small or unfinished rooms when I live with her * She thinks that I passed by the bathroom with her in it one time in order to spy on her going to the bathroom * She implied that I was extremely arrogant and didn't want to hang out with other, like ""normal"" people and guilted me for not wanting, as a grown man, to go grocery shopping with her * She punishes me by insults and contempt for not talking to her for a while * She stopped talking to me for a year after I suggested to her to take a break from her responsibilities, after she was getting hurt repeatedly, for a while by suggesting going to a friends, hotel, respite centre, or even a homeless shelter one time. (She puts me in homeless shelters all the time.) She phoned my stepfather and communicated her great contempt for my suggestion. * She called the police on me for going to my room and banging on the inside of my door a bit * She loves to call the police on me * She loves to kick me out of the house * She thinks she knows more than me on computers, which is incredible * Her voice trails off often when she's talking with me, because she thinks I am only another being in her head and if she can hear her, I can hear her * She seems to lack object permanence and wants me to come over to her house 2-3 times a week so she knows I'm okay. I am 39 years old. * I was underweight my whole life because my parents never fed me enough until I was about 36 and decided to eat for the first time until I wasn't hungry anymore * She waited until I would talk on movie night when deciding a movie in order to talk over me. Once I figured this out and interrupted her by saying, firmly, ""Excuse me, I was talking."", she flipped out and had two 5-7 hour sobbing sessions. I am not kidding. * She has encouraged me to live at her house even though I was around 36 * She is abusive and manipulative * She abuses a small number of people so she can get away with it and not get known as an abuser * She got a Police Vulnerability Sector check so that she can volunteer to help other people, when she's abusing her own family (I should call the police and tell them this) * She lies like a rug, especially about the qualities of the people she abuses * She gaslights constantly * She insinuates that any reminder on my part that she needs to get help is terrifically insulting, and abuse on my part * She cannot and does not work * She is a (mild) hoarder * She self-pities * She(and her husband) kicked me out of the house three times when I was a teenager * She totally loses her mind if I don't respect her * She commits covert incest by encouraging me to see her naked (at least when I was a kid), and encouraging me to talk to her about sexual matters (as a grown-up) * She commits emotional incest * She does not take responsibility * She spends much time lamenting on how her life has gone wrong, without doing anything about it or going to any counselling * Any favours are held over my head later * She likes to steal my things * She makes the things she feels guilty about all about her Okay I guess that's enough for now. That was really reavealing, actually. I had no idea it was actually that bad. It's way more items than I thought I would put down, like about four. My relationship with her and herself are really \*\*\*\*ed up. By the way, the message in my flair is true, I am a 39 year old man in North America. I find when people give a little biographical information in their comments it really helps me understand things, so I decided to do it too. Yeah, I'm going to have to do my stepfather later. I can't switch gears for that right now."

Any interest I showed in any subject was met with criticism for as long as I can recall. My Nmother was watching something on a religious channel, and commented that I should learn to play a guitar, because then I could go to bars and make money. (I was like 12) I replied with confessing that I'd like to learn how to play the violin. She rejected that with, ""You have to be, like, smart to that."" That shit hurt. There was no openness, or emotional support, growing up. Any display of happiness was hammered down, and problems like health issues were met with folk-cures and shrugged shoulders. (flu = drink sprite and shut up) The job market after high school reaffirmed that reality. Application after application - nothing. The occassional interview - nothing. Once I even went into a business and outright asked who to give my resume to, and was turned away in one setence; ""no sir, we're not open to applicants."" Rejection in the real world has a special way of making you feel, and act, like a loser. I've a low income job now, but my life is stagnant. Every time I think about moving forward towards a life goal, or investing in myself, or doing something non-robotic, I get this recoil of regret, and fear. It feels like everything I touch will end in abject failure, and that I'm inconveniencing the world to try to break out of the cage."

When we returned from the airport the locks had been changed and she refused to let us in. It upset my older sister and her wife to finally see how toxic a joyous moment quickly turn. Both had been blind as my older sister had a lifetime as the Scapegoat and often tried to build on the rubble of a relationship with NM that she always wanted. The police were called and eventually NM let me in but refused to give a new key; at this point I started to realize that she was a Narc and begun to research how to better protect myself mentally. Soon after she would get violent and direct in her abuse, and it escalated beyond the psychological to a physical degree, yet the police did nothing; I was her daughter living at home after my cPTSD had gotten so severe I was on the verge of homelessness. I thought enduring the monster I knew would be fine until things escalated where I felt physically threatened by her. I was afraid to take my newly appointed Service Dog out for potty breaks at the risk of being locked out again. NM would claim she didn't believe PTSD was real and with the combination of a poorly researched article circulating misguiding information on Service Animals she didn't think my dog was working despite the excellent behavior and training reflected. The narrative eventually got so twisted NM manipulated the court system to file an OFP against me and have me removed from the house my grandparents had purchased for the family. I filed and won my counter OFP and went NC after her failing to publicly ostracize me by playing the victim. My sister and their wife allowed me to stay for a time being but as she became the new GC, her wife begun to reveal Narc trends. One day the wife does exactly what NM did but twists the narrative to claim I need to be hospitalized. I didn't and spent hours separated from my SD doing yoga while waiting for the staff at the hospital to figure out I was fine. They would say be kind to myself and put me in a taxi in the middle of the night with nowhere to go. While discharged I was told they had spoke to my sister and said I couldn't return. After a brief bout of couch surfing my SD and I reunited thanks to a neighbor that had cared for them and the two of us spent a week sleeping in my car waiting for the end of winter and struggling with discrimination from homeless shelters refusing us access. Today we're on the edge of poverty as the days get colder, but we aren't homeless, we fight for our civil right to access areas and I focus on my wellness as best I can, but a year later I feel afraid of how in an instance it could happen again but more so how it happened in the first place. After things with my sister I tried to spend the summer mending our relationship, but went NC without realizing it. I have my SD and they have me and to extend trust or any vulnerability to need my family's help isn't worth the damage they are capable of. I guess I find myself having a hard time being the SG after all the time as a GC, but I've learned a lot in a year, hurt a lot too, but so much stronger away from the Narc radioactivity, finally free from the prison of their dysfunction. There is no backwards; we only see the horizon."

I want to spend time volunteering and breathing and being normal. I want to judge myself and others for their character, not their achievements. I have made decisions for my life that have helped me gain back control. My own major, my own friendships, my own career decisions, and my own lifestyle. I am going on a mission trip to Haiti. Im spending a lot of time in community. Im learning to trust others. Cultivating intimacy and vulnerability with people who really really need it the most. Spending time in larger groups, which is scary, but whatever. Learning how to communicate well and handle conflict. It sucks to leave behind the old me because I thought I knew who I was. But I know Im going to be so much happier. "
227,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I was ridiculed for compromising.,1,9rcssn,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9rcssn/i_was_ridiculed_for_compromising/,2018-10-26 05:13:58,"I recently have gotten my hands on two books: Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving and The Emotionally Absent Mother. I right now recognized everytime that I tried to change something about myself, even something as simple as my approach, as a compromise I was laughed at and ridiculed. I'm so damn angry. Now I feel shame for feeling anger at them.... Because there was a shit load of contempt when I had any kind of emotion... fuck. Good emotion, ha that's not what should be happening. Bad emotion, you shouldn't have that feeling around family. My mom provided me that gem. How I almost always felt unsafe because of how I never knew when they would blame me for anything then shame and guilt me into a corner in order to ""understand"" what is happening. They made me take the blame and taught me to shame myself whenever they wanted someone to handle their fragile self esteem. They didn't want to take care of their own problems so they gave it to someone with less support thereby using them as a thing rather than a person. No wonder I have started to get sick over the idea of being around them. Any negative emotion was also me blowing things out of proportion even when they were wrong fully excusing me as the problem or the person who made my dad's day bad (my sister, mom and I agreed that we walked on eggshells but everything else was my fault, I now wonder how I remained as emotional as I was...) I now completely understand the feeling in the back of my head, I had nothing to do with it... Whenever I showed vulnerability, I was exploited. Whenever I showed interest, I was laughed and told that I would never do it since I cannot make up my mind. If I made a small mistake even when I noticed they were making a mountain out of a molehill they projected and triangulated it on me. My dad for being my gaslightepr and my mom for telling me to just do what he says since it makes him tolertable for everyone else. Fuck that. A necessary sacrifice in a family isn't a family. It's a terror. I am also learning practically ironically that what I have always wanted my family to be like is healthy and what I should look for in people. Due to the fact I was so used to be unsafe and that living in my flashback of unsafe kept me on guard for the shit that they did, it is similar to the fact I beat myself over everything since my parents did the same thing. I'm so sad and angry. I am so frustrated that I am having these emotions. You don't know how to control them since you are autistic is one of the intrusive thought I get... It was used to demonize me as less than they are. I loved using words I was laughed Everytime I asked what a word meant. When I tried to use ""big words"" I was told I was unable to ever conceptualize them. Doing anything that wasn't what they were doing was contemptible. That is why it is so damning.. They didn't like that I had the ability to change as easily as I did. They didn't support or talk good of my impressionability. That was so denied as well as any attempts for physical comfort and affection then I was called uncaring when I didn't notice they were doing worse... Verbally abused for thinking that my problems we're even a thing... Fuck. Even now I beat myself up for teaching myself body language even when I already knew how to read body language. I thought if I learned to do it better that they would stop calling me autistic. It was more along the lines that those parts of my personality that can mimic autistic symptoms where ridiculed and joked about by my parents. They terrorized me and my sister followed suit... So much more. What has other people found out about their triggers? Are there any good books out there for understanding triggers or am I holding the god of books? "

My mom just emailed me a $3,000 invoice for helping me. This, from the woman who kicked all 3 of her children out at age 14, who married a man that sold me to pedophiles, who kept 100% of the money I earned as a child actor that she peddled me around as. I wish she had aborted me. My entire life has been trying to appeal for permission to exist. If I pay her the money, shell say I owe her for something else. I can never give her enough. If I died she might be happy because shed get sympathy for having a dead daughter. And I think that Im probably the golden child of the family!"

It didn't used to be like this, and I can understand her situation since my stepfather and mother are in a breakup, but the worst is that my stepfather actually started a relationship with my cousins ex-wife (*fucked up*), and spends more time with her children than with my sister (*half-sister, same mother, different father*). She was on thin ice last year where a 30 year old dude dated her, and I borrowed money from her and shit, basically took advantage of her vulnerability. I found out that he had a criminal record which I showed to my stepfather who took it seriously. But that is when it began, he started dating my cousins-ex-wife and asking for my advice on what to do, I basically, diplomatically told him that my sister is in a vulnerable position now and needs to be looked after *(meaning that spending time with some others kids isn't a priority, which of course I didn't say as that is to direct, so basically tip-toed on eggshells).* Saying that he threatened to cut contact with me, since he interpreted it as if I was hostile to his idea of dating my cousins ex-wife *(which I wasn't, I just found it very strange, but didn't realize on how fucked up it was until a year after)*.. After that, well, I was in a very tough spot. I was pretty sick at that time in Lyme neurroborreliosis, and had to fly to a different country for private healthcare. My psychopath- brother used my deteriorating relationship with my father and eventually made him shutdown my company (*which I ran with my father*). So I was broke, sick, and had almost nothing, I had to sell two small dinghys I had from my childhood to survive.. I had a room to live in, but it was doubtful that I'd have it because shit was so constantly in flux. My stepfather started to drink more, and basically started partying with my ex-cousins wife.. To give you a hint on the weirdness of this situation, he is 73 and she is like 32.... He's really into real-estate and has said that ***she's (ex-wife)*** going to inherit a piece of the pie after he dies, and my sister and his brother.. Well, WTF, since I am the only step-son he kind of ""*forgot""* to write a will until I told him to do so, which I never saw and haven't to this day. This is when I started to realize that I'll probably be left without nothing, and he's neglectful behavior was a reflection of his careless and enabling attitude of my nMom during the years.. Got damn it, just writing this makes me feel so fucking awful because I've suffered in silence for so long. PTSD/anxiety/depression. Pardon the scattering, but there are so many situations that goes beyond the conventions of normality and were epithets such as ""*bizareness""* cannot even begin to describe the surreal world a child grows up having parents that have severe empathy disorders. Anyhow.. I don't know what to do with my sister. I've tried talking to her about her lies, irresponsibility for 8-9 times and how it effects me. I told her that if she wants my trust then she has to make up for the lost trust she has caused, which she says she wants but really gives zero flying fucks of and continues being the way she is. She says that she doesn't mean it, and has started doing reverse psychology like my mother and stepbrother have started doing (*I am to be questioned for setting my boundaries - gaslighting etc)*, which again makes me feel neglected and betrayed as it reminds me of the traumas they have caused in the past. I am an adult now and don't really have time for these childish things, but I really do not know what to do, seeing and not being able to do anything with my sister as I live on my own now, well not quite (*I have to move to a different place now because of the dramas they're causing)*, whilst simultaneously and intuitively it feels that I am going NC because her behaviour is absolutely on the contrary of what she says.. I just feel crushed, dragged into the depths of the past, whilst simultaneously starting to have ambivalence towards my sister, because I can empathize with what she's going through but also not, since I have never lied or obscured the truth as she does. What should I do? Has anyone else been in such an ambivalent situation of having a sibling that is younger and still in that dysfunctional environment, how do you cope with it? &amp;#x200B;"
230,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Finally realized that my mom is a narcissist. How do I start gaining self respect/self confidence after 20 years of hating myself ?,1,9rwbsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9rwbsp/finally_realized_that_my_mom_is_a_narcissist_how/,2018-10-28 05:02:11,"I (20F) cant say with full certainty that my mom is a narcissist. I feel like Im also very biased towards her because I respect and love her, but I also feel like Im sort of in denial about how damaging her parenting has been, and Im only now becoming more aware of it. Recently, my weight has been a main topic of conversation, and its really starting to get to me. I have always been a little overweight. I was a very active kid but I didnt have a good diet. I was quite a picky eater, and my mom let me eat whatever I wanted as a kid, which led to me eating the worst diet possible for a very long time. Ever since I can remember, my mom has told me to suck in my stomach in public. I have been doing it since elementary school and shed scold me if she saw me not sucking in. I knew it was something I had to do at all times in public without completely understanding why. At the time, and even up until recently, I didnt realize how damaging this actually was. I became obsessed with my appearance and weight even though I was just an average looking little girl. My mom also aggressively encouraged/forced me to sign up for any and all sports possible, for the purpose of exercising more to lose weight. Flash forward to high school and an anxiety disorder diagnosis later, I was still continuing to gain weight, and blamed my self esteem issues on my anxiety disorder. My junior year I finally gained the motivation to lose weight, and I lost 20 pounds in 1 month with a healthy diet and exercise. I was still a little overweight but again, just an average person. But at the time I didnt realize this, due to my moms constant priming I always saw myself as way bigger than what I really was. At this point she was extremely expressive and happy about my weight loss, and always encouraged me to keep going. I appreciated the support, but I had always felt like she cared more about the fact that I looked skinner rather than being healthier. At the time I brushed it off as me overthinking it. My healthy diet and fitness routine quickly turned obsessive, and I somehow convinced myself to take a break from it as to not start bad habits of under eating. For the last 4 years I slowly gained weight again. Although I wasnt happy with my body, I didnt hate myself as much as I did when I was younger. But little things my mom would say here and there would always put me back in the same feeling of self loathing. Any time Id wear clothing that is somewhat tight shell say something along the lines of see OP youre not THAT fat, you look fine! I had always excused her behavior until about a month ago, and now I realize how fucked up I am because of it. This last summer she began telling her friends/coworkers the things I would tell her in confidence about myself. She has always done things like this, but obviously my weight is a sensitive subject for me, and disclosing my vulnerability to her coworkers really surprised me. I found out when one of them came to talk to me about my weight. About a month ago I got gastritis and I lost 25 pounds because of it. Im at my lowest weight ever and Im no longer overweight. Although I appreciate being thinner since I have such bad body issues, I wasnt proud of the weight loss since it was due to illness. It was a really bad month of unpleasant sickness and I hated every second of it. On the other hand, my mom is ecstatic about the weight loss. She even called me the other day to tell me your sister is pretty, but now that you lost weight youre definitely prettier. Im very close to my sister, and it was so insulting and I couldnt believe she had really said that to me. Im trying my best to remind myself every day that I catch myself sucking in my stomach to relax. I notice that Im always unnecessarily tense in public because of this, and its a really hard habit Im trying to get rid of. Im finally starting to catch on to the damaging things she says and trying to get out of that mentality. Even now at a normal weight I cant help but hate myself and see someone very overweight in the reflection. I avoid dating because of the fear of having to show my body. I honestly dont know what the first step is to loving myself, but Im definitely going to stop listening to my nmom."
231,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Halloween is over and I want it back,1,9th784,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9th784/halloween_is_over_and_i_want_it_back/,2018-11-02 16:06:51,"I'm not... 100% sure where I'm going with this, I guess this is just a call for support? Or talking myself up? This time of year is hard for everyone on this sub, I'm sure, considering we grew up with lies about how important family is, not to mention that the concept of family is just a huge marketing campaign for companies during the Christmas season. And I know, *ugh, it's only November*. But between the images of happy families on TV, and seasonal depression, I always end up thinking of my NDad - who, by the way, sucks. I went no-contact before I even knew that was a real term - hell, before I even knew he was a narcissist. It's been 4 years now, and for anyone who recently went NC, let me tell you, my life has improved substantially. My EMom moved several states away pretty much at the same time I went NC with EDad, and she's living with extended family, and seems to be happy. I was still in college and fresh to the whole adulthood thing - I still am I guess - but even when I was a teen living at home, I played the role of second-in-command around the house. Since NDad was an incompetent, petulant man-child, EMom vented her frustrations and delegated household responsibilities to me. Now I barely see her once a year, and while we have long conversations every couple of weeks, they're exhausting and it's obvious we're two adult friends talking, not a mother and daughter connecting. Sometimes I tell funny anecdotes about when I was a teen, how I started graduated high school, started college early, and came home from classes one day to find a mattress askew on my bed, one end propped up on the footboard because it was too big. Bewildered and inconvenienced, I walked to the kitchen to find my EMom making coffee. I asked her about the bed and got a whole outburst about how she was trying to ""do something nice, and Dad was helping, and you know how he gets! and he stormed off, and I just can't deal with this right now, and I was trying to do something nice!!!"" and she ran into her own bedroom in a fit of tears. Now... I have a lot of sympathy for her, of course. She knows now that her relationship with my father was toxic and codependent and she's learning, as we all are, how to be healthier. At the time, though, I started laughing because it was so absurd. I had to let her cool down, then approach her and tell her I wasn't angry, I just thought it was funny, because I had no idea what was going on. Never mind that my privacy had been thrown off kilter, but now I was comforting her, as if I was a parent telling her it was no big deal. And that's... just how our relationship is. She gets upset, I rationalize it and give her advice - I get upset, she just says ""yeah, that sucks"" a lot, or delivers some cheesy inspirational meme quote that doesn't really help. I told the Mattress Story to friends one day, just killing time, and they definitely reacted... differently than I expected. I was thinking, ""ha! funny story about weird mom stuff,"" and they cleared up that uh, nah, healthy people don't think that shit's cute. (Not that my friends are perfect, but it's good to have perspective.) Later that week, one of my friends (who is a mother of three and is a great sounding board when I need to vent or advice) was drinking with me, and started in on how amazing it is that I'm as functional as I am considering my parents are basically not parents. I cried. How are friends more like family than family? It goes against everything I was taught as a child. I didn't even think it was possible to have friends this close, when I was 14, and homeschooled in the country, and saw my one best friend once a month. Now I have friends I work with and spend free time with and see every day, if not multiple times a day, who know more about my personality and heart and values than NDad could've ever fathomed. Sometimes it stings, still. I'll hear a phrase or see behavior that reminds me of NDad, and I want to cry. I want to take it all out on that person, all the pain of being convinced you're worthless, invisible, fucking everything up and incapable of fixing it. Or I want to sleep for three days, or I want to chain smoke, or get blackout drunk. I've been in therapy for the better part of the year, and it's helped a lot with coping mechanisms, so that's not what I do, anymore. But I want to. The biggest part of this season is that I live in a college town, and every year around this time people flock back to their hometowns. And while I'm being more open and risking vulnerability to the people around me I deem worth it, and I will ask around to see who wants to have Thanksgiving dinner with me, I'm still so incredibly heartbroken and jealous when everyone leaves to be with their family. Not even my grandparents (on EMom's side) or my brother and sister-in-law - ALL of whom live in the state - try to involve me in Thanksgiving plans. Like I asked to be the scapegoat child, and enjoy severing ties with the people I loved most. And when I'm heartbroken and jealous, it turns to anger and resentment, because it seems so unfair. Whatever. I'm here and it's now and the past is gone and I'll make my present as good as it gets. Last Christmas, I actually spent with my boss, who made a ton of food and we hiked with their dogs in the countryside and it was really sweet. I'm sure that'll happen again, or maybe even for Thanksgiving we can do that. I guess I'm just trying to acknowledge my feelings, and process them, and let them pass so I can keep enjoying my narc-free life. Thanks for reading this and being on this sub, guys."
232,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Letter to my father - hardest one I ever wrote,1,9u7vvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9u7vvv/letter_to_my_father_hardest_one_i_ever_wrote/,2018-11-05 09:36:59,"The background is simple. After living a life of complete narcissism, my father is too lazy to go on dialysis and so he is having my adopted sister give a kidney to a stranger so that he can get one now. I grappled with writing him because it was coming out dishonestly. I was trying so hard to tap dance so that he would respond and think about it, but I realized he never would. Then I just let it fly: I havent responded to any of your texts or emails because frankly, I didnt know how to. In your own selfish and narcissistic way, I know that you are trying to find a way back, but I think for me its a bit harder. What Ive learned about myself in the past 9 years of therapy is that vulnerability was always my biggest problem. I justified everything. I rationalized everything no matter how irrational. I walked away from finding within me the emotions needed to resolve situations. In the short run, it allowed me to go on my life, with what I thought, was being happy. However, now I realize that I wasnt. You were the architect of that framework. You taught me that. Unfortunately, you still live it. Because of it, you do not confront things as you should. Its very uncomfortable. But take it from somebody who has been there very deeply, the minute that you allow yourself to open up to that same vulnerability, mistakes, misdeeds, miscommunications, etc. everything gets better. However we both know you are not in that place, evidenced by the mere fact that you wouldnt take the gift of therapy the multiple times that I offered it to you and offered to pay for it for you. You failed to realize your most famous quote which is I am who I am is one of the most hurtful, selfish and pathological things you can say to someone else. It translates into I dont give a shit about you or how you feel, youre not taking me out of my routine nor my comfort zone to do anything I dont want to do. Your relationship with me is only there because I allow it to be on my terms  Because I know thats not going to change without therapy, I never responded to any of your one sentence emails or texts. You are simply have the opinion that time will heal the wounds. Of course, without you doing any work emotionally. However, thats not reality. People cant bury things like you can. Also, I am certain you send those texts and emails so you can further convince yourself that you are the victim here. That we just dont respond to you and therefore we are doing something to you. In fact, I know that is what you tell others. However, I now feel compelled to reach out to. I need to separate the ones I love (Sister) from people as pathological as you. To take this organ from (sister) is your ultimate act of selfish pathology. I am sure youre not even considering the risks of her on the table, the risks of her getting injured one day and having her only kidney punctured to leave behind your grandchildren motherless, all because you dont want to go through the hassle of dialysis. Think about it, you couldnt be considering that because if you did it would mean that you are even worse than you are. Im not going to get into our entire history, because frankly Im sure you have an excuse for all of it. But this example is worse than all of the other things you have done and I want you to understand the magnitude. Its worse than the years of cheating on mom right in front of her face, its worse than sexually forcing yourself on (my niece that I have raised since she was 19 after her dad died) which can only be described as a sexual assault. All the while she was under my care as a daughter. This is the most despicable thing I can imagine, taking advantage of an adopted daughter who obviously has a heightened sense of guilt and loyalty and forcing her to give a major organ to a complete stranger just so that you dont have to deal with going on dialysis because you, as you stated, Dont think you have the patience for it. You can find on the national kidney website the following: Life expectancy on dialysis can vary depending on your other medical conditions and how well you follow your treatment plan. Average life expectancy on dialysis is 5-10 years, however, many patients have lived well on dialysis for 20 or even 30 years.  Therefore, I hope you can understand how others perceive this to be an act of malice. Even if youre dead set on forcing her to give a kidney to a stranger, you can certainly prolong this until it is absolutely necessary by doing dialysis in the meantime. I would be remiss if I didnt tell you there was some good they came out of your behavior. Im twice the father to my kids than you ever were to us. Luckily I caught it before it was too late. The pathological cycle, I truly believe, has been broken. (Sister) is truly giving you a second chance. The greatest gift and sacrifice anybody can. Shes harvesting a major organ to a complete stranger all while risking her own family and children in the process. Please dont squander that second chance. Its never too late."

And there is a story I'm not posting because I'm not really comfortable sharing the details, but it is mentioned further ahead. I'm also calling him Zombie Dad (ZD) cause he told me that he was dead to me so, y'know, dead,but not dead, undead, dad, zombie. Joke. Lol. IDK if this is considered a ""slur"" more than a nickname, so PLEASE PLEASE mods let me know and I'll change it instead of taking it down. This is going to be very very very long, but bear with me. It's a lot to process, and I want to fit it all into one post. Sorry. OB= Older brother YB= Younger brother GMA= Grandma (ZD's mom) YM= Yes Mom FA =(Father's side Aunt, ZD's sister) JNSM= Just No Step Mom &amp;#x200B; Some background: OB has always had more contact with ZD than me, because he got the ""good dad"" experience from him. OB had a child at a very young age (19), and was always a little bit high maintenance, getting in trouble, getting sick, etc. He always looked out for me, though. I on the other hand, spent my entire childhood and teenage years trying to be praised, spent time with, and bonded with by ZD. I was always the one who was left hanging, the one who was left behind or not included in activities. I even tried to get involved with his martial arts academy, but then decided that it wasn't bonding time, since all I was doing was taking orders and I was just another student in his class. He once referred to his top student as ""almost like his daughter. She paints and writes poetry and sings."" Right in front of me when introducing her to someone at a party. I do all of those things. I was that girl with the daddy issues at school who serial-dated/fucked everyone, to the point that my friends brought it up with my favorite teacher and had an intervention that ended up in me crying my eyes out and making my own teacher and friends cry when I told them what my relationship with ZD was like. So, you get the gist of it. So now, the actual story... ZD liked to throw himself a pity party in the book of faces twice a year. Once on Father's Day, once on his birthday. It pretty much consisted of a series of posts with things like ""Blood that doesn't give me the time of day on a daily basis doesn't deserve on congratulating me on this day"", ""If you don't look for me all year don't come crying saying you miss me and love me on this day"", ""both of you are hypocrites"" etc. EVERYONE knew he directed these messages to me and OB. Now, let me tell you, I knew for a fact that OB spoke to ZD constantly, because me and OB talked a lot and I would have to ask HIM about ZD, because MY texts were always met with short replies, and my calls lasted a couple of minutes, only to be hastily hung up with the ""I'll call you in a minute."" excuse, and ZD never called back. So, really? HE NEVER CALLED NOR TEXTED US UNLESS WE DID FIRST. AND made sure to post pictures of us ever so often with some borderline JACOSTA caption, because, other than the Pissed-at-my-children-but-deleted-by-the-end-of-the-day-posts, he was the perfect father and loved BOTH of us VERY much. Every time he would actually spend some time with either of us, he'd make sure to post about his beautiful children. He wore a mask in front of everyone, and everyone believed he was an amazing human being, unless they actually knew him. And who knew him better than his ex-wife and his children? My YM, OB and I would always send each other the posts he put up with some ""Here it is, the yearly tantrum"" messages and shit like that. And this year, shit was about to hit the fan. THE DAY BEFORE FATHER'S DAY 2017 YM got angry this specific day, because, after both of his children were off being married, hard-working, stabilized adults, who still took time out of their busy schedules to call him, only to be met with excuses not to talk, he was still trying to make us look like the shittiest children in the universe for abandoning him. Also because OB's wife had just left him and taken the kid and she was helping him get back on his feet, ZD was supposed to help her help OB with some kind of economic situation. And sent him a message that read somewhere along the lines of: ""I need to know if you are actually going to help me with this money we agreed to send OB, if not, then I'll let him know and send him all the money myself. And while I have you here, I think it's really immature and unfair to the kids for you to talk about them EVERY FUCKING YEAR, when both of them have done nothing but try to look for you, talk to you, and just overall care about and love you. I'm sure they would both appreciate it as much as I would if you would stop this petty tradition."" To which he responded by saying he had always been there for us, maybe not physically, but EMOTIONALLY AND ECONOMICALLY, (laughable) and that it was his turn TO TAKE A BREAK FOR HIMSELF and put his feet up and relax. So long story short, all he said is a lie. He wasn't. At all. Take a break my BIG LATINA ASS because this creature has never lifted a finger other than what was legally required of him, AND THAT WAS A STRETCH BECAUSE HE WAS MONTHS AND MONTHS BEHIND ON CHILD SUPPORT CONSTANTLY. So my mom, very politely and TIRED of his condescending, god-complex attitude, told him ""That's not what your children say, but ok."" Now, HOW DARE SHE. He then messaged me and OB to see ""WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SAYING ABOUT ME, YOUR MOM SAID YOU TOLD HER I WAS A BAD FATHER?????&gt;!!!!"" (LIE, I saw the screenshots) OB doesn't like to argue with ZD so he just said that he hasn't and that he's a good dad. Putting my mom in a liar's position. I just left him on read. He then proceeded to post a picture with me with a thousand hearts and a caption ""WITH MY BEAUTIFUL -NICKNAME and a thousand hearts-"" After this, he also told YB he COULDN'T visit me anymore. We had been planning for him to come visit me in the states, he had saved up money all year, EVEN JNSM SAID HE COULD COME AND WAS EVEN GOING TO GIVE HIM SOME EXTRA MONEY TO SPEND OVER HERE. ZD said yes, too. Until all this happened. FATHER'S DAY 2017 ME: ""I find it so weird I haven't seen the yearly ""BLOOD DOESN'T MAKE FAMILY MY CHILDREN DON'T LOVE ME"" post lol"" OB: I saw it. Me: SO HE BLOCKED IT FROM ME LOL SO he did. He still threw his pity party, but blocked me from it. Because it was directed at me. OB said something along the lines of ""This is getting old, dad, we look for you and what you're doing is hurtful."" To which ZD responded with a picture of a high building saying ""If somebody doesn't like what I have to say, SHE can jump off one of these, if SHE'S so tired of it"" This is war. He knew I had a history of self-harm and several attempts on my life and OB had had a drug/alcohol problem before and was relapsing. I told him that I wouldn't kill myself simply because of the fact that I wasn't going to give him the attention he was gonna call to himself by saying how much he loved me, how proud he was of me, how much he misses his little girl, etc. Because he's only good to play great dad on social media. That he needed someone to knock him off the pedestal all his student's parents had him in, and make them realize what a truly shitty person he really is. Everything he says btw was all public in his profile for everyone to read, including OB's drug and alcohol problems. He said how he was glad that he was there to witness me going through my attempted sexual assault (really close), that he was happy he got to see me at my lowest moment, crying and calling out for him in my intoxicated state. That I cried when I saw him at the mall after throwing a bitch fit for being told no. That he found a letter I wrote to my grandpa after he died, saying sorry for harming myself again at his funeral. And that I had to ask forgiveness because of being bad to him by doing so. He said all these things in a comic matter, mockingly. ""Grandpa forgive me"" with crying faces of babies and so. For you who've read my past posts, you know the true story involving the mall. I unfriended him on the book of faces and made a VERY public post, to make his mask slip, to make everyone who knew him SEE what kind of person he was, because all the things he was saying could've been blocked for those people, but I CONTROL what I post. So I posted the next text (roughly translated) and tagged all his student's parents on it, so they could see what he would comment. ""This is the last I'm going to speak of this. Say whatever you want, attack me however you feel like, stay quiet, I don't care. I'm making this public and I don't care who reads this. People need to know who they're leaving their children with. Since we're airing dirty laundry and throwing stuff at each other's faces. You have made it a tradition, year after year to make yourself look like the victim, poor old you, your children don't call you, we're hypocrites, just because we're blood doesn't make us family, whine, whine, whine. But all year round, we never receive a call or text from you. Every conversation turns into an ""I'll call you back"" two minutes in, but we know you'll never call. So we let it go. For years we thought it was our fault in one way or another. And I saw WE because, no matter how much OB denies it, because he doesn't want to fight with you, because he had to be the ""strong one"", because he didn't want to admit it hurt him, he felt it too. He was less vocal about it than I was, because I'm not afraid to show my hurt and my vulnerability. In the end I got my humanity from YM, because it sure as hell wasn't from you. You whine and whine about how we're horrible children, hypocrites, etc, with no names, but direct enough to make it clear it was about us, butt the moment your children make it known your attitude is hurtful, you suggest to your daughter that she should jump off a building. WHAT A DAD! You say I made a scene at the mall when I saw you, after I decided not to talk to you because you wanted to take ""your wife and children"" to my birthday party and I said no. And what did you do? You HIT me. You insulted me. You left slamming doors. You still came late and left early using some half assed excuse about YB being sick when he clearly wasn't, he told me himself. I knew what was going on, but whatever. We didn't talk for a while and when we saw each other at the mall, we hugged and guess what? YOU CRIED TOO. I missed you like crazy and I'm not afraid to admit that. Honestly, you're the only person of who I'm not surprised to hear that they considered a privilege to live through the hardest moments of his only daughter's life and to take joy from those times she confided in you and counted on you. But see, nothing surprises me anymore. ""Grandpa, forgive me""? that's funny. Whenever I saw him I would appreciate the fuck out of him, I spent moments with him that mean more to me than your entire existence. The poem I wrote him was about giving him thanks and how much I missed him. But what about you? Dear son? Devoted son? What have you done these 5 years so the old man isn't buried in a grave that was hand-painted by my aunt with a handwritten name? Huh? Oh, wait, that new piece for your BMW is more important than a plaque for the old man! That you already did your part. YM was home but you were there for everything else. THE NERVE. When YM told you that wasn't what we said, what did you do? Harassed us about it and posted a picture with me when I didn't answer: ""MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER!"" (But remember, me and OB are the hypocrites) You messaged us saying YM said you were a bad father. Which was a lie. Because she just said we didn't consider you being there for everything you said you were. OB only answered because he didn't want to argue. I didn't because I didn't want to reopen that wound. I made my piece with you not being around not too long ago and I was moving on. If your conscience was burning up your brain, then good. After so much shit, it was about time you felt guilty for once, to change the routine, y'know. You told YB he couldn't come visit me anymore. SHIT EVEN JNSM SAID HE COULD COME! My little brother, man. But you know what? The truth of the matter is that we don't owe you anything. YM is superhuman. She wasn't the most devoted, or spoiling mother. But we counted on her for anything. FOR ANYTHING. Something we can't say about you. And you know what else? We'll still be here for you. When you grow up and accept that you are not who you say you are in front of your students, their parents, your friends, etc. When no one wants to put up with you anymore, when YOU'RE TIRED OF YOURSELF. Me. OB and YB are the ones who will be there for you, even after everything. I can say a thousand more things to you, but honestly, I don't think this will go through your thick skull. This is more for myself, and for those who think they know you. I'm doing good for now, I have my mom and my family, even if they are far away. The only one complaining is you. I don't call anyone else because I'm busy, and everyone understands that. They get a call maybe once or twice a month. When I call FA (Father's side aunt, ZD's sister) after months of not talking, she answers the phone like no time has passed. THAT'S FAMILY. I have my husband, who knows EVERYTHING about me, everything you could ever throw in my face and more, and he loves me, and he takes care of me. He is proud of me and we celebrate every little achievement together, no matter how small. I'm good, not that you care, but I am. I have my job, my house, my husband, my family and much much more than you. You decided to distance yourself and we overcame it. I don't have much left to say to you. I am the woman I always wanted to be, I am proud of MYSELF. I live my life without having to lie to anybody for them to like me. I am everything I always wanted to be, because I am NOTHING LIKE YOU."" He has a student that he has been conditioning since she was like 15, and we all know he's been fucking her since she turned of age. She's severely brainwashed and will believe anything he says, no matter how little sense it makes. She will tell him everything no matter how private and has never been with anyone, even though she's almost . When my dad started teaching her, he was 40. So you tell me how that sounds to you. He used her account to comment on my post that it was really easy for me to ""serve myself with the big spoon"" , blocking him so he couldn't defend himself. To which I answered with a BIG FAT picture of my blocked people, which was empty. Told him ""another lie"" and he said he always paid the money he had to, that we never went hungry, etc etc etc. Which was all a lie, from his part. We never went hungry and never wanted for anything because YM put everything she had into raising us right. I told him ""I never wanted your money, not that you ever paid what you had to. I wanted YOU. Without excuses, without leaving us at grandma's house instead of actually spending time with us until YM threatened you with court. You think we don't know a lot of things that we do, but chose to ignore."" After he said a thousand lies, he deleted EVERYTHING regarding the situation, because he had also been telling family members I was saying things that were the contrary of what was in the post (he didn't know I had them as friends), so he deleted everything to make himself look innocent. My FA called me and left me some angry sounding (not towards me, just generally angry) messages, when I called her, she told me ZD had said that she told me he ""Didn't want to pay for grandpa's headstone because he didn't care about him"", and she called me because she knew he would always lie and exaggerate to make himself look good, and she had read my post so she knew he was lying, but she wanted to ask me anyways. I told her the truth: No one told me anything. I have my ways of finding out the truth. He told me that he was dead to me from now on, I didn't have a dad. That I would come crawling back to him. A year and a half later, I'm doing great. I'm not gonna say I don't think about the good times, because I do, but he's not really necessary in my life. I learned to live without him from a young age, and in my adulthood, I'm at peace with it. BUT He also cut off my OB. Now, my OB was going through a hard time atm, his SO had left him, and we was having problems with alcohol. He had never been NC with ZD and we were all afraid that it was going to push him over the edge. I felt so guilty that OB was going to go through all the pain I went through as a child/teenager, in the lowest moment of his life. I was worried and I wanted to apologize, but could't work up the nerve. FF to some months back from right now, I was visiting home for two months, and I stayed at GMAS house, ZD's mom. Every time he would visit her, which was almost every day, I'd have to either hide, or leave the house. He knew I was there. Sometimes he'd tell her he was coming over, I would leave the house to wander around downtown, I'd come back two or three hours later, and he never came by. He'd come an hour after I got home. I'd just stay in the room. My GMA would ask me to stay quiet. I didn't care. As long as he didn't say shit, I wasn't gonna start anything. Then I got an apartment for the last month I was there. GMA said I should just squash it and let it go, he was my dad and it didn't matter what he did. I told her that their enabling him is the reason he had this god complex, and thought he was always right. Because no one ever worked up the nerve to tell him he was wrong. He was coddled growing up and that fucked him as an adult. I got to talk to OB about it, ended up with both of us crying and me saying sorry for ruining his relationship with ZD. He said I shouldn't be sorry because ZD made his own choice in cutting ties with him, and that someday I had to explode, that he saw how much it affected me over the years, and that ZD crossed a line. That he would never speak that way about or to his little girl. That he appreciated me standing up to ZD and that he had actually recently talked to him. They would occasionally text or talk but OB made it very clear to him that they still had to have a talk about what happened. DH said he could never look at ZD the same way after what he said to me, and that he HAD to get everything off his chest, and that he knew ZD might never talk to him for it, but it had to be done. He needed to know what he did and he needed to take responsibility for it. So me and OB are great. My drug addict uncle would yell at me from the living room that ZD was my dad and I had to respect him. That if he was my dad he'd beat the shit out of me. I walked over both of them and asked them ""Do you know what happened?"" ""No, it doesn't matter."" ""Do you know what HE SAID TO ME?"" I was almost crying at this point and talking loudly. ""no...'' ""Then please, stop it with your opinions. I appreciate you guys trying to ""make things right"" between us but that is a decision that HE has to make. He can apologize and recognize his mistakes and he chooses not to. Because he doesn't think he did anything wrong. Because he was raised to believe he was always right. Now leave me alone. I'm not badmouthing him, or anything. I even leave the house to not cause a scene here for GMA. IM LEAVING and renting an apartment a BLOCK from here just so GMA doesn't get nervous about me being here when he comes. Just leave me alone"" He hasn't told GMA or my uncle anything. Why? Beats me. I'm good. Thanks for reading."

I truly thought I was going to marry him and be with him forever so I am really broken about this (I am a recent college grad who moved back home and I still haven't gotten a full time job, although i'm freelancing). Anyway, my mother got my father enraged with me for sleeping and being lazy before even asking if im okay, or why I would be sleeping in. I walked downstairs in tears after my dad slammed his fist against my door and told me to get up. I made some coffee and couldnt stop crying (i usually don't show emotion or vulnerability in front of my family, because its ignored, but this time i couldnt help it) and she just stared at me and told me to start cleaning because I slept in. I told her my reason for staying in bed because i was upset, hoping that she would understand and not be as angry. But instead she said, over what and I said, ""you know exactly what?"" She went, Oh I think I know what it is but youll freak out on me if I say it."" I said, ""no I wouldn't?"" She always projects, and tries to make me sound crazy. I know this is nasty, but snot is literally dripping down my face and my mother is disgusted by my emotions and ignores me. Hours go by and I come down around 4 pm to eat for the first time, and she just looks at me and tells me to go outside and mow the lawn. Its just unbelievable. Shes been asking about my breakup and why it happened, but 1. We dont even have that kind of relationship where I would tell her. 2. She asks about it in the least comforting way, its cold and she asks about it like she only cares about getting the dirt/gossip so she can tell everyone else. 3. I never once freaked out at her, each time shes asked I respectfully told her im not ready to talk about it/not comfortable. Its just unbelievable. I have a mother that thinks anytime I show emotion that im trying to gain something from it. Its sick, and she knows I struggle with depression. I don't know why her behavior surprises me anymore, but it does. and it hurts still. Also, thanks to anyone who reads this, I just had to get it off my chest and I feel like I have been venting to my friends way too much recently. "

I remember my mom telling me i couldnt tell anyone about what happened cause my dad would go to jail and she would get deported and me and my siblings in a. Foster home and having just met my parents i didnt think of trying to get rid of them, so i tried my best in school only to ultimately fail except i tried to hide it when teachers would send notes home, one time i was caught trying to forge my dads signature, and well deja vu , cold shower belt, the worst was the cold shower cause it felt suffocating the pain wasnt as bad the cold IMO anyways i forget what hppened from 1st grade to wround 5th grade but my mom basically teached me as much as she could and i wasnt hit for yhe most part, maybe here and there like when it was my birthday and a mouse crawled on me so i freaked out, my dad decked me in the face, than my dad was to cheap to get me a haircut so he butchered my hair himself and surprise surprise i got bullied, also i cried whenever he would cut my hair idk why honestly i think the emotional tension and vulnerability that the haircut left me in just made me feel so afraid, yeah he would get rougher with me when i cried cause he couldnt cut my hair right , so far to this point i never questioned my parents, i just had no reason to believe they where in the wrong , i thought all things where normal i made an error i felt the consequences, and they always made it seem like my punishment was for my good so i believed it too. It wasnt until i started asking questions to my american friends on how their parents punished them, i was the odd one out whenever i asked if their parents hit them too. No this is where i think my parents are narcissistic , whenever i started doing good in school and got any achievements my parents would not let me celebrate it, my mom would try too, but my dad never really approved of me, and if he did it was out of pity , so i stopped trying to impress them through school, i flunked some courses i never stayed back a grade but i went from As student to Cs and i would lie to my parents whenever they asked why i wasnt acing classes, my parents victimized themselves as the perfect parents who work all day and do nothing but the best for there kids only for me to wrong them, i felt guilty but i kept semi passing school, anyways my dad didnt hit me much anymore my mom would be a hero if he ever wanted to, k so flash forward to 8th grade, Im coming home late and my phone dead so i cant call my parents i get home at 10 my mom waiting at the door and she rushes me in and , crying like the victim she is saying how i was inconsiderate, she makes me get into the cold running shower, we had been to south America earlier that year and she brought a small whip made from straw, she had been threatening me all year that she would use it if i fucked up, and me coming home late that day was her chance, she was worse than my dad, maybe i just remember it more and thats why, but she really did not care, she whipped me until my dad waked up and he actually felt bad for me so he told her to stop that my screaming would wake up the neighbors , man Ive gotten mad before and Ive hit the wall but Ive never been that angry for so long like my mom was that day. After my dad woke she left told me to go to sleep after the shower. The whip bruised my body really bad before breaking the outer skin layer, so i didnt bleed much but i hurt when i moved. The next morning my mom said to not tell anyone , you know family problems not something the law should get involved with, at this point i was and still am attached to my parents, i dont want to hate them and i do not know if it love or attachment i have towards them but i didnt want to hurt them so i kept quiet, my mom however could tell that i was upset with her and was acting shy and sorry for the week after, also my sister said i shouldnt be mad cause i deserved it and she. Got hit worse, so i cant complain. She is the same idiot that thinks violent games cause kids to do violent acts but didnt think hitting your kids was wrong , but i mean thank god none of my siblings are parents , k so fast forward from 8th grade to software year nothing big happened , some small stuff , like my dad slapped my ass and i got so fucking mad i cursed at him and he just didnt say anything, keep in mind i finally grew bigger than my parents so u know he didnt want to really hit me since i was grown i guess, idk thats a whole other thing i dont want to get into, anyway Im in soft more year of high-school and i have 5 demerits cause i was late 5 times by 1-2 minutes no big deal right, nope my dad saw the letter that was sent home for it and he rushed me and punched me so hard in the chest he knocked my wind out, i couldnt breathe for a bit and my mom got him off me but he honestly idk what his goal was he was going really hard if i didnt block my head i would been fucked for a couple of weeks Im sure. After that i wasnt hit much cause i threatened child protective services on them, to which they responded by saying how my siblings got beat worse and they where perfect people so the obvious problem was i wasnt hit enough for your own good you know, so yeah i started doing drugs, my girlfriend thought i was going to kill myself which admittedly i was trying to take enough hallucinogens in hopes id kill myself while high, but yeah i got sent to suicide watch, bam doctors therapist asking me questions, suicide watch didnt help much it just made it so that i would live with my sister and not my parents, however they both lived in the same house anyways so i mean fuck that it was stupid, anyways who would have guessed my sister couldnt take care of me and i tried to smoke a couple of times but she freaked out and whatever the fuck she was like you cant leave the house. So house arrest wasnt bad but she was just like my dad which made it worse, she literally would call me a pussy if i didnt do what she wanted, i didnt have the patience to tell her to fuck off so i ignored her . Eventually i moved back upstairs with my parents but i had more ground control i snuck out whenever i wanted and i could tell my parents to fuck off and they would also the whole time family from out of the country was living with us and my mom and dad said how bad i made them looked as parents with the whole stunt i pulled at the hospital, anyway senior year in high-school i just did what i want i passed despite my mother having breakdowns everyday cause she thought i was doomed to drop out of high-school, so i passed high-school Im in my first semester of college rn and well idk i wanna love my family i want to feel like their normal, but I dont know, and only this recent summer did my mom come out saying how my dad beat her before, not surprised i mean Im probably desensitized to their shit but idk i feel bad for her, also Im a dick to my mom she tries to overwhelm me as if to play the role of the caring parent so shes over bearing but i try to break her down for having kids so young and being so stupid in raising them, Im not gonna lie i like making her feel bad, its not right i shouldnt want that but theyve taken so much from me, , nevertheless this is just the gist of what my life with my parents has been like . anyways Im not a good person i know but any help ? At all in anything ? "

He told me that all I do is talk about killing myself, and that my depression is a bullshit lie. I sure am depressed, but I've never once said anything related to offing myself to him. He's made a point to bring up every moment of my life where I've expressed vulnerability to him, and called me a waste of a human being for every single one. In between his insults, he kept randomly throwing in how I have shitty friends, even though I've only introduced him to one person (whom he got along swimmingly with). I never know what his line of thinking is. He and his wife seem to enjoy just psychologically tormenting me, and it's beginning to make me feel like maybe I am just a piece of shit. I don't do anything, I literally do nothing; I sit around, look for work, and exercise. I try my hardest to stay away from them. I'm only here because I can't find work, and would be homeless otherwise. I just heard his wife in the other room telling him I don't care about them. If I try to step into the conversation and say that I do, it will only lead to hours of continued fighting, with him telling me I don't care. **Nothing** I do seems to change his mind; he thinks my every action is driven by a desire to say 'fuck you dad, you're a fucking joke,' when that couldn't be further from the truth. I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy. So much happens that for hours after the fact I can't think straight. I'm struggling to form coherent sentences now and my mind keeps drifting to the hurtful things he's said. I just want my family to treat me like family. I don't know what to do He calls my dog a dickhead, I just heard him say it from the other room. He's *so fucking aggressive,* and I know his wife is afraid of him, yet she encourages his behavior.. Is getting out of this house the only option I have? There has to be a way to make him see the light. Honestly I think he may have a mental issue, is there some way to convince him to see a doctor without making him violent? I'm sorry for the ranting, I just really want someone to talk to"

My mother was narcissist as well, but this new woman is off the charts. Having to move on from my Nmom and my Nex were some of the hardest things I ever did. Ive been NC with my mom for almost four years and NC with my Nex for five years, despite when I recently ran into my Nex a couple months ago at the store; I didnt speak to him but thats a whole other topic! Also just for context, he married this woman within two weeks of meeting her. LIST OF WHAT MY NSTEPMOM HAS DONE: -Projects her insecurity and low self esteem on to me. I called her out on/ questioned her on her insecurity/ low self esteem and she immediately lost it, started yelling at me and said maybe I did. her lack of integrity onto me (I thought this one a lot, I thought of myself to be very honest, and full of integrity) her eating disorder onto me. We both have one (or at least are working on it, its not severe its just a preoccupation with loosing weight/bingeing). Shell call me out when I binge (sees dishes in the sink), but hides the fact she gained like twenty lbs in a month after she lost a lot of weight before the wedding. How do you gain 20lbs in a month? BINGING! But shell never admit that. Talk about lack of integrity. My dad had to hide food from her but shell tell my dad when I polish off any food. -bends the truth: She tried to make it look like she had a bachelors when she only had an AA -Talks constantly -Interrupts and talks louder to win arguments -Manipulates my dad by walking away -Talks about her self in third person like shes special (got to get used to that when (her name) is around) -Uses personal information against me to make me look stupid or invalidated. I opened up to her about some stuff (my edad suggested this) and she used it all to attack me -The very definition of a bible thumper. One who uses the Bible to attack/defame others' characters instead of as a guide to proper living. These people tend to be depressingly ignorant of anything else except the Bible and behavior as expected by the religious.This definition is admittedly from urban dictionary but I find it pretty accurate. She tried to make me seem like an inadequate Christian compared to her. -Has to be the star of the show -Extremely controlling -Has convinced my dad Im toxic and manipulative -Snooped through my room when I lived there (I have since moved out). She justified in front of my dad by saying she was just walking by and happened to turn the door knob. Then she realized that answer was full of shit and said I just wanted to open some windows to let air through the house. Its my room, she had no right. -Pushed me and kneed me behind a door where no one could see when she was drunk. I pushed back a little and said dont push me. I didnt dare fight back because I wasnt going to give her any more fuel to make me look like the bad guy. My dad and brother tell me it didnt happen. Tbh this part really hurts. My own father is married to this piece of shit. -Told me she cared more about her sons than my brother and I, but my dad cared about all of us (her sons, and her boys) -Controlled the finances right when they got married. She wanted to buy a mustang and make my dads property a wedding venue. My dad and I found it far fetched by let her gab about the idea of it any way. -Shes labeled herself an empath -She wanted me to go to college and come back home after college. I asked her why and she said because your the girl... and something about grandkids. I found it sexist and insulting for her to assume she was entitled to my future children (if that even happens). -EXTREMELY SEXIST AND RACIST. I have a pretty dark sense of humor tbh and crack a few jokes that might make some sensitive people cringe but she takes it wayyyy too far. To the point were she actually believes she is superior to other races! -Is very vague about her past failed relationships and one marriage. She paints the image that her family is perfect. Labels her son (WHO REFUSES TO SPEAK TO HER) a narcissist, his wife is a whore, and her dad is a malignant narcissist. She claims her two sons that speak with her are closer than ever (she barley sees them except the one who in in fact a mamas boy (I pity him)). -When you call her on bs or challenge her point of view she becomes extremely defensive. -She manipulates my dad to think that men lead. Im not here to debate this theory. My point in is that she is a hypocrite when she says this because she leads, not my dad. She just says this to make my dad think he does, he has no control. She nags my dad, and interrupts him. He has no say. -Shes a huge hypocrite. -Tried to convince me I was had no excuse to be sad or have issues because I was never sexually or physically abused. The list goes on... shes honestly worse than my Nmother. I was more blind trauma bonded to my Nmom, which made it hard to let go of her. After the event in which she physically pushed me, I moved out the next morning. My dad begged me to come back but I declined and said it wasnt happening. They all said I couldnt do it and I proved their asses wrong. Im doing just fine on my own financially. My dad later admited it was good I moved out. Im having an extremely difficult time moving on. My family is convinced Im wrong. Ive been used as the scape goat in many situations before. I know Im easily manipulated. My dad believes Im a bad person. He is with this new woman almost 24/7. My dad is happier than Ive ever seen him in my life and I am so happy he is happy. That being said, my dad is convinced Im in the wrong. Not only have I lost my mom (I havent spoken to her in four years) Ive now I lost my dad. Over the past few months I have spent a tremendous amount of time trying to become self aware and examine my own faults. Ive looked at were I could be wrong in specific areas. Ive looked at where others were wrong in specific areas. I even admitted my own faults to my dad. Im driving myself crazy convincing myself I am the bad guy. Ive made mistakes, but does that mean I have to be guilty forever? I have apologized to my father and others about how I was wrong. I made a long list and read it to him. This was all shit before and in high school before he married this woman. Here is the letter I read to him, feel free to scroll through to the bottom. **~**names have been token out to conceal identities (end of letter is marked by a bolded **~**) *Dad I love you, I feel that your choice to be with a woman who controls you and your relationship with your children is toxic I would love to have you in my life, but I didnt marry (my stepmom). Her choices are her own, but I only want loving kind and supportive people in my life. * *Im an adult now, even though I would like your support love and guidance, I will not sacrifice my mental and emotional well being by having (my stepmom) in my life. She has never offered love or made me feel welcome in my own home and even around you. She has alienated me. She had to control me, and everything in the house.* *I want to start off by saying how I wronged you. I am in no way and angel. However, I am in no way the mentally unstable, alcoholic, bad guy your wife has painted me to be.* *Freshman year* *Lying: I lied about where I was, who I was around.* *I will admit getting out has taught me a lot whether you know it or not. I know it was hard but I feel like I had to see what was bad to know what was good. This wasnt about you, I didnt intend to hurt you.* *When I was little you were always the one that had to carry out the discipline. I hated you when I was little for being the disciplinary figure. I actually felt guilty about this later on and expressed this to mom. Mom was always the one saving me. This is how mom manipulated me.* *I tried to protect mom from you dad as a child. I remember you and mom were fighting once and I stepped in and called a name in defense of mom. You got a hold of me, then my mom grabbed my feet and finally you got me and put me in my room. When you were gone mom let me out.* *It wasnt until I got older did I finally see mom for who she truly was. I finally saw that you werent really the bad guy. You said how actually had to stay married to my mom because you didnt want to lose me to mom and never see me again. I cant thank you enough for that.* *In high school I began to rebel. My freshman year of high school was probably one if the most chaotic times of my life. Mom began drinking more frequently than I had ever seen her, I was surrounded by toxic friends, you were dating a woman with a daughter who had a piss poor attitude (we had to accompany you to visit her every weekend) and at the end of the year I was getting ready to put moms intervention together (I was fifteen).* *I was beyond selfish with all this stress. I was treating my good friends like shit, and drinking all the time. I treated you the worst. You got me in trouble one day and grounded me basically all year for smoking a cigarette. I was barley able to hang out with anyone which really pissed off little fifteen year old me. I talked mad shit about you even though you were really only trying to protect me in the only way you thought you could. Mom was the one who came to the rescue, she gave me some freedom. Again, is is how mom manipulated me.* *I ran away from home once that year. I got caught within four hours (I know I was that dumb). You were at the school when they brought me back. I had nothing to say to the school and went back to class. I felt nothing.* *A couple years later you expressed to me how hurt you were. You said how the principal gave you look like you abused me. You started to cry. I barley ever see you cry. I had nothing to say, I just cried silently. I never gained your trust back again. I feel terrible for how I treated you.* *I also stole tequila from you.* *Anorexia manipulation* *Being so sick and making you worry for my health when you shouldnt have. In my irrational mind at the time I was afraid that I wouldnt get what I wanted if I gained weight. I know you may not understand this but I felt like a kid again in a sick way. I was being coddled and babied again. I know it was wrong.* *Bulimia manipulation* *My bulimia was wrong. I put my health at risk and wasted food and money.* *Alcohol stealing justification* *I stole you and grandmas booze. I didnt pay for it. I was not legally 21. I had no right to steal your liquor.* *My pride/ego* *I know I have this issue sometimes. I like to make myself seem bigger and better than I really am. Im trying not to do this so much anymore and just be my authentic self. Ill find myself inflating my self image a lot when I shouldnt. Im making people think Im something Im not.* *I know my pride and ego stop me from having relationships. However Im also a picky person and am very choosy about who I spend my time with. Theres a lot of screwed up people out there I choose not to hang around and there is also a lot of good people I just dont connect with. I like to enjoy who I am around and I dont want to fake it. Im not exactly the most normal person around and Im making an effort to learn to be more social. Work has helped me a lot with this.* *Grandma was right. I am manipulative. I feel guilty about it.* *I know its hard to find people out there. Especially at your age. You chose this woman. I did not.* *Im not asking you to break up with your wife.* *I appreciate your help. In a world like this you really are all I have.* *I want to invite you into my life. However, Im setting boundaries on who I choose to allow into my life. I will not allow people like your wife into my life. Its draining.* *I know you dont trust me. You havent since my freshman year. I dont tell you everything because I know youll worry. I cannot put my life on pause to keep you from worrying.* *I want you to know I will always love you whether you chose to co-sign or not. Your truly are one of the best people Gods given me within this life. Without you I wouldnt be who I am today. Thank you for what you have done.* *I know we are all human and we are just flawed. I know I am not perfect, and neither is anyone else.* *However I am older now and am able to understand more. It took longer for me to navigate than Id like to admit. Yet I think Im beginning to understand more now.* *Youre my dad and I always want to be open with you. You wont always agree with me, but that doesnt mean I dont want to have a relationship with you.* *I suppose all I am wanting from you (because obviously I didnt write this letter for nothing) is to think for yourself and allow us to have a relationship without your wife.* *I also want to spend time with you and (my brother) if he would like. Id also like to spend time with grandma and grandpa if theyd like. I know Ive been busy and my schedule is not exactly the easiest to plan around.* *However I want to make this work. I know you wont always agree with me. However Id still like to have a relationship with you and do fun things again, I mean your my dad, I know I dont live there anymore but your all I have.* *I will admit I feel betrayed. I know I am not really betrayed by you, I know your actions are not meant to hurt me. I cannot help but see this manipulation. I cannot help but see how you are in fact being manipulated. I cannot help but see that you are in fact a contribute to this toxic family dynamic we have had all our lives. It started with my mother, and your doing it again with (stepmom).* *YOU ARE AN ENABLER. YOU ARE CODEPENDENT. I saw it with mom, I saw it with me (yes I did indeed take advantage of you to justify my drinking and my eating disorder, etc) and Im seeing it with (my stepmom). Im no doctor, Im not god, but I cannot help but call bs when I see it. Im not telling you to not be with her, but I dont think this should stop us from having a relationship without (my stepmom).* *Im not an alcoholic. Do I like to drink; yes, did I push my limits when I was at katies; yes, did I push my limits when I blacked out; yes. Is there any justification for this, absolutely not.* *Idk exactly what (my stepmom) had been telling you but I feel like I have to sneak around to tell you my side.* *Its so easy to paint me to look like the bad guy. I drink when Im underage. I enjoy my freedom and lied to get it. Im labeled as toxic because I struggle socially and I choose not to speak to your wife.* *You dont have to give me any money, and you dont have to agree with me. However Im writing this out of truth. Im writing this out of vulnerability (as hard as that is whether you know that or not).* *I just want you to stop bringing up coming over and being around your wife when I have already told you I will not be around her. My view of your wife stands firm and it has not swayed. Ive logically thought this though. Ive tried to make myself seem like that bad guy in this current situation and it just doesnt match up. Im justified and had the right to leave. I may have left the house, but that doesnt mean I dont want a relationship with you.* *Have I been hurt by you in the past. Yes. I have. Ive always wanted to make you proud and Ill never succeed in doing that no matter what you say, Im not perfect. Making you proud all the time is impossible and Im just going to go my own way now. You may not agree with me all the time but I have to go.* *Also for the record when you said drinking and drugging that other day. I dont drug and havent had a drink since I moved out. I dont even smoke weed, it makes me sick it always has and I didnt want to admit it because I didnt want to look like the pussy that I always was when it came to weed.* *This is the life I chose. It comes with consequences, like having to take care of myself and work hard. Mother chose her path and so did you. I chose not to speak to my mom before I had knowledge of toxic family dynamic. I chose not to speak to her because her drinking (her choices) effected our relationship. The bad out weighed the good, she was unreliable.* *However, its you call. Has the bad out weighed the good with me in your eyes? You literally live five minutes away from me and your work is right next to my house. I may not be able to come see you, but we could go out to dinner, we could fish or take a walk.* *I truly dont want to continue hurting you. But whether you acknowledge it or not, your wife has hurt me.* *We could call and chat but I know thats not really your thing and frankly it isnt mine either.* *Im telling you all this because I feel like there is a wedge between us. Having your wife try and make you think how horrible and toxic of a person I am doesnt help either. So I thought Id go ahead and admit my short comings to you. You bring up having a relationship with (my stepmom) and coming over to the house every time I see you. Its all you talk about. I dont mind hearing about her, shes what you enjoy and its what makes you happy. However, dont force me to have a relationship with someone Im not willing to have.* ~ Every time I see my dad he is trying to tell me to burry the hatchet and forgive her. As if she has nothing to apologize for. My dad says, okay, maybe she was a little wrong, but he actually gets angry at me for not burying the hatchet. Ive already hung out with them, he wants me to apologize to her. I HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR. I cant even have a conversation with my dad without him talking about her when I ask him how he is doing; shes literally his life! I lost my dad. I lost respect for him. And he lost respect for me. He claims I dont respect him because I dont respect his wife and they are one. I cant fake respect unless its a job I suppose. Im moving on in life without my parents. Its a lonely road, but Ill get there. Where ever that is. **TL;DR;** My stepmom my is a narcissist and she has painted me to seem like the bad guy. My dad and my brother treat me different. I have sense moved out and I have no control over it, I just accept it and try to be self aware and do better. "
240,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My stepmom my is a narcissist and she has painted me to seem like the bad guy,9,9k1r68,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9k1r68/my_stepmom_my_is_a_narcissist_and_she_has_painted/,2018-09-30 09:59:49,"I need help and support moving on I made a recent post on here about having my dad recently marry a narcissist. My mother was narcissist as well, but this new woman is off the charts. Having to move on from my Nmom and my Nex were some of the hardest things I ever did. Ive been NC with my mom for almost four years and NC with my Nex for five years, despite when I recently ran into my Nex a couple months ago at the store; I didnt speak to him but thats a whole other topic! Also just for context, he married this woman within two weeks of meeting her. LIST OF WHAT MY NSTEPMOM HAS DONE: -Projects her insecurity and low self esteem on to me. I called her out on/ questioned her on her insecurity/ low self esteem and she immediately lost it, started yelling at me and said maybe I did. her lack of integrity onto me (I thought this one a lot, I thought of myself to be very honest, and full of integrity) her eating disorder onto me. We both have one (or at least are working on it, its not severe its just a preoccupation with loosing weight/bingeing). Shell call me out when I binge (sees dishes in the sink), but hides the fact she gained like twenty lbs in a month after she lost a lot of weight before the wedding. How do you gain 20lbs in a month? BINGING! But shell never admit that. Talk about lack of integrity. My dad had to hide food from her but shell tell my dad when I polish off any food. -bends the truth: She tried to make it look like she had a bachelors when she only had an AA -Talks constantly -Interrupts and talks louder to win arguments -Manipulates my dad by walking away -Talks about her self in third person like shes special (got to get used to that when (her name) is around) -Uses personal information against me to make me look stupid or invalidated. I opened up to her about some stuff (my edad suggested this) and she used it all to attack me -The very definition of a bible thumper. One who uses the Bible to attack/defame others' characters instead of as a guide to proper living. These people tend to be depressingly ignorant of anything else except the Bible and behavior as expected by the religious.This definition is admittedly from urban dictionary but I find it pretty accurate. She tried to make me seem like an inadequate Christian compared to her. -Has to be the star of the show -Extremely controlling -Has convinced my dad Im toxic and manipulative -Snooped through my room when I lived there (I have since moved out). She justified in front of my dad by saying she was just walking by and happened to turn the door knob. Then she realized that answer was full of shit and said I just wanted to open some windows to let air through the house. Its my room, she had no right. -Pushed me and kneed me behind a door where no one could see when she was drunk. I pushed back a little and said dont push me. I didnt dare fight back because I wasnt going to give her any more fuel to make me look like the bad guy. My dad and brother tell me it didnt happen. Tbh this part really hurts. My own father is married to this piece of shit. -Told me she cared more about her sons than my brother and I, but my dad cared about all of us (her sons, and her boys) -Controlled the finances right when they got married. She wanted to buy a mustang and make my dads property a wedding venue. My dad and I found it far fetched by let her gab about the idea of it any way. -Shes labeled herself an empath -She wanted me to go to college and come back home after college. I asked her why and she said because your the girl... and something about grandkids. I found it sexist and insulting for her to assume she was entitled to my future children (if that even happens). -EXTREMELY SEXIST AND RACIST. I have a pretty dark sense of humor tbh and crack a few jokes that might make some sensitive people cringe but she takes it wayyyy too far. To the point were she actually believes she is superior to other races! -Is very vague about her past failed relationships and one marriage. She paints the image that her family is perfect. Labels her son (WHO REFUSES TO SPEAK TO HER) a narcissist, his wife is a whore, and her dad is a malignant narcissist. She claims her two sons that speak with her are closer than ever (she barley sees them except the one who in in fact a mamas boy (I pity him)). -When you call her on bs or challenge her point of view she becomes extremely defensive. -She manipulates my dad to think that men lead. Im not here to debate this theory. My point in is that she is a hypocrite when she says this because she leads, not my dad. She just says this to make my dad think he does, he has no control. She nags my dad, and interrupts him. He has no say. -Shes a huge hypocrite. -Tried to convince me I was had no excuse to be sad or have issues because I was never sexually or physically abused. The list goes on... shes honestly worse than my Nmother. I was more blind trauma bonded to my Nmom, which made it hard to let go of her. After the event in which she physically pushed me, I moved out the next morning. My dad begged me to come back but I declined and said it wasnt happening.

I posted this somewhere else but did not get a lot of response and the more researching I've done I realized this is the best sub reddit for it.. At 30yrs old I finally realized why I think the way I do, and why I struggle with forming relationships. I was raised by a family whose motto could easily be summarized as""stick your neck out for no one, not even blood. And when you you do, make sure there are as many strings attached as possible so you can pull out with little invested or destroy you and them both."" This upbringing forged a victim mentality. I view the world cautiously, everyone is a potentially threat, a potential betrayal, and as a consequence I see myself as someone who is incapable of maintaining relationships for who I am but for what I have. As an example, in high school I gave my date her ticket to the prom a couple of day before and my dad responded ""You big dummy, now she can go with someone else."" As though I wasn't a worthy date, as though my dad actually knew anything about the girl [he didn't even know her name]. Protection over courage; always give with strings attached. Or even as an adult my parents have given every excuse in the world not to help me in times of need. If it wasnt for friends and parent of friends I would not be where I am now, nor would I understand how to give to someone solely out of love them or whats best for them. I now realize the problem.. I am the problem.. my social skills are ass, because I view the world and other people as a threat and I have been trying to control others through resources just as my parents have done with me. Not only that but I view all acts of kindness as potential freedom traps. Help? I dont know how to get better. I now realize building relationships is about vulnerability but I am terrified of being vulnerable. Plus years of living this way has given me plenty of evidence to back up my confirmation bias."

I am married to a son that was raised by a woman with NPD. There are so many nuances of this, but I need to keep it brief, because I need your help (note, I/we are also seeing a therapist now, so I am not without that). To start: I am married to a man who was raised by an abusive mother who has NPD. He joined the military to escape, his sister joined the convent. His parents are wealthy, he was raised in the best schools, thus the abuse was hidden. I have been married nine years now and we have three children together. I love him desperately and dearly. We married in a fever, both of us students of an ivy league school (I only include this detail not for some idiotic arrogance, but to share that it wasn't some flash dance marriage), after a few months. His mother was, and always has been, cruel. She hated that we got married, as I am from the Midwest, and she described me as ""blue collar."" Whatever, who cares. She has not acknowledged the birth of my last two daughters. I intercepted an email, early in our marriage, where she told her son that he was ""incapable of love and a terrible person."" I was shocked. I am close with my family, my mother especially, and this was language I had never heard (for the record, though, I heard it every time I visited them). &amp;#x200B; We went NC for about three years. We live in the middle of the country, they live on the east coast, so that was easy. I did the wrong thing, in that I encouraged my husband to reconnect with them, because I have a hard time not understanding that family, despite it all, loves you. I was wrong. Fellow friends of r/raisedbynarcissists, I want to thank you. You have probably helped my husband in more ways that he can count with your honesty and vulnerability. But that's also why I am here. I don't know what to do, and I am hoping you can help me out with some perspective. I've been married for nine years now with three girls. I left everything to marry him, yet found careers and worked my way to the top. But my anxiety has grown to a level I don't understand and doesn't seem natural. This past week, we flew back to his hometown for a wedding. It was the first time, really, since our wedding years ago, that we were with his parents and his whole family. His extended family was wonderful, and we managed to avoid his parents for the most part. I worked very hard to make this special for him, and for him to feel special. &amp;#x200B; Two days later, I had the idea that he see his grandmother that he hasn't seen in twenty years. It was five hours drive time from this wedding, but I asked if we could extend our trip so he could have that special moment. So we did the drive, he saw his grandma and she met her great grandparents. The next day, we got up to leave. It's hard to set the scene, but I had an executive job before we married. When we were first married, I had to leave my job due to his job, so I switched what I did, and eventually, worked my way into an executive position within that company. But I was also raising three girls, while he was away, and had no care. Then he lost his job a couple of times, and I floated us on my salary and insurance. So now he has a new job, and we are putting all our money into seeing his family and grandma. &amp;#x200B; All went basically well, until we were leaving in the morning. I asked him to help me find the portable DVD players for our kids. He said he couldn't find them. I said, ""well, I can't leave without them."" in a normal tone of voice. I kept looking and I found them. &amp;#x200B; One week, all his family, all the work I put into organizing this trip, making sure he saw his grandma, doing it all, I'm in the car reading him Wikipedia articles and trying to make him happy, and he's just angry. I ask him five times, at least ,if he will talk to me. Nothing. Finally, we get back to our Air B n B in Vermont, and he just unleashes on me. Tells me that I criticized him and that's just ""how he responds."" I'm not really writing the whole story out; I was just so hurt. This was me as a scapegoat to his family. No one on reddit knows me, or what I've put into this, but he was doing to me exactly what his mother did to him in his life and it was just an empty. I was just empty. &amp;#x200B; When we finally got back to the air Bn B, I drove to a Safeway, and just threw up. Everything was perfect, I worked so hard, our children were lovely, all was well, and then it was like he had to put all his rage on me. The worst part, when I got back from the safeway, he was happy and laughing. Like he hurt me and he felt better to do so. Reddit, I acknowledge my mistakes, but this was not that, it was out of the blue. It felt like I was now cast in the role of him. I've been married nine years and this is continual. &amp;#x200B; Now, I realize this is a silly, rambling question and reddit's answer is always, seek counseling. That it imperative. But I am wondering, as the son of an abusive mother with NPD, if this behavior is constant after I'm seeing for nine years, am I married to someone with this, as well? Is there a way to stop it? I'm tired of walking on eggshells. I want to help him. I don't want to be here. I don't want to be a scapegoat anymore. Is there advice you can offer? I have children by this person; I always thought it was just his mother with NPD, and he had ""fleas"" (his word he found from here), but lately his fleas have been that he responds a certain way and that's just his response to irrational criticism. Children of NPD parents, how did you not repeat the cycle? I don't want to get divorced. I'm too far in and I love him. But I'm terrified that I'm married to someone that is comfortable with the pattern of NPD behavior and is repeating it. How do I stop this?"

NDad's reaction/ability to cope is unexpected,12,9713q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9713q2/lost_brother_in_car_accident_almost_a_year_ago/,2018-08-14 05:01:21,"Hi all. Long time lurker. Quick background: I consider both my parents to have at least strong narcissistic traits. My dad has cheated on every woman he's ever been with (and would brag about it ), he had no interest in parenting my half-brother and I , he lied constantly and was amused by being able to trick people. He is very intelligent and very manipulative. Was disgusted by my half-brother growing up as his mom would overfeed him and he gained weight. As we aged, my dad changed from belittling him to trying to force him to go to school, be better , etc. My brother starting lashing out at my Dad which made my dad try harder to win him over. He would very much buy his love with money, gifts , a car etc. Last October, my brother died very unexpectedly in a car accident at 25. He and my dad were not on great terms. It has absolutely and completely destroyed my father. He has shown so much vulnerability (albeit, shamefully) to me . I tell him he needs to let his grief out and that he shouldn't be ashamed. He tells me how depressed he is, he has lost a ton of weight, he is really falling apart. He calls me more than ever. He seems so remorseful and this loss seems to have shattered his mask. We were never close but I'm really trying to make an effort to forgive and be there for my dad right now. But after the way he treated me my whole life idk if this is wise... Have any of you ever lost a sibling? How did your parents cope? I always thought narcs couldn't love but now I'm questioning if my Dad really was one? Tl;Dr my brother died last year. Ndad is destroyed. I find myself wanting to forgive him and let my Dad in more. He needs me right now. "

In any situation, she will side with the bigger guy, whoever that might be. She actually literally fetishizes maleness specifically. She hates women and children in general. I used to think her misogyny stemmed primarily from jealousy of other women, but I think they represent to her a fear that she may also be weak or targeted in some way. If someone is being bullied by someone else in any situation, she will side with the bully. I thought this was specific to my n, but for the last 4 months Ive been dating someone who was the scapegoat of his nparents. His GC brother is kind of a hyper masculine, hyper aggressive meathead. My boyfriend is quite physically small, but hes also very sensitive/intellectual and the type to try to think things out rather than ever hurt anyone. I believe that he was targeted by his parents for two reasons: his refusal to conform to their dog eat dog perspective of life, and his tendency to question things. I remember how much my parents hated when I didnt blindly conform to the world around me/unquestioningly bend to their will. I see constant victim blaming with ns. They just want to gain the favor of the perpetrator and lack empathy for anyone being hurt. It seems like they live in a world of winners and losers, of attackers and attacked, and the latter, rather than the former, is unfairly villainized. My brother is older and bigger than me, and would do all sorts of sociopathic shit to me, but I saw a look of disgust and disdain in my mothers eyes when I accidentally shed a tear. I was being hurt, and like a lion chasing down the weakest of the herd, this made her see me as prey. I suppose this behavior is quite simply what logically follows when someone doesnt have empathy.

Someone I'm really ashamed of and embarrassed for - not me. (And I am seeing my therapist tomorrow, thank God, so I will not feel so isolated in this, but for now I'm reaching out to this community that has been so supportive and felt like a safe space more than anyone I know, where I don't have to be afraid that I'm burdening anyone.) At some point recently that feeling of current me vs. past me shifted and I've had a flood of memories, emotions, and realizations. For the first time I'm starkly seeing the pattern of just how badly I was abused by a string of family members, alleged friends, my ex who I already knew was abusive, and others, and I finally admitted to myself that I was raped by two men, if not more in the gray area of the men who had sex with me when I was completely wasted and stumbling around. That just fully hit me tonight and I spent much of the night sobbing. I'm also confronted by memories of my behavior from when I was really not well. I'm so full of heartbreak, shame, and rage. For so long I told myself that something was wrong with me and that's why bad things kept happening. Or at the very least, I was a very poor decision maker who didn't value my own safety (because I was fun and loved to drink and party, I was sexually free, totally normal to meet much older internet strangers in the woods for a date, no repressed trauma here!). It's so hard to not see yourself as a piece of shit when everyone is treating you like one. And now I'm seeing that no, I have value, I have worth - and I can't believe that these monsters inflicted so much pain without any thought. I know that they sought me out because of my clear vulnerability, because I seemed like I would be easy to abuse, and I'm so disgusted - and it's finally with them instead of me, at least partially."

While I was going no contact I was seeing a therapist who was covered under my insurance. It took me forever to realise that she herself was a covert narcissist. She constantly gave my abusive family the benefit of the doubt, suggested that I go back to them, and seemed to be disinterested and even amused when I would would talk about the abuse from my family. It took me forever to let myself realize how painful it was to constantly be invalidated by the one person whose support I thought had. I think she was aware of that vulnerability and ... Took advantage of that. After all, who was I going to tell? My mom? A friend? Every friend I've had was exactly like my mom- emotionally abusive. I feel that it is important for me to continue going to therapy but I am scared of getting hurt again. The only other therapists in my area who accept my insurance are at a drug rehab. I feel that they're even less liable to believe what I say. Or if they do believe me... Maybe they'll enjoy earning my trust then subtly invalidating me, over and over. I don't think I can take another go-round with a fucked up emotionally abusive weirdo parading around as a therapist. There is a therapist who labels herself as being ""trauma informed."" She is not covered under my insurance though, and the copay would be around $90/session. I don't want to go to another messed up therapist who doesn't give a fuck about their clients and is amused by them. I also do not want to pay 90 each time I go. (and what if the ""trauma informed"" therapist ends up being a covert narc?) I don't really know what to do. I'm feeling really disoriented right now, confused, overwhelmed, like I can't believe what happened, and I don't know how to go from here. I have literally no one to talk to about all this. I fucking hate emotional abuse. It's just... They're right when they call it a fog. "

Failing that in getting nagged to go to the job centre and claim for benefits so I can give 1/3 away each week this is the absolute last resort tho but hes glorified it bc my feelings dont matter.

Essentially my whole life, I have felt like a total ghost. Some would find that to be a relief, but its inflicted with intense overwhelming humiliation and overbearing vulnerability. It's not normal to go out into public and talk to a stranger having to hold you tears back violently. To feel so painstakingly transparent. The familiar feeling of being turned down by everyone- that your pain is unwanted weakness- such paranoia and utter loneliness. Who is this lost child that thinks she is so so broken in a world full of mirroring shadows? It feels like a joke I play on myself to keep me down, and to see the light tin that would be even worse because maybe it wasn't so bad. But I don't feel alone because everyone sees through me. I can't integrate my own story without the thought of another. It's like my story doesn't matter, I""m just a ghost talking to people through glass walls and they see but they really don't want to. I remember reading a story of a man who did ayahuasca within a circle of other people. He said he put his headphones in and pulled down his hood. In that moment I realized even more deeply, that I wouldn't feel I had the right to do that. I wouldn't have the ability to shut myself off, even if I tried, I would feel shaken, invaded, and disposable. Really, what is this? Are we all stuck in child mode? We just didn't grow up. I am 25 but when I look into everyone's eyes, I am baffled that they have a mask, or a wall, or even their own belief system that they hold confidently-that they speak without fluidly. I am absolutely struck by those things. I see people stuck in one loop or another for years, and instantly I take their fate as my own. It feels so arrogant, so grandiose. Theres so much beauty in being a ghost if I just surrendered. Theres so much honor in being small, in being the passerby. In fact it was where I once felt peace, but the tables have seemed to turn and theres no where to hide.

I really liked this toy and I cried a lot. Went to look for it and it was gone the next day. * I was about to ask for a snack bar in the shop and my mother pulled my hair because she didn't want me to ask her in front of the shop employee. She, I guess, couldn't afford it and was ashamed to deny me a snack bar in front of him. Meanwhile my parents had money for cigarettes and alcohol * I am a guy and I didn't want to be dressed in yoga pants in kindergarden in some stupid theatre where I was terribly ashamed to play a bunny. I begged my mom not to make me do it but she refused with an iron anger. She just wasn't having it. * I was like 4 and was playing. I remember hanging from like 2 meters but it was a lot for the baby that I was. Under me was concrete (imagine if i fell on my head and wtf was i alone anyways?). I hanged for my life and remember yelling my lungs out and my father managed to hear me from 100 meters far away where he was drinking beer in a bar outside of it. He ran and saved me. * A friend of my father gave me a cigarette when I was 3. I took a puff and I spit it out in his feet automatically. My father found out and didn't do anything to him. * I remember trying to play with my father and he would constantly tell me off and things like ""Don't touch me"". He literally meant it. * They made me kiss another girl my age. She was the daughter of a friends of my parents. It's pretty weird, we were like 3 and there is a video of it. * I was playing, again, a super dangerous game, unsupervised. Ended up bashing my mouth in concrete edge. I remember crying, being all bloody and my parents being angry at me and rushing me home. * My parents were always fighting and I would go to them crying begging them to stop. * Mother spanked me occasionally when she ""losed"" it. * My father teached me how to punch kids in the face. I did punch them and I was punished even in kindergarden ... * I remember stealing toys in kindergarden as well * Literally not one single hug, ""I love you"" or expression of love &amp;#x200B; **Age 7-14** * All my toys were given to a child of some friend of my father, by my father. **ALL MY CHILDHOOD TOYS AND HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME. I WOULD GIVE A LOT TO HAVE THESE MEMORIES BACK.** * I was one of the really, really bad kids at school. I used to beat up the boys AND the girls a lot. The teachers would always say about me - ""he wasn't raised at all"" * My father yelled at me a lot. My mother was more sinister than him and I feared her more because she used to beat me up when I was younger. Once she slapped me across the face in that age range. * My father got drunk daily (probably when I was in kindergarden too) * My father would be mad at me daily. He yelled at me and called me ""little ungrateful shit"" and things of this nature. Like he would open the door and kick my shoes and yell ""How many times have I told you not to put them in the middle of the hallway""? Weekly I would go to sleep wishing he would drop dead. Any time he would start unlocking the front door my stomach would go in knot. Most of the time he would first get drunk and right before I would fall asleep before school, he would enter my room and be mad at me for some bullshit like ""How many times have I told you to not leave your socks like that"". * Around the age of 11 my father MADE ME shower with him. I was absolutely, devastatingly embarrassed but he and my mother insisted. * Murderous rage from my father for literally nothing. * My mother would tell me to stay away from because he is drunk on a daily basis. * Promised to buy me a scooter if I leave him alone for something - didn't. Later refused that he promised. ""Don't remember."" * Any time I would get sick and lay in bed feeling terrible my father would get angry at me for ""whining"" so much * Literally not one single hug, ""I love you"" or expression of love &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Age 14-24 (today)** * I cried maybe like twice since the age of 7 to the age of 18. I just had no feelings. I was like me parents and I was teached that having feelings is basically insane. This is how I perceived it. I was rock solid and after the age 18 I started actually having emotions. * Was given money weekly to get out and get drunk at clubs since the age of 14. Got into plenty of fights. Stole gold and got tattoed with the money from the gold and I was only 14. My parents didn't give a shit about the tattoos. * To this day I can't stand my father and we can't talk for more than a minute without getting into a fight. * I confronted them about their abuse and they would always get mad at me for ""blaming my shortcomings on them"" and ""choosing the easy way out to just blame it on them"" and ""we were raised the same way, so what?"". * Later they apologized * I don't know absolutely anything about my parents. They never talked about their feelings or just about anything. It would always be about me. Conversations go like this &gt; I talk about me &gt; My father disagrees with something and is demeaning/rude &gt; I am triggered &gt; He is triggered &gt; verbal fight * My mother is somehow always on my fathers side, yet if I try to be passive and endure my father she would always break down crying and tell my father ""When will you stop terrorizing us?"" * I literally am absolutely used to this kind of drama, WEEKLY if not DAILY * I was never, EVER, given one single advice about anything related to social skills or life in general. When I confronted my father on a few occasions about this he would say ""Life is the best teacher"". This is actually his excuse for not raising me for a minute. I wish he would teach me how to relate to girls or how to deal with guys. I had my first girlfriend at the age of 22 because I had severe fear of intimacy because I never knew intimacy or vulnerability because my parents were ice cold ruthless rulers. By the age of 18 I was into probably 20 fights on the street being a tough boy. My role model was the local gangster-killer. * My father supposedly apologized to me and admitted that he ""has also made mistakes"" but yet he still remains absolutely toxic. I have been abroad the last 4 years and when my parents would call me 9/10 times I would talk only to my mother. He is either busy/outside/ or just has ""nothing to say"". * Lately I finally stepped on my feet after being suicidal the last 3 years (to which I received 0 support). I finally started being able to keep a job after literally changing 73 jobs for the last 3 years. I finally made some income and being the opportunist that I am I have saved most of it and only after being at work for 4 weeks I have managed to start a small business on the side. When I told my parents about it my father started critisizing immediately my ways of making this business (it's completely legal - i am selling sweets). In stead of congratulating me or encouraging me he did that. * Of course, NOW, when I finally have stepped on my feet and am thriving towards a goal, my father, all of a sudden, NEEDS me to come back home to him because he misses me so much. His voice has changed from an iron-fist dictator to a mellow, sweet, victim gay saint. It's frustrating because it just screams how fake he is when he behaves like this. It's cringey obvious. * I was in an absolutely brutal car crash. When my father was driving towards it in stead of just parking by the road and come to me (maybe i would have been dead or dying right now, this is how serious it was), he looked for a fucking parking spot that was legal to park. **HE COMPLAINED TO ME HOW HE HAD TO GO OUT OF THE HOUSE TO DRIVE TOWARDS THE CRASH SITE AND LOOK FOR A PARKING SPOT. WHEN I ASKED HIM ""WTF YOU ACTUALLY LOOKED FOR A PARKING AREA TO PARK YOU FUCKING CAR?"" - HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT.** This is how emotionless my parents are- even when their kid is probably fucking dying they are still rational, obedient citizens looking for a parking spot because god forbid he gets a fucking parking fine. &amp;#x200B; After getting all this out of me I realize that, yes, they obviously are narcs. Probably even more than narcs. But you have to understand that I need it confirmed. I have been gaslighted so much that I don't trust my own memory, reality and sanity. I feel like this is all in my head and I would make a great, cruel mistake if I cut contact with them. After all I am an ""ungrateful piece of shit"". **Because honestly, I dread the time when they reach out to talk to me and I never feel like talking to them.** I don't like talking to them, at all. They have no feelings, literally and are insane, in my opinion. Anytime we are together it's extremely weird. Me AND my father have admitted that we are shy towards talking to each other (Something of this nature). It's basically like strangers in a room that have to act like family, this is what I hate the most about them, this, not the abuse. I just wish I had a fucking home to go to. I was isolated from them my whole life since I was born. I know nothing about them. There is many, many, many more to tell but I can"

(It is an article about someone else but I tried to edit that part out, maybe if it reads spliced together)",23,9arnx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9arnx1/an_article_about_narcissism_i_thought_maybe/,2018-08-28 04:51:20,"So, the question becomes, what happens when a narcissist is being threatened with the loss of power and control? The answer is something psychologists call narcissistic injury. The phrase was coined by none other than Sigmund Freud in the 1920s, and it occurs when a narcissist feels that they have been disrespected, belittled, or their true self revealed. This often happens when they are experiencing a fall from grace, which is why understanding the phenomenon is so important at present. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines narcissistic injury as vulnerability in self-esteem which makes narcissistic people very sensitive to injury from criticism or defeat. The manual goes on to say Although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow, and empty. A common initial reaction to injury is for the narcissist to lash out and place the blame on others. When a narcissists self-esteem or self-worth is badly injured, their whole identity begins to fall apart, and they often respond with what is referred to as narcissistic rage. When this happens, the lashing out, bullying, threats, and erratic behaviors rise to new levels. Rather than accepting the blame one deserves for their own actions, narcissists tell themselves that others are responsible, and that they deserve to be punished. They often become obsessed with revenge, which comes in many forms, such as verbal or even physical abuse. Modern technology like social media provides the narcissist with the perfect medium for attacking perceived enemies, Narcissistic rage can also manifest itself as intense anger, outbursts, and extreme aggressiveness.

The filter:delete moves them to the trash folder, where I do the same. And theyre so bad, every time. Every time the same pattern of narcissistic flattery and pain. You were my special person and now it cant be helped if God punishes you. Spam and trash persist for 30 days in Gmail. I could clear the folders but Id have to see whats in them first. And if I see emails from her, despite how much I know they hurt me, I open them - like a cutter - sometimes just to see HOW terrible they are. Ive been in therapy, Im in a relationship now, so Im getting better. But my newfound emotional vulnerability just means it hurts more when I read these things.

Upon my reaching puberty, she could no longer outmatch me physically and resorted to emotional abuse and control through manipulation. We no longer live in the same house, but I'm caring for a sick parent and my sister perceived that it might be a good time to test my vulnerability. She asked that I call today under the guise of mutual concern for our ailing mother, but as the conversation was, by her request, a matter requiring discretion, I knew it was going to be abusive. She only ever wants privacy with me so that she can treat me poorly without repercussion from family, and she apparently thought that I would be tolerant of this behavior. I called her anyway, mentally prepared for a struggle. This was my opportunity to declare my independence from her outright. She proceeded to belittle me and insult me before asking to help me manage my finances, and I told her first that she's a disgusting person, then that she really ought to give thought to the cruel way she treats people, and finally, that I won't trust her with my money ever again because she made me sorely regret it in the past. She was displeased with my resistance, and she pressed me harder, really trying to carve out my self-esteem, so I told her that she's sick and I hung up on her. I hate how bitter and hostile she makes me feel, and I don't like talking to anyone in this manner, but she leaves me with no choice.

He tried to friend me on Facebook, then tried to make me feel bad for him, and wanted to build a relationship, when I didnt he called me the daughter of Lucifer. So a little back story. I have never personally met my real dad. However I have heard probably everything about him from my siblings who grew up with him, my siblings from his side (and not from my mom) and obviously stories from my mom. I do not take what my mom says to heart, because she has some abusive traits and sometimes I believe she is a narc as well, and because sometimes she embellishes stories. This post is not about her. Anyone that I have talked to about my real dad all say the same thing. He was a lying, manipulative, abusive, psychopath man who will do anything to help himself even if it meant destroying other people. Everyone says that he is also charming, and tries to get on your sweet side. Trying to say that hes the one getting abused, hes the one thats the victim. And then when you show a moment of vulnerability, he destroys you. Financially, mentally and even physically. For awhile I didnt believe what people said about him. Yeah he was a deadbeat dad who left his kids to starve but surely he couldnt be that abusive and evil? Right? Well I started trying to fact check everything and cross reference peoples horror stories of him. And yeah it all matched up. So I decided that I was finally okay with not ever meeting my dad and it turning into a wonderful relationship. I put him out of my mind and stopped obsessing over getting a good father, and hoping that everyone was wrong about him. Well... as my title says, one day I received a friend request from him on Facebook. It weirded me out to no end. I didnt accept it. I debated accepting and seeing what kind of person he was for myself. I couldnt decide so I turned to my siblings from his side. They all said block him. But I guess I still kind of was curious what he was like and also super curious as to why he was trying to friend me now, after 20 years of never hearing from him trying to contact me. So I messaged him (without accepting) and asked simply why did you send me a friend request? Just to see what hed say. And he didnt answer til the next day. He said is there any reason I shouldnt have? That made me laugh. I could write a book on all the reasons he shouldnt. Anyway I kind of laid into him about him never trying to come into my life, he missed his chance, hes an abusive person, I dont tolerate abusive people in my life. All that fun stuff. He then tried to tell him my mom left him (if she did, kudos to her) and that he tried to still be a dad but my mom thought it wasnt best. You know that exact script every dead beat dad has to try to win over their kid. And hes also saying he never abused anyone and it was my mother that hurt him. (Bull, my brother was like 6 and remembers him beating on her and the smaller kids). Im getting tired of him trying to twist everything into his favor, so I tell him I have no interest in building a relationship with him, I dont care about him, I dont allow abusive people into my life. Im telling him if he doesnt see what he did as abuse, thats on him and he needs to have some self awareness. All the stuff Ive been wanting to say to him since I realized what kind of person he was. WELL. He did NOT like that one bit! He starts saying that my mother is a wh*re and Im just like her, that I cant even stop and think or reason, that Im just like her. Calls me a total waste of space and air, that he cant wait til me and my mom dies. Like he really turned completely around from saying he was the victim and oh poor him to calling my mom every insult in the book and saying he hopes I die. (Real great dad material there). His last message to me before I blocked him was goodbye daughter of Lucifer and mother of all wh*res. (Which really is stupid because he called himself Lucifer). His last message made it very clear I made the right decision In not wanting a relationship with him. He did get inside my head a little bit and I did feel kind of guilty about not giving him a chance but after reading his last message, the guilt went almost completely away. Im hoping I did the right thing. I feel like maybe I shouldve given him the benefit of the doubt, but at the same time that would be discrediting all the years my mom and siblings endured abuse from him. Im not sure how I shouldve handled it. "

Hmmm) &amp;#x200B; Anyway, I'm 32, over 6 foot, have a hearty beard, weigh over 200lbs, and... feel like a little boy inside. My NMom died 2 years ago and I've spent the time since then falling apart, hitting rock bottom, and working my way back up. This weekend I've become engaged to the love of my life! I've had an amazing vacation and am truly feeling myself again. &amp;#x200B; I've always been a very high functioning adult (I guess as NMom wasn't so I had to step up) but it pisses me off how easily I'll back down from confrontation... I'm currently working in a take out where I'm the manager; 2 weeks ago this young lad of about 20 was late and, it being only him serving while I cooked leaving me working double hard until he arrived with no call, I chewed him out but he shouted me down and I backed down! It was mortifying! &amp;#x200B; I know in my heart I would rather back down and make a stupid joke about it to make people laugh and have them feel better than actually be able to stand up for myself and it's excruciating. I'd sooner look a fool than make someone else feel bad, which is wrong. I feel I'm a looming presence due to my size, but once people realise how soft I am it shows a huge vulnerability I dislike. I know in my head, however, that I'm soon to become a husband and step-father and absolutely cannot have that as I need to be a responsible parent as my stepdaughter grows, and don't want to be the kind of pushover that ends up with bratty, potentially manipulative kids. &amp;#x200B; I'm a very fair and very reasonable man so don't get me wrong I'm certainly not looking to become an aggressor, but having spent 30 years of my life trying to ease over situations ""so mom doesn't get mad at me"" (even if she didn't get mad because of me I was still her verbal punch bag for when she needed to release stress), I need to work out how to be able to stand firm and not back down at the slightest hint of confrontation. &amp;#x200B; It's weird; when I know I'm 100% in the right I will stand up for myself but, having always been the person to be able to assess views from all angles, I can often question my own intuition and back down because maybe I'm in the wrong. I don't think I've ever verbalised that before and it was quite therapeutic. &amp;#x200B; Can anyone suggest some reading materials or references that could help with this? &amp;#x200B; I'm also thinking of taking some boxing classes to show myself physically that an altercation isn't that bad, could that be an idea? Having been working in a take out joint my pain threshold has gone up immeasurably, now I'm constantly being splashed with 400 degree oil, and I think that's helped with my confidence like boxing could as I know I'm not made out of glass (bad analogy as glass isn't melted by oil). I'm big already so it's not like learning how to box will make me violent all of a sudden, I'm not worried about that, but could help with my inner confidence? &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading guys.

I thought that I could use that moment of vulnerability to invite ALL to go to a therapist to talk about this instead of these painful conversations... and they accepted! I was really happy because I thought my brother would have a profesional advising him to start NC or something like that but then, my parents booked the appointment with a psychiatrist and accompanied him to the therapy, as if he was the ""sick one"" - Long story short, he was told to do some medical studies after the first date...

If you find yourself in a vulnerable state at the moment, please do not continue reading. I have been no-contact with mother since late May. We used to live in the same house. Before leaving, I made it clear to her that I no longer want to interact with her and that I do not want her in my life. I also told brother (the golden child) that I am leaving. I however left home in a slightly panicked state with little time to plan and forgot some things behind which in hindsight I should have taken or done something about. I feel bad about this but I know that at that time, the severity of my situation was not clear to me yet and I remember thinking that I would return to pick up more belongings or that I would speak to mother again after some time. Soon after departure however, the reality of the situation and the relationship became clear to me and I know now that I must never return or interact with them unless forced. One of the things I forgot was an old cell phone that was barely working. She apparently broke into the phone, and has been contacting everyone in the contact lists who are mostly ex-colleagues. Every couple of weeks, just when I have calmed down a bit and have started to feel better, I get a message from someone saying that my mother messaged them and is trying to learn about my whereabouts. I do not respond. I know that she is trying to use these people to get to me and if I respond, there will be no end and the situation will spiral into one where I will find myself under her control again. I also feel angry and humiliated. This is partly why she is doing this. She knows how to push my buttons and she knows that I am a very private individual who likes to keep her professional life separate, and that my professional reputation means a lot to me. She is trying to wear me out into submission. I think I will get to see the worst she is capable of in this process, I just wish it would all be over and that I could go on with my life and focus on myself and my healing. I knew how horrible my mother was and could be, I witnessed her dishonesty, manipulation, aggression, hatred towards others my whole life. I have no idea how I deluded into thinking that I was somehow excluded, that she wasn't disintegrating my identity, re-shaping my sense of reality on a daily basis in order to control and use me for her own satisfactions and selfish desires. I don't know how I thought that she somehow still liked me or cared for me. She never did. She has never cared about anyone but herself, and never saw me as anything but an object to be manipulated, a means to her ends. The devastation of realizing that the ones you cared about are your personal persecutors is so painful, so difficult to process. It plunges one into a deep vulnerability and fear, as though you are still six years old and at the hands of this ""all powerful"" person who can literally do anything with you and your life. It's so challenging sometimes to recognize that fear, snap out of it, and tell yourself, you're an adult now, you are strong, you have resources, you will manage and get through this. The vulnerable child inside of me has trouble believing and trusting that."

I often question if Im a good person. Sometimes I feel like being mean to people and I try really hard to not be that way. I feel like my mom liked hurting me and I dont want to be like her, so I constantly analyze everything I do and my motivations to try and be kind. I feel like I have to be extra viligint to not blow up or lash out at people or Ill slip up and be like my mom or like lashing out too much. I hate that when Im slightly annoyed I want to say something like, then dont fucking forget instead of just try and remember to a partner. Im terrified of replicating my parents abusive and toxic relationships. That I have to fight the urge to lash out and blow up so I feel better at the expense of him. You dont do that to people you love Love and I feel like Im in danger of being an abuser. In movies, the abusive husbands say, why did you make me so mad! Why did you make me do this to you I feel that way too. And I feel like Im in on a slippery slope and need to watch out for that. Even though my therapists says I am not abusive. I feel its Important to be self aware as I feel my mom wasnt, and took her anger out on me. She would warp things to suit her and change the story almost the the point of ridiculous delusion. I see her as sad and pathetic and vowed to never be like her. So I try to makes sense of everything to avoid being like her and blowing up. But to the point where I feel guilty airing my own feelings. Then I get mad as I should be entitled to my anger and feelings. Exhausted yet? I am. Im angry shell never know she did me wrong. Thats shell Never feel the guilt of it. Shes always the victim. Shell never face the wrong she did and I dont want to be that. I feel if she had tried to keep herself in check, she wouldnt be as awful as she is. If she had just tried, I could have had a mother. We could have a relationship instead of being NC. This anger comes out when my temper flairs, which my therapist calls transference. *Residual Guilt and Shame* Im used to conditional affection and tension / drama. Im extra critical of myself and take it hard if I dont achieve my goals. I feel that Im not reaching my full potential. I would be rewarded with affection when I was the top of my class or the best on my team, or first chair. If I came in second I was torn down. Any feeling was wrong. If I was hurt I was too sensitive or a drama queen or she would give me something to cry about. Overt vulnerability was always shut down, swat down, and invalidated. In others, it was shown as something to be looked down on. If I cry, I feel ashamed. Even in a safe place like therapy when I cry I cant even look up and I shield my face. I was always told I was wrong for feeling that way and to get over it. *in conclusion* *Im sad these things still affect me.* Like, Im being punished for a crime I didnt commit. And I have to struggle after I already made it out. That Im so angry, and still so hurt. I guess we all do."

267,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Anyone have experience transitioning from NC to VLC?,4,935tyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/935tyk/anyone_have_experience_transitioning_from_nc_to/,2018-07-31 03:00:36,"I have been NC for about 2 years. Don't get me wrong, my parents are very narcissistic. But they are also a bit autistic. I've started to feel a bit like I could spend my entire life trying to psychoanalyze them and it wouldn't get me anywhere. I just want to pick something that will be a positive way forward. It seems like the choice I have is between the total loneliness of total separation from the entire extended family, or mild emotional and psychological abuse. I have felt there was something off about the fact that I have had absolutely zero tolerance towards any form of emotional abuse since I went NC. For example there are people I know who I think are nice people but I have felt like I couldn't be around them at all because a member of their friend group was a narcissist who I could never avoid. I have lived with a true psychopath before as a roommate and I don't think my parents are that bad. When I look at things my parents did I think: did they do that because they loved me? or did they do that so they could say: ""Hey, look, you can't say I'm a bad parent because I did this"". I started NC because they were in such a position of dominance over them they totally controlled me with guilt. Going NC was the only action I could take to stand up to them. I was too terrified of speaking up to them about my problems and just being rejected again. But now I wonder if I don't care as much about them rejecting me. Maybe it would still be possible to have a relationship with them. NC has felt a little like a Mexican stand off, and ultimately, they did not budge one millimeter to give me any validation. They have said ""We did some wrong things"" but that's it. Other than that it's just ""Give us a call to let us know you're OK"". No ""I understand you're angry..."" etc, no acknowledgement that really felt valid or really any vulnerability from them. They need to be in control of saying exactly how bad they were. But I wonder if I could accept that now. Because I wonder if despite this fucked upness of their personality if they really don't love me at all. I think they are basically people who love me in whatever limited way they can who are so fucked up they are unable to admit wrongdoing. If I go back into the extended family I expect to be ignored and treated like I am invisible again, and be put down, but considering I don't live near them I wonder if it really matters. In the sense that ultimately my choice is to have some kind of support from this extended family or to just be completely isolated. A part of me thinks that being around them will damage me more than it would help me and another part of me thinks that maybe I have enough confidence in myself to understand that I am my own person separate from them. I don't want to have completely zero tolerance towards any degree of shitty narcissism from anyone for the rest of my life, because I expect that everybody acts like that at least sometimes. I need to be able to tolerate at least a little bit from people. I think maybe it's possible that even though my parents cannot really admit fault of their own that they do still love me in some way. Members of my extended family seem to be able to interact with them fine without even noticing any really deep problems. I just have a hard time believing they are really pure evil because I have lived with someone who was. Do any of you have any thoughts about this? I just came from a meeting with a therapist where I was saying maybe I have the confidence now to not care about mild abuse from them. They are not as bad as they used to be when I was younger even though they are still very fucked up and I guess too fucked up to really admit any fault. But maybe now I don't care as much. Your thoughts? Thank you"
268,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I need input. I don't know whether my mom is showing signs of a narcissist.,6,93bxzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/93bxzi/i_need_input_i_dont_know_whether_my_mom_is/,2018-07-31 16:09:23,"I'm currently a college student. Growing up my relationship with my mom was really rocky. When we had good times (which to be honest were rare), it was great, but when it was bad, it was just horrible. I grew up with little physical (very minimum) but major emotional abuse. It was really hard to listen to. As a kid, being called names, told I wasn't good enough, worthless, or being compared to my older sister (who really is pretty good) was hard. And btw, my sister was the ""good"" kid, while I was the ""bad child""-I just can't remember a time when I wasn't the bad one. I didn't really understand it. But I always responded back. I went head to head in arguments. If I was told I was a bad daughter, I'd tell my mom I'd learned it from her. I had a rough time in school. I went to a small school which meant all the same people for like 12 years and was bullied in middle school. I think that was what made me really closed off. I was also quite aggressive with my siblings (when I was younger -thankfully that passed!). I can't call my mother a bad person. She's really not. I mean I do love her. She's done a lot for me and continues to do a lot for me. It's just when she's upset, the emotional abuse is traumatizing and draining- she just really hurt me. Its to the point where I cant really let go of the past, even when I try. But also, its not just the past. When she gets upset even know, the same abuse surfaces. I don't know how to deal with her. And whats even more is I react just as badly. I have upset her A LOT. I've made her cry numerous times. I cannot deal with tension or negative feelings thrown at me in a positive way. I literally do not know how people can laugh off or offer a hug to someone who's seriously mad at them. Like I just get angry or annoyed, or maybe even scared. And I know when my mother is mad she will just say anything (ranging from you're stupid, you don't know anything, Im the parent , etc) to win arguments. She'll also get you really worked up and then once you react, act like it was all you. I feel like she tries to guilt trip too. She has control over a lot of my life. What I do, how I keep my room, where I go, what I eat are all her business. She basically treats me like a 13 year old. Im almost 20. On the other hand, she also does everything for me and my siblings, from cooking, cleaning, housework, etc. It's just that the guilt, the hate, the tension, the anger over the smallest things, the insistence on being right that really bother me. I cannot expressively show her love. I mean I also didn't see much expressive love since I come from a culture where its not shown. But I wouldn't, or rather feel incapable of, showing emotional vulnerability because I am afraid it will be used against me. Now would you classify her as narcissistic (or am I overthinking this)? And if so what would be the best way to deal? Another serious issue here is, I'm literally the same -I can get incredibly mean in arguments, always want to win, will put you down if upset etc (Im trying to get out of this but its work). And I don't know what goes through her head (obviously), but knowing what goes through mine, I also know that I can be very self absorbed. So Im not sure if I'm seeing her because of the way I am (meaning I'M the narcissistic one), or she actually is narcissistic and my habits are a defense mechanism. ANY advice/thoughts would be really appreciated. Btw, sorry if I'm all over the place, first post and all. And thanks in advance! "

Last week my therapist and I were talking about the root causes of my eating disorder, my perfectionism, my people pleaser-ness. I talked about growing up with her and my father, the constant comparing she did between myself and my siblings (bio and steps). That she would criticize my appearance at every opportunity, belittle my career choice, and how she was unable to be happy for anyone but herself if she wasnt the center of attention. I remember my first semester of college, I came home with straight As. I have had ADHD my entire life, and that 4.0 was something I never thought Id see. I felt like I was walking on air when I walked through to their living room, proud as punch that I was one of the few college freshman who made the Deans List. Her response: Well, that means the classes are too easy for you. So its not like youre actually learning anything. That school is stealing your money. After berating my decision to attend a private university, she decided - not long before my graduation - that she was going to enroll in a private masters program that cost about $65,000 a year. My dad had me over for dinner the night before I moved across the country to join Teach for America. My dad said is was to celebrate my graduating from college cum laude and being accepted into TFA, but she spent the entire evening talking about herself. Along suggesting it was easier to be accepted into the TFA region that I was a corps member of because no one wants to go there. From the time I was thirteen until I was eighteen, I covered my body in oversized clothing because I wanted to avoid her comments. Im naturally hour-glassed shaped and was an early bloomer. She called me fat at every opportunity. Think of how much boys would like you if you were thin. I developed exercise bulimia by eighteen, escalating into binge-and-purge episodes by nineteen. I knew it was unhealthy, I knew I had a problem, but when I came home for summer break and heard her say the words oh, youre looking so skinny, I felt a sense of pride that I had never felt before. Im still ashamed of it. My perfectionism, my anxiety, my on-again off-again struggle with bulimia (two years binge/purge free this past March!)...I knew that much of it was rooted in childhood. I thought I was overly sensitive. That I was emotionally immature. There are so many other stories I could tell, but even posting in this sub has me second-guessing myself. Maybe none of it happened. Maybe Im remembering it wrong. I shouldnt be sharing this, its not that bad. Something was off, sure, it wasnt normal...but now I know that there is an actual pathology attached to this toxic woman and its who she is as a person. All of thats to say...Im glad you all are here. Thank you for sharing your stories, for demonstrating strength in vulnerability, and for helping others heal. Im reclaiming my emotions and my body and realizing that I was always beautiful, smart, and worth love. Its not easy, as Im currently sorting through a lot of anger primarily directed at her and my father. But I feel farther along than I was yesterday. "
270,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Estranged Nmother and staunch atheist family can't stand my inner autonomy or spirituality,2,9558x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9558x5/estranged_nmother_and_staunch_atheist_family_cant/,2018-08-07 07:11:15,"\[Tw: emotional abuse, spanking, threats, suicide, verbal abuse\] My parents and siblings are upper-middle class, materialistic, authoritarian atheists with little tolerance for anyone in the immediate family straying from their ways. My mother often threw hellish emotionally abusive fits when I was growing up, and both of my parents spanked me, which was traumatic. They, especially my mother, were very controlling and overprotective. They instilled a lot of shame in me and treated me like my own voice and experiences were invalid because I was young. They said that children and youths were completely dumb and treated me like a blank slate they owned that existed solely to please them personally. I wasn't allowed to determine my own life path or mature emotionally. My mother treated me like I was never good enough. When I was under six years old and was learning to draw, write, count, etc., she would get in my face about how she could do such things younger or better when she was little. For years, she treated me like crap for being an introvert, not being enough of a lady, not being good enough in English class, making minor mistakes, doing things differently than expected, crying a lot, and dare questioning her ways. My dad went along with her. In fact, my parents expected me to treat them like infallible gods who were completely superior, not human beings. They typically refused to admit mistakes and show vulnerability around us kids. They also lived in deep denial about being dysfunctional. Naturally, I rebelled and strayed from my parents' ways. In my teens and early twenties, I embraced thinking for myself and sensitivity to vulnerable people and nature, which they didn't like, even though they supported Democrats over Republicans. At 17, I decided I was agnostic. I wanted to be honest about what I knew for certain and didn't, and I didn't know the ultimate nature of reality. My dad really didn't like that and tried to tell me in an angry tone that I was an atheist. When I went to college with their help, my parents got suspicious that I was being brainwashed because I was entertaining new ideas. My parents, who have both taught at another university, tried to persuade me to transfer to that school and live at home to be closer to them. Meaning, they felt they were losing control of me and wanted to completely rule my life again. That didn't happen at the time, but my parents repeatedly expressed that I must not think for myself even after I turned 21. My mother straight up encouraged denial as a way of living and declared herself to be a wise elder expert on life. Around age 21, I had some powerful near-death like experiences after someone I knew died. I became very spiritual afterwards, embraced mysticism, and rejected materialistic ego-driven living. I dropped out of school after that because I was both disillusioned with my studies and had a hard time functioning due to the sudden inner energetic change. My parents were completely against that decision; they wanted me to go to grad school, get a Ph.D, and have money and status. They wanted me to be an impossible ""perfect"" daughter who both didn't question them or think critically and was a brilliant academic or high achiever they could brag about. Nothing else would please them. They were also completely against my inner transformation. They tried to push me to get ""cured"" back to ""normal"" several times, which was awful. I tried to escape somewhere else a few times. At one point, I ended up having nowhere to go but back home. I had to live under my hostile family for a few years as they supported me financially. (I completed my bachelor's degree and did a bunch of volunteering, drawing, and writing during this time.) They would often bully me on a daily basis, threaten to kick me out during my most vulnerable times, treated me like I was a worthless loser, and did inconsiderate things like make a bunch noise late or early and disregard me saying to please let me sleep. I was energetically sensitive, and lack of sleep affected me badly at that time. Whenever I had problems with their behaviors, they said it was my fault. The more I spoke up or got upset, the more I was wrong and useless in there eyes. One time, my mother encouraged me to get rid of the car I owned. My parents and siblings frequently treated me like I was the enemy. This treatment nearly drove me to suicide more than once and stalled my integration process and ability to function. Once in 2012, my father got explosively angry, treated me like the absolute enemy and an a useless person, and tried to kick me out several days after I was discharged from being hospitalized for wanting to kill myself. Fortunately, my mother intervened, or I may not have survived that time. Plus, the place where my family lived was quite conservative and intolerant of people who were weird or different, so I wasn't able to go anywhere else locally and had very few helpful resources. Three years ago, I was finally able to buy a one way plane ticket to the other side of the country thousands of miles away. I have never gone back. I still talked with my family until the last straw about two years ago, when my mother said not to talk to her anymore because I said I wasn't going to apply for the prestigious jobs she sent me, all of which I was either unqualified for or wouldn't be good at at all. At the time, I had just been laid off from a job and had applied for various jobs I thought I could do. My roommate was also getting increasingly controlling and threatening. I was talking about having to flee. I had expressed great reservation toward my mother's offer to come back home and let the family help me, given what had happened before. Homelessness looked better, honestly. Because I rejected her idea of what I needed, she said not to talk to her. After no contact for a couple more months, I sent an email to my family officially cutting ties with all of them. (My extended family was dysfunctional and not good to me either, so I cut them off too.) In particular, I mentioned being tired of them being the meanest when I was at my most vulnerable and said that family doesn't treat family like that. Financial support (typically bestowed to me in a codependent, manipulative, or conditional way) was not going to keep me with my family anymore. I did become homeless and was living outside when I cut my family off. That was another reason to cut ties, as I can only imagine the crap they would've given me for it. I'm now in housing, doing better, still healing, and glad to be away from them. I haven't had any contact with my parents or siblings in almost two years and don't plan on having any anymore. There is much more I could say in terms of details and incidents. These are the basics of my family situation. I have no more blood family. It's hard to talk about being estranged from my whole family because it feels like people would assume the main problem must be me. I also feel uneasy in most of the human world because I see how driven it is by similar dysfunctional patterns that I want nothing to do with anymore. Although I feel much better without my family, I often feel trapped in a mad world that hates anyone who is open, different, sensitive to life, or not identified with polarized patterns or drama. People will betray life itself to defend their individual and collective egos."

Stole a pinwheel from a store when I was like 5...mom found out and told me she was going to tell the police on me. -. Subtle, almost unexplainable, feeling that my mom hates me even though there's rarely overt examples. -. Mom doesn't feel like a mom....I have never, ever, once seen her in a place of vulnerability. -. Weird relationship with animals, mean to them, they are nuisances... -. Mom's dog started peeing when I walked in her house one time and she screamed at me, without the slightest bit of humor, ""You're evil!!"" -. Money is her currency for love. -. She's terrible to my step dad -. Nobody in our family or out would have a clue, it seems, how she is -. She gets angry at emotions -. Deteriorating memory -. Hoarding -. One night she wanted me to visit, and I ended up cooking in kitchen with my cousin (I don't like sitting in front of a TV like she was doing). So she came in the kitchen, washed dishes, then went to bed to watch TV. It was like I instinctively knew this was her way of producing pity or attention, and I went to her bedroom and gave her a cookie just to let her know that we weren't ignoring her and loved her. I thought about this the next day and it all came to me how that all played out and it was like I understood or saw everything clearly for the first time and started crying for my mom....that it's like she is a little girl.. Overall, I do feel a kind of weird disconnect/dislike of her...like I don't really know who she is. Like it's all just been a dream. But I also have this overwhelming sadness for her.

I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and uncontrollable crying fits for as long as I can remember (since I was eight at least, or earlier). Last year, I lapsed into what I think might have been a state of depersonalization. I'm out of it now, but it scared me and I'm trying to find support or help so it doesn't happen again ... I've realized for a while that my dad is a narcissist (he brags all the time about being smarter and more talented than other people, and has admitted that he doesn't think about his children any differently than anyone else he knows), and that he was emotionally abusive (lots of screaming at us for accidents or sometimes for literally no reasone.g. if something in the house broke, like regular wear-and-tear, he'd yell at me and my brother for being careless and disrespectful even if neither of us broke the thing) and mildly physically abusive. Really, the only thing to do when he started to scream at you was to freeze and agree with everything he said. He'd freak out if you got upset, if you apologized too much, or if you stood up for yourself. My brother had a terrible temper and used to take it out on me physically. I almost never fought back; I didn't want to hurt him, I just wanted him to stop hurting me. Both of my parents blamed us equally for these ""fights"", and I'd get punished as bad as him or worse if I screamed or reported it. I was told I was too emotional, that I was pretending to be hurt because I wanted to get my brother into trouble, that I was a bitch, that I was whiny, that I exaggerated, that I was seeking attention. My mom also sometimes made fun of my emotional reactions or made me feel stupid for having them. I moved out twelve years ago but I still live in the same city as my family. I don't want to go no contact (except maybe with my dadmy parents divorced a few years agobut then I'm scared I'll lose touch with my cousins on his side), but I'd like less ... they just make me feel terrible. They also drink A LOT and I'm worried that I use alcohol and marijuana in a self-medicating way, instead of a healthy, fun way, but whenever I try to stop it's usually a family member that breaks my sober streak. I also really struggle with their conservative and libertarian politics because socialism makes a lot more sense to me. I don't really know how to handle this. I want to be able to connect better with some of the kind, wonderful people I know, but I've been told I intimidate people and come off as aloof and like I don't need anyone. I don't know how to show vulnerability, but I'd like to start, and I also think I really need to stop crying in bathrooms all the time because I bottle up my emotions and only feel comfortable letting them out when there's no one around because then no one can accuse me of faking them (and I can't accuse myself of this either). Interacting with family almost always sets me back. I crave love and care but then act like a deer in headlights whenever someone tries to show me it. How do you stop holding hurt and fear and open yourself up? Is it even possible for me to heal while still attending group family events with my father and brother? Is it possible to grey rock in certain situations, without becoming stone? I'm sorry this is so long. I think I needed to vent. There's a part of me that wants to self-destruct and it terrifies me. I have a good life outside of my family, a kind partner, and a promising career. I'm scared I'll throw it all away because I can't stop obsessing over old wounds and I feel empty inside."
273,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,[Rant/Vent; Advice appreciated] Dealing with N(?)Co-Worker,3,8rutpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8rutpn/rantvent_advice_appreciated_dealing_with_ncoworker/,2018-06-18 09:06:21,"Please bear with me as I am not a native speaker and I might not always be able to phrase things right. Also wall of text inc! I work nights in a home for people with mental problems and addictions. Usually on the end of a shift we do a report to the next shift so they know what happened prior to their shift and can plan accordingly. Tonight I came to work and N-Coworker was there. I want to be honest.. I don't like him for various reasons , he probably doesn't like me either and all the night-nurses kind of know that he's an odd guy. We're all happy when he says nothing happened and leaves so we can look at the electronic documents in peace and figure out what happened in the prior shift. Anyway there is a couple in the home. The past 3 nights the lady had mishaps regarding her bowel movements. It's a strain on her boyfriend as he usually freaks out because he feels responsible to clean her and the room up. (It's really not, it's our job). He got really upset with the whole situation and mentioned that he won't be able to bear with it any longer. It took me a hot minute to calm him down and tell him everything's gonna be fine. I wanted him to get some rest and sleep as it was the middle of the night. So in the morning I suggested someone talk to the two of them and maybe suggest they sleep in separate beds for a little while. Reason being that he is not able to get rest and gets super upset because he doesn't understand why she won't go to the toilet. Today that lady said goodnight and went to her room as opposed to his room. It confused me a little because they slept together last night, too (fortunately, no mishap!). So I asked my co-worker if anyone had talked to them or what was the matter. I meant it in a curious way as in how this situation happened. I definitely did not mean to be inquisitive about it as in ""did you talk to them yet?!"". My Co-Worker then tells me in a pretty condescending way that forcing someone to do something wasn't their style of labour here and that I could do that in the field where I'm originally from. Medieval times were over and stuff like that. I was like wtf? So I tried to clarify to him that I was merely interested in if there's a reason why she's in her room as this behavior is different from the nights before. I don't force anyone to do anything. My opinion is that one can talk to the two of them and suggest it and if they don't want to be separate then that's it. Then we'll find a way to care for her without it being a strain on him so much. Then he proceeds to tell me that's not what I meant, that I meant it that I'd like it to be enforced for them sleeping separate. It made me really angry as his condescending and arrogant way of saying that really reminded me of my parents. In counseling me and my therapist have talked about the importance of boundaries. So as best as I could I try to set them for him so he know's he can't just do what he likes. I told him it's pretty presumptuous for him to insinuate that and to also insinuate that I used force in my prior occupation. **Then** he goes on to ""diagnose"" me that I would always understand factual statements on a relationship level and tells me ""I don't know which mental problems you have there"". What also struck me as odd was that he said I should work days and take over responsibility there. That I could really put in some work there. I think he meant this to insinuate that during nights there is not a lot of work to do which is a common stereotype with people who haven't worked nights before. The thing is.. I transferred to this home because no one wanted to switch from day to night. So my supervisor ""borrowed"" me from another home for a few nights before I transferred completely. And me and the other nurses in night shifts are there for night shifts only. While we were fighting he was all smily, happy and arrogant. I think it gave him some weird satisfaction to be mean and arrogant and I can't wrap my mind around it. I know for sure I was really upset and I am strongly thinking about talking to our supervisor tomorrow as I also found out he has been talking behind my back. E.g. when I report in the morning that the night was quiet he tells the next shift I supposedly said I was bored. I am really unsure but to me this whole situation felt like a mindfuck. Is him pretending to know better than me what I meant gaslighting? Also the generalizations and blank statements drove me up the wall. There was no sentence where he would say ""I feel/ I experience this / I think"" but rather ""It's this/ It's **always** this"" and even claiming his ""diagnose"" as a fact. Also I'm wondering wha he was so happy about picking an argument. Why the fuck was he smiling and seemingly drawing satisfaction from this? I think implying I have a mental health problem is a pretty mean and unprofessional thing and I don't get why he would feel the need to do that. That point honestly really hit me as I am in fact in counseling to recover from NParents and dealing with occasional depression. However I don't think that this seriously influences the way I communicate with people. None of my colleagues know that so I'm not sure if he sensed a vulnerability to exploit or if that was a lucky hit for him. I kind of think he did this whole shtick on purpose, I just don't know exactly why. Maybe he was in a bad mood and decided to take it out on me. The thing is... I know I'll be seeing him occasionally and next time I want to deal with this with a little bit more grace. Because when we were fighting I got so worked up that I my hands and arms were shaking and he noticed it. I also feel like I wasn't as quick-witted as I should have been or otherwise I could have pointed out his double standards and projection. What I did, however (and I'm a little bit proud about that) was to tell him that this will have consequences. I told him that he should not think he can pull shit like that and next time it's all good again. I also insinuated that I might talk to our supervisor about his remark about me having mental health problems. So at least on that part I set boundaries even though not as gracefully. So... Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. Now I have a few questions. Is this really Nbehavior? And if so how can I competently deal with him the next time? How can I not let this get to me so much? I feel like he deliberately tried to push my buttons and I kind of want to put a figurative acrylic glass box over them so he can't push them anymore. "

I say rash, it wasn't that rash as I spent more than a year saving money and planning it before I did it. It is something I would recommended anyone doing, I had an amazing time, can't say I found myself and I wish I had planned what happened when I got back with a bit more care but thats not what this post is about. No its about the reaction of my nmum when I left. I spent a few days before I left at my n/eparents house, seeing old friends, catching up, saying goodbye to people - the sort of thing that you would do before heading off on the trip of a lifetime. I remember it as one of the most pleasant weekends I have ever spent in my home town, a place I don't have the fondest memories of and not just because of my n/eparents. Anyway the time finally came to leave and get the train to London and get my flight. I was sitting with my nmum in their house and said something like ""right then, time for me to go and get the train"" and she just burst into tears. I can remember sitting there thinking ""what is going on here, this is not normal"". Now I would imagine that people with normal parents would at this point have thought ""I am touched, my mother is sad that I am leaving and going away travelling"". I just thought ""hold on a minute, you didn't cry when I left to go and live in London three years ago. In fact you never cry. Why now?"". I don't know about anyone else but the sight of my nmum crying is a weird thing. She doesn't cry like a normal person, its almost as though there is a element of the planned about it. The times in my life I have cried there is something uncontrollable about it, it is emotional. With her crying its like it is being controlled, its unemotional, I can't really explain it. I remember saying something conciliatory like ""I will speak to you on the phone and I am coming back eventually you know"". She sat there and said ""I don't want you to go"". Right, I have spent over a year planning and saving for this, I have a visa, I have a flight booked to leave tomorrow morning and for the first time in my life you decide to actually show some emotion about me and my existence? I just said something to effect of well, thats not going to happen. I got my stuff together and made for the door. She came to door to say her last goodbye when it got odder. I find physical contact with my nmum an excruciating thing. There is something forced about, it has always felt uncomfortable and I avoid it as much as I can. For some reason she decided that this was possibly the first time I could remember in years that she was going to hug me. I can remember it feeling, well, nothing. It was an embrace that held no love in it at all. There was no empathy, no caring, just no nothing. I just wanted the thing to stop but she would not let go. It was almost as though if she let go, she would lose what it was she was holding onto. During the whole time she was still sobbing. I wanted to be anywhere else at that moment and she would not let go. Eventually I prised myself away and left. Like so many other things, I haven't thought that much about that event until recently. Looking back on it now, 26 years later it just gets odder. As much as you ever can understand the thoughts and actions of a narc, I sort of understand her motivation - show vulnerability and stop the thing that you don't want to happen from occurring. If one assumes that this was the ploy, why on earth did she ever assume that I was going to go ""oh my mother shows emotion for the first time ever, I must stop all my plans and make her happy"". Yet again I can only say, I have no idea what goes through the mind of a narc and for I am thankful. Of course there is a postscript to this, the ""how my nmum did manage to find a way to ruin my trip of a lifetime and get me to come home early"" but that is for another time."

It happened a few days ago, The NMIL has always psychologically drained my wife, and like poison does, it spread to me. I've been with my wife for almost six years, and I always knew something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. I knew that my wife had been hurt in some way, but she attributed it to depression and social anxiety and never pointed the finger at her mom, who of course at first seemed totally harmless. I, too came from an unstable upbringing, and something in me just kind of... knew. Even though my wife has been in the fog until now I still love her. I'll try until I can't. Fast forward to this past Saturday, I had weird heart palpitations due to a medicine I was prescribed, which in turn scared me more and then morphed into a full blown terrifying panic attack that had me thinking I was literally going to die. My face was vibrating and my pulse was throbbing in my legs. I called my wife because it was my nurse's off day who had her phone on silent during work hours. No answer. I'm scared shitless so then I call the narc because they live 10 minutes away, after doing great with NC. Fuck that was incredibly stupid. So I'm sitting on my couch basically hyperventilating, and all she can think to say is ""Why don't you tell (wife's name) to cut her hair again?"" And then proceeds to fish for other answers **while I am still struggling to breathe** about the stupidest fucking shit you could ever think of. She only gives a fuck about image. She did not care that her daughter-in-law was fucking hyperventilating. Sure, she rushed over to help me, but she also used my vulnerability as an opportunity to fish for info about my fucking trans wife's hair (who, by the way, is the sweetest most loving person you could ever meet) and then got me to tell her about the HRT and then lied to my wife saying I told her I had a problem with it. No the only thing I had an issue about was the fact that we didn't get a chance to freeze sperm. (And yeah, she used that against me too.) I was doing so well. I could've called anyone else. I'm struggling so much with gaslighting and overloads of guilt, and what seems to be my spouse's fleas. Jesus guys, please send hugs/validation."

I was raised by an nmom but I never knew this when I was a kid. A combination of beatings, death threats, 3 hour lectures where she'd tear me apart for tiny mistakes, all contributed to a lifelong struggle with short-term memory. I could not remember parts of my childhood at all. When I was in high school I started having anxiety attacks sporadically, and tried to go to therapy, but whenever the therapist would ask ""what's wrong,"" I'd immediately freeze up and forget everything I wanted to say. I just didn't know how to describe it all, and it physically hurt too much to think about. Until I was in university, I never thought that the reason why I hated myself so much was because someone else actually told me to do so. I read r/raisedbynarcissists in the past but even until last year, I actually didn't think that my nmom was like these stories at all. But I kept reading and found that everything aligns perfectlythe mind games, the cultivating of complete dependence. And from there, I started to have flashbacks. Detailed memories of words my mother said to me, including where and when. I understand so much more about myself now, and about her, and it's becoming so much easier to admit that she really was not the perfect parent she thought she was, and that I want her to be. Even the vulnerability of these posts has encouraged me to share with my close friends. I feel much less shameful about my experiences. It's hard to access my therapist all the time, so when I'm feeling panicky late at night I like to read the posts here and remind myself that I am not alone. I'm going NC soon and this community has been the final push I needed to go forward with that decision. I'm still shy about posting but I wanted to share my thanks. I feel like a giant veil has been lifted from my life and I'm finally starting to see clearly. "

I always had to be my parent's parent, and if he were drunk, it was more of that. I would have to sit there and listen to hours and hours of sob stories of his life. Poor him, he got to have a childhood, and chances that I never had. Acting like he had it bad for getting the basic liberties that are a given to most people like getting to leave the house, or go outside without asking. Things that I dreamed of and never got to have because of him. There was sob story mode, him bragging which was mostly what he'd do, then he'd threaten me. Sometimes, there was the fake vulnerability, that was him trying to manipulate me. Pretending to acknowledge the numerous problems that he caused, while doing nothing to fix them, just enjoying the pain that it was causing me by bringing it up. That being the only reason he brought it up, but if I were upset, how dare I? His reasoning and what'd I hear was, he cares, if he didn't care he wouldn't bring it up. From both my parents ""I love you"" was a petty, guilt trip used to gain leverage when they knew they were in the wrong. Everyone else's parents were terrible, violent, abusive, neglectful, racist, close-minded monsters who hated their kids and didn't allow them what my parents allowed. That's what they made me believe, and I was never around other people enough to know that it was the complete opposite. One night, in guilt trip mode. He says to me ""You don't let anyone tell you that your parents don't love you."" I realize now what that means. Basically, if I were ever around someone that could see through my parents phony image of niceness and normalcy, and this person were to tell me what things are. I counter back to them with the guilt trip of how much my parents supposedly care. What an ungrateful brat I am for thinking this. For knowing the truth. My my Dad rot in Hell. "

I was raised in a house with no central heating and a perpetual building site for an ""extension"" that never got finished. There was no shower and a lot of the time there was no hot water. My parents fought all the time and since I'm an only child I had no one to turn to. I was told to keep it a secret or else I'd be taken away, and because of my vulnerability I was an easy target for bullies in school.... which my parents never did anything about since they were so focused on beating on each other. I could hear them from any hiding spot I found throughout the house. My mother used to take it out on me and roughly brush and pull my hair and if I complained about it hurting she'd tell me I was just trying to start another argument, that I was trying to get my dad down. I remember getting shouted at for accidentally breaking a jar of peanut butter when I was maybe 6 or 7. To this day I get anxious if I drop or break anything. This treatment basically continued my whole life, even after my parents split up. My mother once made bruises on my arm because I sat on a cushion wrong when I was in my late teens. She took out my grandparents illness on me, I loved my grandparents they were the only people who showed legitimate affection for me. After my grandad died she told me that I was only nice to him to get his money. I was 16 and he had left me some money in his will. My grandfather was legitimately more like a dad to me than my own father and I miss him every day. I used to ask if I could go to a therapist and she'd laugh and ask what I needed therapy for, and say that she wouldn't pay for it anyway. Then as I got older I got seriously depressed. I was in college and I couldn't handle going anymore and I told her that, but she said that if I took a break it meant that I was a failure and I would have wasted my grandparents money on an education that I didn't even finish. So I kept going until I very literally had a mental breakdown and tried to kill myself. Soon afterwards I was in the car with her and she turned to look at me and called me pathetic. She has needled me until I've had panic attacks and walked out leaving me there and saying she's sick of my drama. She has hounded me until I've walked out of the house at 2am in the winter because I can't get away from her and then called the cops on me and had me arrested. But of course she doesn't remember any of this lol. I used my inheritance to try and get myself some professional help. I paid for therapy and doctors appointments and psychiatrist appointments and it turns out I have bipolar disorder. It chipped away the last of my money and I've been dependent on her ever since and every time I've tried to break away I'm told that I'll just fail again. I've tried to sign on for social welfare payments but she has told me I wouldn't qualify for anything. My illness isn't a real illness because I can walk and my mobility is fine. But at the same time I'm a leech and a burden on her. Turns out that's not true! I live in Ireland and here I actually qualify for disability benefits because I have this illness and it seriously affects my ability to function in my life. It's hard having a severe mental illness *and* an Nparent. I've been secretly getting everything together to apply for it and my friends want me to move in with them after I have. I'm gonna be posting it and getting supplementary payments from the end of next week! My friend is gonna come down with her car during a time my Nmother isn't in to cart my stuff *across the country*. I'll be living hours away! There's no way she *or* my abusive dad who I'm no contact with will ever find me. I won't need to worry about money or paying for my medication ever again. "

Stories I hide, feelings I repress, fears I just fight instead of looking at compassionately. It feels good. I feel light and free. I never thought I *could* feel that in daily life. I'm excited to grow. I might not be away from my possibly-N for several years, but I'm going to grow *anyway* because . . . well, screw her, she doesn't get to take any more years from me. Sure, she'll hurt me when she sees vulnerability, but I'm stubborn and ticked off and I have a few allies . . . so . . . may as well try to live in a way that lets me have peace. Don't worry, I'm putting reasonable limits on this. Nothing that will provoke her into taking away my social contact etc. - I'm not going to act like an asshole, I'm just going to do harmless human things. She's stopped being physically and sexually abusive since my parents put me in karate class, so I'm not too concerned about *those* types of punishments. Here are some very, very tiny, ""first step"" goals to help me stop being afraid of showing who I am. I want to put them out here as a way to stop being ashamed of them. 1. When the Scripture is read in church, I will pick up a pew Bible and read along. I've had this desire for a long time (I absorb knowledge best when I'm able to read it), but I've always been afraid of my grandma's reaction because *she* doesn't do it. 2. I will clean my room. She has always told me that I can't be clean (and as a result, no one will love me), so *screw her, she's wrong, so there.* 3. I will wear jewelry when I want to wear it. Who cares if she has this weird thing against girls (who aren't her) being feminine? 4. She insists that I play piano (joke's on her - it does bring me joy). I'll be slowly dropping the pieces I don't like (which she loves) and focusing on the pieces that *I* like (which she always ""suggests"" that I drop). 5. I will display my drawings and various things I like in my newly cleaned room. She doesn't come in there anyway (helps that it's not her house), which makes it a ""safe"" way to get over the fear of punishment and ridicule. My space will be *mine.* 6. I will start writing fiction again (and get my cursive back to its former evenness), regardless of the shame and inadequacy that grabs hold when I pick up the pen. These are all safe, small things. They don't make much of a difference to anything. But my heart wants them, I'm afraid of them, and I am just so *done* with that fear."

Like my dad. :-( Thats not me :-( I am very vulnerable and lack social skills, but am often told I appear intimidating on the outside. I work in a toxic work environment, with narcissists as the people who work above me. When they throw shade my way, I dont really react or ever show any hint of vulnerability.

If I said something hurt me, I was being manipulative. If the tone of my voice was off in any way, there was going to be an explosion. The things that kept me safe as a kid are the things that destroy my relationships now. Its going slowly, but its going. For the first time, I was able to open up to my partner. We had a really difficult conversation and i didnt completely collapse. I didnt self destruct and run away. I actually stood up for myself and asked for what I wanted lmao.

For example, most people don't scream child neglect when a kid says they've never lived anywhere longer than a few years--that they changed schools as often as they changed grades. Or how my mom was working on her forth husband by the time I was 10. But in any ways, this was just as bad as the over sharing of traumatic and sexual stories, blaming every little thing on us, and refusing to do any housework even after it got to the point where there were maggots growing in the basement windowsill. My mom spent most of her free time playing online games. She'd potentially become enraged if you bothered her at the wrong moment, screaming violently. She liked to call us, ""stupid little shits"" when she got like that. I learned to push her. If we got get to do something really bad that actually struck her as something wrong, she'd go through a ""guilty"" phase where she'd take us out to dinner or to the movies. But it was a tricky balance because I honestly feared she might lose her temper and kill me by ""accident."" Because we always moved around and she was always ending her relationships, my mom and my two brothers were the only permanent figures in my life that I could rely on for love or support. You can probably imagine how maladaptive that was. I did my best to make friends at school, but I was so vulnerable to bullies because I was so desperate and lonely. I NEEDED my friends in a way few of them needed me back. I always chose people who were neglected or abused, but most of them weren't as bad off as I was. Most of them had experienced something awful in the past, it experiences ongoing emotional neglect. I chose these people because I knew they would be more hesitant to abandon me than healthy kids. Of course, I had no clue that's why I did that. Didn't figure that out until much much much later. I've always felt desperately lonely. Nobody else in my family seemed to care about having friends, but I yearned for love and support. I didn't admit it to anybody. My mom and brothers had already made it clear that I was ""too sensitive."" They all acted like I was a worthless crybaby because my feelings were easily hurt. Not by my mom. She was crazy. But my brothers could hurt my feelings easily. They made fun of me for how I would play video games weirdly or how I wanted to play ""unicorn"" or ""cat."" I find it so hard to explain to people what I've been through because there was just so much--but nothing you could just say outright. I think I accused my mom of being abusive when I was around seven. She'd get violent with us and expected us to do all the chores. She said really mean things and she would then go through nice phases that made it seem like she knew better. Anyway, she had always told me about serial killers and rapists and how there were people in the world who liked doing horrible things to others (especially children). When the topic of child abuse came up, she liked to talk about parents holding kid's hands down on hot stoves. Her own stepfather would beat her and rip out handfuls of her hair while throwing her against the wall. Anyway, she proceeded to advise me that she was not abusive because she was not nearly sadistic enough. She once read a story about an abusive mother who used a shoe hook in her daughter's vagina. So, I spent my childhood perpetually lonely and perpetually afraid. I loved my family dearly. My mom constantly pawned our care off on other people. Her husbands. The oldest child. Her grandmother. Daycares, babysitters. She was always very cruel to whoever got stuck with this work, while doting on the kids that weren't stuck with the work. At least, doting as much as you can be to children you usually ignore and then blow up at for no good reason. I guess maybe everyone could tell we were totally fucked. They didn't seem to take much pity on us. Other parents at daycare didn't want their kids around us. We were a bad example, with our ill fitting clothing and suspicion of authority. I clung to what I loved. Holidays. Friends. Art. Animals. Adventures. I thought only about the good parts of my mom--the mom who used to hold me when I was scared at night or after a pet died. Who took us to vacation at cool natural parks and let me have her old computer and would sometimes take me out shopping for Mommy daughter dates. She had told me that she wanted to kill herself after a bad break up because nobody loved her. I said I did, and she said my love didn't count. I was 7, absolutely crazy for my mom. I couldn't imagine living without her. I thought I'd probably never end up moving out because of how much I loved my mom. But when she said that, it was the first time I got an inkling that maybe she didn't love me all that much in return. She basically acknowledged that being my mom was not enough to make her want to stick around. My mom ""stopped loving me"" when I hit around 11 years old. Not all at once, obviously. She'd show me around to people at her job. I was desperate for their approval--as I was always desperate for everyone's approval. I was so happy that she included me like this. But at the same time as showing affection to me around strangers, she stopped wanting to cuddle me when we'd watch movies together (said that I was hurting her, as she has a chronic painful disease). She became critical of me about how I tried to make friends, pointing out that I was always choosing bad people to make friends with who ended up upsetting me and why do I keep doing that? I had a bunch of weird behavioral issues, like being terrified of sleeping alone. I was too old to be sleeping with my brothers, and I would get in the way of her rest and romantic intimacy with husband #4 if I slept in her room, so I was told with great anger and violence that if I didn't sleep in my room alone she would give me something to be afraid of. Around this age, bullying at school got worse. Mom had always told me boys bullied me because they liked me. Now that bullying turned into lewd comments in the classroom, groping motions at my ass as I walked by. My mom would grin at me and explain that I was very curvy and attractive so I should just take it as a compliment. It felt violent and humiliating to me. Worse, though, it also felt exhilarating. I wanted the attention. The feeling reminds me of how I used to fight with my family on purpose in order to get attention--dangerous, exhilarating, powerful, and spectacularly lonely and empty. Meaningless. They didn't care about me. They were just stupid horny boys at best--cannibalistic jackals at worst. I developed a phobia of male authority figures, and of boys liking me. I'd pick up in the slightest sign of interest like a warning light--situation not safe! My older brother was disdainful of me, telling me that it was egotistical to assume all these guys liked me. I would laugh about it and strut around smugly when talking about it, but when actually faced with it I would freeze and feel sick. I'd want nothing more than to run run run away. My therapist thinks I must have been sexually abused at some point because of this. I don't remember anything like that. Instead I just remember having been exposed to the concepts of sex and rape from a young age, having been threatened to be left to fend for myself in a world full of those things. And of course my mother, having no boundaries, would share any story she wanted about how she liked to touch herself or about men she'd been with. When we'd grimace and tell her to stop she'd get sulky and say she didn't have anyone else to talk to about this until I got either guilty or afraid enough just to shrug and let her continue. I think I was just terrified of a grown man having no boundaries in the same way as she did, having and using authority against me the way she did. And then of course, being told that it's not that big of a deal, ""You're very cute. He just likes you!"" No idea if my mom would have reacted that way to me being assaulted or not. But I was desperately scared of finding out, and very paranoid about how commonplace it was. First I got smart. I did amazingly in school. Impressed my teachers (positive feedback! Omg!). I set myself up as a ""goodly two shoes"" and rule follower. I stayed away from risky crowds, sticking to smarter, shy girls as friends. I had crushes on nice, polite boys who were friends of mine. I felt like a repulsive, vile little pig. I wouldn't eat around others. I avoided showing any vulnerability at school. Nobody would see me enjoy a treat or relax. I was hypervigilent and aware of every second of what went on. I fantasized about being important. I started writing fiction and finished my first book at 12. It didn't last. We moved to a shitty part of a big city. My friends were smokers and already dabbling in sex. I was teased relentlessly for being smart and thinking I was ""better"" than everybody. The sexual harassment grew commonplace. My teachers still liked me, so they let me move away from the bullies. I managed to keep up my grades and optimism until 13. My mom quit her job due to her disability. She was fighting with her husband all the time, who would no longer take care of us kids now that he was the only one working. She began acting suicidal. She was on some pretty strong pain meds, so she was even more unstable than usual. She started looking into homeless shelters and talking about how she couldn't stand living with her husband anymore. I knew she was going to leave him and we'd be on the streets in a big city. I knew my mother wouldn't be able to (or willing to, perhaps) get a job and I'd have to take care of her and my little brother on my own. My older brother would abandon us and live with friends or something. I knew I would not be strong enough to keep my family alive. I was the only one who acknowledged the danger. Everyone else acted like everything was fine. Mom even told me I was being stupid when she was outside of her melodramatic flare ups. At that time, someone I was related to told me that they were romantically and sexually interested in me. It was a nightmare come true. It was horrifying and heart breaking and beyond my ability to handle. I got my first boyfriend at school to make the bullying stop. It worked. I buried myself in my social life. I didn't care about grades anymore. Then my mom finally decided she'd had enough and we left the state. Moved across the country and bummed around our extended relatives for a few months. We'd left almost everything behind. Our relatives hated the burden that we were. My older brother, who was the person I relied upon most for comfort and security when it came to my mom's absolute insanity--ended up staying to live with those relatives while we moved back across the country to live with my biological father. I didn't realize at that age (13) how lucky I was that he didn't turn us away. With nobody older than me or married to her to abuse, my mom's abuse finally magnified upon me. She'd mock me when I tried talking to her about my problems, about feeling desperately lonely because none of the soft-skinned white-bread suburban babies I went to school with understood me at all. About feeling held back from opportunities to make something of myself in the world due to everyone seeing me as a child when I felt nothing of the sort. I grew sour, fantasizing about the attractive male science teacher I had. I couldn't seem to bond with the people my age anymore. Like my heart was too weak to hold on to affection. My mom got into astronomy and I did too in an effort to be closer to her. The astronomy club was made up of old men, ages 50-70. I was 13 and desperately lonely. I ate up the attention and praise they gave me for being so mature and smart (and attractive!). I was deeply ashamed of how much I crave it. It was humiliating--they were old, my mom would show me off like a beloved dog, and I was always terrified my mom would decide she was jealous and start making comments about how pathetic I was for craving old man attention. I feared she would explain to my brother and father the real reason I was heading to the astronomy club. After dropping out of school for a few months, realizing it was horribly boring in my house where I shared my room with my brother and mother, and I went back to school. I was back in highschool, so I didn't feel as much like I was around children--just really privileged people my age. I made friends, but not many, and none that I loved the way I used to love my friends. None that I needed. I hated school. I hated the assignments that were fairly easy for me, and so became painfully repetitive. I hated feeling like an outsider, like an alien, surrounded by people who did not get me at all. Everyone assumed I was just a goody two shoes with a giant ego. I felt like I could never be ""normal"" like they were. Like I was marked and malformed. I tried to believe I was special, that I was desirable and attractive, but I couldn't get a boyfriend. I was terrified of showing any vulnerability and boys that age don't make it easier. So I focused on my writing. My mom had already been at me about my writing--telling me I needed to hurry up and finish editing something so that she could do the final pass to make to presentable to an editor or literary agent. She made it very clear I'd need her to get it published. I didn't believe that, but I played along anyway because I wanted my mom to like me and spend time with me. Plus, when she'd been my age she'd written a lot and wanted to be a novelist. I wanted to include her in the excitement of the publishing process. Looking back on this, it's amazing to me how bizarre and mixed up my life has been. How I could be someone with weird neurotic tendencies of attention seeking and hiding vulnerability, yet still cared so deeply for my mom's happiness. It all feels like it's too much for me to ever finish processing or ever understand. Does anyone know why this is? Or what it's like? "
286,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Mildly disabled mature college students first 3 days back with Nmom for the summer hell on Earth.,3,8x6ybk,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8x6ybk/mildly_disabled_mature_college_students_first_3/,2018-07-09 12:03:51,"Mildly disabled mature college students first 3 days back with Nmom for the summer hell on Earth. I will give context in () where it would be useful. Im a second-year college student going into third year with a mild disability in my 20s, Ive had to go back with Nmom and Edad over the summer because my halls are being refurbed for next year so I couldnt stay in my room with adaptions already in place and Nmoms house has most of what I need. Somewhere between 20 and 30mins of me being back in the house (having had several emotional breakdowns packing the previous week to the point of me screaming at Nmom about my life as home as much as I could without swearing at her) N Mom made a joke about my weight. Now I am obese morbidly so. However, Nmom literally never taught me to cook among other things (like use public transport which is prevalent in my country or pick out clothes I like etc. etc.) and tells me all the time I will worsen my condition if I go to a gym unless I make my presence known to everyone there (I have social anexiety at the best of times and I used the gym in high school without supervision). I must live on microwave food, fast food or restaurant food at college all year and Nmom knows this she feels its too dangerous for me to even attempt to learn or consider adaptive cooking (Im so sucked in to all this I fear trying anything new Nmom disapproves of. I have struggled with my weight since the ages of 3, 5, or 8 depending on how Nmom tells the story. Nmom kept on making digs at my weight (something I sadly feel I have no personal responsibility for because of her) and decided she was putting me on a salad diet. This consisted of one meal a day being provided me and Edda defied her and bought something else late in the evening. This was day 1. Day two Nmom launched into a Narc rant as soon as Edad was out of earshot about various different things re how I accused her of being a criminal over my welfare payments (I disputed she was handling it correctly on my behalf and said I needed to gather evidence personally not just on her say so), told me no one in my college town cares about me, repeated a suggestion that I was officially diagnosed with autism when I was 3 years old (I can disprove this and have the documents to prove it more on this later), she told me I am abnormal and I dont want to fit in with the family because I took an hour to myself the first night I got back (Im an introvert), she called me a narcissist lol and that I cant except the world to revolve around me. I took an hour alone while she was watching tv. She then continued that students are dirty because they dont do laundry every single day in halls and thus students live like tramps and I also speak weird. The above paragraph was all in the same 15min speech. Why because I asked if she would make a quick phone call about my summer welfare payments since she is the only one with authority currently to do so. She said she didnt feel like it and it would literally take 3 hours I objected to this concept in a peaceful manner. Then it took a darker turn she threatened to drag me to a doctor and have me involuntary committed to a mental hospital for defying her as well as having me kicked out of college for being a nut Repeated her claims that my above getting upset with her and having taken one of her jokes the wrong way the other week as being evidence of autism. She told me it would make her life easier if I just got diagnosed (despite the fact she had previously said in the same convo very clearly that I was diagnosed as a child just ponder the implications of that for a second if you would.) I point blank told her she had been making abusive statements to me. She countered with anyone agreeing with you is taking advantage of your vulnerability I use a chair big deal I am a college student getting a degree (which I didnt get when I was younger due to medical issues). I have previously gone to my doctor and have found NO evidence of an autism diagnosis ever. She yelled at me at the time for going to my doctor about something she said. Right. She continued to moan about how coffee Is bad for me despite it being one of my only pleasures in life since I dont drink and she told me Im too moral because wanted to check my welfare wasnt being overpaid. Funny same day I heard Nmom who doesnt work due to illnesses complaining to Edad about using his money to pay taxes. Me and Edad must speak in whispered tones when discussing the tax thing later. the walls have ears he says. Nmom randomly screams at me that the cable has been cut off. and this is relevant to me why? Day 3: Nmom thinks eating nothing but egg sandwiches is a days food. Edad is recovering from leg injury and she has him up and down going to buy her fast food of an evening because she claims due to her illnesses she cant eat anything else. I offer to buy similar food online. N mom continues to go on about my weight and autism whenever she can. Think references to Sheldon Cooper and suggesting we watch a movie with a protagonist with autism. I speak to dad about all this and the treats to have me taken to a doctor and have me thrown out of uni on mental health grounds (impossible) and he simply says, Ah she wont do it son and walks away. Post 3- she keeps making comments. Ill keep you posted this is just the highlights I assure you. She keeps treating my dad like Cinderella and have him going for fast food late at night when shes already previously eaten that afternoon on health grounds and demanding her makes her tea etc. minds our animals etc. Sorry for any spelling and grammar issues I am writing this late night. Ill keep you guys posted. Im just sick of having to live here with no freedom to even go out on my own or express the independent adult I am disability or not at college. I just feel stripped of who I am here sorry this is so long. "

Confusion from gas-lighting, them putting fears into my head, Indirect threats. Ive never slept with a knife close to me before, and so many times this year. I think ive been through indenial of it all (video games), probably with a mix of cPSTD, gaslighting and just the scope of how twistedly sick this is and how everyone thinks shes the vulnerable person she plays. Its like some kind of family vampire cult. I have nobody at the moment. No support. My Ex of 10 yr relationship also seems Narcissitic or something close to it. Her support seems to be abusive at same time. And im not sure that shes talking/helping my mum get information out of me. Their vocab in idea's is similar and the call timings are peculiar. I think im paranoid from family mobbing, which happened for 2 years after my ex left me (jump on his vulnerability). Dont know who to trust anymore. I need an understanding GF who has the insight to believe me, validate me as a person. who wont turn into an N. The worst thing is i dont have the confidence to get a job, meet new ppl and change my life. And i know they want to keep me financially ruined. I need to start looking at positive things, change my mentality and exercise it"
288,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Changing my name? Advice and thoughts happily invited,5,8ln6lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8ln6lo/changing_my_name_advice_and_thoughts_happily/,2018-05-24 07:36:21," Sorry for the wall of text, but I need to get this off my chest and I want to be as clear as possible. I'm very open to advice and suggestions on how to better protect myself in the future, as well as any advice for changing a name/identity. I left my abusers years and years ago, but I broke down last year completely after years of therapy, overworking and the worst breakup, loss of most of my friends, loss of my best therapist; I couldn't work, nearly ended up homeless, ended up in hospital after a suicide attempt. I fortunately had made a friend 8 months prior to me losing my flat who had the means to take me in, which meant moving to a new town and trying to repair there, leaving my old sense of self behind. I've definitely made some significant progress though I'm struggling immensely \- can't work, or socialise outside of my flatmates and a couple of friends over the phone but managed to work up to doing more chores, feeding myself better and more frequently, tried a new therapist that didn't work out, slowly budgeting my benefits, hygiene improved, making goals and plans to enter the community to build some healing relationships, and continue to work on triggers until I'm stable enough to work and move on. The problem I've had was two pronged: firstly my abusers are my parents and the rest of my family were mostly in the dark about the abuse. I tried opening up to an uncle and his partner, which lead to me being verbally and emotionally attacked and abandoned, and my privacy leaked to my dad. This was after being told everything was fine with one cousin who's a controlling rageaholic and another who's in her teens and suffering from anorexia \- they claim they are happy with their lives as they are. I was gaslit when I honestly and vulnerably confronted them on exposing me to my father and talking to me about his life as they understood that was my big boundary and told me ""It would ust be nice for me to know how he's doing since we don't talk. That's all"". This was after explaining my father had beaten me for being raped as a 16 yr old and triggering my chronic fatigue and the worst parts of my cPTSD which I have struggled with ever since. This is only of many stories and examples I shared with them. The consequence of this is I've decided they are fairweather/toxic family and they aren't worth keeping in contact with and they were the last family I had any hope of having a healthy relationship with. The second prong is my flatmate's family, we'll call him Erl. He has family issues of his own relating to some narcissistic abuse and physical, alcoholic abuse from his mother. He was taken out of her custody as she sometimes abandoned him for days for drink binges. She died in a carcrash when he was 9 after drinking heavily with his baby brother in the back. He luckily survived. His father then passed away almost exactly a year later in a work related accident, which was far harder for him as he had a very strong bond with his father. His grandmother adopted him after his passing and they had an odd, partly lovely, partly abusive relationship. They were very close, but she had a tendency for controlling behaviour, flipping out over minor things like flicking on a lightbulb etc. and various gaslighting, minimising/invalidating behaviours whenever she did something wrong. Because of the extensive pain of his parents loss, the intense tidal currents of his grandmother and the big age difference, in zone out into video games and he was left to his own devices most of the time. He essentially desolved his sense of self into gaming, whilst shifting like a chameleon to whoever he shared time with, avoiding anything or anyone that caused him pain or difficulty. As a consequence, he's very underdeveloped as an adult. Whilst he most certainly has some symptoms of cPTSD, he doesn't suffer from nightmares or anxiety at all. He has big issues learning new things that are emotionally challenging because he's a hide and wait till it blows over type. Since meeting me, he has begun therapy, had a short breakdown, quit video games, changed the dynamics of his friendships, started reading new things, changed his work to a new place that's less stressful for him with better pay and begun meditating and working on his emotional issues. Under extensive encouragement, he began being more honest and open with his family members, who for the most part he avoided like the plague and lying through his teeth when he did meet them because he didn't want to be bothered. Throughout this, I avoided meeting his family because he had a lot of work to do with building those relationships on his terms and I know from experience that as the new and strange variable, I will get the blame for anything they don't like. Low and behold, him opening up about his mother's abuse and drinking \- all of which must have already been known, there are public records on it \- and his grandmother's outbursts and controlling threats and that the effect they had had, that Erl was still struggling to deal with the effects and because he had had to hide it from the family, it had caused him to withdraw from them. That if they wanted to have him close, they needed to hear his truth and bear with him as he sorted through his own stuff on it, but he wanted to keep them in on the loop if they respected his boundaries on what was too much at that time. Some members took this much better than others, the split being clearly between his father's family and his mother's. His father's family seemed to be getting it, though a lot of this was new information for them and very shocking. They seemed open and loving and that hasn't changed. Unsurprisingly, his aunt \- his mother's sister \- lost it and stormed out and hasn't spoken to him since. Her partner was calmer but clearly took her side. His grandmother also denied any abuse from his mother, despite her taking custody of Erl whilst she was still alive because of the neglect \- the fact his mother lost her license for drink driving before her death probably didn't help either. Not long after, the aunt tried to add me on facebook, which I immediately guessed investigative action, not a friendly one. Erl's grandmother dodged him for 2 months afterwards, until she finally allowed him to see her yesterday. She blamed me for everything, saying I was brainwashing him and that if I was still in his life when she passed away, he would lose his inheritance. Now luckily for me, Erl isn't moved my money so there's no danger of me losing the roof over my head, but this was a very serious move against me because she wanted to deny responsibility for any wrongdoing she had done to Erl, framing the situation as black and white, I was evil, she was good. She could see what was happening despite only meeting me once \- and boy, did she like me when we met \- having never talked to me seriously about me or my life, and knowing I had no family because they had abused and abandoned me. This was the very reason I had kept my distance, I know the patterns, I know the cycles. She made it all or nothing, Erl had to choose me or the family, that if she had abused Erl that meant she had never done a thing for him; clearly not true. But none of that truly got under my skin. What did truly get under my skin was hearing after her and the aunt had got angry I hadn't accepted the false friend request, they had looked up my father \- my last name is unusual and relatively rare \- and contacted him to get ""his side of the story"". They revealed my location to him. They do not know the extent of the abuse, and it's unlikely he would come hurt me. But he does have the ability to. He now knows a part of what of my life is, struggling to recover in a small town, away from my work that I was so proud of, that I worked so hard for. This was after months of me pushing Erl to contact her and make things up. To give her a chance to understand his side of things, to build trust, to repair. She demanded he abandon me, whilst demanding he walk her down the aisle to marry the man he caught her fucking in the living\-room of his grandfather's house whilst his grandfather slept upstairs. She accused me of using him and manipulating him whilst threatening his family ties and inheritance if he stuck by me. She risked my safety to try and take advantage of my vulnerability of having no safe or loving family, so she could deny the horrors that Erl has had to go through, whilst stabbing me in the core about mine. I fought for Erl to have a connection with her because I saw a real potential for a loving relationship beyond pain if they both sat down enough and talked it out. I simply feel violated and abused again. Erl's beyond livid, I think he might have lost his grandparent over this. I feel scared again, I feel violated again, I feel like I'm burning again. Clearly she's a bitch \- I hate the word, but she clearly is. She has a history of doing this \- the aunt had to chose between the family home to live in or elsewhere because one of her daughter's was ""having too many babies"".This daughter isn't allowed in the family home. She has had three children. The grandmother had two. Clearly this is the fault of some cruel, cowardly old woman who can't take responsibility and respect other people. But this is also because I have my last name. So to the main point of this post \- how safe would changing my name realistically make me? Does anyone here have any experience changing their name? How would I need to go about telling the people who are in my life but aren't super close or trusted about the change and how would I prevent others from being able to find my family or them find me? Any advice/experience/thoughts would be very much appreciated. TL;DR \- been no contact with abusers for years, working intensely to improve life, had friend's family freak out because he's growing and changing which they blame me for and they contacted my family to try and expose and attack me. Thinking of changing my name so this can never happen again. Advice very much wanted on how to protect myself from c\*\*\*s!"
289,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Is anyone else codependent?,16,8lx5wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8lx5wq/is_anyone_else_codependent/,2018-05-25 09:23:10,"My therapist has told me that I am codependent numerous times. I thought I knew what that meant. In my mind it was ""somebody that worries too much about other people and forget about themselves."" Which.... is part of it. But I decided to Google it tonight, and was shocked at how many of the things I did! Here's a excerpt from the site I was on. ### Symptoms of Codependency The following is a list of symptoms of codependency and being in a codependent relationship. You dont need to have them all to qualify as codependent. * **Low self\-esteem.**Feeling that youre not good enough or comparing yourself to others are signs of low self\-esteem. The tricky thing about self\-esteem is that some people think highly of themselves, but its only a disguise  they actually feel unlovable or inadequate. Underneath, usually hidden from consciousness, are feelings of shame.Guilt and perfectionism often go along with [low self\-esteem](URL If everything is perfect, you dont feel bad about yourself. * **People\-pleasing.**Its fine to want to please someone you care about, but codependents usually dont think they have a choice. Saying No causes them [anxiety](URL Some codependents have a hard time saying No to anyone. They go out of their way and sacrifice their own needs to accommodate other people. * **Poor boundaries.**Boundaries are sort of an imaginary line between you and others. It divides up whats yours and somebody elses, and that applies not only to your body, money, and belongings, but also to your feelings, thoughts and needs. Thats especially where codependents get into trouble. They have blurry or weak boundaries. They feel responsible for other peoples feelings and problems or blame their own on someone else.Some codependents have rigid boundaries. They are closed off and withdrawn, making it hard for other people to get close to them. Sometimes, people flip back and forth between having weak boundaries and having rigid ones. * **Reactivity.**A consequence of poor boundaries is that you react to everyones thoughts and feelings. If someone says something you disagree with, you either believe it or become defensive. You absorb their words, because theres no boundary. With a boundary, youd realize it was just their opinion and not a reflection of you and not feel threatened by disagreements. * **Caretaking.**Another effect of poor boundaries is that if someone else has a problem, you want to help them to the point that you give up yourself. Its natural to feel empathy and sympathy for someone, but codependents start putting other people ahead of themselves. In fact, they need to help and might feel rejected if another person doesnt want help. Moreover, they keep trying to help and fix the other person, even when that person clearly isnt taking their advice. * **Control.**Control helps codependents feel safe and secure. Everyone needs some control over events in their life. You wouldnt want to live in constant uncertainty and chaos, but for codependents, control limits their ability to take risks and share their feelings. Sometimes they have an addiction that either helps them loosen up, like [alcoholism](URL or helps them hold their feelings down, like workaholism, so that they dont feel out of control.Codependents also need to control those close to them, because they need other people to behave in a certain way to feel okay. In fact, people\-pleasing and care\-taking can be used to control and manipulate people. Alternatively, codependents are bossy and tell you what you should or shouldnt do. This is a violation of someone elses boundary. * **Dysfunctional communication.**Codependents have trouble when it comes to communicating their thoughts, feelings and needs. Of course, if you dont know what you think, feel or need, this becomes a problem. Other times, you know, but you wont own up to your truth. Youre afraid to be truthful, because you dont want to upset someone else. Instead of saying, I dont like that, you might pretend that its okay or tell someone what to do. Communication becomes dishonest and confusing when you try to manipulate the other person out of fear. * **Obsessions.**Codependents have a tendency to spend their time thinking about other people or relationships. This is caused by their dependency and anxieties and fears. They can also become obsessed when they think theyve made or might make a mistake.Sometimes you can lapse into fantasy about how youd like things to be or about someone you love as a way to avoid the pain of the present. This is one way to stay in denial, discussed below, but it keeps you from living your life. * **Dependency.**Codependents need other people to like them to feel okay about themselves. Theyre afraid of being rejected or abandoned, even if they can function on their own. Others need always to be in a relationship, because they feel depressed or lonely when theyre by themselves for too long. This trait makes it hard for them to end a relationship, even when the relationship is painful or abusive. They end up feeling trapped. * **Denial.** One of the problems people face in getting help for codependency is that theyre in denial about it, meaning that they dont face their problem. Usually they think the problem is someone else or the situation. They either keep complaining or trying to fix the other person, or go from one relationship or job to another and never own up the fact that they have a problem.Codependents also deny their feelings and needs. Often, they dont know what theyre feeling and are instead focused on what others are feeling. The same thing goes for their needs. They pay attention to other peoples needs and not their own. They might be in denial of their need for space and autonomy. Although some codependents seem needy, others act like theyre self\-sufficient when it comes to needing help. They wont reach out and have trouble receiving. They are in denial of their vulnerability and need for love and intimacy. * **Problems with intimacy.**By this Im not referring to sex, although sexual dysfunction often is a reflection of an intimacy problem. Im talking about being open and close with someone in an intimate relationship. Because of the shame and weak boundaries, you might fear that youll be judged, rejected, or left. On the other hand, you may fear being smothered in a relationship and losing your autonomy. You might deny your need for closeness and feel that your partner wants too much of your time; your partner complains that youre unavailable, but he or she is denying his or her need for separateness. * **Painful emotions.**Codependency creates stress and leads to painful emotions. Shame and low self\-esteem create anxiety and fear about being judged, rejected or abandoned; making mistakes; being a failure; feeling trapped by being close or being alone. The other symptoms lead to feelings of anger and resentment, [depression](URL hopelessness, and despair. When the feelings are too much, you can feel numb. Some of this I feel doesn't apply to me. And, from what I understand, you don't have to have \*all\* the signs to be codependent. Theses are just strong indicators. I just thought it was really shocking, but also useful information. I bought a help book for codependents and am going to try and work on this part of myself more. I am hoping that this information may be of use to others!"
290,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I was basically kidnapped by narcissists,13,8n3ixo,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8n3ixo/i_was_basically_kidnapped_by_narcissists/,2018-05-30 08:53:02,"Ok, its a long story, and even though I feel like I reached adulthood without it affecting me much, its sometimes very apparent that it has. Recently I started watching The Handmaids Tale, and I realized I relate hard with the main character, and thats not something anyone should relate to regarding their childhood especially. Its triggered a lot of bad memories as a result. My birth mother and grandmother raised me until I was 9 years old. Mom was diagnosed with lupus shortly after the birth of my little sister, and when mom and my stepdad divorced, I spent some time in the summers with my grandmother while she sorted things out. I never knew my own birth father. My grandmothers brother, an extreme narcissist, saw the vulnerability my family was in and offered to help. My grandmother was in poor health herself, and my mother was wheelchair bound from her disease. When I was 9, my uncle said he was going to take me to summer camp like he had another summer, but instead, he drove me along the entire west coast, visiting random families he either knew well or had a vague acquaintance with, to see if they would adopt me. He boasted that he would adopt me himself but he didnt have a wife to care for me. He carefully critiqued these families based on their religious fervor alone. Eventually, we ended up in the home of an older couple. After a couple days, my uncle decided they were suitable, and dropped the bomb on me that my grandma and mother didnt want anything to do with me, that I was going to be put in state foster care if I didnt stay with these kind strangers. To my mother and grandmother he said that I had found Jesus and didnt want to go back to living a sinful life, that I was begging and crying to not go back to them. Because my biological family was too sick and weak to drive thousands of miles across the country to bring me home, and because everyone seemed to believe my uncle, I lived with these people for 10 more years. I was brainwashed into believing that my mother was abusing welfare, lying about her illness, abusing drugs, and abusing my younger sister. That she was a sinner and would only force me to live in sin and squalor. My uncle would show this older couple pictures of my mother sick and disheveled and her home a mess, and claim it was due to drugs, but in reality, she was suffering alone with a toddler through a divorce and an excruciating autoimmune disease. I was used to helping my mom around the house with my baby sister while I was still with her, and looking back, I was pretty smart and independent for my age. This couple didnt appreciate that, and made it their mission to dumb me down and make me act my age (act much younger than my age) for the next 10 years. They simultaneously treated me like an ignorant baby and disciplined me for not being mature enough. I wasnt allowed privacy of any kindI wasnt allowed to lock the doors of the restroom and the Mrs. would often walk in on me unannounced whether I was changing or bathing, and never batted an eye at seeing my body no matter what age I was. If I protested, I was disciplined for being disrespectful. If I misbehaved badly enough, I was threatened to be sent to foster care. I wasnt allowed to have a radio, they didnt own a tv, I wasnt allowed to wear anything that exposed my shoulders or knees or too much of my neckline or back. I could only wear dresses, no pants ever. I never learned to swim because swimsuits were out of the question. I was constantly made to apologize and be ashamed of my body. I was disciplined for the way I walked (I couldnt sway my hips at all) and I couldnt wear my hair too long or too short, and it always had to be tied back, parted in the middle. Makeup or heels were obviously sinful once I got to an age I might be interested in them. Even at the very balanced church (which I am still a member of) I was snickered about and left out by the other kids. I was homeschooled. I wasnt allowed to speak unless spoken to or have a say in anythingmy response to everything could only be a meek okay. They refused to teach me to drive or do anything other than housework because they didnt want me to be too independent and run away and get pregnant, even though I never indicated that I would be that kind of rebellious. I swallowed most of this abuse with meekness out of fear of being sent into foster care. I sassed and objected occasionally, which warranted the return of my uncle to take me away but after a stern conversation about how God chose me to be better than my sinful mother, they always reluctantly took me back. The only motivation I can imagine that these people would want to go through all this bother with me was that they enjoyed the power trip. My uncle has a long history of 6+ failed marriages for being controlling, and being a sexist douche in general. He failed raising his own children, and wanted a second chance to get credit for raising a child successfully. As for the older couple, the man was dismissive and reclusive and rarely engaged with me. The woman was controlling and constantly hovered over me. As I grew, she was also more obsessed with the fear I would seduce her husband or other general whorish behavior. (Her father was a pedo who ran away with her 16 year old mother). I eventually moved out at age 19, got a job, went to college, got my drivers license at age 21 and got married at the age of 24 to my first and only boyfriend. The main residual habits I still have is being too accepting of less than ideal situations like a job that treats me poorly, and for blaming myself for something that is someone elses fault. Thankfully, my husband is not a narc or abusive. I know its common for people raised in abuse to choose abusive partners, so Im glad Im an exception there. I reunited with my mom and both my sisters (I have an older sister who was busy being a wild teenager through most of my childhood) when I was 20. It didnt take long for us to realize we had been cheated out of a happy life together. None of us speak to that uncle any longer, and last I heard, he was sad and lonely in a camper in the middle of the desert somewhere after being divorced AGAIN. He tried coming to my wedding uninvited, but threw a tantrum as soon as he was informed he was unwelcome. As for the couple, they too are aging and never call me. They assume its my responsibility to contact them, which I have done exactly once in the last two years. Not sure how I should relate to them, since arguably they were also duped by my uncle, but they also were abusive and controlling regardless of that. Im happy to say my moms health has improved, and she can walk again. I live 8 hours from her and visit often. My younger sister is a responsible, smart, hardworking adult, a testament to my mothers resilience and wise parenting despite being handicapped most of our childhood. I feel like my childhood was stolen. No number of holidays together can make up for the time thats been stolen from us. My mom still grieves that she missed so much of my childhood. Even though shes better, she still has pain and wishes to die young. The idea of losing her when Ive missed so much time with her already is more than I can handle. I suffer with bouts of depression and shes the only reason I havent committed, many times. Yeah"

Not sure if she hates me because Im mentally ill or vice versa) mother Im having some serious problems with. As in, she is currently dead to me and there are no plans to change that in any future, immediate or otherwise. Im not really looking for advice on how to deal with this, though I wouldnt mind it. Im mostly trying to figure out whats going on with my head. This is how I get closure, to the extent that this is a real thing in real life ie. not very much. But suffice to say I find it helpful and comforting to work out the way someones head works when they start abusing me so I have an idea of how to shut them down if they (or someone else for that matter) does something similar in the future. I have this long dumb story here about how I got to this place but if you just want to skip to the list of ways my damn frustrating mother has like 2 traits of each personality disorder and it combines to make a really unpleasant person to be raised by/be around, CTRL+F for heres what I can tell you about mom. Otherwise, idk, heres some suffering porn. Maybe its informative. Maybe itll make someone feel a little better about their life. I dont know. Like I said, I dont exactly go disowning my mother every day so I dont know wtf Im doing and could use all the advice I can get really, but Im particularly looking for advice on how to figure out why shes like this. Thanks. Birth: Broken brain. Finally discovered it's bipolar 2 with a heavy emphasis on doing bipolar depression within the last year (mid 30's) and have been making progress with an unorthodox medication regimen (**NO ANTIDEPRESSANTS FOR BIPOLARS**). Tried every antidepressant on the market over a period of decades, starting at 12 or so. They either did nothing or were bupropion, which the only thing I could've told you at the time was that it made me feel *too* good. Euphoric, unable to sleep, didn't need food, this may be starting to sound familiar... I had a bunch of antidepressants that did nothing and then one that activated manic episodes that pushed the limits of hypomania and entered, I think, the low end of actual mania. This is all clear to me now that someone who knows what they're talking about has diagnosed me as bipolar and explained that there is a depressive side to it, that the bipolar depression is often deeper than unipolar depression (aka depression) and there are fewer periods of relief than either unipolar depression or Bipolar Type I, where you at least get to be manic and think you're superman and everyone wants to know you, and everything's going to work out perfectly so you spend all your money and get an STD and all that fun stuff (kidding, but I wish this shit would make me feel good once in a while if I'm going to have to deal with all the other crap that comes with it). Also: jumped and beaten with baseball bat in early teens, 4-5 other incidents of head trauma that caused me to black out (falling down stairs, bike wheel fell off while riding at a fast speed and I flew over the handlebars, etc). --&gt; probable brain damage but nobody will let me see a damn neurologist. PTSD from the baseball bat thing. Possibly anxiety in addition to the bipolar; hard to tell. Abusive alcoholic father. Mom convinced me she was the good one because she wasn't overtly abusive like he was... most of the time ... but whoaaaaboy if I could have a do-over I would've taken getting popped every now and then over the shit you're going to read about if I had to choose (obviously if I *Could* choose I would chosen to have been born to different parents, like maybe ones that were both ass-ripping guitar players and I would've spent my youth shredding my brains out instead of shredding my brains, but you know. Mice and men and all that). Long story short I went through so much shit that I know there are one or two things I'm forgetting about and I don't feel any urgency to look them up or figure them out. Can you really break a brain twice? Let's just say I went through some shit... partway. When I reached the middle I just stopped and chilled for a while. It felt like home. Ok let's get started in earnest. This is all stuff mommy dearest, the good one, the one who doesn't abuse me, did to me. ~14 years old: Told me not to date because nobody worthwhile would ever want me until I ""fix"" my mental illness, which of course is impossible. Don't know if she said that knowing how it works but I know she used to be be big into NAMI, so ... let's just go ahead and say she knew, because she probably did. Rest of my life: Intermittent comments along a similar vein. The late middle school/early high school one is the only one that stands out to me vividly enough to remember the details. I guess after a certain point it got to be ""the way it is."" Parenting for her = sitting me down and reading from the book of my failures, which was her version of ""tough love,"" imo a bad enough idea when you're treating a drug addict and objectively, no question, a category error when applied to mental illness. Compassion? Empathy? Soothing a child who is hurting? She doesn't know what these mean. If I went to her and said this happened and I feel bad she'd basically tell me how my failures brought it about and what I needed to fix and how nobody worthwhile would ever love me until I did so. And it invariably gravitated back towards other mentally ill people, who were depicted by her as sharks, snakes, users, abusers, takers. Better be careful or you might run into someone who will mess with your head, kid! Yuk yuk. So I have this huge complex about how I'm inherently unlovable and I can't figure out why, because I'm an idiot and all I knew was that she wasn't, like, sitting me down to shout at me for a half hour for walking around the house with my shoelaces untied the way dad did so she must be Good. Fast forward a bunch. Who even knows how many more of these incidents, with her restating this whole premise that is essentially ""nobody worthwhile will ever love you until you change your genetic structure"" in increasingly explicit terms (But you say you love me and my genes are still broken... what are you trying to tell me?). Culminates with... I want to protect my anonymity some, so I'll speak a little vaguely. I've had a fear since high school (I am now in my 30s). I've been afraid that the opposite gender(?)/sex(?) just inherently had no interest in me because I was A) fundamentally flawed for some reason I (used to) find myself completely unable to explain or point out the origin of. Well that confusion is now gone, at least. And B) Just terminally f'ing ugly, so ugly that I felt listening to friends and family tell me I'm not basically made me delusional because I was *actively choosing* to go along with the motions of believing things I ""knew"" (felt in my heart) not to be true. It was better to accept the chance to not have to go through life seeing myself as Quasimodo when it was offered. I felt like I was lying to myself, like *for some darn reason* that I just couldn't figure out I had this sense that none of it mattered and I was just doomed. But you can do a lot with the power of delusion, I told myself. Might as well pretend I don't think I make people sick. You can even get people to believe you sometimes. Hell maybe someday I'll even believe myself. Unsurprisingly, lifelong problems with dating. Real, real bad. Self-worth, self-love, self-hatred, self-harm, drug abuse (over that now, don't drink and take a puff of weed once every week or two, so that's good), willing to knowingly let people walk all over me just to not be alone (only child too, so...), some petty crimes, you name it. If it's anywhere on the self-hatred, -abasement, -blame spectrum I've done it. Crime up to breaking into houses... never stole a car at least. Most of the really crazy shit ended when I stopped being a teen. At any rate, we've fast forwarded to now-ish. Muther has still been intermittently telling me how I'm permanently flawed, but usually keeps it to implications and glancing blows. I'm sitting around on a dating site. Get a message from a person of the gender I'm attracted to. Someone messaged me first?! How exciting, this never happens! This person complimented me even. It felt really cool. I had no expectations, so I just talk to them a bit and then... this beast tells me that one of my facial features is ""disgusting"" and makes them ""want to puke"" and that I look like I'd give 'em a disease if they laid with me. What is, at this point, a 20+ year fear is now, in my mind at the least, confirmed fact. Snapped hard, real bad, like almost needed a rubber room. Shaking, massive adrenaline surge and accompanying cortisol spike, eyes full dilated, screaming at things that weren't there, screaming when I stood up, at one point like 8 hours later I remember the whole thing flashing back through my head and I yelled, ""No don't call me that!"" and started crying like littel babby. Most beyond the scope of this, just context. Point is, called mommy trying to get comforted. Not a word of sympathy. Not a syllable. Immediately got the damn book out again and started listing how I'd failed. Well you don't take good enough care of yourself, and you let people take too much control, and... Some truth to this, but...now? Mudder wants to tell me stuff about psychology. She wants to do that real bady. I have a psych degree, a small one but a degree nonetheless. She has some shit she read in her church's magazine to go with her office administration degree or MS Word certificate or whatever the hell she has... it's some kind of AA but it had to do with being a better clerical worker, and not a daaaaaaamn thing to do with psychology, sociology, human development, anything like that. But she won't stop talking to me from 10,000 feet in the air. So perfect. She really starts getting explicit when I pushed back on some simplistic ""this happens so then you're like this"" pseudo-Freudian crap that was more like Bad Network TV Detective Show Psychology than anything. Mother is never wrong, and can't stand being contradicted. Basically gets to a point where it's ""Yeah yeah enough of these *facts* look shut up I'm trying to lecture you."" Not quite in those words, but that sentiment. And then, in nearly these exact words: "" 'Regular' people don't want anything to do with mentally ill people. As long as you're still mentally ill, regular people aren't going to want to anything to do with you. They're not going to consider dating you. They don't want to deal with that crap."" So she has lost her temper and is accidentally telling me what she really thinks about me and people like me. And then, verbatim: ""Mentally ill people are fundamentally broken people. That's how it works."" Jaw, floor, etc. Decades of memories start coming back by to re-introduce themselves. I realize I've been in this situation many times before and I always just sat and took it. So I give other people too much control right? Fine I'll take some back. I appealed to what I thought (hoped?) was some confusion on her part, and a shared understanding that saying *and meaning* the things she said is facially monstrous. ""You understand how this works right? You get that I can never be cured? That it's in my genes? You're telling me the some huge majority of the country will *never* be interested in doing anything but taking my money, and at the same time youre telling me that the only people who *will* be interested are going to try to scam, hurt and abuse me? You realize that you just told me Im fucking *broken*, always have been, always will be. Forever. Nothing to be done about it. You realize that youre saying this because I was *born a certain way?* Do you understand the implications of what youre saying to me here? A short pause. Its true. Thats how the world works. Red phone icon red phone icon red phone ic. *booop*. Ok. I have hung up on her, which in that moment provides some satisfaction because, and I suppose this is relevant to the bigger picture, she goes *apeshit* if she gets hung up on. She thinks she has a right to I mean basically, Ive never heard anyone lay out a more airtight case for why I should top myself than the one she dropped on me that night. Turns out the figure is 82%, and they basically see me as an untouchable because of how I was born? 82% of the gender Im into will never consider dating me, not because of where my symptoms are at but because I have the disorder at all? Long story short my birth was a mistake, Im a genetic monster, and Ill always be a second-class citizen at best because I made the mistake of being *born*? Like I mentioned, its a good thing I actually know things about this stuff and realize what a load of horseshit that is or I may have ended up in serious danger. Instead it was our relationship that ended up hanging by a vine, in a bamboo cage suspended over a fire pit. I thought about it for a few days. I was shaking too hard to type properly so I made some voice recordings telling her what she had to do to have a *chance* to get back into my life: basically, take it upon herself (I used to send her tons of articles that shed claim to read but obviously yeah whatever-ed given that she never showed a sign of encountering a single one of the concepts involved, like not blaming people for having genetic medical conditions, or any medical conditions for that matter). I sat on them for a few days to make sure I wanted to send them, and in the meantime I blocked all her and her husbands numbers, email, etc. I was leaning towards no, towards this is irreparable. Towards youve been doing this my entire life, and have gone to the mat, doubled, tripled, quadrupled down on this thinking when Ive challenged you. This is what you believe, and I dont believe you can think these things without hating me. So theres my calculation: you hate me. You broke me when I was growing up, filled my head with hateful bullshit that I can trace a lot of my disordered thinking directly to now that my mind has allowed me to remember that it happened. You taught me to be bigoted against myself just like you are against me. *You. Hate. Me.* I dont want this in my life anymore. Youre gone. Youre dead to me. No second chances. Mail me my spare house keys and if you have any parting words, say them to a picture of me. More likely, crack a smile and be glad you finally have an excuse to walk away. There was more but that was the gist: *you abuse me, youve always abused me, I dont believe that any show of contrition or change will be anything but a way to regain access so you can hurt me more. Fuck you, you arent welcome at my funeral, youre dead to me, if you show up at my house Ill act like I dont see you and if you dont go away Ill call the cops and you can explain why private property laws dont apply to you. Goodbye and good luck.* Pointlessly vicious? Pointedly vicious imo. Ive let this woman get away with patting herself on the back like shes the best mother ever because she didnt physically abuse me. She just taught me that as long as I was alive, everyone would hate me. Thats all. No bigs. Is it necessarily useful? No. But if youre me, it had to be done. I was still in the process of trying to decide if I was going to send her those recordings when I noticed a voicemail from her. Looks like Android call blocking doesnt reject the call entirely, it just sends it straight to VM. And the way I felt when I saw that missed call from her I knew. There was no way I was ever going to forgive her, and I know her well enough to know shes going to accept blame anyway. I didnt listen to her voicemail but knowing her it was either a straight-up request for an apology for hanging up on her or an I know I did some bad stuff, but you hung up on me 50/50 split kind of thing. Its hopeless. Ive been estranged from my father since before I could grow hair on my face. Now Im in my 30s and I have no parents. Im having to learn how to take this all in, how to accept that this is real and that its for my own protection, and my therapist at the (admittedly overworked) local mental health clinic is *not* helping by continually ignoring my requests for an appointment. She does her own calendar, Im sorry. I cant schedule you an appointment. Ill pass the message that you want an appointment to her, said the front desk, helpfully, so helpfully, more and more helpfully each of what feels like 100 times that theyve said it without my getting a call back. So while Im at it Im disowning my therapist. What good is a therapist you cant schedule an appointment with? Sooooo theyre on notice that if I dont finally hear back from them with info about how to switch therapists by well, today now, 5/30, my new therapist will be nobody. And then Ill show them what happens when you treat a well-spoken feller with a knack for navigating bureaucracy, documenting contact with the organization, and an Android app that automatically records all my phone calls like dirt in the middle of what I would grade as a 7.5 crisis. Im burning bridges, which is a metaphor of course I might as well set that building alight too and flush anyone who just cant be bothered to return phone calls from people in crisis out so they can be well, *fired.* Yeah grievance form, cute. Now watch as I Google up the email address of the head of the entire countys mental health system. Even this new me that shakes like a leaf, jumps and starts at nothing, and screams involuntarily at some subconscious hallucination I cant fear or see has it together fairly well. Id hate to imagine what happened if they pulled this crap on one of the people I see in the lobby that carries on conversations, clearly including hearing responses, with people who arent there. Or for whom randomly screaming in fright isnt a new thing. This looks like a village that is badly in need of saving, and you know what that means. And yeah before anyone points it out, I do realize Ive got a few layers of like intersecting revenge fantasy going on here. Hey look, two nights ago I was picturing my mother burned alive and now Im just wondering what my life is going to be like and trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with her. Im sure in a couple more days Ill be less worried about destroying the village and more about just climbing the bureaucratic (phone) tree until I find someone who can solve my problems. Please dont think Im like a secret serial killer or something, Ive never been in more than a fistfight. I just had some rough shit happen to me, some mind-blowingly vicious emotional abuse delivered in a concentrated burst by a complete stranger, and two (groups of) people who are supposed to be there for me when this happens have seemingly turned their backs. Im pissed. Im venting. To the NSA Agent monitoring my reddit account, I have no intention to destroy anything or light anything on fire. I might just end up having to get someone fired, thats all. Ok thanks, good talk. Anyway, thats my story. Everyone sucks, humans are awful, life is harsh and short. Dont trust people or theyll use the opportunity to twist the knife in your gut so you can see their face as they do it, see their shit-eating grin, as they insist thats just the way the world works. Everyones letting me down. They can all eat my ass. Look Im sorry, I know this is longwinded. Its the first time Ive disowned my mother and tried to figure whats wrong with her on a sub-personality-disorder level, bear with me. Im a little disoriented and I dont know what info is relevant. I tend to be that way normally, and then this its trying to burst out of my damn head like some kind of variant alien from that movie called Trapped in Space with the Chest-Bursting Monsters, I think it was. Whatever, you know what Im talking about. Sigourney Weaver and all that. Im sorry to talk your ear off but between some random woman on a dating site closing her eyes, apparently, and hitting a bullseye on my greatest fear; me being dumb enough to forget who my mother is; her confirming why it was wrong of me to extend trust to her, let alone expect compassion; and my mental health people doing what looks suspiciously like just enough not to get sued if something goes bad here, its been a hell of a few days. But heres why Im here. I dont understand what my mother is. I know some people just go, Maaaaan my moms a frigging kook, screw this lady. Well, I mentioned I have a psych degree. I get over these things by figuring out what the hell is going on inside the head of the abuser, learning everything I can about how they work, and using it in an attempt (in vain, often, but) to never be hurt that particular way again. I could use any ideas anyone has about mommy dearest. She doesnt fit enough of the criteria to qualify for any one Cluster B disorder that I can think of (Im less familiar with BPD), but she has this mlange of traits that show up here and there throughout them. She appears to have no ability to detect or express human emotion. I cant remember a single time in my life where she showed empathy or compassion, soothed me, you know *acted like a mother* instead of saying ok time to do tough love, thatll cure you of your chemical imbalance and neuroses and, pretense established, proceeded to get that damn book out again and start raking me over the coals. This thing is bad enough that Ive gotten in touch with my estranged father just to say, look, lets cut the crap. Were never going to have some big reconciliation, but there are Big Things going on in my life right now and if you have any info on my [whooooooaaaaaa muthaaaaAAAAAAA](URL history of disposition towards the mentally ill, like has she always wanted to gas us all or did that only start after he left the house, when my stepdad showed up, a few years after he showed up and had a chance to rub off on her etc. that would would be helpful. Dad left at 12 and Mom was telling me by 14-15 that I was basically doomed as far as ever dating anyone worth knowing, and stepdad didnt show up for a couple years yet, so he didnt cause it but he may have exacerbated it. So heres what I can tell you about mom: *Cold and distant *Cruel *Ive been describing our relationship as Businesslike for decades. Oh you need help with that errand? Ok cool. I am picking you up. We are doing the errand. I am taking you home. Goodbye. Christmas and all that, Im on Twitter and people are talking about omg three-day feast with extended family yadda yadda and I'm going, like, is that really normal? Because its making me incredibly self-conscious about the 2-hour stuff your face, tear open presents, let me pack you some food, ok Im tired get outta here and have your aunt drive you home thing that involves maybe 6 people, and thats including a family friend (Ive asked my aunts if they know of any history with my mom and mentally ill people too btw) *Abusive alcoholic father. Mostly verbally/psychologically I believe, probably occasionally physical. More than anything, Grandpa Momside was such a bad drunk that he couldnt be counted on to watch the kids so there was some learning to be your own parent (or for your sister to be your parent - moms the youngest) going on there *My two aunts arent like this. They experience, express, and detect human emotion as you would expect. They feel bad when bad things happen to people who are not them. *Mom is never wrong, even if its a subject she has NFI about. Shell say some stuff she read in a church magazine, Ill respond with facts, and if my facts feel too fact-y and it kinda feels like Im right shell make clear, Ok whatever, I dont want to talk about this anymore *Always a Republican, but became a hardcore get a good job and support yourself or die in the gutter type when my libertarian-leaning fundamentalist-Republicanist stepdad showed up. Be Republican, fine whatever. Im a socialist, Im used to having to deal with stuff outside the 2-party dichotomy and reckon with the idea that sometimes Republicans are right, or more righter than Democrats anyway. But like the best summary of this guy I can give is that, during government shutdowns (oh yeah baby you bet your ass this guy works for the government) he would argued that he should not receive back pay (!) when the government opened back up. But dude you had nothing to do with it Comes the response: Did I do the work or didnt I? Maybe easy to take a bold and outrageous stance when hes getting the check either way, but he still said it. My mom is weak-willed and has shifted significantly in that direction since meeting him, but then again shes been after me about how Im just a broken piece of shit since 14-15yo. So its not all him. *Before Trump became the catchall for Republicans who just wanted to beat Hillary their choice was Cruz, fwiw. *Views things in extremes like BPD but doesnt really have much else that fits *Constantly at war with her sisters in a rotating series of allies and antagonists, again seems to fit BPD. Nothing else fits BPD. *Zero, I mean ZERO human empathy, like a narc/psychopath/APD. False image projection vanity stuff is missing from being a narc and unless shes sneaking around killing people when Im not paying attention she has no history of violence. *Lack of psychological awareness (Narc?). Seems to have no concept of theory of mind, thinks mental illness is a character flaw, etc. *Hypersensitive to certain insults or affronts, mainly centering around control issues. Hits the roof if you hang up on her when shes busy fixing you by telling you how youre a failure, for instance. Thats the big one. *Vulnerability to shame rather than guilt. Im having a bit of trouble with this one but I can say that she only ever admits doing wrong if you throw it in her face and make a big scene about what a shithead she is. She will neeeeeeeever spontaneously realize shes done wrong and apologize without having how she messed up and why its bad explained to her in detail, and most of the time shell just reject that. *Inability to see the world from the perspective of others right, theory of mind, been here, she hasnt done that. *Gets very frustrated with waitstaff, etc. even though Ive tried to explain to her a billion times that theyre not cooking her damn food. Rude to service employees in general. Stingy tipper. *(Psychopathy) Meanness. Yeah Id say so. *Narcissistic rage? Maybe? Like screwing up and telling your only child theyre basically doomed from birth, and then saying the hell with it and doubling down? *Buying love. Where a regular mother would hug me and tell me she loves me and is proud of me for hanging on through all this crap blah blah, mine will say nothing and then pay for my groceries for me if we go shopping. Overly fixated on money and status in general- constantly DIY improving their house, to the point where shes complained of wanting a break because shes fatigured. But  she cant  or else .? She doesnt really seem to know why shes doing it, she just knows itll be bad if she doesnt. *Lack of remorse. When shes hurt me in the past and Ive cut her out for a week or two her apologies always feel instrumental. Just what ya gotta do to get that access back, and sure enough within a few months shell be hurting me again. *No praise, nooooooo praise, and generally doesnt care about me as a person. I had a severe drinking problem which I regarded as very bad, and I smoked a lot of weed which i regarded as \_()_/. Now I drink zero alcohol and smoke weed a couple times a week. She knows about the former and hasnt said a word of congratulation, and she doesnt know about the second one because she doesnt give a shit enough about me to ask any questions that would bring it up. Thats all I can really think of. I know you guys cant diagnose my mummy, but maybe theres a pattern in here that someone recognizes. Something I can look into more. Because she has like one or two trait from each Cluster B disorder but never anywhere near enough for a diagnosis, even an armchair one. Do we sometimes just give up figuring people out and go, Ehh, miserable person. Unsolvable at this level of expertise? Because that would be very frustrating to me tbh. I want to wip her head open and see how she ticks, like some other people Ive encountered who were clearly narcs, so I can learn something here. If I cant categorize her. How do I learn? Thats a serious question. I know it must be possible, but what do I do? Because most of my experience dealing with people who clearly have a personality disorder is tearing through the DSM and the online descriptions, looking for traits/symptoms that match, and looking for them to exceed the minimum diagnostic threshold significantly because idk what Im doing here so I have to leave room for me screwing up a few of them. Like the lady I met who checked 9/9 boxes on the DSM IV yeah pretty sure that was a narc. But mimsy here, I just dont know. Im not talented enough at this stuff to figure out what someone is if Im going to have to do like spectrum diagnosis from my couch. I just want to understand why shes like this so I can stop her from hurting me (ie convincing me to let her back in then pulling this crap again) and stop other people from hurting me similarly. Im sorry to ramble. Its been a lot to deal with. Any advice is greatly appreciated, even if its just another sub like this to go ask in, And I'm sorry for talking your ~~ears~~ eyes off, I've just never really been here before. A forum like this didn't exist when Dad left and I'm going to have to disown my mom a few more times to really get the hang of it and figure out what I'm doing here, y'know? Thanks....

I havent had a best friend since junior high, and after we had a painful falling out, I never have again until I met my boyfriend, who is now my best friend. But we need people besides our partners in our lives, and Ive longed for a real female best friend ever since junior high. However,the way I tend to isolate myself and avoid people because of fear and vulnerability suggests to me this will be difficult.la difficult goal to achieve- that and the fact that it can be hard to find people you click with, much less someone you feel comfortable enough with to risk getting close to. Ive never told anyone that because I feel like its embarrassing to say. That was kind of cathartic."

I hate my life and so I am choosing to make it uncomfortable. I have used many distractions to avoid my troubling problems: video games, porn, food, school work. Yes, even school work was a huge addiction, an escapism (maybe I will date, maybe I will get a career, maybe I will have a non-abusive home). In fact, having a career and watching porn gave me the same hope-filled arousal built on an imaginary concept of escapism. I am 25 fucking years old. I was ""forced"" to go to college until I literally had a mental breakdown and started to fight everyone within a 5-foot radius. I tried to kill myself. I tried to end the suffering. I was addicted to grades because it felt like the better grade I got, the more the professor valued/cared for me. I was coping with my own vulnerability and lack of emotional awareness. I used their praise for my own misguided sense of self-worth and lack of a loving family structure. My home is hell. It is a hoarding bullshit filled with enabling and the worse kind of consumptionism. My parents have no friends. I have no friends. Naturally the only friends I really had growing up was my dad and my sister. I had a choice at a young age between school and my home. I normally picked my previous house: it had so many interactions. Lots of natural things to explore. And so I skipped school most of the time. My new home was infested, gutted, and left with piles of ""stuff"" that has just accumulated over the years. My mother has a spending problem. My mother has a communication problem. My mother is a bitch. And so school became my new narcissistic hell. The worse pain happened when I started to repeat the routines. There was a reason why groundhog day or Edge of Tomorrow are appealing to me: the level of control over one's situation grows with more situational and introspective awareness the more they repeat it. And so over the past years I have started to see all these routines starting and stopping. The enabling, the coping, the promise of hope. As soon as I see it starting, I start to melt the fuck down. I have been crying, screaming, and raging. Closing my eyes and ears and just screaming ""SHUT THE FUCK UP."" I am not normally violent. In fact, I went away on a trip for three whole weeks a few months ago. This was the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE AND MY PARENTS AND SCHOOL. I forgot all about the house, the emotions, the feeling of being entrapped, everything disappeared. Until I got back... When I was away I could think, I could read, I could process things 10 times quicker. My teachers said I had a learning disability, my parents wanted a fix, and I just felt trapped. I have been labeled ""aspergers"" by doctors but I think it is bullshit. My true label is CPTSD but that was skipped because during the performance evaluation, a significant amount of the information was told (like an interview) on MY MOTHER'S PERSPECTIVE. I froze up instead of hammering that point across everyone's head and slamming the results as biased. I froze up. It was one of the worst mistakes of my life. I do not know what to do again. I am freezing up. Again. Please help me not make a second mistake. Please. What can I do? "

I'm poor, and have no insurance (health or moped insurance, as it isn't required in my state to have a moped insured if the engine is a certain size) because of a 3-year stint of my Nmom kicking me out and almost killing me when I was 17. All of this has been new and terrifying for me. Fortunately, the woman admitted fault to hitting me (I was already in my lane) so when I made a police report it was cut and dry. But I had to call my boyfriend to even ask what to do first, what to do in terms of getting insurance information, etc. I remembered to take pictures of my bike and her car and license plate in case she drove off. I have been feeling alone throughout all of this. I've kept a tough face and have been making the decisions I need to make (quickly getting an attorney, something I've never had to do, and something I have took a leap of faith with with him being the right one) but I feel like this has been the longest 3 days of my life. My boyfriend definitely has narc fleas from his Ndad, and these affect our relationship, and have been making my last few days hard. He's been second-guessing and playing devil's advocate/fearmongering (unintentionally I think, but still) on every decision I've made. The first day after the accident, the adrenaline had finally left my and my body aches everywhere, and something is up with my ribs, as I have problems breathing. I walk with a limp and have no money for a set of crutches right now, and the first thing he does that morning, when I'm supposed to go to the doctor, and get snippy with me. He's acting passive aggressive all morning while I stress out and try to find an attorney and hospitals myself. I finally confront him and ask what the hell his issue is and tell him to stop beating around the bush, and he informs me that he's just been sour because it was ""Not how he planned on spending his weekend"". That for maybe a week or so while I recover that he'll have to be the one to walk the dog and take me to my hospital visits, and that I'll miss work, and that he had plans this weekend. He apologized for the attitude, but it's still been sitting horridly with me the last three days. I am in alot of pain right now (can't sit up comfortably at all because of some unidentified spinal issues from the crash), stress from an argument he and I just had (separate from the first) and his negativity reaching me about whether or not I picked the right attorney and if I'll actually get a settlement or end up in debt. He keeps saying stuff like ""Well, you might not even get like, 10k. You need to keep that in mind."" and, ""Do you really need an MRI? When I've gotten injuries, I've just seen a doctor and been done with it."" My SO operates off of fear, and I've been homeless on adn off before we moved in together, so I have to act off of my gut, and it hasn't failed me. But his fear and negative-Nancy attitude and need to only think about the worst case scenarios so he doesn't get dissappointed is rubbing off on me. I'm so fucking stressed out, and I've been freaking out, and feeling alone, and I just thought, ""I want my mom."" out of reflex and vulnerability, as if she was ever there for me when I wasn't NC. And I don't have one. I don't have a motherly figure. I don't have anyone to hold me right now. I feel so fucking alone. I'm supposed to have a mom to hold my hand while I go through these waves of pain. I'm supposed to have parents calling in and checking on me or flying out to see me. I'm supposed to have people helping me handle this because I'm fucking 21 and I don't know what I'm doing and I'm scared. I'm dealing with both the other person's insurance company being nice and playing on my emotional need to feel safe and trying to swindle me out of any kind of a settlement, and then my lawyer who's job it also is to make me feel safe and like a part of some family of some sort when really he's just trying to make his money too. I can't even cuddle my dog because she has no bodily awareness and steps on my leg, which a doctor that I've seen believes I have a contusion on from the accident, and that sends blinding, searing pain up my leg. I've woken up in the middle of the night in so much pain I can't sleep and I have no meds. And after pointing out to my boyfriend that I feel fucking alone and that he hasn't been a part of this (aside from taking me to the doctor since I can't drive rn because of my injuries and my moped being broken) and when he feels bad, he can only think of himself and his own guilt. *I* don't get comforted, and he goes and wallows alone or does what he can to take his mind off of the guilt. He's in the next room Redditing on his phone and has left me to cry by myself. Fortunately, my attorney has me seeing specialists on a lean, so I can go to an orthopedic office tomorrow to see what's really wrong with me. But until then, no meds, no help, and no work or transportation to get there (my bike is very damaged right now and cannot get fixed until an automotive adjuster handles that, as my attorney handles the medical side of things). I feel like I'm too young to deal with this. There are times where I'm riding high and trying to see the blessing in disguise that a good settlement from my attorney can get me is. Then there are times that I feel like this... like I feel like I'm alone and things are falling apart and that I just got hit by a fucking car. I'm happy to be alive and I'm really trying to not take that for granted at all -- if it was a bigger car than a four-door, I'd definitely be dead. But thinking about all of the pieces of this fucked up puzzle (feeling isolated by my boyfriend, untrustworthy attorneys AND insurance teams trying to get what they can out of me, missing work and getting fucked financially, etc.) I am fucking miserable. I just want to fucking run. I want to hide in a ball and make everyone around me disappear because I left my mother to be away from this selfishness. I feel like I'm fucking surrounded by it right now and that no one can think of anything but themselves and that no one has *my* back in times of crisis, despite the fact that I've been there for my boyfriend through his parent's divorce that's ongoing, and when he's gotten sick. That everyone I meet assumes I'm fine because I can't afford crutches, and I'm speaking normally, and my contusion isn't really visible, so they think my injuries aren't bad and no one cares. I don't have any friends where we live. I don't have any family. I just want for one day for people to care. I'm sobbing my eyes out right now and no one can hear me. "
295,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,The Cycle Stops Here: A Borderline on a Narcissist,33,8oewcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8oewcb/the_cycle_stops_here_a_borderline_on_a_narcissist/,2018-06-04 15:33:17,"The cycle stops with me. My damaged, angry, broken, narcissistic father could bring you to tears with some of the stories of his childhood. His mother was an evil woman, belonging to a generation of personality disorders that went undiagnosed. On one occasion, she joked that he would stab him with the knife she began to cut into his birthday cake with. This wasnt funny coming from a woman who had thrown soup cans at his head and calmly watched as blood dripped from his skull. For Christmas, he would wrap his old toys to create the illusion of love. He wanted to pretend for that morning, so that when his sister opened her gifts he wasnt alone. I was verbally abused on a regular basis, especially as a young child. Worse, I endured many family therapy sessions wherein he explained these outbursts as healthy, necessary, and my problem. Neurolinguistic Programming had taught him how to manipulate even better, and he was actively using it to demand that I reframe my perception of these events, to process his abuse in a positive way. I have an entry in my diary as an eight year old that says that I want to hang myself and die. How does a little girl wish to hang herself? Other pages in this diary recount how afraid I am that he is going to hurt me, because I am almost sure that he hates me. But still. What make a little girl, who has very little concept of death really *want* to die? As I got older, I began to act out and challenge him by cutting the extension cord. I took the abuse for so long before it bubbled over. My father is scarred and he scarred me. I now have been diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and it is no match for his narcissism. I crumple for him and any abuser. There is a lot of stigma around those with BPD. Contrary to popular belief, people with BPD are not monsters and with the reputation they have you might be surprised to know they they are extremely susceptible to outside influence and just generally vulnerable. And narcissists crave vulnerability, as it lets them infiltrate. I was molded and made into the perfect target. Not only have I experienced this trauma, but this trauma has rewired by brain to be more susceptible and willing to accept this very brand trauma. I once had a therapist who marveled at the chaotic state of my relationship with my father and insisted she write a book on how narcissist fathers create borderline daughters. At the time, it really bothered me, but I can sort of see her excitement now. It is an interestingly terrible cycle and one I refuse to let continue. I dont love myself yet and I dont know if I ever will, but I know that I dont hurt people and I dont ever want to. It is extremely difficult regulating my emotions. It takes courage and dedication to change something about yourself that as broken as it is, once blossomed in the wake of your tragedy. For many years I let myself fly off the handle, hoping I would just crash and burn. Not caring was the only thing that saved me as child. Many times my father would yell at me, my little girl body would drift to earth and I would rise above it all, finally weightless and numb. My father taught me to dissociate. He taught me to hate myself. He ripped away my sense of self and left me with an undying sense of abandonment and worthlessness. It is so mind boggling that a parent could treat a child the way I have been treated. It warps your view of people, so that you always assume bad intentions, because its the only thing that has ever protected you. This is BPD in a nutshell. Today, I struggle to be in my body, so that I can be there for the ones that I love. I want to see them for exactly who they are and never who I want them to be. I want to be present in this moment with them and give them all the validation they deserve to know that they are valued and I appreciate them. I am damaged, but I am not broken. Everyday is a struggle, but Ive been told I am in remission and it is a beautiful feeling to live a life beyond chaos. The cycle stops with me."
296,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"I hate my malignant, soul-sucking Ndad.",11,8psut6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8psut6/i_hate_my_malignant_soulsucking_ndad/,2018-06-09 23:42:22,"This is long so there will be a TL;DR at the end. Also, please note that I've included a Trigger Warning further down. I'm a female in her 40s with a life-limiting disease. My whole life has been a non-stop clusterfuck thanks to my soul-sucking demon of an Ndad and his dumb, enabler wife (my N/Emom). My nick-name for Ndad is the Tyrant and as a child I called him Satan behind his back. Thanks to the Tyrant, I've never had a long-term boyfriend or husband, just short-term flings. The longest ""relationship"" I had lasted around 3 months. I have a phobia of men, mainly large groups of guys (any age) or older men by themselves. I often feel terrified and disgusted if an old man stands close to me. The logical part of my brain knows that he's harmless but the primal part feels the flight response kicking in. In general, my life is a shambles. Everything I touch crumbles and turns to dust. I have very few friends I rarely see and no reliable network of people. In short, I'm deeply lonely and always have been since the toxic DNA donors socially isolated me. Growing up, I was a SG and Lost Child. As an adult, I feel like an aimless ghost. I've never had kids because I don't have a mothering instinct. I was never nurtured, just beaten or ignored, so how could I even know how to nurture someone? I can't even keep a plant or a pet. I did rescue a kitten once but I had to give him away to a good home. Any nurturing instinct I had for the kitten faded away within 3 weeks. I also tried keeping plants as well but they all died. Probably they reflected the fact that I'm dead inside. I've been in therapy for years and have done some EMDR. My first therapist actually dumped me because she couldn't deal with my deep, unending layers of trauma. My new therapist has diagnosed that I'm Hypersensitive with CPTSD. To people who don't know about hypersensitivity, it means that you're over-sensitive to external stimuli like noise, touch, etc. Imagine being HYPER-sensitive and growing up with a sadistic brute who screamed at me and beat me up. No wonder I eventually broke. Finally, I have a life-limiting disease with docs predicting that I'll be gone within 1-2 years. I won't say much else on this other than I'm certain the disease has been caused by my deep trauma. Growing up in deep despair and terror broke my mind first and then my body. Tbh I keep thinking that I'd like to speed up the process and end things soon. Hopefully, I'll find peace when I'm gone. (Trigger Warning here including covert incest) Some evil things the Tyrant did to me as a child: 1. Started throwing me out of the house when I was a little toddler. One of my earliest memories is sitting all alone in a field for hours. I was only a little 3-year-old girl! As I got older, he'd frequently scream at me to ""join the other animals outside"". I have many memories of being abandoned alone in a field for hours. 2. Started smacking me when I was only 2-3 yo. That escalated to beatings over time. Please note that the smacks and beatings weren't for ""discipline"" reasons. I was very bell-behaved and too terrified to be naughty. They were in order to take out his rage on a tiny child and gratify his sadism. For example, I got smacked for drinking water out of the bathroom tap. Where's the fucking logic in that? Or I got smacked by the sick fuck for doing something cute like cuddling a kitten. 3. His evil eyes would follow me everywhere just so that he could spot me doing a ""transgression"". That would give him an excuse to explode into a rage and scream at me and beat me up. My so-called transgressions included doing normal everyday things that little kids do: getting excited, giggling, talking in a loud voice, being playful, etc. It wasn't long before he broke my spirit and by the age of 8, I was a sullen, quiet, miserable kid. My teachers noticed that there was something wrong with me but no one stepped in to help me. 4. Covert incest. Exposed himself to me when I was 3 yo. By the age of 8 I was drawing naked men with full, detailed genitalia. When I was 11 yo he showed me a magazine full of naked people, including girls my age because it was photos from a nudist beach. When I was around 11-12 yo he would walk around the flat naked and laughed at mine and my siblings' disgust. Even now, in his 80s, he gives off creeper vibes and my sister (53 yo) and I refuse to go near him. I don't remember being touched by him thankfully. However, he creeps me out so much that I believe my brain has blocked that trauma. 5. I was a deeply depressed, introverted little kid with suicidal ideations. His favourite phrase to scream at me was: ""I'll kill you, little bastard"". He would also threaten to strangle me and break my neck. Because he kept screaming that he'd kill me, he put the idea in my head that I was better off dead. I became obsessed with death and dying. No coincidence that I'll be dead from my disease within the next couple of years. He'll get what he always wanted I guess. 6. When he saw how miserable and depressed I looked, he would beat me up because in his words:""You should smile when you see me"". Writing it down makes me realise how insane and sadistic this fucking bastard is. He would also scream ""Who do you think you are???"" just in case I got any ideas that I wasn't a worthless piece of shit. 7. He spent every afternoon sleeping so I couldn't bring any of my few friends home. The flat always had a heavy, toxic, haunted feeling to it and it was silent like a crypt. No one could believe that 3 children lived there because it was so deadly quiet. It was like a horror film with the demon slumbering away in his lair while we tiptoed around on eggshells, terrified to wake him up and face his rage. We could only speak to each other in whispers. One time, a girl from school dropped in unannounced. I remember feeling pure terror that the doorbell might wake him up. Also, when the telephone rang my heart would skip a beat. If you didn't wake him up for the phone call, he'd scream at you in the demon voice. If you did wake him up, he'd also scream. There was no pleasing this bastard. 8. When I was 8 years old, he threatened to cut my hands off. He had bought a bag of peaches and I kept eating them. I was so traumatised by the threat of mutilation that I had nightmares for years afterwards. It even became psychosomatic and I had strange pains in my wrists as a teenager. 9. By the age of 8 or 9 I started actively avoided him. When the Tyrant noticed this, he escalated his attempts of violating my boundaries. He would force me to sit next to him and explode into a rage when I scurried away if I saw him. My reaction to him since that age has been a visceral disgust and to get the hell away from him. He stinks too which makes his creeper vibes extra disgusting. 10. When I was 9 years old, I had a fungal infection on my hands and head. I got beaten up because ""it was my fault"". When I was 14 yo, I had pleurisy (fluid around the lungs) and was in agony for a whole week before being taken to the doctor. I heard him telling N/Emom ""It's her fault because she doesn't look after herself"". 11. On my 10th birthday, I had a falling out with my brother. I didn't really have any friends, so some family friends were invited over for my ""birthday party"". Just as I was poised to blow the candles out, the beast started screaming at me in front of all the guests! The soul-sucking demon had just been told about my fight with my brother so he had a temper tantrum. Fucking overgrown toddler. Being the SG, I rarely got any birthday parties anyway so trust this shitbag to ruin one of my FEW birthday parties. 12. I have some memories of him kicking me out of the car and making me walk because I ""looked miserable"". When I was 13 yo, he kicked me out of the car and made me walk for miles in tight, new boots. My feet were shredded by the time I got home. Then he supposedly ""felt guilty"" in my N/Emom's words. This means that he moped around like a little bitch for a few days but never apologised to me directly. Oh, and the poor ""martyr"" cleaned my boots for me. 13. He would scream at me when I looked miserable and he would mock me when I laughed. He claimed that my laughter was ""bestial"". There was no winning with him. Every single thing I did was wrong and I got singled out for the most brutal treatment. I believe it's because I was the youngest and he hates the vulnerability of children. He was the predator and I was the prey. 14. When I was 14 yo he beat the living daylights out of me for getting into trouble at school. When my sister was 16, he beat her so badly with an umbrella that she was full of bruises for weeks. This was the 1980s in a Third World country. There was no such thing as CPS or even calling the police because they would have sided with the beast. Now the Tyrant is in his 80s and still as malignant, verbally abusive, evil and arrogant as when he was younger. He's a grandiose narcissist, totally full of himself and his self-importance. He seems oblivious to the fact that he rarely sees his son and his daughters hate him and refuse to sit anywhere near him. I can't wait for this ass-clown to die and I'm furious that he might outlive me. This piece of shit is healthy, while I'm dealing with pain, depression and deep loneliness every day thanks to his violent abuse. TL;DR My Ndad was an abusive and violent beast to me when I was growing up. He has left me with a phobia of men and I've never had a SO. I have a life-limiting disease now which I'm positive was caused by my deeply traumatic childhood. He's in 80s and still healthy, totally oblivious to the havoc he's wreaked on my life. If he knew he wouldn't care anyway. Fuck him. "

I repeatedly felt explosions of emotion inside my chest as I was essentially trained not to react, show a facade and wear a mask. This in turn resulted in taking on narcissistic-like behaviours and being unable to connect emotionally with people later in life because of lack of trust and not being able to act naturally around anyone. Over the years I felt the tightness on my chest getting harder as my only interactions were with people who kept attacking my core, in response to which I had to fortify my chest shield even more, which kept me further from bonding with normal people in a vicious cycle. I only removed the shield when I fell in love for the first time and allowed myself to feel vulnerable and to be hurt, but it was too late and only after the relationship ended. For the first in a long time I let go of control at the cost of being hurt, and I found out that it didn't kill me and that being hurt and rejected, while painful, is a pain that is bearable and is better than being completely shut off to others. Now that I'm going through a court case with a lifelong narcissistic ""friend"" I need to keep my emotions under tight control again so I don't overreact to every new infuriating move that they do against me. It doesn't feel like that accursed stone shield over the heart, but I do need to maintain high levels of self control and awareness without allowing myself to be spontaneous. Is maintaining an iron grip over my emotions a desired natural skill of growing up and having to ""adult"" in the world? I don't want to lose my childish innocence and spontaneity and end up a perfectly controlled cold emotionless bastard like the narcissists. It seems to me that the narcissist, having given up their true self (spontaneous expression of genuine emotion, positive or negative) early in life in exchange for power, sacrificing the capability to be exposed (vulnerable) and authentically bond with others, are driven with internal rage to force others to make the same sacrifice by mercilessly attacking their core being (self esteem, emotions, perception of reality), punching where the wound is, so to speak, do that the other has to fortify more and more as long as they are around, but in the process losing their capacity for vulnerability. Will I be able to lose control and fall in love ever again with this constant holding back? On the other hand I can't allow myself to be manipulated emotionally like this, ever again. Am I being drawn into another trap that will estrange me from my feelings? Does anyone else has this dilemma?"

Despite numerous attempts to explain what it is that I do for a living, I suspect she doesnt care enough to listen, let alone commit it to memory. Perhaps its because she talks at me rather than to me. We see each other regularly; yet I feel invisible. It exposes a vulnerability with every attempt to be seen and heard. This just one small aspect of my life she knows nothing about. It would be nice to have a connection and loving relationship but I fear these unreciprocated attempts are causing more harm/pain than good. Im not at a point where Id like to go NC but am at a loss as to how to proceed. Guidance and/or suggestions would be welcomed and appreciated. "
300,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,realized I was raised by an nMother...but I still hate myself [first-time poster],1,8f7brq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8f7brq/realized_i_was_raised_by_an_nmotherbut_i_still/,2018-04-27 09:52:42,"After more than a year of being estranged from my mother, I've begun thinking about my childhood relationship with her and its effect on my current negative thinking habits and low self-esteem. I've always been anxious/shy, but recently I've noticed that my toxic inner dialogue has begun to negatively affect all aspects of my life. I used to think I had a pretty normal upbringing with a seemingly loving parent, but after doing a lot of reflection and research, I've come to realize that I was raised by an nMother (albeit, a very charismatic one whose nqualities were hidden from family and friends and were tolerated by my non-confrontational father). My question is how do I deal with the cognitive dissonance that seems to persist, even after recognizing the truly messed up nature of my mother's actions? I feel like my entire life has been a lie and I'm ashamed that I didn't realize how dysfunctional my family life was until it was too late to actively intervene. I'm an adult now, but the damage has been done, and I'm bitter that I'm the only who has to deal with effects of my mother's dysfunction. Additionally, the manifestations of my own mental health issues (depression, anxiety, ADHD Inattentive, diagnosed at 23) were viewed as calculated misbehaviour on my part. There were never any conversations about feelings or self-esteem...EVER. And whenever I did something wrong I would be screamed at, called names, even get kicked out at 13 for lying but also being manipulated to also remain under the thumb of my nMother because my father ""doesn't want you, he doesn't even have his own house."" (mind you my misbehaviour was always in the form of lying because I wanted to avoid confrontation in the first place). I used to be confused at the sad state of my life, my extreme avoidance of confrontation and my crippling anxiety because I never had any experiences with the obvious types of abuse that lead to trauma. But it turns out I was being surreptitiously traumatized for my entire life without myself or my family even realizing it! Just a few example of the the dysfunctional behaviour exhibited by my mother are: - Responding negatively to any expressions of vulnerability (e.g. I used to play tennis and when I expressed that I was scared to be playing the number one seed in the province I was yelled at. It went something like ""why the f*** are you scared?"" - Attempting to manipulate me with money (e.g constantly reminding me how money was spent on my extra curricular activities when I would dissent. ""You know how much money I spend on *insert activity here* and you can't do this one thing?"" This was usually meant as a joke but the underlying sentiment was real - Using extremely hurtful language to reprimand me when i did something wrong (I've been called a piece of shit, a bitch, stupid, etc.) - Essentially lacking a strong moral compass (she would constantly call my dad a piece of shit and ask me if I knew I.e. ""You know your dad's a piece of shit right?"" - Forcing me to have a sweet 16 and getting angry at the fact that I wanted a small get together instead (for that I was deemed ""ungrateful"") - Literally threatening to not go to my 8th grade confirmation because I wanted to wear my hair in a middle part instead of a side part. It's not that I used to view the above examples as ""normal"" but because they would be offset with seemingly loving actions the severity of the dysfunction was blunted. We went on a lot of vacations as a kid, I was known to always be put together by my peers, and she also very personable, to the point where some of my friends had a better rapport with her than they did with me. I also come from a Caribbean background, where beatings for misbehaviour and raised voices are ordinary parenting techniques. My father lived a bit aways so I don't even know if he knew how toxic my mother could be. And because he would chalk it up to my mom's personality (he's a really low key guy), I never saw the need to complain to him. My question is, how do I move forward after having the rug pulled from under me? I'm more resentful of myself for not realizing the severity of my situation/speaking up... how do I reconcile the seemingly incommensurable concepts of personal responsibility on the one hand and the very real affects effects of my nMother's behaviour on my mindset on the other?

I love her. But Ive always known that I cant come to her about my fears or injuries, because she will belittle and diminish them. I got a concussion when I was seven and was knocked out. I woke up in the nurses office at my school and couldnt remember what had happened. When my mother got there, the nurse asked me if I knew what had happened and I said I couldnt remember. My mother told me listen, youve already gotten enough attention. You dont need to be a drama queen about it. A few months ago, I started showing symptoms for leukemia. I didnt notice it at first, but then the early-morning fevers and night sweats, the bruises, headaches, mouth ulcers, swollen glands and exhaustion all led up to an excruciating bout of bone and joint pain that landed me in the hospital. So, Im being tested. Against my better judgment, I told my mother I was scared. Im seventeen, and I just started university. She immediately started diminishing and belittling. Oh, you have to have this symptom and this symptom for it to be leukemia! Youre fine! (Side note, I had both symptoms and have shown her both symptoms on previous occasionsshed completely forgotten) Anyway, I expected that. It wasnt ideal, but it was fine. My mother isnt perfect. I figured this was her way of reassuring me, however misguided it is. Well, I dont know what the results are yet. I was released from the hospital but sent for more blood tests, so we still dont know. Today, my mother came home looking exhausted. I asked her if she was okay and she said Im just worried. I asked about what? And she said well, now that youve told me you have leukemia and just started laughing hysterically, as if it was a big joke. Shes never outrightly turned my vulnerability and fear around on me and used it to attack me before. Im *so fucking* hurt. Ive never been this hurt by her. How could she make this a joke? Im *scared* and shes laughing about it. "

I wasn't sure if this post should be on r/advice or this subreddit, but I figured since this is the topic of parents, this subreddit is more suitable. I've been contemplating if I should keep in contact with my parents as I get older. I'm currently 20 years old, and studying at university. By 2021 I should be graduating, and then I'm off into the real world. In all honesty, I don't want to keep much contact with my parents. I feel they talk a lot of shit about me behind my back, especially about how stupid I fucking am. Because of this, I've just grown to become so fuckung uncomfortable being myself around them. I've made some very little attempts at vulnerability, but I feel they just pass it off as nothing. But to me, it took my whole fucking being to actually show some personality of mine towards you that isn't fake. It's not like they're bad people. They aren't, but I am so uncomfortable being around them that it's hard for me to even think straight, because I don't want to sound like an idiot. I just feel like I'm a piece of shit, because what kind of son would want to abandon their parents because of their fear towards them? I am an adult, yes? It is my decision to do this, but I personally feel this isn't healthy for me. If I am to be vulnerable, my mom would most likely talk about it with my step-father, leaving me embarrassed and hateful at the fact I even considered trying to open up to you.

I remember overhearing my mom discuss with my step-father that she thinks we are just going to move on with our lives and forget about her. In my position, I don't see why wouldn't I. Throughout my entre life (I'm 20), all I've done was try to do things you wanted me to do, just to please you. You taught me SOME things, but compared to everyone around me at university, I wasn't taught the things that are actually IMPORTANT. Mostly everything I know now I learned on my own or through school. I don't want to have to spend more of my life having to support her, but apparently I'm a bad child for not wanting to be around you? You accused me of not being normal, demanded me to be normal, and you think I can be vulnerable with you? You most likely think I am stupid (you even said I was years ago), your husband thinks I am a fucking idiot. Do you honestly think I would want to be around you when you quitely betlittle me and my intellectual capabilities? Days ago, I actually had a slight taste of what the real world was like without my mother scowling my movements, and it felt nice. I would not say she's a bad person, just very fucking judgemental of people who aren't ""normal"" in her eyes. I also don't think I don't respect her. I think we both have different meanings of the word respect. I think she thinks that going through a hard life and talking about all the suffering is a way of respect, but it isn't to me. Respect to me is being able to accept someone, despite the fact you know you have all the power in the world to destroy them, because they have become vulnerabe around you. My definition of respect is more on the emotional side rather than the hard working side, if that makes sense. I have been able to achieve this bond with friends, and maybe even my little sister, but I feel the possibility of it ever coming between me and my mom is just not oging to happen. She has no idea how hard it was for me to even send a text sending ""I love you."" Most likely all my attempts are being vulnerable she took as nothing, so fuck you for that ""mom."" I hope I'm not sound like a rebel teenager, it's just I take vulnerability very fucking seriously because it's important to me. I have realized I seem to be more happier when I'm on my own. I can learn whatever I wish, and if I fail, I know I won't have someone to make fun of me behind my back about being so stupid. Fuck this, man. I'm sorry that I may be going on a tirade against this, but I am just fucking annoyed that I'm a bad child because I just want to live life. I even got a job for you (I work as a janitor), but even that annoys you? The reason why I got a job as a fucking janitor was to fucking challenge myself to do a physical job like cleaning. I'm not really a person that likes the easy way, because I guess I get more satisfaction from things that are harder to do. I have so much potential, and I know I have it, but I feel all my mom does is talk shit about my supposed ambitions behind my back, like I can't do them. Yes, I can't do them, if you constantly fucking rebel against every decision I make that you don't fucking like! It kind of sucks that at 20 years old, you come to the realization of how much pain you went through with your parent. I'm not interested in your life struggles, because you and I have different fucking ways of viewing the world. Just fuck it. I want to settle this matter so I can do things I wish to do without her knowing. I've grown to not tell her things because she freaks out when it isn't something she wants. Thoughts about this, if any.? "

She talked about numbing ourselves and the ensuing dangerous cycles, and holy shit, does it seem like it explains a lot about what i've been feeling (and not feeling) recently. I've been feeling like I'm drifting, without purpose or direction. Her talk makes me think that maybe this is an effect of numbing myself because i'd developed the expectation that i'll be hurt when i make myself vulnerability. i feel like i simultaneously need to hug, curese, cry, yell at, and thank my coworker."

Ive been lurking here for awhile without writing an original post and I really need some advice. Or help. I thought about making a throwaway account, but I realized that making a public post might be part of owning my shit, and here we are. To begin, I am a child of narcs. My entire childhood and adolescence was subjected to the irrational will of my Nstepfather (which was backed up by NMom). When I was 8 I realized that I was depressed, and that it would best for me to hide that vulnerability as best I could. As an adult, the realization that he couldnt control me anymore led him to intentionally disrupt the relationships I had with my family. His behavior triggered a level of anger and sadness Id never allowed myself to fully tap into until I was an adult. I started drinking as a coping mechanism. Drinking was great. I could FEEL my anger and I let it f l o w. Id had to deny it for sooooo long until this point. Twelve years passed. I cant say it was all bad. There are good memories in there. But most of them involve me, drunkenly raving about something, being an asshole to everyone. I started getting my shit together two years ago. But Im still struggling with residual anger I wasnt able to process. Ive lost so many friends. Im okay with losing some of those relationships, not do I speak to NFamily, but i dont think this is healthy. Im definitely planning on attending an anger management class or therapy sessions. But how do yall deal with the fallout from reacting to having NParents and/or NFamily? "

I didn't like reading, maths or anything because they would constantly scream at me, like a legit scream to the point where I just gave up (which is my ultimate regret). Yes, I could've stood up to them but damn, to be defeated from the inside out, living becomes a chore and dreams of the future very finite. Funny that my Nmother demands i do not shout at her when she did that constantly...their hypocrisy makes it hard not to smash something into their faces. I feel ancient, always have and always will. Maybe until the age of 4 i felt young but yeah. I just wanted to write this piece out because it is something that has always bothered me. How their lack of good parenting, sigh, has made me into half of what i could have been (my half-sis experiences the same). I will try to get into a Clinical Psychologist course and if not, I guess I have to be honest with myself and my nparents. Maybe when I do become a Clinical Psychologist, I could actually help children that had/have Nparents. I do not know if there is a point to this story. All I can say is, if anyone is reading this and is still young, DO NOT GIVE UP ON YOURSELF!!! I feel that by giving up on myself at such a young age I jumped ship. It is only until recently of last year or so that I have found a ship that i can manoeuvre but the ocean's tides are unbearable. Also, do not think that by being broken that someone is going to fix you; i learnt that the REALLY hard way. They won't encourage you, teach you, or tell you ""hey, you are gonna regret doing that. Let me show you what you need to do."" Instead, for the most part you will be part of their amusement (yes, after 1 year and few months I am still heartbroken). Because of such a terrible upbringing (mentioning how others have it worse never helps but people do mention it lol) I somehow have been ""cursed"" to be surrounded by assholes all my life. Again, many people irl look at me as if I am a spoilt woman-child, spoilt yes as in like spoiled food type. Haha at least one good thing has come of it, I try to be as forcefully honest as I can (by that I mean stating my sexual desires first and foremost so that girls don't get a wrong impression of me being this or that. At least they can decline quickly, which is perfect for me and her. Second, I mean that by demanding honestly from myself, I naturally demand honesty from other people; the English suck at that). It pains me that no matter how hard i try or don't try, I end up acting a bit like a sociopath. Reason being is that I did not get taught right and wrong, so I just copy others and follow procedure. It pains me that my Nmother refused to help me via a counsellor when I was a child, stating that there is nothing wrong with me but with the rest of the children. I remember she telling me this a month ago and still, I hate her for that. Or when my Nstep-father didn't care for me but instead just bought things for himself and lied it was for me. So as you can see, a lot of lies. Honesty maybe won't get you far, but it is better than playing Macbeth or Machiavellian tactics. I feel that by being honest with myself at least has helped me move on bit by bit. The biggest shame is to realise the joy of being child-like too late and in an age where you have to act ""proper"". I look at my past like I look at babies and children; so much potential, fragility and vulnerability. Every day I want to hug that ""inner child"", let it know how much he is loved and teach it everything I can rather than giving it everything. Much like how i get that feeling of awe due to Astronomy, children evoke the same feeling. Maybe it is indeed related to energy potential or some other science-related thing. In sum, I try to use all my pains to focus, change it up when it is not working and get that little bit more motivated than the day before. Honesty is key because much like risk, it teaches you how to deal with the consequences rather than avoiding every goddamn thing. "

I stopped calling, I dont want her to see pictures of us, I dont share baby milestones or life events. I never realized how much love a parent could have for a child till I had mine.

My sisters, twins, perpetually had each other, to rely on for agreement, back up, everything. They never experienced vulnerability in the same way most people do, and it may be the confirmation bias, but I think that had an effect on their personality development. My brother, the oldest, took on a fairly bossy, controlling role - our dad was only partially in the picture (being as it was, that he was married to a different woman), and in the vacuum he left, Tom took on the male dominance of the house. He's arrogant, short-tempered and glowering. He shows a remarkable lack of sensitivity on any subject, including when our mother was dying, the type of funeral she was to have (argued with my clearly very upset aunt that it didn't matter what mum would have wanted). I have been mulling over memories I'd completely forgotten. As I know a lot of abused people do, I've been torturing myself over why my siblings think it is ok to treat me like they did, and why the adults let them get away with it. I came to the same sore point lots do: ""is it me?"" Is it something I've done, maybe I'm really that antagonistic (even though I started the practice of saying as little as possible around them), or I really am that oversensitive? If everyone else in the family is still friendly with them, and even want me to reconcile, maybe it is true? Then I remember a few bits here and there, examples of the sisters taking unusually angry, aggressive stances at a stranger cos they didn't hold the door open for them, took to long in their questions, or trying to get an airport employee fired if they made (an admittedly costly) mistake. Little things here and there. Then I remembered a pretty severe situation where my sisters, forever in their twosome, bullied a guy in a village near us for a good few nights. They encouraged other kids to get involved, mobbing him with insults and the odd kick. Part of the humiliation, I think, was that most of the kids were much smaller and younger than him. Admittedly, I was involved too. They wanted to dump some water on him, and I filled the bucket and carried it back. I'm so sorry to that guy - he was 16ish, which seemed like adult age to me at the time (I was 11ish), but it was still wrong. He still obviously was on the receiving end of a very intense spate of abuse and hounding, perhaps not started by, but definitely massively exacerbated and pursued by my sisters. Another memory came to me, of my sisters hanging around with their friends. They always made friends with really nasty girls, who they'd end up feuding with like mad soon after. But while the friendship lasted, their activities seemed to consist of hanging out at the side of the road, spitting on the ground and saying horrible things to anyone walking past. Me, being the annoying little sister, would tag along. One time sticks in my mind - they laughed like mad, with evident scorn, at a boy who tried to ride his bike up a steep hill. Shouted at him that he was sad, how any of them could cycle up the hill, pathetic etc. The boy was walking his bike up the hill with his head down, and I remember knowing exactly how he felt, humilation and burning rage, but unable to do anything as the shouts and laughter went on and on. These are the examples I can remember. I might be forgetting some, and of course the majority of the time, I was not with them. But I suppose their defense could be that this is when they were kids, and everyone has done silly things when they were younger. I don't talk to the siblings anymore. Any of them. I steadily realised, in my late teen years, and then adult life, that they were, at best, not my sort of people, and at worst, actually foul human beings who were actually harmful to be around. The guillotine for contact finally came down when one sister punched me 3 times in the face for telling her to stop asking my mother a question that was obviously distressing her (she was dying from a brain tumour), and when my brother exploded at me, telling me how much he hated me and what a c&amp;@t I was for asking him an innocuous question about leftovers. My memory may be another example of confirmation bias. Maybe they aren't complete or altered. But I can't help think this fits the pattern for the personality type I've witnessed from them. It may be just empty hope, and maybe I am a horrendously flawed, immature and self-centred person, but maybe it's not down to me, why they act like that."
312,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Sexuality after Narcissist,6,88nhnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/88nhnt/sexuality_after_narcissist/,2018-04-01 11:55:21,"Let's talk about Sex. No, but seriously, no one ever talks about this stuff and I think it's kind of ridiculous. We're all adults. I've been pretty open on here, and various other forums about my mental health and how psychiatrist medications have pretty much saved my life and my relationship. I'm also and have been in ongoing therapy for a colorful amount of other issues pertaining to long term traumas from my narcissist parents and the narcissist lovers I chose after fleeing their grasp. Without going into to much detail about my own personal sex life (I don't want to to discuss it without my partners consent out of respect), Psychiatrist meds have some unpleasant side effects. Low libido and harder to orgasm, just to name a few. Because of this, I was beating myself up about my low libido a lot, blaming my medications and thinking there wasn't much i could about it. I can't go off my medications, I NEED them, so i felt stuck and hopeless. But here lately, I've been working on being brutally honest with myself, and I have a come to jesus talk with myself and about my sexuality. No, this isn't me coming out as gay, I've always been bisexual. This isn't a new development. I've always been a rather sexual creature. Not in the terms of having sex with everybody, but very aware and curious about sex, and genitalia, and exploring sexuality fluidly, without judgement. I've been with both men and women equally, and I believe that's how sexuality should be explored. Freely and without judgement. But as I've gotten older, I've gotten more closed off, and really gotten away from the foundation i laid for myself 10-12 years ago (I'm 31 you do the math). This realization really made me take pause and try and figure out why I've changed. And this is where things got interesting. I've been traumatized, a lot, by several people. Between 21 to now, I've been hurt a lot. Some of it soul crushingly sad. Like move away to a new city level of soul crushing. I've been working through these trauma's in therapy, but what I haven't worked on and what I didn't expect is these trauma's effect on my sex life and my sexuality as a whole. Being fluid about sex and sexuality requires a level of vulnerability and trust that I have subsequently lost by being betrayed, cheated on, abandoned, and left by previous lovers. Each time someone broke my heart into a thousand fragments, I stopped trusting as much, i stopped being vulnerable. I stopped trying. This has led me the realization that I am far more closed off to my current lover than I ever realized. I would like to note, my relationship is strong and healthy and we are both very happy. But I realized, through this journey, that I am like a gear shift. Without realizing it I have been stuck in one gear for the last 4 years, and it's been great. But now I realize I'm holding back. And I'm holding back because I am afraid if I am as open, trusting, and vulnerable as I WANT to be, as I know I CAN be, that he will leave (abandonment issues are a huge issue with me that I've been working on for 2 years, this is another layer to them). So now, in addition to my regular therapist, I am seeking a Sexologist. A therapist that specializes in sexuality, and sex issues, and issues related around trust and sex. The search hasn't been fruitful yet, but I am still trying. Even writing this now, and being open with it, is a huge step for me in my vulnerability training. It's a step for me in the right direction. Don't be afraid to talk about sex. Your sex life, or sexual hangups you have. It might just be the missing piece you've been looking for in whatever you're going through."
313,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,BF has an NMom. Should I cut my losses and run?,21,8a2toq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8a2toq/bf_has_an_nmom_should_i_cut_my_losses_and_run/,2018-04-06 05:41:05,"Throwaway because he knows my account. Will try to limit details for the sake of length. Weve been together for almost a year and things are getting sort of serious. He is really great. Helpful, kind, affectionate. Overall would make a great dad and a great life partner. No real complaints about him. However... I noticed early on that there was something weird. BF said his mom is crazy and I just took that as a little wonky, not full on crazy. Over time, I noticed that she would constantly undermine everything I say. I could say my favorite color is purple and she would be furious and tell me all of the reasons who I cant possibly like purple. I found it weird because, at the risk of sounding like an elitist prick (I hope I dont!), Im a 26 yo PhD student who is obviously capable and accomplished and certainly does not need someone telling me how to make decisions or live my life. Her claim to fame is raising 3 kids as a stay at home mom with a high school education. I initially chalked it up to her being a typical protective mom and decided to ignore it. But then she started getting intrusive. Interrogating me about the financial return on my degrees, questioning why I would even do that, etc. I also noticed that his brothers wife and his mom dont get along and their grandkids never see them even though they live in the same city. The story I get is always very vague and blames the SIL, obviously completely eradicating the role Mom played in destroying the relationship. Then shit hit the fan at Xmas when she was super rude to me and I had to tell BF that I was finished with her behaviour. It wasnt anything over the top like some of the stuff I see here, but it was definitely well beyond the boundaries that I would set for literally anyone in my life including my own parents. I am simply not willing to tolerate that. He talked to his dad, who said I remind her of SiL and shes taking out anger toward her on me. He talked to her and told her it was inappropriate. I suspect she said a bunch of stuff to him about me trying to take his money (which is like... lol my parents are wealthy and I dont need his money). Afterward he more or less said to me that he didnt think it was his job to mediate the relationship between us, to which I said lol get fucked. I would never have a human like this in my life if it wasnt for you and if shes going to be my problem you better believe its going to be yours too one way or the other. Anyway, things have been going ok since then, but I cant shake the feeling that this is a bad situation to get wrapped up in. I stumbled on an article about narcissists and their children yesterday and it was striking how much it explained his lack of emotional intelligence and trouble with intimacy and vulnerability, as well as his moms ridiculous behaviour. I keep thinking about what might happen if we had kids and Im just so uncomfortable with it. Am I over reacting? Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with the child of an NMom? Tl;dr cant shake the feeling that getting more serious with the child of an NMom is a bad idea. Need perspective and advice. "
314,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I cannot eat food my nmom insists on bringing me,2,8awlml,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8awlml/i_cannot_eat_food_my_nmom_insists_on_bringing_me/,2018-04-09 17:10:44,"Going to try and keep this as short as possible. Feel free to skim through. My mother is not a terrible cook, and actually I always liked the food she made (mostly the boxed-style, ""assist"" kind of foods, with some of her flair) when I was growing up. Now that I've moved out... And it's been almost two years. They keep trying to feed me. She always asks me if I want her to make something to bring over on the once a month the visit, and generally I will say yes, because it sounds like a good idea. And I don't cook what people would call ""real meals."" However. When faced with eating it after they have left, I often can't. I don't know what the feeling is, but... I will try. And I won't get sick or anything. But the thought of actually eating it... Sucks in real life. And generally it will just sit and fester while I order something else or just make my own. So, even when they don't mention it to me or ask, they often bring food. Especially foods they aren't eating anymore (because dad is vegan and mom is cutting back on meat). Or they bring candy. I don't even like candy, but they always bring what I liked as a kid. And I don't know what is up with this. I am thin, yes, but they were my same weight at my same age. I know it can't be genuine concern. I think people definitely put emotion into food, so I have definitely considered that as a reason why (I don't want to absorb that ""negative energy"" (and yes, I know this sounds a little juju)). But... Is she trying to make some peace offering or what? It doesn't matter, I know, but I wanna know why they bring me more crap I don't want and then have to feel anxious about throwing out. I'm not a full-on minimalist or anything, but I really don't like crap hanging around I'll never use. My parents are very ""you never know when you'll need it."" AND they seem to be on some vendetta against eating out because ""you can't trust those people to make your food."" They went on a vacation to Colorado, probably a bit of a bastion to my vegan dad for places to eat out, and they just went to the grocery store and ate in their hotel room. And if that doesn't encompass narcissistic control, I'm not sure what does. But even moreso... I think sometimes them bringing over the meat makes me think, ""Okay, just some more leftovers you won't eat? I feel so special. /Sarcasm"" And secondly, the candy. I don't get it and it irritates me the most, almost. I don't like it, generally, and I've said that a lot! I don't know if this is some passive agressive tactic or what the hell is up with this. Or maybe she just misses cooking, for me or for the family unit? No clue. Only issue is... I feel guilty throwing food away. My mom was and still is very thrifty. Always made fun of me for not finishing all my meals or tried to make me eat more (and I know a lot of you will relate to this). I do it anyway. I just threw away a lot of food that couldn't be donated or anything. (I left some cans on the ""free"" table at work because I knew I wouldn't eat them in a month and they were gone in a few hours.) But. It bugs me to trash food (usually for safety or expiration dates, but in this case just because of emotion), then it feels good. Having it in my fridge makes me anxious. But getting rid of it makes me feel kind of... A release. Then eventually I go into some kind of ethics sprial. Maybe you guys can comment about what you think is up with her bringing me food, even when I don't ask, or even if it's nothing I typically eat (but don't explicitly hate). I think a lot of people here have strong feelings about food and parents combined... I wish I could actually have those meals again, but... It just isn't the same since I moved out and realized she was a narcissist. And I didn't expect that. And I don't know why. And I don't even know if I'd be willing to eat them if someone I currently like made them for me, tbh! Also, how can I make her stop bringing me this shit without revealing a vulnerability to her? Or should I just take it and throw it out like I have been? Just such a waste, though. And I'd rather avoid the anxiety anyway. Thank you for reading this. "

But often there is a vulnerability hangover, second guessing, and feeling ashamed. Again, I try and be nice to her and not continue the pressure to be perfect. Just curious if you could share how you handled being the new you as you went thru therapy, what changed in you, how did it feel, how did you handle the changes? I'm not sure I recognize myself. (In a good way, but it's still a lot of changes.) Just writing all that out kinda reminded me to be nice to myself and that I'm not such a horrible human. "

Is this narcissism: inability/unwillingness to control her reactions? For example, Nmom cannot tolerate anything she doesn't agree with. So, if someone in conversation says something she doesn't agree with, she has to shake her head, stick her nose high up in the air, start snapping ""No! No! No!"" She cannot let ANYTHING go. She also MUST interject a negative, critical, sexually or bodily function ""gross"", transgressive or other unwelcome and unpleasant comment into everything. She cannot stop herself, any and every comment or story gets capped with something nasty. She has to let every thought that passes through her brain out of her mouth. Obvious inability or unwillingness to control herself. It's almost like a Tourettes tic. Hear a comment? Open your mouth and let fly in response. See vulnerability or real emotion? Laugh and ridicule. It's almost automatic, like her breathing. It's not just speaking and mocking either, she can't seem to control her eating or drinking either (no sense of appetite or ""full"" sensation, she just inhales until she's sick). It's detestable (IMO) but I'm not sure if this is narcissism or something else. Thoughts and information are welcome. Thank you all!"

URL TLDR: Narcissism seems to be derived from a mixture of two perceptions a person has: Grandiosity and Insecurity. Grandiosity is sort of a given: entitled, self absorbed people display narc tendencies. On the other hand, severe personal insecurity creates a need for control and power, driving toward narc behaviors. The two driving factors aren't mutually exclusive and the more of either (both) that are prevalent in a person, the more Narc-like they tend to be. People with very high levels of both are almost assuredly narcissists and are likely very volatile with wild swings between the vulnerability &amp; grandiosity drivers of their personality (disorder). As an ACoN, this research makes a great deal of sense to me personally. In my experience Narcs are forever the hero-victims. They are the greatest bestest people in the world, and they get treated oh so badly by everyone else all the time, because people won't give them the pie-eyed reverence they so totally deserve. Grandiosity, cycling into insecurity, cycling into grandiosity, so on forever. Anyway, hope you enjoy the read and the food for thought."

It turns out I was rarely validated during childhood and in my teens or even as an adult and having a bipolar n mum who went from possessive and demanding to cold cruel and indifferent / hyper critical and having a dismissive and angry n dad meant I attracted narcissistic people in relationships and had no idea on red flags or boundaries as messed up behaviour was 'normal' (albeit upsetting and stressful etc). I also ended up with anxiety, social anxiety, health anxiety, OCD, depression and agoraphobia. So... While in therapy my mum would say things like ""I bet you talk about me."" ""Do you talk about me?"" ""Why do you need therapy anyway?"" And so on. When therapy was coming to an end my nmom asked again do you talk about me a lot? I said we talk about a lot. She said ""I was a good mum wasn't I? If anything I suppose I was too possessive and protective and loved you too much."" This from a woman who I have had to take pills out of her hands, who has been suicidal and acted upon it, and thrown all of her issues on to me since I was little. Who criticised me and put me down, was an abusive drunk and then used her charm and warmth and vulnerability to draw me back in over and over. A few months later when drunk she texted me and asked ""do you not spend time with me any more because your therapist said I am toxic?"" I didn't reply because my drunk mum is not very nice. She waited then wrote ""I know you read that. I love you my messed up confused child."" I was furious!! So. Any examples? "

I've spent a lot of time here sorting out the complexities of an incredibly dysfunctional family, and how I've responded to this experience. I'm 56 and have seen doctors and therapists for anxiety and blah blah complex ptsd, on and off since my teens. My siblings and I are largely estranged and the relationships are somewhat civil but rapidly plunge into outright viciousness and hostility whenever I try to set a boundary or ask for cooperation, not to mention substantive help. It's been fucking miserable but I've seriously had a spiritual awakening from endless conflict, work and isolation. I'm having a beer but I finally understand the Buddhists, so there's that. I've had at least two plans all along: an exit plan and a shelter in place plan if siblings didn't come through. Dad's affairs have not been resolved. There are unclaimed insurance benefits of perhaps over $10k, lots of money for me and dad, not so important to sibs I'm struggling to make ends meet month to month. The usual power struggles and interference. Last summer I had an opportunity to go away, and it became clear sibs wouldn't take over in a meaningful way. Dad assigned me durable powers of attorney and I had it notorized. I didn't want to have to use it or do the rest of the work to keep him comfortable and safe until he passes. Many people have told me to walk away but despite our family history, he is by now so emotionally dependent on me that it would be cruel to leave him to others' care. I don't think I could do it to a stranger with this level of vulnerability. I am eligible for full time help or compensation but have been blocked toward accessing these resources. It sounds fucking crazy because it is. I wish I had called their bluff long ago but that's not useful and I have other urgent work to do to keep the ship sailing along. I called a family meeting with brother and sister after dad had a worrisome hospital stay, the first since I've been here full time. I let my eyes off him a few days a week for about 2 months and he might have died if I didn't take him to the ER. Then sis took over the whole hospital thing. Of course. ""You stay home, you said you need some rest."" Mommy Dearest died 4.5 yrs ago and left a lot of shit to deal with as far as unpaid bills, taxes, etc. They were reluctant to meet and were agitating and making obnoxious visits and predictable demands when I said we should consult with a social worker. There are benefits for in home help and they are obstructing, and if pressed will be in serious legal trouble for fiscal negligence. They'd clearly discussed things behind my back and when I told them I had the POA they both lost. their. shit. Then came a verbal assault that lasted at least 15-20 minutes, with both of them shouting questions about my actions and intentions over dad's accounts, why I hadn't paid certain bills, why I'd been paying for a caregiver (ha ha like 9 hrs a week), etc. Was probably one of the worst aggressive psychological assaults I've experienced, and that's after enduring this fucking rage family for over 1/2 a century. But I was ready. I refused to turn over statements or documents. My brother's face turned deep, deep red as he shouted at my father ""Do you know SecretRaccoon is behind on the mortgage!!!????? Do you know SecretRaccoon blah blah blah."" It went on for as long as I expected. Pure, beautiful extinction burst. Tldr; crappy brother and sister set up caregiver for total financial failure, then try to sweep in and take control while offering no reliable assistance with dad's failing health and need for 24/7 supervision. Jesus fucking christ. Thank you rbn, because I was ready for the dirty, goddamned backstabbers to pull their final cards and show how nasty they really are. Yep, see ya in court assholes. By all means call Adult Protective Services to see if I got dad take out last night or he got another seared Ahi steak with sauteed mushrooms and fresh tomatoes, you selfish dicks. Word, gather your wits and allies, secure your documents and keep records, take care of yourself in this stupid battle, then get strong, be strong, stay strong. We got this. Boom. "

I see it in my face when I take pictures, or catch myself in the mirror-- even on nights I think I feel really confident.

I can't think of a single person who has a comprehensive idea of who I am. At the end of my group therapy program, we were supposed to go around the circle and say something encouraging to each other. Almost every fucking person said ""I don't really know you, but..."", and had lots of very personal words for other people. Tears were shed, but not when they spoke to me. I spent almost 6 years at my last job, by the end of which I felt people were glad to see me go. They had seen my worst and forgotten my best. Respect was low, I know I wasn't seen as intelligent-- I'd really been discarded (an Ncoworker played a big role in that, and I did not handle it well at the time). And the worst I think came to light in my last relationship. By far the healthiest I'd had. My ex admitted he was so afraid of ""breaking"" me and wished I was more confident in myself. At that point, I had just escaped the most toxic living environment I'd ever been in, and felt very accomplished. I am tired of people acting surprised (or annoyed) when I say something intelligent or deep. I am tired of people dismissing me because of the way I look, or speaking to me like I'm younger than I am, or stupid. I am tired of women giving me uncomfortable glances when I tell them something personal. Or women who think I'm an easy target, or men who think I am either insecure or easy, people who don't count me as a peer and think they can or need to handle me differently. I was raised in a horrifically abusive environment and every ""drastic"" thing I did was an attempt to get away from situations they could not fathom being in. I've been through 12 years of therapy, and I'm still working on it. I am just so sick of trying to convince people that I too am a human adult, on top of all the other shit I am compensating for.

During our ""conversation"" (him yelling like a madman)...I smell the beer on his breath and realizing he is sorta not in control of his temper (understatement). He keeps pushing this behavior further clenching his fist, seeing what sort of fear he can provoke. *My Mom can't call 911 because she has Alz and doesn't know how to use a phone anymore.* But she was visibly scared and upset by his behavior.

It is like manipulative, abusive people were attracted to my vulnerability at the time I was the weakest (eg until I left home at 19). Now, I am weeding out some very old friendships that, after all, have never been good for me. A lot of these are going down the drain anyway because these people are used to using me and I am a lot more resilient now and stand up for myself. I hope this is a good thing but it makes me feel shitty sometimes losing people. One friend is very emotionally manipulative. She uses her emotions against others by being constantly hurt for things she is probably to blame for (eg she slept with her friend's boyfriend and then got mad at her friend for being upset with her! um fair enough right? or once she called me crying because she went into someones fridge and ate their mum's chocolates and they asked her not to and SHE FELT VICTIMISED). Last year she was coming to visit me interstate but canceled last minute because she couldn't be bothered paying for the $40 flight and went partying all weekend instead. I was hurt as I had taken the week off a heavy work and study schedule so I just asked her to be more transparent in future as I plan ahead at which she totally flipped out at me and told me I didn't deserve friends- amongst many other lengthy messages telling me what a shit person I am. I stopped talking to her after this after being friends since we were babies. I was so done after years and years of her acting like this. The great thing was, once I cut her out, it was like all these really beautiful friendships came into my life where I feel happy and respected. Anyway, last night, after 10 months, she apologized and asked if we could have a chat. So, here is the issue. I don't want to talk to her. I really don't. As an adult free of a relationship with an abusive nmum, I am very firm on drawing lines with behavior that belittles and demeans me. But I know this friend isnt my mum but I am having trouble determining if her behavior is narcissistic or not and, to be honest, I have never received an apology from anyone before so I don't know how to react. But I feel like she is just lonely and wants my company back but I doubt her behaviour has changed as she has always treated all her friends and family terribly. Should I be forgiving? If I just say, no, I dont want anything to do with you, am I just punishing my friends for the damage my mum did? I dont want her in my life, I dont trust her. "

But I worry about also just being biologically ""screwed up"" as genetics for mental illness tend to run in families, too (and it's not disorder specific, btw, according to the latest research). So sometimes I feel like I can't just blame these things all on my past--like I'm some totally normal person who was subjected to emotional abuse in childhood--and it makes me think/worry that there are just things inherently ""wrong"" with me baked into my brain, if that makes sense? I want to get better but I feel so screwed up. Can anyone else relate to any of this and is there any hope?"

I always knew there were things wrong with my parents and did put 2 and 2 together in realizing it might have something to do with their childhood experiences/early trauma but it was fairly late in the game that I understood that this was PD. Getting into a destructive relationship with a guy who was diagnosed with a cluster-b personality disorder led me to look back and figure out where this vulnerability originally came from and that's a large part of putting it all together...what about everyone else?
330,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Had been doing fairly well in life until this all exploded over the past few years and now I'm so worried/anyone else had a similar experience/any advice?/tell me I'll be OK?,4,7vhkin,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7vhkin/had_been_doing_fairly_well_in_life_until_this_all/,2018-02-06 07:12:19,"I always knew I was screwed up from my childhood/upbringing, but until fairly recently (past few years), I thought I was going to be able to rise above it all and come out OK. I managed to graduate from college and even get an advanced degree (all mental health related, of course, as I spend a large % of my waking hours trying to sort out the adverse impacts all of my early family life has had on me and how to ""undo"" it so I can try to live a healthy life/get past it all...). Well, after getting my advanced degree, I started a new job about 5 years ago, and it was a really exciting/impressive job and I felt like I was really on the path to success. Unfortunately, as soon as I started this job, I got into an abusive relationship with a man who was diagnosed with a Cluster-B personality disorder. I have been out of that relationship for over a year now but the damage to myself, my life, my career has been unfathomable and I am so worried about what will happen and if there is any hope at all to get back on track. I started completely failing in my job, immediately upon starting it, related to that relationship, my bosses were really confused. Then, a mentor seemed like she could ""save"" me and took me under her wing as my new primary supervisor at this same job, which at first seemed like it would help me recover from the initial struggles at work. Unfortunately, it turned out that SHE has NPD, too, and what at first seemed like a really helpful mentor/helping hand has turned into even more quicksand. I think this may be a common thing, unfortunately, that someone who has experienced/is experiencing N abuse looks for a ""rescuer"" but then the rescuer ends up being an N/cluster B as well and things just end up worse in some ways. So, now, here I am with this N mentor, my career is hanging by a thread and I feel like I am about to drown. I keep trying to get myself to a new place/job, etc. but because my work track record here is so bad and pathetic-looking, I feel stuck. I feel like I can't leave here and get myself to a better place because of how much one can see that I have failed here over the past five years (so why would anyone else take me/invest in me) but the longer I stay here, the farther behind I keep falling. Finally, as a last-ditch attempt, I told my two senior bosses that I had been in abusive relationship when I started this job and they seemed kind of sympathetic/like this all makes some sense as to why I had been so successful before starting my current job (the one I've had these past 5 years) but then started failing once I started this job. I am hoping that their sympathy is enough that they can help me find some kind of stepping stones to get to where I want to go because, as I mentioned, I feel a giant lack of confidence and hope about being able to do so the normal way since my track record is so awful-seeming over the past 5 years. I used to be so hardworking and successful and I used to enjoy applying to new positions, networking, planning out the future. It is really discouraging to be drowning and struggling to get myself above water/swimming again but then I just keep seeming to find myself drowning all over again. I suppose some good news is that I am out of that abusive romantic relationship entirely so I am feeling a little more functional now than I had been previously...but I feel all of this shame, humiliation, lack of confidence now because of how I have been at work these past years as a result of all of this. Has anything like this happened to anyone else where you thought you were overcoming childhood in an N family and then it later came back to haunt you and catch up with you? My vulnerability to being in that abusive relationship and then vulnerability to seeking ""saving"" from an N mentor seem related to this... I am trying to forgive myself for all of this failure by telling myself that it's just my N family childhood finally catching up with me and I am recovering from trauma from that as well as this recent abusive N relationship. But I feel SO bad about myself and so worried about if there is any way to recover from this and get back on my feet. Otherwise, I think I will have to just drop out of this career and find a completely new one/start all over again? Which would be really sad to me given that I've been working so hard on this career for like 15 years/however you want to count it... Meanwhile, it's really hard to be functional in the rest of my life (e.g., trying to find a life partner, being a good friend, just generally being happy/healthy in life, etc.) given how anxious/insecure/ashamed/feeling like I am drowning I am in my career constantly.... Anyone can relate/have thoughts/advice/encouragement, etc.?"

I can't find any other place. I believe I have been gaslit, and I'd like some feedback and maybe to pm someone if that's ok. Over seven months ago now I made the choice to live nomadically. Being autistic, I'm pretty eccentric. So I've spent a while moving from town to town, camping, hostelling, writing, philosophizing etc. A couple of months ago, I had a short romance with a Canadian guy. It ended just before Christmas in the form of me being ghosted. I felt devestated, lonely, rejected, and definitely my vulnerability was way up. During this time I went to spent Christmas and New Year at a Buddhist retreat. I arrived carrying deep heavy feelings underneath but I was still full of confidence and social energy. I got into some conversations with an ex Buddhist monk, about ten years older than myself. I really enjoyed the conversations but during one I noticed pain in my gut and I wasn't sure why. Then I soon noticed that he'd taken to referring to me as poor and homeless in front of other people. I was quite upset about this. I'd chosen my gypsy lifestyle and enjoyed it. I didn't see myself as either of these. Finally by the last day I got quite mad and completely avoided him. I left with a sense of very heavy depression and I think it wasn't just the recent breakup, it was that this ex-monk had gotten into my head. The strange thing was that after leaving the monastery I began to think of myself as poor, homeless, depressed. My self esteem took a complete dive. This wasn't helped by the fact that a few days later I was put on disability for chronic fatigue. I had a very rocky few weeks coming to terms with that and also suddenly feeling like a burden and unwanted because I was 'homeless'. I recognized finally that he'd gotten into my head but I couldn't seem to get my confidence back. I'd slunk into depression and my health was failing. In addition, I had another planned trip to the monastery and didn't want to lose out just because of him. I resolved to be more assertive though. When I got there, I was instantly drawn into conversation with him again (unfortunately I found him quite attractive) and thought...how bad can it be. He waited til the second day to spring the poor and homeless thing on me again. It took me two attempts to silence him. A couple of days later he began again. This time I became incredibly upset and close to suicidal. The next day I pulled him out on it. He said he'd work on his conduct then a few minutes later shot me down again but in a different way. Each time I'd stand up for myself he'd always laugh first. The entire week I spent with him I could not meditate for even two seconds. There was so much cortisol pumping through my body that my attention span didn't even exist. When he left I felt instant calm, but must have been still on edge. A conversation the next day triggered me into becoming actually sucidial for a few seconds, something that hasn't hasn't happened in over two years. So I must have been left prety fragile. I left the monastery and felt my reality collapse. I felt like I had gone crazy, didn't know who I was anymore, like I'd lost touch with reality. I had an imminent fear that someone would cart me of to a mental hospital and also a belief that no one from the mainstream could ever respect me. This is my third time being seriously gaslit. The first time was the worst as it resulted in a complete breakdown. The second time led to me spiraling into depression and being kicked out of my flat. I am more vulnerable due to autism. I am wanting to know how can I recover from this and get my confidence back. The first two times I moved home but I'm a bit old for that now. I think that this guy was so potent because on the surface we had a lot in common, so he worked his way in from that. I also found myself in a position of not being able to resist his charisma. I'd been in a vulnerable state when meeting him and very open as I thought he was trustworthy having been an ex-monk. But I realise he has serious problems. He said that in the outside world all he can really do is feed himself. He thinks he might end up on the street. So essentially he was thinking of becoming a monk again out of desperation. I am an empath and I soaked up all the desperation he projected onto me. , "

Face always buried in her phone, far dissociated from reality, her life revolves around the he-said she-said of Facebook. Frankly, it is her last semblance of knowing what is going on in my life, so she seems to get her kicks out of going through my posts with a fine tooth comb. This woman loves to piece together my life like it is her job, then posts the infamous memes revolving around ""the FBI has nothing on the investigation skills of a worried mother"". She will friend mild acquaintances who *like* my posts more than once in hopes that they might be my love interest. She's done that to dozens of people she has never met. She uses social media to garner access into my life that she doesn't get otherwise. Fortunately for me, my SO has no social media, and I've gotten smarter in who i allow into my account any more. I spend a ton of time fearing that somebody I have on Snapchat will blurt the wrong thing to my mother, and suddenly my whole bubble will be burst. I blocked her once, and shit hit the fan. She also found out I was hiding posts from her when she logged into other accounts... cue yet another mental breakdown from her. Nmom opened up an Instagram account. I had nothing incriminating on there. Really, it was nothing but a fitness account marking my progress and regress over the years, but it was still something that opened me up to vulnerability and i didnt want her to see that. She had used it against me when she caught me with a belly button ring that a friend had paid for at 19 (I was super fit! Hell yeah I was going to show that off!) I was chastised for weeks about being tight on money and such... lesson learned. About a month ago, she opened an account. For some reason, I had an easier time showing my fitness progress to strangers on Instagram than I did my mother, and had a public account myself. The second she followed me, I blocked her and immediately told her I closed my account. She went with it. I logged out and deleted the app and haven't been on since. Today, I received a screenshot of a meme I had sent her, stating ""you can't choose your family but you can block them"" along with a screenshot of my Instagram account since she'd opened yet another new account. I had sent her that when she was obsessing over the political differences of our family. Today, it was sent with a text saying ""thanks for the reminder"". I no longer have any boundaries. My life is on severe lockdown. Every happy aspect of it is being guarded from my nmom. Boyfriend, friends, career status, future plans. Today, the minute I got that text, I called around to several therapists specializing in anxiety, ptsd, and familial relations. Today, I found out that my first 20 visits are covered by insurance. I made an appointment for myself for my birthday present next week. I am so done. I am an adult. I deserve a spine. I deserve boundaries. However, until I leave at the end of this year, I have no experience weaning off contact while still living in her house. Any advice on how to establish boundaries within the home without subjecting yourself to retaliation? I feel as though slowly shutting down social media is the only way to go, but then I feel like any control I have on the situation is gone as well. Tl;dr: in need of weaning contact following yet another social media riff"

Heres a summary of what has happened for me so far. I was fired from one pool company for a misunderstanding of company policy back in April. My Nparents use this moment of vulnerability to proselytize to me. They cut off financial support two months ago. I was able to get a job at UPS as a package handler. I wasnt getting the hours I needed and I had to deal with a full time supervisor who bullied everyone and set her sights on me because I was new. I quit the job before she could try to fire me. I got another job shortly after with another pool company. I thought I was going to be okay. I had the job for four months. I would still be there if I got my certification but my boss wasnt clear on the details of getting it. When he let me go, I asked him if he would give me my job back if I were to get the certification which he said was possible. I go and take the class, pass it, and get the certification. I go back to tell him the good news and ask for my job back. He didnt say no but the whole conversation summed up to him saying that business is slow for him. I have come to the understanding that I was laid off. When I told my Nparents that I lost my job, Nmom groaned and said, What did you do now? During that time when I thought I was fired, she blamed me for not getting the certification even though my boss wasnt clear on when I should get it. Three days after I was let go, I decide to start my own business because I was fed up with being bullied and losing my job over BS or things that wasnt my fault. Since I had the experience and predicting that I would get my certification, I decide to start my own pool cleaning business. When I told my Nparents about it, they were quicker to try to scare me out of it than support me. I already have my first customer who very much appreciates my work. He also practiced business law, so he gave me some good advice on how to start and protect my business. I already have a name for the business and Im even creating a Viking theme for it to help it stand out from the other pool companies. I got a call from Nmom tonight to basically pull a Mother Gothel on me. She again was trying to scare me out of starting and building my business by telling me how Im risking being sued. She was shitting on my idea of doing Uber full/part time to make ends meet by telling me that Im putting too many mile on my car by driving for Uber as well as driving to clean my clients pool. I told her that when I will save up for a work van once business picks up. I need to get all of my government/legal paperwork done first before advertising my business. I already got my EIN and paperwork proving that I am the sole owner of my business. I am meeting with the Chamber of Commerce tomorrow morning to know what my next steps are. She topped off her whole charade by saying something like, Mommy just doesnt want to see her boy get hurt. I want you to have a good career. I rolled my eyes at her first sentence and told her Isnt that why Im starting a business? To have a good career? She told me to get a job even though my business is a job and I have started looking for one today. I picked up a job application from one pool service today before driving to my clients house. If she really loved me, she would have helped me in getting my business started or at least given me emotional support and telling me what I would need to do to stay out of legal trouble. Thats what my friends have done for me. My friends have been more helpful and supportive in my journey to build up my business. People at my church including my pastor have given me more support than my Nparents have. I didnt know I needed an EIN until my client and a friend I know from a BDSM bondage group told me about it and how to obtain one. Im receiving so much positive energy from my friends more than I am from my Nparents. And yet, my Nparents wonder why I dont want to have a relationship with them. It doesnt matter how much I explain myself on why, they wont change or admit they have done or said anything wrong. And what is so frustrating and even maddening is how much trouble I have explaining this kind of emotional abuse to others. If you take the Nparents emotional abuse at face value, it seems harmless. I dont have any physical wounds but I still hurt. I hurt, but I cant explain what the wounds are. I want to start a business so I can finally have the means to make enough money to never need my Nparents money again. Its not like I can easily get financial support from them anyway. I also want to make enough money to give back to my church and bring Norse culture to the mainstream. If my business gets to a point where I can run it on autopilot, I want to start another business, except I want to build and open an authentic mead hall. I might even open a Viking themed water park since I already have experience with maintaining pools. I want to be able to grow them all to where I can run them on autopilot so I can start directing and producing my own movies. Theres A LOT I want to do with my life."

Tactics change, ceasefires happen, flare-ups renew hostilities. You still never move forward. The happiness youre fighting to protect dies, and the memories of your own life become like beloved friends who will never return home when it ends. They are lost to us. Past a certain point, the war is sickening. What an affront and atrocity to the human soul. The well-intentioned arrive as sympathetic columnists from afar, to express their kind sympathies and leave before it destroys them. The malevolent involve themselves directly. The only solution to save anything worth keeping at all is to lay down arms against yourself, without guarantees. Any violence to any part of yourself, is violence to all of yourself. You cannot excise a part of yourself and remain whole, no matter how much it hurts. Thats why loving yourself is so fucking hard  its surrender, to someone whos entire life has been war.

Here is the extended bonus, abandoning the world of metaphor. Respect the original OPs privacy, please. Its not your fight. &gt; **Q:** /rant Ive been going through some existencial phase again, somehow. I thought I was done with that, with finding who I am, how to be in life and what I want, and now I feel like Im back in a similar phase, questioning everything. &gt; A little background: Im 33, single. Working and studying. Live alone. Have a dog. &gt; I have friends I see when I want too, Im very social, used to be more. I feel much more mature and better with myself, its like I finally reached what I wanted: peace of mind, being okay alone and with myself. Then it starts a new serie of questioning. &gt; For the last two years I lost interest in partying or going to bars. I meet my friends in all sorts of contexts, but very often I also decline invitations. Until my thirties I was very social and hooked up a lot, had a bunch of relationships but was never ready to commit for too long (max was 2 years) due to borderline instability and other things. Now my body starts to change. My face is changing, which is obviously normal. The opposite sex is not anymore so interested in me as before. I dont hook up anymore so much. I dont even know if its because I just started to be less attractive, or because Im 30+, or just boring to be with, since I exchanged partying for coziness. Mostly, the physical change is affecting me. Like probably most people do, I always never felt pretty or anything, but I was good at ignoring that because I always had people into me, but now its starting to be in my head how unattractive I am. I dont think I will age well. Im trying through this crisis to figure out what I should value, how to live my life alone (even if I dont, I want to know this), how to dont drive myself crazy about my body and face changing and aging. Its been too much on my mind. Not even as a teenager I had to deal with this, why now. Its affecting my self confidence and that was always my most attractive trait. I dont know how to deal with this thoughts anymore. **A:** 37/m here for context. If you have unresolved shit from growing up, there is a good chance it has impacted your ability to attach in the long-term. You can fill your life with casual friends and fun activities, but in your heart if you want someone who truly loves you? Youd be putting wallpaper over a literal (actually figurative) crater in your entire being. You are not going to compensate with better distractions. A diminished sense of self is typical if youve been damaged  you never know yourself. So is lowered self-esteem. So is distrust and feeling like you cant expose your internal world, and you have to go online to spill where you have control. So is a prolonged existential crisis since your teens, where we first consciously separate our identities (or dont). So is looking for validation from other people, often sexually, as you cant validate yourself. So are short relationships because you cant hide yourself forever, and your intimate partners either dont give you what you need to be whole or simply reenact the same traumas. What keeps you trapped in this emotional purgatory is a habit of minimizing or distracting from how bad youre actually hurting. The only escape is radical honesty thats so painful you cant know if youll survive it. The above isnt a statement on you, of course. The above is a statement on me. One of my best friends was divorced by his wife and killed himself a little more than a year ago (well come back to that). For myself, I struggled most of my life growing up to keep ties to my fucked-up family. Only three nights ago, I was living at my parents house, not for finances (I have plenty) but as a flimsy fake shelter from a depression that hurt so much I couldnt even admit it. Time distorts. I was there for a week that somehow became four months. Every good maintenance action and sensible advice would grind against my desire to just not feel. I spent my days and nights shooting myself full of dopamine, using electronics as the tool. I dont give a fuck about reddit memes, games, porn. I might as well have been shooting heroin. Its not like I was very different inside, was I? Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking big television, choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers. Choose good health, low cholesterol, and dental insurance. Choose fixed interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. Choose leisurewear and matching luggage. Choose a three-piece suit on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourselves. Choose your future. Choose life... But why would I want to do a thing like that? Life is not about choosing. Life is about being. If you cant be yourself, all choices are pointless. All of them. When I finally had my catharsis, it was bad. I have cried three times in my life. Once when I was maybe 10 and felt in my heart I wasnt loved, and stopped trusting my parents. Once when I was 27 and my illusion of regenerative love ended, after I couldnt salvage my abusive girlfriends uncontrollable personality. And now at 37, when I have finally realized that the stubbornness, pride and self-denial that stopped me from killing myself also cost me everything I ever wanted, which is someone who could have cared about me. I wanted anything but this. How completely alone Ive been. How untrue and unfair Id been to myself. How could everything I wanted as a young man come to this? No close friends, no true lovers, so many failures of my own courage, hating people who saw my vulnerability and pitied me, everything sacrificed to people who used me, and I thought destroying myself was love. And finally, realizing that broke the shackle on my soul. I was gone in about 3 hours with everything I own. My parents were out, and came home halfway through the evening to me packing, which must have seemed to be mania. What happened next was like watching from outside myself. Every dysfunctional pattern played out as if I was a child, to the letter. I finally defended myself, I finally didnt let their dysfunctions devour me, I finally didnt care what it cost me. And it has. When relationships built on lies shatter against truth, they cannot come back. Im writing you from a hotel room with everything I own. My sister has her own pain to bury, who I loved so much and wanted to protect from our parents as a child. She isnt independent enough to be secure without their financial support, so that relationship is gone too. Every physical token of affection and loyalty that could provide a reason to return to home  Ill hold onto this in case you want it  is gone. Everything in the life Id tried to make is gone, forever. But my brother understood. Something survived. Heres what I would have said about myself four nights ago: Im fine. And everyone would have understood, in the way we all do. You should run more. Eat healthy. Spend time with friends. You know how much that would have helped. Our society is built so trains run on time. And my friend, who chose non-existence and lost out on any possibility of future happiness? His story has ended, and the trains run on time. He did his part. Theres no need to answer me, the internet stranger who cant know you at all. But if this sounds plausible or sounds familiar, you need to answer you. If you are unhappy, stop the whole fucking train and let the world go to hell. You might be surprised how many people want to do the same. Youre the one who matters in your life."

Dad become completely self-absorbed and immediately jumped into a relationship with a seriously effed up woman (sociopathy, borderline personality, etc.). Dad's vulnerability and selfishness combined with GF's manipulation have made them an astoundingly toxic pair. For the past year they have been harassing and emotionally abusing my sister and I (fortunately, we are both adults). In September they told my sister and I that because we were so terrible, they didn't want contact anymore. My sister was sad, I was relieved that they pulled the trigger first. But it didn't last long. On Monday (at Christmastime - how lovely) dad called each of us separately to demand that we start 'paying him back' for all of the financial support he has given us through our lives (college, home and car repairs, etc.) He also demanded that we give him back all of the valuable family heirlooms we have in our own homes. Luckily, we each had the strength to tell him to fuck off and have decided that we are both completely done - WE will now institute NC and stick to it. My sister and I are just so disgusted. This is the breaking point - he has escalated our issues from a conflict over emotions to a conflict over property. He has clearly shown that he doesn't want a relationship with us anymore, but he DOES still want our money and valuables. He and GF are clearly fishing for money and it's despicable. I'm going NC partly to relieve and protect myself but also to try and hide. I'm scared he and his crazy GF might start trying to break into our homes or sue us. I hope I'm wrong. But I'm not putting up with this BS anymore."
337,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Sharing What I learned: Our Values &amp; Metrics,10,7ln9i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7ln9i1/sharing_what_i_learned_our_values_metrics/,2017-12-23 17:55:00,"Hello RBN, I wanted to share something I learned recently, that might help you all too. For the longest time I've never felt 'good enough', and I was not sure what the hell my friends even meant by 'love yourself'. We've never learned that. I felt like a blind person lost in a labyrinth. After going NC, I still felt very much dichotomous; there was my self, and then there was this other not a personality but what I would call a ""pattern driver."" Some of my values weren't my values and they never felt right, but I was not brave enough to confront or question them. A lot of the values we learned as a child, at least in my experience, had a lot to do with placing your self worth on: (1)external events, or (2)unrealistic positive expectations For instance, the value of ""Material Success"" and the metric of, ""How much money I can churn out, just look at how competent I am guys, I can even cut off my aspirations and feelings!"" Other examples of bad unhealthy values are: being the center of attention, dominance through manipulation, being liked by everybody, pleasure or having a lot of sex, staying positive all the damn time. Ever noticed also that when you tell yourself something like, ""If only I were beautiful enough"" it just makes you feel like utter shit? And it honestly cancels out the reality that you ARE beautiful enough. This entire society revolves around the 'extraordinary', 'you have to be more and do more!' and ofcourse, ""and yes, you CAN be extraordinary if you buy all this shit we're selling you for the amazing price of $999999999.99' etc &gt;Its what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as the backwards law the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place. The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make. The more you desperately want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance. The more you desperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you. The more you want to be spiritually enlightened, the more self-centered and shallow you become in trying to get there. And for those that are curious, this is what Alan Watts said about 'the backwards law' in his book 'The Wisdom of Insecurity' : &gt;""I have always been fascinated by the law of reversed effort. Sometimes I call it 'the backwards law'. When you try to stay on the surface of the water you sink; but when you try to sink, you float ... insecurity is the result of trying to be secure..."" Funny enough, I've read this book 4 years ago and could not understand the backwards law in an experiential sense, I do now. THIS is why some of us may have never felt 'good enough'. All these standards and ideals are reliant on external events. And what happens when your feeling good about yourself is reliant on that? It never ends up pretty. I mean, you can't exactly force someone or everyone to like you etc. Good and healthy values are achieved internally, something like honesty, creativity, and self respect. So for example, for me one of my values is good relations with my friends or rather, cultivating a family-like/familial presence; a multitude of values are involved here such as honesty, mutual respect, vulnerability, and compassion in my interactions with them. And this could be further branched off into sub branches such as ""the ability to give and receive no"" .. Previously one of my value was ""closeness"" and I used to go by the metric ""frequency of contact and whether they initiate as much as I do"". But, thinking about it, I'm not necessarily happy in the instances whereby I did get very high daily contact from others, it's not about quantity but quality. I will never feel good about myself that way, because doing so would be relying on external events that are not in my control. So a healthier metric now is: awareness and cultivation of the mutual trust, compassion, and respect in my friends, as well as experience a trusting, compassionate, and self-respectful presence in myself. We gotta nurture ourselves as adults, it's not our fault that we were born in a shitty family, but it is our responsibility to uproot all that shit and replace them with healthy values. : ) What are some of your values? And can you see if they're good or bad for you? After all, we base our actions on these very same values. "

I have always been the mad, and ill one. The bad one because of that, the metaphorical lamb to the slaughter. My sister though I cannot tell where her place is I would say SG, but also not its not black and white mix of both. I know shes always been the sane and healthy one, the one who would be capable unlike me. I had chronic fatigue syndrome as a child and at 16 my parents went to a private psychiatrist to give me an ASD diagnosis both were used to control me, with a surprising lack of sympathy towards the disorders. With the chronic fatigue syndrome my wheelchair use was severely rationed. I had to walk and run and I had to be on proper behaviour so not to look bad. It was expected of me to maintain a level of normality to be no different, while my parents weirdly told me I am weaker, and less capable than other people. Where the schools told me this and my aunt a real fucking narcissist loved to see me, like the rest of my wider family as a weak child who, wasnt too smart or strong or was entirely untalented unlike her own children. The one who was a monster and perverted because I disclosed non-contact sexual abuse, I couldnt be believed by Mum because I am clearly just a mentally ill person. Yet still I dont know if I was really abused, if I was hit or pushed there were rarely bruises or marks, and It was my fault if there were because I caused it because I had a meltdown, when they spend their entire lives communicating in way which is just so mind-fucking it makes you want to die. Jokes on them though, everyone else has failed around me, my FLEAS is this arrogance and denial of my own vulnerability. Unlike them, I am not weak I spend my life helping people. "

The first night I spent there I was hooked on an IV and given powerful meds. It might've been the meds or the vulnerability of the moment but I decided to email my Nmom (with whom I'm VLC) and let her know how sick and sad I was. I waited for her response email which arrived an entire day later. In it she said: ""I'm so sorry, Bogizley! I hope you feel better soon."" That was all. I felt like such an idiot for sending her a long, sad email and she responded like you would to a neighbour you barely know. Three days later I was still at the hospital and feeling sad. The surgery still wasn't scheduled so (like a stupid, moronic idiot) I emailed my mom updating her on my condition, even though she hadn't asked for an update. She never responded. The day of my surgery she emails my hubby to demand information about me. She couldn't understand why she hadn't heard from me after that last email. Hubby ignores the message and then she emails again saying ""so why is she in the hospital and what is she getting surgery for?"" Hubby was furious that she would be so self-absorbed. I clearly stated in the two emails that the problem was my gallbladder and all the symptoms I had had. I even described the procedure to her! I am now out of the hospital and recovering at home. Hubby gets yet another email from her where she says she wants to email our family as well as the extended family sharing details about my surgery and time in the hospital. She wanted to ask for prayers but the truth is she wants attention. She wants to control the information, share it with others so as to implicitly show others that she knows more than the rest, and of course center the whole thing around her and her suffering as the mother who stands by her daughter dutifully. Hubby responded and said firmly that this was not information people needed to know. Nmom was really disappointed and upset that I didn't want her to send out an email. Standing my ground was an incredibly difficult thing to do. Even if it's through hubby I usually end up caving to her demands, but this time I was so upset that I didn't. I'm very proud of myself and the way hubby stood by me! I hope I don't make the same mistake in the future by sharing information about myself. She is not capable of seeing through my perspective. All she sees are spotlight opportunities."

I'm not talking about being transgender- although I know there are some transgender people on here so I want to say that I do hope things get better for y'all because life as a transgender person and having an nparent can be hell- I'm talking about when you were a kid, even if you identified as the gender you were born as, you wished to be the other gender just to please your NParent? I've been out of my NDad's and NStep-Mom's house for a couple weeks now and VLC with my dad, virtually NC with Step-Mom. I'm starting to come to the realization that my NDad may be a misogynist. He expected me to act a certain way because I was a girl. When I was a little kid he didn't really stop me from doing anything just because it wasn't ""girly"", he let me go fishing and play with boy's toys and all that. But I remember he didn't really seem like he wanted anything to do with me. As though he just wanted to avoid me. I don't really know that was all about but I remember because I was so tomboyish I secretly really wanted to be a boy. I thought girls sucked and were stupid and never wanted to do anything fun. And I was completely aware that I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; one, so I hated myself. I constantly made fun of ""girly girls"" and mockingly pretended to be a ""girly girl"" sometimes to show my disdain for them. I also thought that society would look down on me because I wasn't the pretty little girl obsessed with princesses and dresses, and that I'd much rather go hunting and fishing. This was around the ages 6 - 10. Around 11 to 15 I tried to ""embrace"" being a woman but I still was a tomboy, I just remember telling myself ""I can be a tomboyish girl, I can be a tomboyish girl, it's okay to be a tomboy"". Also around this time I of course matured a bit and I didn't make fun of feminine girls or femininity in general. I became friends with girls that I would have made fun of a few years previous. It just wasn't what I liked, but I had nothing against girls that liked feminine things and all that. But my dad had a very... strange reaction to this. If I ever told my dad that I would describe myself as a tomboy, he would reply ""No, you're not a tomboy."" I remember I described myself on a website as ""I'm a girl, but I'm more masculine than other girls"" or something like that, he somehow found the website and my account and was able to edit it (I stupidly left it on the computer, I quickly learned to never do that again) just to get rid of that and called me just to tell me that I &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt; masculine. At this point I'm wondering, why the fuck are you going this length just to prove that I'm not a tomboy? Can't you just let me be me? Yes, I understand tomboy is a label. But I LIKE to be called a tomboy. I don't understand why he had to be against it. Especially since it's total bullshit. He KNOWS I am not feminine, at all. He watched me obsess over fishing and hunting and play with boys toys and wear boys clothing and play outside not afraid to get dirty, he knows damn well that I was a tomboy. He just wanted to be stubborn for whatever reason. No, actually, I know the reason. It wasn't a matter of whether or not I was a tomboy, in his house I &lt;i&gt;couldn't&lt;/i&gt; be a tomboy. Now I was at my mom's house that day he called. The next day I went over to his house. He was standing there waiting to talk to me when I walked in. He told me, in a very snarky, sarcastic, passive aggressive tone: ""We're soooo sorry that we thought you were a girl this whole time, WabashLynx. We understand that you're really a boy now. We'll go and get your hair cut short and get your flannel shirt and you can go outside and cut logs, just like a boy would."" What the actual fuck? I said NOTHING about being transgender! Also, vomit at the blatant transphobia. I wanted to fucking strangle him. Instead I went out and got logs for the fire while he mocked me and transgender people the whole fucking time. ""Huh? can't pick up that log? I thought you were a strong tomboy, huh? Don't be such a sissy."" In a sarcastic tone. Then he had me sit down in the living room. He explained that he wanted to teach a lesson to me for ""disrespecting him"". He said he wanted to look out for me because I could be called a d*ke or a bu*ch if I kept calling myself a tomboy. Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself a million times. You DON'T just fucking drag your daughter outside to make her work while degrading her with sexist and transphobic remarks and then drag her back in and say it was done in love. From 15 - 17 I believed I was transgender. I had thought that I really WAS a boy, because why else would I be having all this shit thrown at me just for the genitals I was born with? Why CAN'T I just be a feminine girl? Why don't I feel like I'm feminine? Why do I feel bad for being a woman? Well, I concluded that I must be a transman because I fucking hated everything that there was to being a woman. I don't know why I was so stupid to look past the fact that all the sexist shit my dad told me could have had an affect on me, and my n-stepmom wasn't better either, she always said ""Oh, I hang out with guys more than girls, it's okay,"" but when I do it she ridiculed me for it? She also tried to put bullshit in my head that I had to act a certain way because I'm the ""fairer sex"". A few months ago I realized that I'm not transgender because I don't feel like I'm at odds with my body. Do I still hate being a woman? Yes. But that's part of the reason I got away from my dad. I didn't need his toxic influence to tell me that I'm a terrible person just because I'm not following what's stereotypically expected of my gender. I realized that I subconsciously wanted to be a boy because it might, it just might, finally please my dad. I truly believe that he wanted a son. If he loved having a daughter he would have told her everyday that I could be a strong woman no matter what and how beautiful I was just like every father says to his daughter but instead he had to mock me for everything I did. But honestly I also know now that if I was a boy, then it wouldn't be any different. He would constantly be pushing me to be a strong, masculine man. He would have ridiculed me for liking anything that wasn't for boys, for showing any vulnerability or tears, anything. No matter what genitals I was born with it would of sucked. He believes that i won't make it one day on my own. I need a man to guide me. He probably thinks that once I have a husband I'll ""snap back to reality"" or whatever he thinks and I'll be feminine. He's fucking delusional. To this day I'm not very feminine. And that's okay. I'm trying to love and accept the fact that I'm a woman but it's hard. I'm just wondering if anybody else had a similar experience, whether you tried to be the other gender to please your nparent or maybe you were a tomboy or effeminate man and your parents couldn't stand it. I've actually found posts here about parents mocking their girls for being feminine, which is odd to me. If you're one of those girls that got mocked for being feminine, forget your parents, you go be the most feminine woman they've ever seen."
341,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,The Other Side,8,7dk4mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7dk4mn/the_other_side/,2017-11-17 21:55:37,"ok, long one here. Understanding Bullying. We were the first ethnic kids at school back in 1983, and my two sisters endured horrific bullying for the next two schools, constantly getting into fights, and with boys too. The oldest one who was sweet and mild natured would get slapped and thrown about, as per course, get bottles of drink poured over her, and generally called 'ch1nky' or 'ch1nk biitch' all day - she'd also get bullied by the teachers, one of whom put her in a bin as she was so small. Whole groups of kids would throw her into the air like having the bumps, but onto the tarmac, the kind of stuff she only admitted to happening years later. - Some of the teachers hated her for trying to be 'teacher's pet' for staying behind in class, when in truth she was just trying to avoid Fightclub playground 3x a day. That's the kind of teachers we had, who'd ignore the fact both sisters were coming into school with massive, identical bruises - literally black shoeprints on their left legs, from home. The younger sister was total tomboy and ran around getting into fights, in the end she was suspended for knocking a girl out when she slammed her into a metal pole. Luckily for me I came a few years later, when there were 2 other ethnic kids in my year (a Japanese kid and an an Asian American kid who were both popular), and a 3rd who joined mid-term and was Sri Lankan - who took the heat off us. As the first dark skinned kid in school he was absolutely HOUNDED by the entire school around the playground, on his first day, while the teachers and playground wardens all watched. I was such an idiot then I thought it was funny and joined in. When you think people back off if you fight back, they don't if the entire school is behind you. His family even moved house due to the racism (this was Thatcher's Britain in the 80s, a world away from the famously mixed, progressive society today), and his mum, and ultimately him, ended up having mental health problems by his teenage years. We had all inadvertently moved into the only racially divided area (a ghetto in other words) in the London area - all other boroughs were staunchly, traditionally mixed. Anyhoo, I escaped it at school, but at home the neighbourhood was pretty fvcking awful, as it was a skinhead estate. We had a 'crowd' of kids at our back door every day shouting abuse for the first year and throwing crap at the house, through the windows- bricks, stones, wood, rubbish, and one of my sisters got dragged out of a tree (when she was 6, by a 14 year old and his friends - the local neighbourhood sociopath), and had the scars all over her body for years, which was probably why she became so bolshy. They hounded the family for about 12 years - one generation of kids would slowly grow out of it, even becoming friends, but a new lot would replace them, until one day, home from uni, a log came though the window and I just fa-lipped, thinking this was what my Mum on her own had to go through. Went out screaming like a madman, chasing the teenagers (no idea what I would have done if I'd caught them), then spent the next hour hammering on doors and yelling at the darkened street. Everyone left us alone after that the fvcking twats. Back at school I would get the occasional insult, on the street it was weekly (it's not 'racist' if it's to East Asians!), but luckily for me I 'blossomed'. I was ripe for bullying, hanging out with the semi-nerds, I smelt bad, hated life, had terrible clothes and haircuts due to the utter neglect from the carcrash of family life, but luckily I wasn't bad looking back then. After high school I got with the artsy 'in crowd' and did a spot of modelling. Needless to say bullying wasn't a problem at school, and only occasionally outside, but at home it was absolutely constant due to the mental health issues resulting from deaths in the family; I won't say too much about what happened but we were abused from the ages of either 7 or 11 (depending on my sisters points of view and experiences) till 17 due to our guardian being in a constant state of psychosis, right until the time we started carrying out suicide pacts, running away, dropping out of school and the authorities getting involved. In retrospect I see how the abuse morphed with our willingness to take it - when you're 7 and told to strip, then stand in the street for everyone to see, you do it. By the time you're 17 and tearing down the walls, they don't care, they're just actively baiting you. To this day the one thing I've learnt is fear itself - living in constant fear - is often worse than what you actually fear will happen. It literally kills you in every way. What is so fvcked up about the thing is we loved our abuser and that person loved us back, deeply. It was never sexual, and only occasionally violent, but purely psychological, all to a backdrop or racism, bullying, and death (dying family members, from cancer). I would sleep next to my abuser after their partner died, to keep them company, but would often wake up to the sound of screaming, from say, my sisters, as they were being dragged into the garden at 4am, or the person just screaming in frustration and anguish, or just maniacal laughing, at times with a knife, other times a bucket of water for the carpet. Our abuser suffered themselves in the past, thanks to the machinations of an undiagnosed schizophrenic sister-in-law in the ranks (in other words a part-time sociopath), poisoning the family our abuser had married into, and I'd have to endure endless nights listening to them rail against society, marriage, and the bitterness of injustice. It would be us standing to attention in the dark (to save on electricity) for hours listening to it all and how we were abject failures, but by the end, after years the tables were turned and I was actively counselling our abuser. It peaked about the time my 'younger' sister would have nightmares about being smothered by our abuser. She went from the aggressive tomboy to a withdrawn and shy girl at this period; she had recently become the focus of the attacks for years as her face grew increasingly similar to resembling the schizophrenic who had abused our abuser in the past. This was a time when our relationship, brother and sister, became very close, when before we had always been competing and fighting against each other as siblings with divergent personalities. We often crept into each others beds and talked long into the night, had midnight feasts, kissed and hugged each other all night (not sexual, we were both gay), that kind of thing. The only peace she had, and only crack of vulnerability she displayed, was falling asleep while I very gently stroked her forehead, brushing away the pain. I've never become closer to a person as I've ever had with her. We talked a lot about dying, after so many years with no escape, and so much poison, and facing a bleak, hopeless, impoverished future becoming like our abuser, it was the only viable option. She wanted to die, deeply, but I wanted to save her. I told her if she ever did it, I would kill myself the next day, as I didn't want to go through the fallout again. This stopped her for a while - it took me a long time later to realise this was a suicide pact. As mentioned, this was a period that the abuse had peaked - my sister sensed that things were escalating, that things were even more wrong and odd than before, and we were in danger. Every one of our family members was suicidal. Years later, our abuser admitted it was at this time, they had to pray to God, to stop the thoughts of killing us then themselves in a murder-suicide. My sister had sensed right. However, after a while, things slowly improved, the constant psychosis became daily episodes, then only every couple of days, over the years. But it's the straw that broke the camels back as they say. By the time my sister was 17, and our abuser had launched into a 'return to form' of attacking her for 3 days, she started singing that old 80s song, 'I'm crying alone tonight', but substituting 'crying' for 'dying'. By then none of us had revised for our exams as we never really thought we'd live to see them, and the realisation she would have to embark on a life beyond these prison walls, which was all she'd ever known, was too much. Same with me. We talked that night, which was the last night we spent together. She kissed me gently at the end, stroked my forehead, while I pretended to fall asleep. Then stood in the doorway, and said goodbye. I heard her downstairs taking all the pills in the cabinet, then move to her bedroom to die. I didn't even cry, just lay there with the world revolving. Hours later, our abuser came up, still in psychosis mode, shouting and screaming, and slowly, gradually I talked her down, asked her what was it she wanted in life. I was at that stage of peace. She was sobbing by then, could barely get the words out - she just wanted someone to not even love her, just someone to think she was... alright. Denied it from her husband's family, her husband, her own family. We lay in bed and talked about life. We even got laughing later on, reminiscing funny stories. Then at some stage, I turned to her and told her something was happening, right now, to my sister. She was instantly worried, then - I can't remember - I either downplayed it again, or she went to check things out before coming back and saying she was fine and asleep. Later, in the night my sister began vomiting. She had taken multiple times the lethal amount, and luckily her body hadn't absorbed it, but rejected everything so high was the dosage. I don't know how it came out, but a week later they found it it wasn't 'food poisoning' as our doctor had thought. This was the start of 3 more suicide attempts in the next 4 years, even after the abuse had stopped, and a lifetime of depression. At the age of 40 now, she is still in care, jobless, no qualifications and utterly isolated, and still living with her former abuser, this the once brave, bolshy girl who could take anything on. During her mock exams, pretty much accepted into the best uni in the world, her suicide attempt had seen her withdrawn from school, and society. She was sectioned last year, at the stage where she no longer read (her massive hobby) or watched movies (her massive collection), but has since improved slightly. The other, oldest sister - the sweet, innocent little girl, went the opposite and became a bully herself, taking no sh1t from anyone. Although a walk-over at school, she was the one who began to rebel, answer back, slap back at home. She finally went off to uni, became super popular, did stunningly well, even forgave our abuser and sent loving letters home. Then came home for a year to save money and everything collapsed; reverted. I remember the year of arguing and screaming, this time with tables turning on our former abuser. It reached a head once again: my sister, had a stable job in a clothes shop, a circle of friends and interests, but couldn't reconcile the past, and bitterness faced with the reality of living together again - and made a life turning decision one night. She packed her things to move out, to live on the streets, homeless; her aim was to become a prostitute, perhaps out of revenge. She even went to work for the last day - but in the morning her bag strap broke at the door. I remember her being irate, late for the waiting taxi, trying to scoop up the contents, then saying FVck it! Fvck it! and storming out the door. That's the only time I saw her sobbing. She came home that day, and weeks later told me her failed plan. Shortly after she started another uni course, a series for the next decade. She was 35 by the time she started working professionally. She's now got things together and has landed some super high paying job, though still has issues and obviously needs counselling. I never felt I went off the rails, but in retrospect I did, for a long time. At first I went out to beat someone, kill them even. I wanted to get into a fight, to the extreme, end up in prison or dead and an imagined glory of defiance and the first shred of 'respect' I would ever get. I didn't care about them, some abstract figure of hate, only me. My first fight resulted a few hours later in me washing out copious amounts of my own blood out of my clothes, having been beaten to a pulp. It was my last and only act of unwarranted violence, and I thank the other hothead to this day for rescuing me. I got into drugs and alcohol and club culture in a big way (I ran away briefly before art college, was homeless, and a prostitute sleeping in parks or the rail terminals), but on return was a thoroughly functioning member of society throughout. I had two 'cold turkeys' by my final year at uni, and gave up heavy drugs more or less after, but carried on drinking secretly - or not so secretly, I'd spend up to 11 hrs at the pub after 5 hrs work every day, or at my worst, 2 bottles of spirits daily. My resultant health issues and the fact work was cottoning on to me meant I gave it up by my thirties, and keep to a limit. We went through family counselling years later, charting a map of all the things that had happened over that decade, from being forced into battling wasps nests to the knife play, the caning, the character assassination, the hysterical laughing at the moon, to the endless laughing/ screaming at us for being weak, bad, lazy and stupid into the night, the constant living in the company of death. -Our abuser had slowly transformed after our suicide attempts, into the quiet, sweet and intelligent person she had been before The Years, perhaps a stage that had been started from coil surgery that had negatively affected the hormones at the worst possible time (poverty, death, isolation, racism, injustice). Although abuser and abused now live together, they have an understanding, and are each others only friends though they still argue and ignore each other at times. Our older sister never did the family sessions and still maintains our abuser is a sociopath, and knew what she was doing, and that it's BS she couldn't remember those Years, reading elements of that into everything our abuser does or says. She doesn't hold back from publicly humiliating her, offers no comfort when our abusers other 'son' (her much younger brother) dies. Our abuser is of course, now terrified, and it's hard to watch. They are best kept apart. I had moved out with our oldest sister from a flat recently and she had turned on me on the last day, bullying and publicly humiliating me, making impersonations even as I screamed at her. Afterward I sat in the car and burst into tears, that was the end of our relationship as we knew it - I knew now she could do that to me. I was distant to her for the weeks after, though she never thought anything of it, and to a slight degree, still am. The schizophrenic Aunt that started all of this in the first place, ended up killing herself shortly after. Following her funeral my oldest sister argued with our abuser once home and I went mental one last time, as she started arguing with me too, pressing the buttons she knew I had. I just saw red, a 30 year old man headbutting my way through the double glazing in my former bedroom, covered in blood. That was the only other time I saw her sobbing, as she cleaned my wounds. "" I just thought you didn't like me anymore"". It had to stop, it all has to stop, or the cycle never ends. Is it not enough that someone died for us to realise the value of life? I said. -Bullying fvcks you up, especially by people you love, for years after you think you have to prove yourself, and if there isn't anger there's sadness. But at some stage you mellow, after about 20 years you leave it behind, you realise you have to look after yourself, and part of that means letting go (confrontation with your abuser and forgiveness helps, though isn't a prerequisite), and looking at the here and now. Plus there's so much more to life these days than reliving personal experiences. I have to say, although it was personality stripping, often violent and absolutely fvcking MADNESS, I never really went through the humiliation kind of bullying my sisters and others on here got at school, or where the world was against you rather than just family behind closed doors. That kind of sh1t, a favoured gem of sociopaths, effects you for longer I've heard as it changes your personality, which was rightly forced to change in order to defend itself. In a couple of days my oldest sister will marry, at her request, just her and her partner, and two nearby-but-distant relatives for witnesses. She lives abroad now, and none of us in the family are in much contact with each other. We have our own lives to lead, though there's so much love between us, across oceans, it's the only way. Love hurts, grief is the price you pay for love, but let it never stop you."
342,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Need to know what I'm dealing with,3,7dkhbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7dkhbh/need_to_know_what_im_dealing_with/,2017-11-17 23:09:29,"I'm just fucking exhausted man. I'm here to tell my story. It's a long one. Just looking for some answers. Parents: Father is undiagnosed NPD and mother is diagnosed codependent/histrionic Father: Growing up my Dad was extremely abusive. From toddler age I was thrown against walls, screamed at 2 inches from my face, shaken pretty damned hard, belittled, etc. My family was raised Mormon and my father loved playing the role of abusive, misogynistic patriarch. He would publicly shame my mother, control her, gaslight her, etc. all while playing the righteous church-goer card. I was always terrified of him and to this day at 25 years old still am. Well, not so much terrified, more like I would probably choke him out or beat him senseless if he ever threatened me again. Even though he was abusive, I still had some loving feelings toward my father. That is until my mothers parental alienation drove me and my siblings to a deep and abiding hate. To this day I still don't know how much of my hatred towards him is my own, or my mother's. Mother: Mom was always very protective of me. Overprotective. To the point of coddling. When my Dad would be abusive she would swoop in to rescue me. Pretty sure my Dad hated that. I was always running to her to be saved/protected. However, I always knew that something about my mother was just ""off."" She had multiple affairs during her marriage. She was obsessed with her body/working out. (All of her sisters and her had bulimia and/or anorexia growing up). I remember finding porn under her bed when I was 9. She was always weary skimpy clothes to attract attention. Which drove my father nuts. Especially as they were at one time both practicing mormons. I would have to tell my friends they couldn't come over for fear of them flirting with her the entire time. Fucking embarrassing. Anyways, she never validated my emotions growing up. Anytime I tried to express my feelings or how she was hurting me, she would turn it around and gaslight me. Making me feel guilty for expressing any type of feelings. To this day, at 25, if I were to try and express my feelings the same thing would happen. And I would probably rage or turn instantly suicidal. Me: Growing up I always needed to be the center of attention. I was hyper aware of my environment and could read a room very well. At a young age I remember being overly sexual. Obsessed with ""naughty words."" And displayed inappropriate sexual behaviors in school. (Looking up girls dresses as they walked past me in class, stuffing stuffed animals down my underwear, dry humping walls in elementary school, etc.) I was also molested by a neighbor boy at 8 years old. That may have something to do with it. I was also an extreme compulsive liar from a very early age. I believe that this was to avoid being punished. Because the punishment I felt was usually severe. I was also very manipulative even as a toddler. When my parents divorced when I was 9 I became suicidal. They took me to one counseling session, put me on Prozac, then assumed I was fine. Thanks guys. Dad remarries an amazing woman. I finally feel loved and taken care of. I feel safe and hopeful. Marriage crashes and burns two years later and I do a total shutdown. I haven't been able to connect with others or feel any semblance of joy since. I've had about 3 nervous breakdowns that have landed me in hospitals. And a depression so severe that I become bed-ridden for 6 months-a year. I am currently working part time and can barely pay the bills and eat. I'm severely obsessive compulsive. Anything I do I do perseverantly until I completely burn out. I can't keep a sleep schedule. I am in constant need of attention/assurance. I can't stand intimacy/true vulnerability with anyone, as I still feel like an abused helpless child on the inside. I have no boundaries. I play the victim card constantly. I have no executive functioning/reasoning skills. I can really only think about the next 10 minutes. I'm driving my family away by avoiding them. I don't trust anyone. Nor do I trust myself. I don't know what I feel and can't identify my feelings. I seem to have no control over my thoughts. I experience hypomania from time to time. I'm diagnosed BPD with bipolar type II. But I'm not so sure about the BPD. As I've never self harmed and I don't do relationships. And I don't act out. I know I shouldn't asked to be diagnosed on here, but the therapists I work with seem to be completely incompetent on these kinds of issues but they're all I can afford. Basically I just feel stuck and wish for death all the time. I'm pretty damn close to giving up and don't know if I can make it much longer. I'm so afraid that I'm a narcissist. I think I may be a vulnerable narcissist as I'm always complaining and looking for sympathy from other people. I can't really introspect and I'm extremely self-absorbed, vain, and dishonest. Wtf should I do? Thx for reading, -Bo"
343,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,The Letter: To me to remind me.,3,7esccb,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7esccb/the_letter_to_me_to_remind_me/,2017-11-23 03:51:24,"Is there a point maintaining contact at all if all there is is negativity? I mean, with all of them; mother, father, brother. My brother doesnt call, which doesnt bother me because Id rather text. But texting is a couple times a month, if that; usually a joke or something. My parents dont hear from him unless hes literally hounded. Like when dad called him over 30 times  every half hour, he said  when he was driving thru Edmonton and wanted a place to crash or something like that. Bro never called him back, and my dad will hold that grudge forever. And yet, my father has said the following, to my mother, about my brother and I: I dont want to get close to the kids, and when wed moved out, I finally have my wife back. The sarcastic, angry barbs we endured as kids were enough to destroy any semblance of self-esteem we had. He once said I was just like his sister; selfish, manipulative, only nice when she needs something, etc. He lamented to my brother that I shouldve stayed in school and graduated (here I am with 2 diplomas, going on another. Good enough yet?). He told my mother that I was acting like a slut when I was dating my BF at 17. And Im sure theres plenty I never heard about. But no matter, because thats more than enough. All mom and dad do is complain about things to me. How everyone theyve ever met treats them like shit and fucks them over. They complain about my brother, my father calling him a pathological liar and saying to my mother that he doesnt care if he ever sees him again; this was last fall. Brother doesnt call him on Fathers Day or his birthdays, hasnt for years. Shockingly, he and his GF are coming here for Thanksgiving. And frankly, I dont want to go. Its all fake, anyway. Faade of everyones OK and my marriage is perfect; while dad glares at mom for the slightest perceived infraction. Every single time I go there, I have high anxiety the whole time; physical/mental anxiety. Mom gets jealous when I give dad more attention than her and vice versa. I spend the hours there mediating. Keeping the mood light when I feel the passive aggressive tension build. Its all so fake. My dad resents my brother and my mother for a multitude of things, but lets pretend were a perfect family. I hate pretense and falseness. They both dump on me about each other and my brother, and have for a good 20 years. When dad was bitching about my bro last fall, he says to me: Youve never forgotten to call on my birthday or father's day. This, after all the nasty shit hes said about me behind my back to mom and bro throughout my life, now Im the fucking perfect kid? The martyr? Your perfect son whos lived his life the right way, has failed you; has failed to pledge allegiance and show respect where its due. Where was/is our respect? We were never respected for our choices, were never allowed to make any choices, for that matter. Hypocrite. We were born owing you something. For your time, your money and energy spent. You guys are just ALL ABOUT that respect, it's nauseating. I went vegetarian years ago. But was and am STILL offered meat to this day. Fucking rude. My father expects my daughter, who hates tomatoes and onions, to eat those foods, like he expected us to when we were living at home. I hate butter, but was lied to all the time about butter being in stuff when I asked. Great trust builder. I vividly remember literally being pressured to eat egg salad by both parents at the same time, was 28 years old. Wheres this respect you speak of? Oh, thats right; only parents get that privilege, not kids. They are hyper-controlling. I get disapproving looks when I discipline my kid in front of my mom. She always rushes to her rescue and babies her, essentially undermining my authority. Then I get a couple parenting books from her. More passive aggressive behavior from her and father when we bring kids and they are ANYTHING BUT perfectly quiet and seen not heard. I can see them seething about it if theres one little thump or voices go one half of an octave too loud. Cue more mediating and anxiety from me. I wrote a letter regarding my name change (first and middle), unknowingly pandering to their inevitable passive aggressive tantrum about disrespecting the names they gave me (more so for dad than mom). Whatever I do, think, say, I must run by them first. Particularly mom. She gets very hurt if I dont consult her on what I should do. Then she will scramble my decision by creating doubt and trying to get me to do what SHE thinks I should do. I didnt realize that I wrote that letter out of pure fear  fear of their reactions to doing what I want as an adult. I dont owe them or anyone else an explanation as to why. Mom told me years ago that dad resents me for using my middle name instead of my first, which he gave me. It was never anything personal, but now, with this name change, I cant say the same. Among the many personal reasons for this change, is to separate myself from them; from their identification of me. I have always been told by my mother: youre just like your dad, you look just like your dad, your life is parallel to mine, I feel like Im watching myself live again. Always hated that. How the fuck can, or would I want to be, just like someone I dont have a relationship with? It makes no sense. With these two statements said to me dozens of times in my life, I have never been given autonomy or individuality. Until a year or two ago, I couldnt even begin to fathom who the fuck I was, because all at once, I was apparently my mother and my father. I didnt know where they ended and I began. To top it all off, my mother would (still does) brag about her physical features, saying she has a perfect nose and ears and eyes and then say to me, you got your dads features, ha-ha. I grew up resenting this and hating how I looked. A year ago, I had an open conversation with mother in a bookshop about how my relationship with T is helping me through commitment and vulnerability issues. I had never opened up to anyone besides T about that. She looked at me from across the bookshelf between us, and said with this semi-amazed look on her face, I feel like Im looking at your dad. I shut down. The anger was intense and immediate. I cant even have my own feelings. To her, I am my father and his issues and feelings. I dont have any of my own. She then said that, its like, Im T and youre dad!. He and I may as well have been Siamese twins; to mother, theres no difference. Throughout my life, mom has put dad down and belittled him to us kids, any chance she got. When brother and I went to her with a concern or complaint ourselves about him, shed flip flop on us and say, You guys should talk to dad and try to have a relationship with him. Talk about fucking with my head. To this day, she will make plans for us to get together in front of him, and his attitude changes immediately. She has seldom included him in things, saying that his absence due to his career is the reason. She has created what I believe is emotional enmeshment to keep control of us kids; to keep our attention and affections on her. As one of the many examples, last xmas, when Ts parents were down, we had everyone to our house the night before they flew back home. Everyone was having a great time and socializing, except my mother. She stood with her arms crossed being standoffish the whole time. Later, I asked what was wrong that night, and she said she felt ignored by me and like I was doing lots of talking with Alice (mother in law, name changed), but not her. Then proceeded to trash talk Alice, while not even knowing her. That day, I learned she resents my getting close to any other women but her and needs my constant attention and approval. On top of this, shes told me all my life that: Im the only woman thats never turned on her. What a burden. One wrong move, and she will think Ive turned on her. Ive always felt very responsible for the emotions of my parents. Ive had a couple dreams in the last several years where Im running from her and shes screaming for me to come back. I recall her telling me shes had a dream like that too. Just the other night, I dreamt that she and I were at some metaphysical bookstore, and they were having dinner at like 930 at night. We decided to leave, so mom goes outside (it's winter in the dream) presumably to get the red SUV she drives. I go a minute later, and I see several red vans, but not hers. I start screaming for her and freaking out that I cant find her. The next moment, Im in a bathroom cutting my long hair up to my ears. I believe this is symbolic of cutting off the cord to her. If I told her this dream, she would get all sentimental and think it's symbolic of our connection and sweet. Our connection, I realize now as an adult, is grossly toxic and has crippled my full functioning as an adult. Mother was always the messenger for shitty things said about my bro and I by my father. When I was in my first relationship at 17, I was called a slut by my father because he assumed I was sexually active with this BF. My mother somehow felt the need to inform me of this, but not to stand up for me. Not long after, BF and I received a box of 100 condoms from my parents as a joke, but this was most definitely a passive aggressive move on their part. Typical. Mother would call this BFs mom every time I was over at their house to make sure he and I werent in his room alone. I was never spoken to about birth control or sex. I was told to wait til marriage because we did, which was a lie, I found out years later. I was heavily shamed for having sexuality and was oppressed. My brother, however, was not. A couple years later, I was only hanging out with a guy Id met. Not even dating, just leading up to that possibility, I guess (never dated anyway). I was sitting on the couch in the basement of my parents house (18 at the time) with my legs over his legs. Nothing going on, just innocent. And once again, my mother is the bearer of choice words from my father, who said I was acting like a whore with my legs over this guy. Dont know what she got out of telling me that shit, other than to create hatred for him and more enmeshment with her. One time, my father listened in on a very sexual conversation I had with my first BF (17 yrs old). He reported the sordid things he heard to my mother, who, you guessed it, told me. I have never forgiven him for that. It was so wrong to do that to me. My sex life was their business, as far as they were concerned. During my teen years, I wrote in diaries. Writing was super cathartic for me (still is). One day, when I was 17, I returned home from being at my BFs house, and my bed was flipped and bedroom door removed. My parents had hunted for and read my diary, then used what Id written against me. They did this once more and I stopped writing for years. Only in my late 20s did I begin to write again. I have not trusted them since this incident. I am positive, that if they had a chance to read the one I keep now, theyd be all over it like white on rice. My mother used the excuse that they wanted to know what was going on with me. Then fucking ask. I wasnt a bad kid at all; didnt get into a bad crowd (wasnt allowed friends anyway), didnt do drugs, didnt have sex, etc. etc. I obeyed what they told me to do, but I still wasnt given trust or respect. They had to know what I was doing at all times. So then, at 13, I develop anorexia, not surprisingly. With the super-controlled, everyone must be perfect at all times dynamic, I just internalized everything. I had to be (and still must be) two different people around my mother and father, to be acceptable. My mother has always blamed my father and his absence for the E.D. I ate it up, because I believed just about everything she told me. She was my confidante, best friend, therapist, everything. My life couldnt function without her managing it. I realized last year, that the ED had more to do with her than it ever had with my father. She was constantly making remarks about my body. I remember standing in the kitchen at about 13, before I began losing weight, and my mother standing behind me with my father. She said, your butt looks like two round globes! and making the gesture like she was holding a melon in each hand. I hated her for that. I was never aware of my body, or the space it took up, until she brought it up. She went grocery shopping one time and upon bringing it home, she said, dont go eating everything I just bought. Then another time, not too long after, I asked if I could have a wrap. She looked at me over her reading glasses (extra condescending-like) and said, dont you think youve had enough (food) today? Soon after, I began losing weight. A year later, I was around 95 lbs and essentially dying. I was admitted to Ottawa IP eating disorder ward, and after 30 days, my parents removed me AMA, because I was begging them to. Id only gained 7 lbs and needed to be there for at least 5 more months. I was doing well there, because I was away from the fucked-up family dynamic. My mother shuttled me to a therapist or two, one or two times each and never encouraged me to keep going. I never dealt with the root cause of my ED, and didnt figure it out til last year. About a year later, I was weight-restored, and my mother and I got into an argument and she alluded to thinking I was fat. I said, are you saying Im fat? and she said, well youre getting there!. Saying that to someone recovering from anorexia is justevil. I was a normal weight for my height and had gone through hell, alone, to get there. I promptly lost 20 lbs. To this day, she loves to hold it over my head that she and my father saved my life and refuses to talk about how difficult it was for me and the severe depression I suffered from. She talks like she was the one who went through it. Her problems will always be worse than mine. A year ago, I told her i'd been struggling with a relapse. Her response? oh ya, Ive been relapsing the last 4 months, too (eating junk food). When I told her I was trying to gain the weight back that id lost, she said: but do you think that would be good for you mentally? Shes always given me the loud message than being thin is more important than being happy and healthy. Whenever I put on a few lbs, she manages to notice and ask if Im working out still. Shes always called me big boned and says theres nothing dainty about me. (Im 59 and small framed). In one breath, she will put me down indirectly and then compete with me about whos eating is more fucked up. But always under the guise of caring. What a mindfuck. When I was about 11, the drama from my dads side of the family came to a head. It was all about his family not liking her for some mysterious reason, which is shitty. But naturally, she involved us kids and forced my dad to cut all contact with his parents and siblings. It was just after Xmas, and mother made my brother and I each write a letter to them, stating they cant treat our mother like that and cutting them off. Made us send back the xmas gifts, too. Then, we were made to show dad the letters wed written. Ill never forget that moment. The whole thing haunts me to this day. It broke me. All I wanted was my grandparents. But we were guilted into supporting my mother and were not about to rock the boat. I can only imagine the shitstorm of you dont love me or support me! if we said no. Guilt was and is a heavily used weapon by my parents. Around the same time, my mom made my dad stop talking to a good friend because he didnt like her. My mother has told me more than once, that if it wasnt for us kids, she wouldve divorced dad years ago. Last year, she confessed (without prompting) that she and my father havent been intimate in over 5 years and that she feels dirty being intimate with him. (Why the fuck are you even together? Oh because 35 years and RRSPs? Luxury.) And then has the NERVE to criticize my relationships and tell me what to do. She will literally ask the same question 10 different ways until she gets information out of me. If she doesnt get the required (read: insatiable) amount of attention and info out of me and my brother about our personal lives, we will both get a call about how she and dad feel put out by us and made to apologize. I dont know how many times she and my father have made us kids apologize for shit. I was made to apologize to my father for my eating disorder and being such a difficult kid and putting them through everything I did (depression and anorexia). My brother was made numerous times to apologize for not calling or texting and thus showing disrespect. I mean, anything could be disrespectful to them, anything. If we speak our minds and it goes against what they believe, guilt-trip and repenting time. We couldnt and cant be loud, speak our minds, say how we really feel or hold difference of opinion. If they dont approve, it isnt OK. I lived with them for a few months when I was about 20, and got bitched out for leaving hairpins on the bathroom sink. My father took that as disrespect and I literally got a lecture for it as my mother stood by. Got the silent treatment from him, too, of course. Only thing theyve said sorry for is moving across country 50 times and dad being on the road all the time for his job. When I was 22, I had my daughter by my abusive ex. It was not an accident; through my Stockholm syndrome, I made the choice to have her. If I could go back in time, I wouldnt do it again. Not because I dont love my kid, but because I was in no way prepared to have a child and he was a terrible choice in terms of a father and partner. But my mother always says: you were meant to have her, babies come when theyre meant to, the Universe, blah blah blah. NO. I made a CHOICE. I wanted to adopt her out because I thought she would have a better life with a mother who was not traumatized and dealing with severe postpartum depression and relationship trauma. But mother talked me out of it, for her own selfish gain. She needed something to care for, to fill the void. She had a psychic warn her that I would be pregnant by this guy and she didnt tell me til after I was. She still talks like it was her who went through the abuse. Talks about how it affected HER, literally, just like my eating disorder. I told her last year to never bring him up again. Surprisingly, she hasnt. Now, she compulsively buys useless shit from the store she works at and has filled their house. Can barely move without knocking something over. My dad complains to me about how much he resents the pack ratting and how hes just a paycheck. I dont even know what to say. The anxiety is insane. They want me to help them move to a new house in a month, in return for them helping me move my 15 boxes a couple times this year. My father couldnt just ask for help; he had to present it like I OWE IT to them. My brother and I have helped move their shit over 50 times throughout our lives, due to their compulsive moving across country. No word of a lie; they PACK a 54 foot truck trailer (and then some), top to bottom, back to front, with the shit they have. Theres boxes my mother has been vowing to unpack for 30 years and never touched. Theres a little rebellious part of me that wants to say, fuck you. But guilt. Update on the moving house thing.. we didnt go to help, because they hired a moving company. This was done only because I announced my name change on my daughters 7th bday at their house and my father hated me for it, so he didnt want me there to help move. Hes the cheapest person I know, and after the money he had to spend to get that house, the last thing hed want to do is hire movers. He gave me the silent treatment for the millionth time in my life that night and my mother made excuses to his benefit for his behaviour. I cried most of the way home. Imagine: a 29 year old woman, with her own family and career, crying because her father treated her like shit *again*. Showed her he doesnt accept her and never will. That night is burned in my memory forever and its the night I finally went VVVLC with my mother and NC with my father. "
344,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Effects Of Being Hyper Observed As a Kid,16,7fsfsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7fsfsw/effects_of_being_hyper_observed_as_a_kid/,2017-11-27 15:05:52,"Hi guys! This is my first post here so I hope I'm doing this right. I've been thinking a lot about how my Nmom's hyper observance of me has affected me and my ability to have relationships. I'm wondering if anyone else has any similar experiences or good reading material on this subject My Nmom loved to act like she was telepathic and omnipotent and looked for dirt on me constantly. She was also a Jehovah Witness so what she would constitute as ""dirt"" was ridiculously harmless stuff. Like once she snooped in my backpack and found a halloween picture a girl drew for me, confronted me about it with the bible and yelled at me for about 4 hours. I later found out she photocopied that picture and kept it in a big stack along with copies of my diaries and everything else she found that was ""bad"". She read all my journals, raided my room, somehow found blogs I secretly made at my dad's house, everything. She'd make me sweat too, she didn't pounce right away when she found something. She would make vague comments about how she was ""always watching"" and ""I knew more than she thought"", give me the cold shoulder for a few days, then say ""we need to talk"" and make me sit in my room for hours until she came in. Even when she wasn't around as a kid, I'd imagine an audience of people around me all the time. I was left alone a lot but I always felt watched. I haven't had any real private experiences in my life (I can think of two instances when I sing of feeling 100% present, but that's it). I don't know how to feel inside of myself, like I'm looking out of my own eyes. I have mild dissociative/depersonalization problems too and Its annoying to feel like I always have to watch myself from the outside. So, I recently ended a four year relationship I've been in since I was 17. My ex had a few similar qualities as my mom, which I'm realizing now. Hes not a bad guy or anything, but the way he operated made me feel very hyperobserved as well. He demanded vulnerability and transparency all the time. Sometimes when I said how I felt, he would disregard it and try to ""dig deeper"". He's very psychoanalytical and I felt under a microscope with him. He also literally described himself as telepathic. I hated looking at him during sex because his eyes felt searching, like he was trying to find something deeper than what I was presenting. I thought I would be sad when he moved out but instead I've felt a great deal of relief. I don't want to be vulnerable or open all the time about my feelings, I don't even know how I feel half the time. This is literally the first time in my life I'm living alone and not in a relationship. I'm very relieved and greatly enjoying it, but I still have the observer in my head and I want to get it out. And another thing, i don't want to cut myself off from the world. I'm a human and I need people, but I don't want to be seen. I don't want to be looked at or picked apart. How can I have relationships (not romantic, necessarily) when I'm obviously so emotionally unavailable? "
345,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Advice request: should I reply to my Nmom?,2,7h806j,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7h806j/advice_request_should_i_reply_to_my_nmom/,2017-12-03 16:36:02,"I'm working through the pain caused by my Nmom. The process means so much is close to the surface, and I've chosen not to visit when we are in town for fear I will lash out. She sent a note after Thanksgiving saying she was worried she had done something to offend me, asking if she should just not contact me, please just let her know. I'd been NC for years before having my son, then went back to contact, then had to cut back because the N behaviors were starting to increase and visits with my Nmom and nearly absent dad were getting difficult for me emotionally. Do I reply to her at all? Do I say I'm going through some fairly intense therapy and need the space to process? Do I tell her I'm going through intense therapy to work through all the pain caused physically and emotionally from her abusive behaviors towards me as I was growing up? Part of me wants to do that last one, but another, more rational part realizes it won't lead to any apologies, likely just gaslighting or rationalizing or twisting it around to excuses without apologies. And while I can still do it knowing that won't be the outcome, I have to wonder if it's worth the trouble, pain, and even vulnerability? Some part of her truly loves me, right?

I always feel like I need to lighten the mood with humor. Moments like that make me feel vulnerable, which is something I hate. I imagine this stems from being manipulated emotionally so much my whole life and having my vulnerability used against me. Weakness was not permissible in my childhood home, and whether the moment was real or in a movie we were watching, Ndad would huff and roll his eyes and say Jeez like what was happening was the stupidest thing hed ever heard. Now, as an adult, seeing emotionally charged moments, or being paid a compliment, or to have someone thank me for something makes me feel so uncomfortable, like I just want to rush back into the safety of neutral emotional territory.

Though the issues I've faced have been quite difficult, looking back I feel as if I gradually ""got it"", stumbling across some very distinct tuning points where I knew - or at least felt strongly so - that I was seeing things more clearly. I'm frustrated that I haven't had as many tuning moments, or at least my picture is still fuzzy, when it comes to assessing people's intent, having confidence in my interpretation of what statements mean given the context (who is present in the room, prior conversation, where attention has been focused or shifted, how quickly.... those sort of things). It's one of the more insidious outcomes of the N abuse we go through, and I've noticed that it impacts us as individuals in a variety of ways. Having lurked some time and becoming more active recently, I've noticed that some users seem to be aware of the impact right away, while others aren't and they accidentally attribute it to some character flaw, and still others are so battered and self-doubting that the idea of any alternative explanation never occurs to them. Identifying with each of those levels of awareness, continuing to struggle with self-doubt and longing to feel like I'm not broadcasting vulnerability / being taken advantage of, I ask this community.. Have you (or do you currently) experienced: * doubt over what someone meant * feeling like you were being toyed with * notice that others structure communication in conversations involving you (being asked a question in earnest with an * -overt or otherwise- * social implication that it be answered) * a lack of understanding others' actions and communication styles * a need to pre-empt any abuse by giving more weight to negative interpretations of someone's communication style, verbal or otherwise (as it relates to people that knowingly test your boundaries / are verbally-emotionally abusive, as it relates to innocuous conversations) * a feeling that what you say is being examined for vulnerabilities * conversations in which you are presented a choice, yet it is clear that the initiator only finds one choice to be acceptable * any other example that you feel would fit here (please mark it as a bullet point in your reply) Thanks for taking the time to read, and especially so if you reply!"

While I was packing, it came out that this was a lie. I was pretty fucking pissed, naturally. But today I received word that my grandmother has actually passed. This is according to my mom (who I am very close with), but she heard from my dad. In a panic, I called my university office to get a bereavement absence, and let all my professors know. But it just dawned on me that I had heard from no one other than my mom. My NDad and his sister all have my number, but no one has told me when they normally probably would have. If this is a lie, I am in deep moral and academic shit. The office will probably revoke my absence and I will be reprimanded for ""lying"". I am pretty close to one of my professors, and the thought of lying to him, even on accident honestly makes me pretty upset. He has always been beyond helpful with my (mental) disability accommodations, and I wouldn't want to jeopardize this or hurt him. I am raging. I do not know if she is even actually dead, and I don't know that I will even believe it until I see an obituary. I know there will not be a funeral or anything either, as there was not one for my grandpa from the same side. So it wouldn't be hard for NDad to lie about this. This is not the first time he leveraged someone's death to ""come home"". He did this after our family dog had to be put down, and took advantage of everyone's vulnerability to create another year of hell for us. So basically, if I find out that this is all a lie again, what can I do? Has anyone had this or something similar happen to them? I do not want to be reprimanded by my college for something that is not my fault... edit: My college office is expecting an obituary in the next few days. My college is notoriously difficult to get excused absences for death of family. If this is all a lie, I will obviously not not be able to give them one. I don't want to seem like the boy who cried wolf, but more morally twisted, when it is in fact my NDad that is."

Its long** Is there a point maintaining contact at all if all there is is negativity? I mean, with all of them; mother, father, brother. My brother doesnt call, which doesnt bother me because Id rather text. But texting is a couple times a month, if that; usually a joke or something. My parents dont hear from him unless hes literally hounded. Like when dad called him over 30 times  every half hour, he said  when he was driving thru Edmonton and wanted a place to crash or something like that. Bro never called him back, and my dad will hold that grudge forever. And yet, my father has said the following, to my mother, about my brother and I: I dont want to get close to the kids, and when wed moved out, I finally have my wife back. The sarcastic, angry barbs we endured as kids were enough to destroy any semblance of self-esteem we had. He once said I was just like his sister; selfish, manipulative, only nice when she needs something, etc. He lamented to my brother that I shouldve stayed in school and graduated (here I am with 2 diplomas, going on another. Good enough yet?). He told my mother that I was acting like a slut when I was dating my BF at 17. And Im sure theres plenty I never heard about. But no matter, because thats more than enough. All mom and dad do is complain about things to me. How everyone theyve ever met treats them like shit and fucks them over. They complain about my brother, my father calling him a pathological liar and saying to my mother that he doesnt care if he ever sees him again; this was last fall. Brother doesnt call him on Fathers Day or his birthdays, hasnt for years. Shockingly, he and his GF are coming here for Thanksgiving. And frankly, I dont want to go. Its all fake, anyway. Faade of everyones OK and my marriage is perfect; while dad glares at mom for the slightest perceived infraction. Every single time I go there, I have high anxiety the whole time; physical/mental anxiety. Mom gets jealous when I give dad more attention than her and vice versa. I spend the hours there mediating. Keeping the mood light when I feel the passive aggressive tension build. Its all so fake. My dad resents my brother and my mother for a multitude of things, but lets pretend were a perfect family. I hate pretense and falseness. They both dump on me about each other and my brother, and have for a good 20 years. When dad was bitching about my bro last fall, he says to me: Youve never forgotten to call on my birthday or father's day. This, after all the nasty shit hes said about me behind my back to mom and bro throughout my life, now Im the fucking perfect kid? The martyr? Your perfect son whos lived his life the right way, has failed you; has failed to pledge allegiance and show respect where its due. Where was/is our respect? We were never respected for our choices, were never allowed to make any choices, for that matter. Hypocrite. We were born owing you something. For your time, your money and energy spent. You guys are just ALL ABOUT that respect, it's nauseating. I went vegetarian years ago. But was and am STILL offered meat to this day. Fucking rude. My father expects my daughter, who hates tomatoes and onions, to eat those foods, like he expected us to when we were living at home. I hate butter, but was lied to all the time about butter being in stuff when I asked. Great trust builder. I vividly remember literally being pressured to eat egg salad by both parents at the same time, was 28 years old. Wheres this respect you speak of? Oh, thats right; only parents get that privilege, not kids. They are hyper-controlling. I get disapproving looks when I discipline my kid in front of my mom. She always rushes to her rescue and babies her, essentially undermining my authority. Then I get a couple parenting books from her. More passive aggressive behavior from her and father when we bring kids and they are ANYTHING BUT perfectly quiet and seen not heard. I can see them seething about it if theres one little thump or voices go one half of an octave too loud. Cue more mediating and anxiety from me. I wrote a letter regarding my name change (first and middle), unknowingly pandering to their inevitable passive aggressive tantrum about disrespecting the names they gave me (more so for dad than mom). Whatever I do, think, say, I must run by them first. Particularly mom. She gets very hurt if I dont consult her on what I should do. Then she will scramble my decision by creating doubt and trying to get me to do what SHE thinks I should do. I didnt realize that I wrote that letter out of pure fear  fear of their reactions to doing what I want as an adult. I dont owe them or anyone else an explanation as to why. Mom told me years ago that dad resents me for using my middle name instead of my first, which he gave me. It was never anything personal, but now, with this name change, I cant say the same. Among the many personal reasons for this change, is to separate myself from them; from their identification of me. I have always been told by my mother: youre just like your dad, you look just like your dad, your life is parallel to mine, I feel like Im watching myself live again. Always hated that. How the fuck can, or would I want to be, just like someone I dont have a relationship with? It makes no sense. With these two statements said to me dozens of times in my life, I have never been given autonomy or individuality. Until a year or two ago, I couldnt even begin to fathom who the fuck I was, because all at once, I was apparently my mother and my father. I didnt know where they ended and I began. To top it all off, my mother would (still does) brag about her physical features, saying she has a perfect nose and ears and eyes and then say to me, you got your dads features, ha-ha. I grew up resenting this and hating how I looked. A year ago, I had an open conversation with mother in a bookshop about how my relationship with T is helping me through commitment and vulnerability issues. I had never opened up to anyone besides T about that. She looked at me from across the bookshelf between us, and said with this semi-amazed look on her face, I feel like Im looking at your dad. I shut down. The anger was intense and immediate. I cant even have my own feelings. To her, I am my father and his issues and feelings. I dont have any of my own. She then said that, its like, Im T and youre dad!. He and I may as well have been Siamese twins; to mother, theres no difference. . Throughout my life, mom has put dad down and belittled him to us kids, any chance she got. When brother and I went to her with a concern or complaint ourselves about him, shed flip flop on us and say, You guys should talk to dad and try to have a relationship with him. Talk about fucking with my head. To this day, she will make plans for us to get together in front of him, and his attitude changes immediately. She has seldom included him in things, saying that his absence due to his career is the reason. She has created what I believe is emotional enmeshment to keep control of us kids; to keep our attention and affections on her. I told her about a year ago how I was thinking about going NC with Dad and she lamented about how hard itll be for her and how itll put her in the middle. Well no worry, cuz youre both on NC now. As one of the many examples, last xmas, when Ts parents were down, we had everyone to our house the night before they flew back home. Everyone was having a great time and socializing, except my mother. She stood with her arms crossed being standoffish the whole time. Later, I asked what was wrong that night, and she said she felt ignored by me and like I was doing lots of talking with Alice (mother in law, name changed), but not her. Then proceeded to trash talk Alice, while not even knowing her. That day, I learned she resents my getting close to any other women but her and needs my constant attention and approval. On top of this, shes told me all my life that: Im the only woman thats never turned on her. What a burden. One wrong move, and she will think Ive turned on her. Ive always felt very responsible for the emotions of my parents. Ive had a couple dreams in the last several years where Im running from her and shes screaming for me to come back. I recall her telling me shes had a dream like that too. Just the other night, I dreamt that she and I were at some metaphysical bookstore, and they were having dinner at like 930 at night. We decided to leave, so mom goes outside (it's winter in the dream) presumably to get the red SUV she drives. I go a minute later, and I see several red vans, but not hers. I start screaming for her and freaking out that I cant find her. The next moment, Im in a bathroom cutting my long hair up to my ears. I believe this is symbolic of cutting off the cord to her. If I told her this dream, she would get all sentimental and think it's symbolic of our connection and sweet. Our connection, I realize now as an adult, is grossly toxic and has crippled my full functioning as an adult. Mother was always the messenger for shitty things said about my bro and I by my father. When I was in my first relationship at 17, I was called a slut by my father because he assumed I was sexually active with this BF. My mother somehow felt the need to inform me of this, but not to stand up for me. Not long after, BF and I received a box of 100 condoms from my parents as a joke, but this was most definitely a passive aggressive move on their part. Typical. Mother would call this BFs mom every time I was over at their house to make sure he and I werent in his room alone. I was never spoken to about birth control or sex. I was told to wait til marriage because we did, which was a lie, I found out years later. I was heavily shamed for having sexuality and was oppressed. My brother, however, was not. A couple years later, I was only hanging out with a guy Id met. Not even dating, just leading up to that possibility, I guess (never dated anyway). I was sitting on the couch in the basement of my parents house (18 at the time) with my legs over his legs. Nothing going on, just innocent. And once again, my mother is the bearer of choice words from my father, who said I was acting like a whore with my legs over this guy. Dont know what she got out of telling me that shit, other than to create hatred for him and more enmeshment with her. One time, my father listened in on a very sexual conversation I had with my first BF (17 yrs old). He reported the sordid things he heard to my mother, who, you guessed it, told me. I have never forgiven him for that. It was so wrong to do that to me. My sex life was their business, as far as they were concerned. During my teen years, I wrote in diaries. Writing was super cathartic for me (still is). One day, when I was 17, I returned home from being at my BFs house, and my bed was flipped and bedroom door removed. My parents had hunted for and read my diary, then used what Id written against me. They did this once more and I stopped writing for years. Only in my late 20s did I begin to write again. I have not trusted them since this incident. I am positive, that if they had a chance to read the one I keep now, theyd be all over it like white on rice. My mother used the excuse that they wanted to know what was going on with me. Then fucking ask. I wasnt a bad kid at all; didnt get into a bad crowd (wasnt allowed friends anyway), didnt do drugs, didnt have sex, etc. etc. I obeyed what they told me to do, but I still wasnt given trust or respect. They had to know what I was doing at all times. So then, at 13, I develop anorexia, not surprisingly. With the super-controlled, everyone must be perfect at all times dynamic, I just internalized everything. I had to be (and still must be) two different people around my mother and father, to be acceptable. My mother has always blamed my father and his absence for the E.D. I ate it up, because I believed just about everything she told me. She was my confidante, best friend, therapist, everything. My life couldnt function without her managing it. I realized last year, that the ED had more to do with her than it ever had with my father. She was constantly making remarks about my body. I remember standing in the kitchen at about 13, before I began losing weight, and my mother standing behind me with my father. She said, your butt looks like two round globes! and making the gesture like she was holding a melon in each hand. I hated her for that. I was never aware of my body, or the space it took up, until she brought it up. She went grocery shopping one time and upon bringing it home, she said, dont go eating everything I just bought. Then another time, not too long after, I asked if I could have a wrap. She looked at me over her reading glasses (extra condescending-like) and said, dont you think youve had enough (food) today? Soon after, I began losing weight. A year later, I was around 95 lbs and essentially dying. I was admitted to Ottawa IP eating disorder ward, and after 30 days, my parents removed me AMA, because I was begging them to. Id only gained 7 lbs and needed to be there for at least 5 more months. I was doing well there, because I was away from the fucked-up family dynamic. My mother shuttled me to a therapist or two, one or two times each and never encouraged me to keep going. I never dealt with the root cause of my ED, and didnt figure it out til last year. About a year later, I was weight-restored, and my mother and I got into an argument and she alluded to thinking I was fat. I said, are you saying Im fat? and she said, well youre getting there!. Saying that to someone recovering from anorexia is justevil. I was a normal weight for my height and had gone through hell, alone, to get there. I promptly lost 20 lbs. To this day, she loves to hold it over my head that she and my father saved my life and refuses to talk about how difficult it was for me and the severe depression I suffered from. She talks like she was the one who went through it. Her problems will always be worse than mine. A year ago, I told her i'd been struggling with a relapse. Her response? oh ya, Ive been relapsing the last 4 months, too (eating junk food). When I told her I was trying to gain the weight back that id lost, she said: but do you think that would be good for you mentally? Shes always given me the loud message than being thin is more important than being happy and healthy. Whenever I put on a few lbs, she manages to notice and ask if Im working out still. Shes always called me big boned and says theres nothing dainty about me. (Im 59 and small framed). In one breath, she will put me down indirectly and then compete with me about whos eating is more fucked up. But always under the guise of caring. What a mindfuck. When I was about 11, the drama from my dads side of the family came to a head. It was all about his family not liking her for some mysterious reason, which is shitty. But naturally, she involved us kids and forced my dad to cut all contact with his parents and siblings. It was just after Xmas, and mother made my brother and I each write a letter to them, stating they cant treat our mother like that and cutting them off. Made us send back the xmas gifts, too. Then, we were made to show dad the letters wed written. Ill never forget that moment. The whole thing haunts me to this day. It broke me. All I wanted was my grandparents. But we were guilted into supporting my mother and were not about to rock the boat. I can only imagine the shitstorm of you dont love me or support me! if we said no. Guilt was and is a heavily used weapon by my parents. Around the same time, my mom made my dad stop talking to a good friend because he didnt like her. My mother has told me more than once, that if it wasnt for us kids, she wouldve divorced dad years ago. Last year, she confessed (without prompting) that she and my father havent been intimate in over 5 years and that she feels dirty being intimate with him. (Why the fuck are you even together? Oh because 35 years and RRSPs? Luxury.) And then has the NERVE to criticize my relationships and tell me what to do. She will literally ask the same question 10 different ways until she gets information out of me. If she doesnt get the required (read: insatiable) amount of attention and info out of me and my brother about our personal lives, we will both get a call about how she and dad feel put out by us and made to apologize. I dont know how many times she and my father have made us kids apologize for shit. I was made to apologize to my father for my eating disorder and being such a difficult kid and putting them through everything I did (depression and anorexia). My brother was made numerous times to apologize for not calling or texting and thus showing disrespect. I mean, anything could be disrespectful to them, anything. If we speak our minds and it goes against what they believe, guilt-trip and repenting time. We couldnt and cant be loud, speak our minds, say how we really feel or hold difference of opinion. If they dont approve, it isnt OK. I lived with them for a few months when I was about 20, and got bitched out for leaving hairpins on the bathroom sink. My father took that as disrespect and I literally got a lecture for it as my mother stood by. Got the silent treatment from him, too, of course. Only thing theyve said sorry for is moving across country 50 times and dad being on the road all the time for his job. When I was 22, I had my daughter by my abusive ex. It was not an accident; through my Stockholm syndrome, I made the choice to have her. If I could go back in time, I wouldnt do it again. Not because I dont love my kid, but because I was in no way prepared to have a child and he was a terrible choice in terms of a father and partner. But my mother always says: you were meant to have her, babies come when theyre meant to, the Universe, blah blah blah. NO. I made a CHOICE. I wanted to adopt her out because I thought she would have a better life with a mother who was not traumatized and dealing with severe postpartum depression and relationship trauma. But mother talked me out of it, for her own selfish gain. She needed something to care for, to fill the void. She had a psychic warn her that I would be pregnant by this guy and she didnt tell me til after I was. She still talks like it was her who went through the abuse. Talks about how it affected HER, literally, just like my eating disorder. I told her last year to never bring him up again. Surprisingly, she hasnt. Now, she compulsively buys useless shit from the store she works at and has filled their house. Can barely move without knocking something over. My dad complains to me about how much he resents the pack ratting and how hes just a paycheck. I dont even know what to say. The anxiety is insane. They want me to help them move to a new house in a month, in return for them helping me move my 15 boxes a couple times this year. My father couldnt just ask for help; he had to present it like I OWE IT to them. My brother and I have helped move their shit over 50 times throughout our lives, due to their compulsive moving across country. No word of a lie; they PACK a 54 foot truck trailer (and then some), top to bottom, back to front, with the shit they have. Theres boxes my mother has been vowing to unpack for 30 years and never touched. Theres a little rebellious part of me that wants to say, fuck you. But guilt. "

I've had a set bedtime of 8:30 since kindergarten (highschool junior now and nothing has changed), and they prevented any workaround of this by disabling the internet on all my devices, sometimes taking them from me. They've made sure I can't enjoy gaming by locking me out of my 360, making their own Live account and preventing me from playing online, logging into it, or changing the gamertag on the account they made. Once I moved on to PC gaming to try and avoid this, they then installed blocking software through a hard-disk while I was at school that prevents connection to Steam and any other program or website that provides anything other than resources for my school work. Not only that, they make sure that I don't even have the option to use my devices by grounding me for no reason at all or leading me into saying or acting in a way where they can say 'You had an attitude' or 'You're clearly obsessed with games' when they initiate a conversation about games that I can't leave without being grounded for ignoring them, and they even ask me dead-end questions where telling them anything except what they want to hear will get me grounded anyway. They've even grounded me for 'not having enough homework'. They also openly hate on every interest I pick up on. I made the mistake of telling them about my interest in streetwear and designer clothing and now 'I'm obsessed with Supreme and I can't responsibly handle money' when I don't even buy anything I like nor am I allowed to make or have enough money to afford those things. When I was 7 they put me in a situation where if I wanted anything more than a roof over my head and food, I had to pay for it with my own money. However, they made sure that I had no way of getting money or being able to use whatever money I got. All my chores and jobs were 'volunteer work' and I never got money for them, any actual employments so far that brought me money I had to give them my check and they would store my money in their bank accounts and then never let me spend it on anything. And I could never be right about anything with them or have a fair point in any conversation I have with them. If I talked about my friends, my parents would never like them and they would bar me from ever talking to them or visit them outside of school, and they would only allow me to be friends with the kids of my parents' friends that didn't like technology or gaming or fashion or anything I liked. They also have no sympathy for the social anxiety, avoidance, secrecy, and vulnerability that my parents onset on me. It's never their fault, its always the technology or that if I had real hobbies like sports (Which I play but since I didn't make any of the school teams then they don't acknowledge it) then I would have friends and not be depressed or shy. And any time I speak my mind on the way my parents act and treat me, they always shut down the conversation and they turn it into a 3-hour hit piece on how much I dissapoint them or disrespect them when it's always my parents that make fun of me. My stepdad and mother openly insult me vulgarly and if I respond to it in any way then it's me being disrespectful to them and having an attitude and it's 'the reason why I never have anything I want'. They also use my personality and interests that they made me not proud of in order to guilt me into giving in to whatever they want. They use the blocking software as well as the tracking features that they got from the ISP and threaten me with it, that they'll show my history or my internet usage times to the other parent and my restriction could be extended further. Please Reddit, how can I deal with this? My parents have made me a shut-in with no hobbies, no interests, no voice, and no social life. I have to hide everything from them and I feel like I can't even discuss the weather with them without being grounded or insulted for multiple hours in a row."

She never taught me any decent life lessons that any parent should have. When i was a kid, if my sister stole something, her response was to tell me to steal it back, and when I did and my sister and I got into an argument, she would yell at me for not sharing. She always looked down on other people who were below her, never treated me as a person with actual valid opinions and feelings, was extremely emotionally manipulative, and power-hungry. Before, she would make me cry and then call me a brat for crying and said that I had no right to cry. I was never entitled to cry whenever she yelled at me because it was always my fault. For example, one time she walked in on one of my panic attacks about schoolwork, and she yelled at me for procrastinating and that I deserved what I got. I've always (and still do) wanted her affection and approval, but I always fell short, and it's taken its toll on my self esteem. I've been talking to my school counselor about potential mental illnesses, and she encouraged me to tell my mom soon, but with her always disapproving of me and putting me down, it made me not want to tell her for fear of her dismissing it as me ""making excuses for my behavior"" and ""not taking responsibility for my actions"". I started talking back to her a lot, but it's because I've become aware that she's feeding me lies and exxagiarations about my shortcomings and behavior for years, and if I just sit there and take it, she'll manipulate the situation to make her the victim and me the villain and keep going at it until I cry or she does something petty like force me to quit something or confiscate something. Up until the last argument, she has always been able to steer the argument towards my awful time management and how it's affecting my schoolwork, and it always worked because I didn't realize she was doing it. Another thing she does is accuse me of doing or saying something that she did/said within the hour. During the last argument, however, I stood my ground and didn't let her redirect the argument towards what she thought was wrong with me and I pointed out things she'd said previously that disproved/contradicted her current accusation. However, as she was walking out of my room after telling me that I'm a horrible daughter and student, I mumbled that she was a terrible mom for not providing emotional support. Then, something hit me and I started sobbing uncontrollably because years and years of longing for motherly emotional support finally hit me and it wouldn't stop. I've had suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, symptoms of mental illnesses that I've been trying for a month now to tell her about (by order of the conselor), and this made me realize how truly alone with this I was, because no way in fucking hell would I tell her this. She misheard it and thought that I said that she didn't provide financial support. Seeing a vulnerability, she dove for it and started yelling at me about how she provides me with food, clothes, shelter, and a tutor, as well as several years of music lessons. She yelled about how spoiled and rude I am. She compared herself to some parents of my friends who were also abusive, saying that she wasn't like them and that I should be grateful (news flash: she's exactly like them). When I tried to tell her that that wasn't what I'd said, she told me to tell her what I'd actually said, but I couldn't bring myself to because I was afraid of her belittling my accusations. She stood over me while I was crying, watching me for maybe 5 seconds, and then called me a drama queen, and started fucking LAUGHING at me crying. She fucking started laughing. I asked her what she was laughing at, and she said the fact that I acted like I was the victim. When I told her to stop and leave me alone, she continued to laugh at me until I'd collected myself enough to fight back, and then things got nasty again. She tried to play the victim but I didn't let her, and she got mad and stormed out and threatened to tell my dad, but I told her that I wasn't afraid because every single fucking time, I was provoked and that she did worse things to me that would be looked down on more than my disrespect. This shut her up, but I still suspect that she told him anyways. I can't take this anymore. Every time thigns are good between us and I open up a little, we get into an argument that leaves me completely broken. I dont' know how to deal with her because my mental health is slowly deteriorating and I feel my personality and happiness literally slipping away little by little. I can't talk to anyone about this because I'm afraid that maybe I am being over dramatic. What should I do?"

First time I openly express myself about this and try to keep it as short as possible. So I recently realized my mom has NPD. As a child Ive been very much emotionally neglected. I received no hugs/compliments/Iloveyous, my mom would get very angry with me if I was sick/sad/scared. I was not really conversed with so I was a very internal, silent child. The only moments I got to shine is when I did something that my mom could show off to others, to give her own ego a boost. She would also hit me regularly. To make things worse, I got bullied &amp; beaten up a lot at elementary school, got molested for a longer period (approx. at age 6-8) by a guy from our neighborhood 10 years my senior and on one occasion (as far as I can remember) by my oldest brother. So I think its safe to say my youth was pretty messed up. I left my moms house to live with my then bf as soon as I was 18. By then I was no longer shy/silent but more outgoing, spontaneous, maybe a little rebellious etc. I was very restless though, so I/we would move to different houses/towns every 1,5 years or so. As soon as I felt I was settling down somewhere and people started to get to know me, Id feel like leaving and starting over someplace else. Fast forward to 25 when I settled down &amp; started a family with the father of my two sons. I was determined to be the exact opposite of my mom. I instantly loved my sons, loved to take care of them, show a lot affection etc. (still do!), but also all of a sudden felt a new kind of vulnerability, and insecurity. I couldnt pinpoint it. At first it was not that much of a problem, but as soon as the boys started going to school I noticed I was feeling awkward around parents/teachers, getting more shy etc., second guessing myself. Fast forward to today. I am now 36 and a single mom. I so far got away with sociality by faking it: Pretending Im always fine and not so insecure, always wearing a mask. Until I got sick. A few months ago I got diagnosed with a tick-borne disease, which was already giving me some symptoms over the last years but escalated 6 months ago. I lost my job, can no longer work. Im getting treatment now and slowly getting better, but Im at home 95% of my time. So I get A LOT of time to think about stuff. My illness also got me confronted again with my Nmom. She lives close and we have regular contact, but she is NOT there for me at all. I expressed needing help but she just turns me down. I started to feel alone, insecure and bitter. My awkwardness increased &amp; my social anxiety is sky high. My kids go to a very crowded school, and I get so nervous there, just so many people/noise. I cant help around at school, or join in on school trips because of this. I avoid social parent nights at school and let the boys walk home by themselves 2 times per week to give myself a break (we live 5 minutes away, theyre 8 &amp; 10 now). I cant do small talk because I dont trust people, I always feel less and ashamed and insecure and that distracts me from the conversation. Im okay with one on one conversations in a calmer environment though. Im one of those moms that waits by herself for her kids, and not join all the little groups of parents scattered around the school yard. To get to the point: I cant be the (social) mom that I want to be for my kids and its killing me I feel so messed up. I sometimes wish I could erase my past and reset my brain.  I could really use some advice on how to deal with this.. Thank you for reading. "
356,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"[Question] Neglectful NDad and childlike, volatile possible NMom - Will someone be my friend?",6,7a9kkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7a9kkm/question_neglectful_ndad_and_childlike_volatile/,2017-11-02 16:39:31,"I am a 24 year old woman who is financially independent and not living with my parents. My parents are both from east Asia and have put survival first and foremost in their lives. They do not see their style of parenting as bad in any way (they were raised similarly), but I believe it is considered neglect and abuse in America (where I was born and raised) and has caused me a lot of psychological harm. Neither of my parents possess any empathy. Every negative event that has ever happened to me (from being bullied as a child to being sexually assaulted) has been my fault, and they have treated me with nothing but callousness when I come to them with my problems. They are pathologically one-track minded when it comes to career and outward-facing success, and I often feel that their only interest is in showing off my achievements to the outside world. My younger brother and I have both struggled with depression our entire lives and their singular concern has been for us to keep our emotions under wraps and to not let it distract us from going to Ivy League schools and working at prestigious firms. I am certain that my father is a narcissist. My mother displays some narcissistic traits. I do not have many memories of my father. He was a VP (now retired) at a very large firm and from his telling has enjoyed an illustrious career of unanimously adored leadership. Throughout my childhood and adolescence, he would work all day and then retire to his room and did not seem to display much interest toward either of me or my brother. He didn't start talking to me until I graduated from college and started working, at which point we assumed a kind of manager/report kind of relationship in which he endlessly waxes poetic about his career - which he sees as worthy of writing a memoir - and attempting to apply it to my life; he has about 4-5 stories that he will morph around anything that I say, and the conversations always seem less about me and more about him receiving admiration. He has this same relationship with my brother and my mom (my mom SHOWERS him with praise). When I attempt to talk to him about things that matter to me but aren't relevant to my career (i.e. art, relationships, emotions), he tells me it is a distraction to my career and redirects the conversation back to him. I have found that the only way to communicate with him is to simply nod and give praise. My mother is extremely simple and volatile. She does not have the same self-aggrandizing tendencies as my father, so I'm not sure if she is a narcissist. Her main issue is that she is incapable of coping with the fact that I am a separate, sentient person and not merely an extension of herself which she can control. She has explosive mental breakdowns whenever I disagree with her and is threatened by my independence. Unlike my father who is entirely emotionally distant, my mom and I have had warm, affectionate moments when I am ""obedient."" However, she is extremely opportunistic about using times when my guard is down to say hurtful things that completely shatter my psyche, so I am no longer able to relax around her. I've had to cease all contact on multiple occasions. When I talk to her about my friends, hobbies, ambitions, etc, she gives me the cold shoulder. If I ever come to her in moments of vulnerability, she takes it as an opportunity to question and undermine my judgment as a whole. In heated arguments, she has expressed that she wishes I was never born among countless other terrible things and later either denies it or defends it by saying she has a right to be mad. When I cut contact, she apologizes by forcing me to validate her (i.e. ""I'm sorry you think I'm a terrible mother. I should just kill myself.""). She has yet to acknowledge that her behavior has caused me lasting harm. I have found that the only way to avoid her wrath is to only talk about very ""light"" subjects and avoid talking about my life outside of her at all costs. Last weekend, I went to my parents' house. My brother just graduated from college and has been living with them. I have always been the golden child, and he has always been the scapegoat in our household. He has been unable to find a job and has fallen into a deep, non-functional depression that seems to be bordering on suicidal. After hearing what my parents have been subjecting him to, I cried and had a panic attack. I had 2 more panic attacks in the following days. When I went to bed at night in my childhood home, I felt a sense of deep, profound loneliness I have never felt before in my life. I felt like I was the only person left alive on earth. Which brings me to my plea: Would anyone be willing to be my friend? I would LOVE to have a friend I can reach out to privately about this, and of course I'd love to be there for you too. I don't know anyone else going through this. My brother and I have a great relationship and support each other through this, but I find that he typically prefers not to talk about it. I'm so glad I found this community. Thank you sooooooo much for reading! :)"

I am shy because every time I said something completely innocent, it was attacked. Im afraid of getting hurt again, so I sabotage new friendships. Its okay to not always be happy. I have to own my emotions and experiences rather than minimizing or ignoring them. There is a way to let abuse go in one ear and out the other. Depression and anxiety are normal reactions to abuse. I cant connect without vulnerability. Freedom isnt chaos. Years ago, I stopped letting people get close because I thought if they really saw me, they would see how flawed I was. Its okay to cry. Being abused wasnt my fault and I didnt deserve it."

I'm a 30 year old college graduate living at at home with no job prospects to give context. I've always hated my mother since I was about 12. I realized her behavior wasn't normal when she once completely lost sanity on vacation and started throwing her purse and screaming. Some of the bad things she continues to do are the following. Every day of my life I walk on egg shells. 1. Scream and yell without stopping at even the slightest criticism, blame, or accusation on her even when she clearly did something. Any time I show the slightest anger at her she explodes. 2. She constantly prods me until she gets what she wants. If she wants me to come to a family event she will ask me 100 times if I want to go until I finally relent. 3. Purposely does things to push my buttons. Like always leaves her curling iron on all day but refuses to buy one with an auto shutoff. Screaming at me to apply for jobs and not ever stopping talking about it even when I beg her to stop harassing me. More on this later. 4. She doesn't support me at all emotionally. For example, I paint and have gone viral on imgur and reddit but she just scuffs it off. Any other business idea or whatnot she just doesn't give me any emotional support or encouragement. I literally can't show her any feelings because she's an awful human being and just pounces on any vulnerability. You guessed she acts like she's a god and the entire world revolves around her. 5. I graduated in 2009 and struggled severely as I had no connections and no real skill. My mother kept harrassing me every day and just kept pushing my buttons on purpose until the point where I developed an extreme illness. I went down to 100 pounds and almost died and she pretended to care but it's obvious she didn't. I'm positive that the illness is 80% psychosomatic because I went on vacation for a week by my self and felt almost entirely better. 6. I don't want to talk to her and she will physically hold my door open while I try to close it. Keep in mind I'm 30 years old. 7. She always brings up how they do so much for me and how they previously paid for my car insurance and half of my college. I didn't even have a choice on going to college or not. She also does things specifically to hold it above me. Like she always says she does my laundry like I owe her except she screams whenever I try to do it myself. She's like a hobo who washes your window without asking and expecting a payment. 8. She catastrophises everything almost every single day. I have developed severe anxiety because of it. Every day there is something that goes wrong with my dad, her family, or something. 9. She said she expects me to talk to her every day if I move out. 10. She refuses to see a therapist and screams like a lunatic if I mention it. 11. She never listens to a word I say and nothing I say holds any meaning to her. 12. If I wake up early she gets angry because she has to go to work and going to take a piss interferes with that I guess. I literally have to stay in my room until she's gone. 13. There's more but it's hard to remember or even recognize when you are so close to the problem. All of this has really messed me up. I've never been with a women because I'm honestly terrified they would be like my mother. I feel like I'm emotionally stunted because of all of this. Every time I try to apply for a job I have a severe panic attack that I'm pretty sure is conditioned from my mother screaming at me for years to keep applying for jobs. I can act like a normal cool guy but I'm pretty fucked up deep down. I feel like I might be even going crazy somewhat. I've seen around a half dozen therapists but really it all comes back to one conclusion which is to leave which is extremely difficult for me for many reasons. Hence stuck in hell... "

My mom brought up a memory that I suppressed for 24 years but once it was brought up, I was able to fully remember it. At the age of 5, my mother took me outside after a particularly bad episode with my dad, who had screamed at me to the point that I hid under the table until my mom returned from work. I remember being paralyzed with fear. Outside, she told me that I need to learn how to control my fatherthrough my own actions. My response to her was "" I am 5, he is an adult. Why am I responsible for his actions?"" An insight into myself, what 5 year old even has that insight? Anyways, she responded with ""if you don't learn, I will have to put you into foster care."" After she recanted this memory, I responded with the endless times I heard that ""this could be the straw that breaks the camels back,"" after getting yelled at or scolded for something ridiculous. Then I started crying. When I came home my husband asked how my family was doing and I told him I needed time to process what was uncovered. I cried myself to sleep. This morning, I awoke amongst an emotional haze. I feel groggy and raw and transported to that 5 year old. I told her I watched family videos and can see my funny, outgoing 5 year old self evolve into the Moody, anxious self conscious teenager. I knew that aged 5 was a pinnacle year. I've written about this when I was a teenager. I knew this was the time my whole life shifted and I began to wear mask. I told her that I am not myself around my family and she expressed her regrets and guilt of how she raised me. She expressed guilt about how this has affected my adult life and marriage. She finally took responsibility. But I don't know how to take back my life, to be able to comfort the child in me and tell her she is safe and loved. "

I've been NC with my mother for a while now. There have been good days and bad days. I'm getting better at things like mindfulness of emotions. When I start feeling overwhelmed I try and reduce that feeling into sensations in my body and imagine breathing a calm, cooling, forgiving light into myself. Since that time one of my triggers has been to do with my NSister and her son/my nephew. We go to swimming lessons each weekend and last weekend I had a go at her. She seemed to be critically observing all the faults of my nephews swimming and storing them for later. I turned to her and said ""I don't know why you are focussing on all his mistakes but you are not helping him."" She flared flailing around at which point everything kind of devolved. Basically I thought she was riding my nephew critically implying he was inadequate and I think it hit something in my history of having my sister always lurking, waiting for a vulnerability to exploit. Is this a FLEA? I could use alternate perspectives. Meanwhile what irritated me the most is that my brother in law seemed cowed(maybe not the right word) or numb to what was happening. The kicker is that I'd been undergoing schema therapy in the four years prior to now, learning how to ""speak"" to my inner child which gave me insights on what I was missing from my upbringing that I had no idea about (safety, compassion, nurturance, unconditional love, a voice). I was undergoing this therapy and my Sister at the end of the conversation used some of what I'd passed on to her to justify what she was doing. As though she was now some expert on it educating me. I looked at her and saw a monster. A monster that was happy to lap up unconditional kindness and empathy but not to extend it to others. I'm not giving her any more ammunition but the response has been to freeze me out. I worry about my nephew and I feel powerless to show him the compassion he deserves. I feel powerless and guilty and that the choice I have is to allow myself to be manipulated by my sister in order to maybe do some good or to accept that my sister controls this family and that I can't do a god damn thing about it but watch the cycle of abuse reoccur. I don't know, apologies for the rambling. A lot of things are colliding at once when I see my sister beating down a 7 year old boy and no one is stepping in to stop her."

Some incidents are public knowledge, just because of how they happened, and I didn't want the people involved to somehow identify me. I know it's a long shot but I felt kind of paranoid about how much I'd shared, so I've erased most of the personal details. But, I just want to thank you all for reading and helping to validate my experiences. So firstly, I've lurked here for a long time. I'll try my best to tag everything right and format this post how I should, but I've never actually used reddit so I'm not sure how to go about this. Sorry and thank you for your patience with me on this one! Secondly. A lot of what I've read here hits me hard; I can often relate and I'm so thankful you've all shared your experiences here. I'm just not sure if my experiences are necessarily valid- I wouldn't consider my parents to be narcissists, and was wondering if you agreed. Is there a better word? I'll share a little of my experience and see if you can help. I was born into a working class family, the youngest of two siblings. We were a functional family. My parents worked in respectable jobs despite not making much money. There was no drug or alcohol abuse- my Father was a drinker and has been throughout my life but it was never a major problem. I've never seen my Mother drunk. Ever. They're respectable, ordinary people. Nothing that would put them out there as abusive. My parents were hard workers. They both had good jobs, though not jobs that paid very well. For much of my childhood my Grandparents contributed to raising us- they took care of us before and after school, until our parents were free to collect us. They were very kind, soft people, and adored my brother and I. My Father was not soft. I remember even as a very young child that if Dad was angry, you should be worried. He was a loud guy, lots of shouting, lots of swearing, lots of what he called ""smacking"" if you were in trouble. Basically ""spanking"" I think is what most people call it. Usually to the back of the legs where it really stings, but sometimes he'd lose control and go for wherever he could reach. Sometimes with his hands, sometimes with a belt, sometimes with a spoon. He once kicked me. Sometimes he'd throw objects. Sometimes hair pulling. Depended on the level of temper. I don't know why, but the moment I started school, I got a temper. Really bad. I'd throw tantrums, kind of expected special treatment from teachers. I was a nightmare of a child. I never acted like that around my Father, wouldn't dream of it- see, the second he found out I'd been in trouble at school again, I was in big trouble at home too. Telling Dad what I'd done was the threat people used to shut me up. He was a scary guy, and I remember being frightened of the mere thought of him in a bad mood. Screaming, shouting, smacking. That was his thing. There was a childrens home in the town I grew up in. I remember the whole family being put in the car to drive me to the home on more than one occasion. The first time is clear as day as a memory. He took the whole family in the car after screaming at me for being in trouble at school. I must have been about four or five. Drove us all through the dark to this home and pulled me out of the car, started walking me up to the house. Left and got back in the car. Came back after a minute saying it was only because my brother and Mum had talked him into it that I was allowed to come home. This happened frequently. I remember one occasion when I was around seven at a school play. I kicked up a fuss over something stupid, but my Dad's reaction was way too far. He grabbed me and yelled at me, in front of the whole school, parents, teachers, other kids etc. Smacked me on the back of the legs- that's where he often did it. Sometimes he was in control and gave a few sharp slaps, one, two, three, four, five. Sometimes he totally lost control and just slapped endlessly until his temper wore out- I would always kick and scream and cry and that wound him up more. I knew though, somehow, that day that witnesses meant I was safer. I only got a tap or two and then I pulled away and tried to run. So, he grabbed me and dragged me kicking and screaming out of school, threw me in the car and drove me to the childrens home. Pulled me out. This time, someone came outside, one of the women who worked there. It was the first time we'd been in the day. He panicked, pulled me back in and drove away. I remember being so confused that day. I was in big trouble, I knew it, he spoke to me in ""that voice"" that meant I had disappointed everyone. But then he took me to McDonalds. Bought me a happy meal, but took away the toy- said I didn't deserve it. Didn't smack me again once though, all day. I think he felt guilty. After that, the trips to the childrens home stopped. The smacking didn't stop, but the threats to put me in care did. He did once pull over on the side of the road in an unfamiliar city and drive away because I was crying, but he came back again quickly. But no more abandonment threats, not really. I should note a little about my relationship with my brother here. We were very close. We only have a year between us. We grew up as best friends. He was himself a little manipulative. I was desperate to keep him happy, and spent my childhood doing what he thought was cool and what he wanted. Normal little sibling shit I think. He often framed me for things he had done- he once smashed a very expensive vase perfectly calmly in front of me, went downstairs and quietly told my Mum I had done it. He was also responsible for an accident that left me with life long scarring, so there are one or two instances that are a little abnormal, but nothing serious. However, despite it all, we were very very close and he was a good friend growing up- I have some really lovely memories of us. Anyway, eventually, our luck as a family changed. We suddenly had more money, got a bigger house in a better neighbourhood, became ""middle class"". We were a very respectable family from the outside. I feel at this point I should say that my parents were loving people for the most part. My Mum was amazing and never raised a hand to me. Despite being physically abusive, and a terrifying person at times, my Dad loved me very much, he was a funny guy, he had a great sense of humour, he went out of his way to provide for me, he would have done anything for me, despite his flaws. When he was in a good mood he was awesome. The best Dad you could ask for. Great guy. As a family we had endless material things, we went on great holidays, we spent some valuable time together and it wasn't ALL fear. And for a few years in that new house it was all okay. I mean, sometimes Dad would still swear and smack, but there was no big incident that comes to mind. I was still getting in trouble at school but much less. There was a great teacher who spoke to me like my opinion mattered and I felt valued and respected around her. She always calmed me down, so despite the occasional tantrum or call home I was good at school. However, I had at some point, developed serious anxiety. I developed OCD- though didn't get a diagnosis for years. I was obsessed with the idea my family was going to die if I didn't do certain things, and convinced I was going to get a terminal illness. I struggled to relate to other kids, but tried all the same. I was just a disaster inside and my OCD made me unrelatable. It also frustrated my parents- my rituals made my behaviour quite odd. Anyway, I held it together for a few years, made it to high school. Hadn't had a temper tantrum in years at school. The first year was horrible. I was bullied pretty badly. Told I was ""dirty"". I don't know why. I'd come home in tears most days. I remember one night crying to my Mum about being told my hair was dirty- it wasn't by the way, I washed it obsessively twice a day in a set routine thanks to my OCD, it was just damaged from the extreme routine- my Father dragged me upstairs and forcibly washed my hair himself. He would try to use the bullying against me too. If I ever got upset or raised my voice he'd tell me not to take being bullied and having no friends out on him. I was also a very skinny kid. I didn't like food, had lots of food phobias, and only really had a sweet tooth. I was force fed by my Father a lot at this point in time, or locked in the kitchen until I'd eaten my whole meal. Meal times were a horrific thing- I wasn't actively trying to avoid food, I just had a lot of phobic behaviours surrounding texture. I was also very very scared of choking. With my anxiety, I struggled to swallow. I got scared of choking a lot, and if I felt like I was about to choke I'd reflexively jump up to my feet. That would annoy my Dad to no end. He'd tell me I was going to die if I didn't eat and that made me more anxious. Anyway at some point when I was around 14 I started acting out badly at school again. I hadn't been in trouble at school for years but suddenly it was all going wrong. I had no friends but hung out with a group of kids who were just looking for trouble. They got lots of attention and notoriety and in all honesty, I wanted it too. I wanted so hard to be liked and accepted but I was always too awkward and too aggressive for no good reason. I was a horrible teenager quite suddenly. I had an attitude with teachers, got into fights and arguments constantly, and got calls home frequently. Sometimes I'd get sent home early. When I got in trouble at school I was shunned at home. I was totally the black sheep of the house, and I knew it. Sometimes my Dad would still smack me but I was getting bigger so it was rarer. He'd just scream at me and mock me and bring up my failings at every turn instead. At this point, by the way, my relationship with my brother was non-existent. He was very embarrassed by my behaviour and I don't blame him one bit. I was well known at school for being a nasty little shit. He stayed out of my way and was I think ignored by our parents quite a lot because of my acting out. I feel guilty about that. My behaviour took up a lot of their time. Also, at some point, my Dad started trying to pit us all against each other. I don't remember when this started, but at one point he started saying that my Mum liked my brother better. I didn't believe it at all, but I latched on to that and repeated it every time he said it. It was a strange common ground I had with my Dad and I liked to pull it out as a trump card in arguments with my Mum. I don't know why- even at the time I didn't believe it was true. But my Dad still does stuff like that to this day. He'll tell me he thinks my Mum is boring or has an unfavourable habit or something. These days I obviously am old enough to know not to agree just for approval. But he literally does it right in front of her and tries to make people agree. It's a weird habit, but I'm getting off topic. I was in so much trouble at school they referred me to a psychologist. Sometimes my parents would come in for meetings, and they'd sit there like good respectable people and list off their grievances with me, and I'd feel like a burden. My teachers liked my parents a lot. They really seemed like good people. One weekend after a bad week at school I got into an argument with my Dad. He smacked me in a way that felt out of control for the first time in a very long time. Monday morning, a teacher I got on well with asked me how my weekend had been. I explained that it hadn't been good. At this point in time my Nan was dying of a terminal illness, my Grandfather had recently died, and home life was bad. I mentioned that I'd argued with my Dad and that he'd ""hit me"". I realised I'd made a huge mistake once my teacher repeated ""hit me"" back to me. I suddenly felt horrible. Really sick and nervous, really guilty. I tried to explain that it wasn't like it sounded, he hadn't hit me with a closed fist, etc. I begged him not to report it, but they called social services. Somehow, my Dad got out of it. I don't know how to this day, but I was sent home as normal. I went home that night with a pit in my stomach. My Mother was furious. She was so angry I've never seen her that angry- they could have both lost their jobs, and that was something she reminded me of constantly. I apologised, she didn't want to hear it. I went upstairs and stayed in my room. At some point I managed to work up the nerve to go downstairs and get a drink. My Dad was in the kitchen and spoke to me in very short clipped tones. He said something along the lines of ""If you think that's being hit you don't know what being hit is. You don't know abuse."" It's probably important to mention that his Father was extremely abusive, if the stories his siblings have told me are true. I felt awful, I felt sick and guilty and wrong, I felt like an attention seeker. He called me an attention seeker all the time and I suddenly felt it more than ever. Other people had it worse, we had all this nice stuff, and sometimes, most of the time, they were good parents. I was the one who got in trouble and made them stressed and made my Mum cry, and I was the burden, I was the cause of all the trouble. I felt horrible. He didn't speak to me for six months, and even after that our relationship was strained for years. I felt like a stranger in their home. I was in more trouble at school. Eventually I was expelled. I got more help with mental health services. Got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and eventually OCD. My Dad thought that was all stupid. He made me feel guilty for getting help, like I didn't deserve it, like I wasn't really sick, or not sick enough. He was always quite mocking of my illnesses. I felt like my behaviour was my fault and still sort of do- I chose to act out all the time, I was very aware that what I was doing would get me in trouble etc. I consciously adopted this sort of ""I'm a slacker and I don't care!"" image because I thought people would like it. I was desperate to be liked by someone. Anyway, I'm rambling. I should add by the way, my Mum was supportive through all of this. She came to all my appointments and always checked up on me and cried with me and listened to me, she was great. Anyway, eventually I got back into school. I struggled through. Got a few friends who weren't such a bad influence. Still got into a little trouble here and there. Still felt unwelcome at home. My Mother acted as the peace keeper between my Dad and I. It was unfair on her to have to do that. As embarrassing as it is to look back on, I started having temper tantrums again. Sometimes physical fights with my Dad. It was a teenager kicking and screaming like a toddler, it was embarrassing and totally stupid, but I was desperate for something. My Dad would film it sometimes, not sure why. He started threatening to call social services and put me away again. I actually wanted him to at this point, really encouraged him, because I thought that was something solid I could be angry at him for. I felt like everything else was my fault and not his. It probably was, I don't know. My Dad has this way about him, where he wants the last word in an argument, and he chooses something that's going to make you angry. He makes you angry, says a trigger phrase, picks on something sensitive, and then YOU'RE the bad guy for flipping out. That was often the cause of these tantrums. Something mocking about being depressed, or having no friends, or being an attention seeker. He'd say it, and I'd lose it. Or he'd say it enough times over enough days that I couldn't cope anymore. He'd get me angry too. And then, if I swore or slammed a door or something, that was all the justification for pinning the blame totally on me. My Mum would come to patch things up for him- she'd always make his excuses, and she'd say stuff like ""but you can't swear at him/slam doors/have a temper..."" as if that justified the way he'd pick and pick at me for days sometimes just waiting for a reaction. And I was always the one to say sorry. I was always sorry. He still does stuff like this but I react less and less as I mature. Anyway. I dragged myself through school. Passed my exams- turns out I'm smart, I did really well. Took a few years out to get over an eating disorder (I turned to binge eating for comfort and eventually developed bulimia) and a few suicide attempts out of the way. I joined university at 20. I'm in my second year now. I'm considering returning to therapy to clear up some old issues, but I feel like I'm doing good. I get on well with my family these days. My Grandparents died a long time ago so the nice soft side are gone, but my Mum is still a gentle soul who just means well and wants us all to be happy. My brother, unfortunately is currently struggling with addiction to some hard drugs. He's the family disappointment now. My Dad complains about him to me every time I see him. I feel guilty but I kind of like that. Being the good kid. My Dad gaslights me frequently- downplays his past behaviour, outright denies events I know for a fact happened, confirmed by others. When we talk about difficulties of the past as a family, he either jokes about things that were actually traumatic, downplays it, or says I was a difficult child. He says I dwell too much on the past. Maybe I was. Maybe I do. My behaviour as a child and teenager was very difficult. I can excuse myself as a child. I didn't know any better, and recall being frightened of my Father in a way no child should be. He often lost control when smacking me and it was painful, frightening and humiliating. He often spoke down to me, gaslit me, mocked me, etc. He was loud, aggressive, and unnerving. As a teenager however, I struggle. I made the conscious choice to do a lot of bad things. I was an asshole. I couldn't control my temper when he provoked it, but I could control my behaviour at school etc. I made my Mother cry as a teenager, very often, and she didn't deserve that. She was just a peace maker. My behaviour was extreme, to the point that mental health services and even the police were involved at one point. No one ever thought it was my parents fault- it all seemed to be mine. I wish, more than anything, my Father would acknowledge that his role in my life hasn't been perfect and apologise for some of the things he did wrong. So... what do you think? Am I just a shitty person? Is he a narcissist or do you have a better word for him? Was it my behaviour that drove him to it? Am I just overreacting? Do you think it was his parenting that made me so unstable or just bad luck? Because, my Dad doesn't seem like a narcissist from how I understand the word. He's very human at times, has this vulnerability to him, he comes across as a lost puppy sometimes and I pity him more often than not. Deep down he has this heart and deep down he's a wonderful guy. He just so happens to have these terrible flaws and has done some awful things. I understand that human beings are a mix of good and bad. I know that. I just struggle to pin him as a bad guy at heart, even though he's put me through hell at times. I'm sorry this was so long but I've done a lot of thinking about my life lately and the reasons I am the way I am, and how to move forward, and I want to feel some closure. I'm grateful if you read this whole rambling mess. Thank you. "
364,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"I would like to post this quote here by u/Nerrolken about why abuse leaves so much more trauma than just regular pain, in hopes that it answers som questions some of you might be struggling with (I know it did for me) [TW: Rape]",30,6wq5fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6wq5fd/i_would_like_to_post_this_quote_here_by/,2017-08-29 19:37:16,"&gt; An example that can help illustrate the effect: why is it that torture so often gives people horrific emotional damage, when a similarly-painful (or even more-painful) car accident often doesn't? It's because it's not about the pain, it's about you being forced to recognize your own inability to protect yourself. You can't make them stop hurting you, there's nothing you can do to control your own fate and wellbeing and possibly even survival, and the FULL realization of that is what does the damage. &gt; Rape is similar. It's not about the pain or the immediate trauma (though those can both be significant), it's about being forced to recognize your own powerlessness and lack of control. The rapist forces you to acknowledge that they can control your own body, and hurt you or defile you or do whatever they want, at their own whim, and you have no control at all. This is also why rape victims are often still traumatized even if they weren't seriously injured or even conscious for the event, like when the victim is drugged beforehand: it's not about the pain, it's about the realization of vulnerability and your own powerlessness to protect yourself, even if you only experience it when you wake up hours later. &gt; Rape is, both literally and allegorically, a form of torture. It's the deliberate infliction of pain and trauma on a helpless (or defeated) victim, and the forced recognition of the victim's own powerlessness is what separates it from similarly painful or traumatic experiences. - u/Nerrolken URL"

Just thought to mention this song here, it honestly has brought me so much peace. I've had so many songs throughout the years that's helped me deal with my feelings dealing with my Narc, the bad memories, the terrible ghost emotions of not fully remembered nightmares/flashbacks...so far none have them have been ""positive/progressive"". My favorite go to songs were Christina Perri's ""Human"", Linkin Park's ""Numb"", and others that I can't think of right now. They helped me healthily let my vulnerability out, but they never left me feeling positive afterwards. Kesha's ""Praying"" is one of the first songs that help me work through my emotions and leaves me feeling good along with that cathartic soreness that working through old wounds cause. I honestly am not religious in the slightest, but the meaning of the song is more than just ""praying"". Just thought to mention it. If anyone else has songs that help them work through old emotions please let me know. I'd love to expand my collection :). A big hug out to all you internet strangers. "

Despite feeling all this, i still wasted money to distract myself but was going into a deeper whole. It was a catch 22. I was too afraid to go get mental health help and my mom had convinced me all my life to not feel my feelings or that it was impossible for me to have mental issues I was very unaware for the longest time what was going on and didn't realize I was suffering from N abuse from multiple people all my life contributing to my breakdown I'm back home and not in university this year because I haven't paid last years tuition and failed classes and I'm trying to use mental health extenuating circumstances to get out of it ( not really ""get out of"" it is the truth..) but in my city it's like a year wait for a psychiatrist and every doctor I've talked to said you won't get it unless I'm like about to kill myself but the university needs proof of my issues so I don't know what to do.. I'm thinking of going over the border to Quebec or if I can use my university's psychiatrist services if i go back to Montreal for a day, this is something my mom also berates me and guilts me for ""why didn't you use their services if you were having problems"" well I didn't KNOW you've taught me to dissociate all my life ( im currently on probation for failing and not paying tuition but I do have my student card so I could have access, idk if that has been suspended too) My mental breakdown plays perfectly into my N moms guilt trap... she saw my mental state and vulnerability and guilt when she came to help me move back and basically berates me everyday, tries to get my brother to gang up on me, says the most horrible things l. It's given her full reign to go completely sociopath, awful because she feels what I did is some ""attack"" on her somehow and since I'm not in university and not paying bills she abuses her authority to an extreme Her tactics are usually 1) Try to me I convince me I am a selfish pig at the core with no mental issues and I'm just an evil bitch, as if I woke up one day and decided ""I wanna waste 15k and ruin my life"" 2) When I call out her abuse, she calls ME crazy, retarded, stupid, autistic etc... 3) Berates me for not doing anything but ironically by berating me she knows this will instill even more insecurity so I will be less motivated and she kills any hope I have so she can repeat her abuse cycle Do you see how one and two contradict ? It's whatever fits her agenda that day. I have been working but I have been wasting all of the money because I am so depressed and don't care about life and feel too anxious, insecure to deal with my debt and i know at this point I cannot blame everything on my n mom but I am compulsively addicted to spending... idk what to do. There's nowhere I can go. No shelter. No friends or family They only way my life can turn around is seeking professional help but of course there's very little of that available. "

Morty's father bears a striking resemblance to mine. Pathetic, desperate for attention, and annoying. The only thing that's missing are bipolar temper tantrums And a domineering presence. The second I met that man I knew my life was going to be difficult. He wasn't going to make it easy for any of us in spite of all the opportunities to change his ways. Instead of being a man and trying to succeed in life, He kept the same shitty little job for nearly 30 years and spent every waking moment of our lives reminding us how much he hated us. He didn't need to out right say it it was implicit in his actions he is the most childish man I have ever encountered in my life. Nobody that profoundly stupid and irritating should've been around children. I got in trouble for things that didn't even make sense. I got in trouble because he was clumsy and dropping pots and pans in the kitchen, and actually the thing you do when that happens is Yell att your kids to come into the kitchen so you can take your frustration out on them over being a clumsy moron. I gotten trouble because he lost his clothes and couldn't be bothered to take care of his own things. Did you think I would forget about all of that you stupid piece of human garbage? Did you take my quietness, my timidness for acceptance? Do you have any idea what you've taken from me? All the other kids at school looked at me like I was an alien because I didn't want to hang out with them, it wasn't because I didn't like them it was because I didn't know how. I had been raised to believe that vulnerability just gets you in fucking trouble. And nine times out of 10 that was true it home. How dare you put me in such an infantile state, God help you if the tables were turned you sanctimonious son of a bitch. I would never have done the same thing in your position, because I'm a man and I know how to take care of myself without blaming other people.

368,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Surprise visit by my Ns,4,6zz7np,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6zz7np/surprise_visit_by_my_ns/,2017-09-14 11:44:32,"Hi RBNs, first off, I am so thankful for this community. I don't think I would have handled this surprise visit so well without thinking of you. Some background info. I've been nc with my nparents and nsister for 4 years. I was diagnosed with bipolar around 8 years ago. I worked hard with a psychiatrist to get to a point where I no longer need medication or regular doctor visits. During that period it was established that my triggers were my N's. So on the advice of my Dr, i went Nc. It was hard, but it was a good decision. As I said, I'm no longer on meds (drs advice). It's been almost 3 years without an episode and even better news, I'm pregnant with our first baby. Since falling pregnant, i have had the urge to conact my ns. I miss my family and wish I could talk to my mum. The rbn side of me knows she isn't the mother I miss, she is an N, but that's not saying contact hasn't been weighing on my mind a lot. During this pregnancy, my husband and I have dealt with two major losses in our lives. Loved ones that we were extremely close to. So the thought of contact has been pushed aside as we couldn't deal with another loss if things went bad. Yesterday, my world was turned upside down. My nsister and ndad turned up at my house. Husband was at work and I was home alone. I can't even begin to explain how many thoughts were running through my head at once. The main one ""what would rbn say?"". Don't answer, don't answer!!! But, I did. The emotional side got the better of me. The moment I had my hand on the door I saw the shitshow that was going to happen. Surprisingly, they were polite. Started by respecting boundaries. Asked if it was ok to hug. After invitinging them in they asked if I was sure. So, i gave them an oppertunity. I had my walls up. I was neutral. Not completely cold, but more shock and caution. My nsister tried bringing up the situation and I changed the subject. She brought a present and I said it wasn't necessary. She was happy to do it. We spoke civilly. They asked about the pregnancy ans how I was doing and I gave them curt answers. I even offered to show them thw baby room. Thwy were excited to see it. That's when it started. Nsister wants back in my life (not husband's). I replied with ""i feel the current sotuation might be best"". She had a reasonable response although the all too familiar n smirk did glimmer. We sat back down and I knew i should have avoided the topic, but I stupidly continued. I used the important I feel statements that harboured no blame. As i spoke I could see the agitation flare in my ndad's face. I could see it coming. I explained my progress and acknowledged the decision to go nc hurt a lot of people and i take responsibility for that, but I had to do what was best for me. I needed to look after my family and get better for the both of us. Ndad took his aggressive stance and began to fire at me. ""You don't want us in your life? Do you know how nasty that is? You are so selfish."" I stopped him there and asked him not to twist my words or put blame on me. I admitted that I don't know what I wanted. I love them and miss them terribly, but I need to think of my health. H started again and i stopped him. With RBN in my head i said ""this isn't the right time and I do not feel comfortable with this confrontation. I do not want to feel attacked"". He stood up and said ""i dont want to be here. I want to go, i dont deserve this. From now on, consider me dead to you. I'm dead as far as you are concerend. You couldn't even ask me how I'm doing since we have been here"". I replied as calmly as i could ""don't say things you will regret. I am still in shock that you are even here. I don't even really know what to say."" With that my sister calmed him down. He sat back down but all i saw was anger in his eyes the whole time. They left shortly after. They both gave me a hug and told me they loved me. I said nothing in return. I couldn't out of fear of crying, showing them my vulnerability, wanting them to stay and maybe because I wanted to hurt them a little too. It got me most because ndad cried. I don't know him to cry. I've seen it maybe twice in my life. After they left, I broke. I cried so hard I couldn't breathe. One of the people that passed away was a father figure to me. At his funeral my husband and I got a letter from him. In it he addressed my heartache of my family and had said that he always considered me his daughter. With that letter in mind my ndad's words crippled my heart. The RBN side of me knows what i should do. - Stay NC - Ndad just proved nothing has changed and it never will. - oppertunity was given and he fucked it right up. - total N behaviour - how dare they do this while im pregnant and in a vulnerable state - if i wasn't pregnant they probably wpuld never have come over. And so on.... But then, i kind of want to give them an oppertunity. I am vulnerable but I miss them. Surprisingly, my nsister was rational. She saw my perspective and reasoned with me. She respected boundaries. She was actually the one I didn't want to be in contact with initially. I'm not saying she changed, i still saw a glimmer of manupulation here and there. The thing is, I've changed. I stood up for myself. I stopped the arguments without it going too badly. I managed the situation in a way that I have never done before. I can't comprehend 100% nc with never ever the possibility of reconciliation. That hurts too much. I never thought it would be forever. Thinking about that now, hurts. I'm not sure where to go from here. Do i give them oppertunity for vlc? Or do i stick with nc? Is LC a possibilty? If i opt for vlc/lc do i invite them to the baby shower? How much damage can they cause in public? Do i wait until after the baby is born and make sure i don't go through ppd? I just don't know what to do. I'm torn in a few different directions and i would really appreciate different persepctives. Thank you for reading, sorry it was so long. "
369,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"My dad, the local celebrity",346,6o8h7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6o8h7j/my_dad_the_local_celebrity/,2017-07-19 23:33:01,"I just discovered this forum and its been amazing to read so many of the stories here. Growing up, my dad and I did not have a good relationship. I always thought the issue was that my parents divorce impacted our ability to bond. I have always been close with my mom, so my dad frequently told me that she brainwashed me against him (Youll see when you're older!). I gave him the benefit of the doubt that maybe there was a hint of truth there. Well, I am now a 30 year old man, and all I can see is that my dad is a full-blown narcissist. He openly talks about how he is a star and when he walks into a room everyone looks at him, how his name sells newspapers,"" how he is only meant to associate with other VIPs, how waiters in restaurants can intuitively sense his importance, etc. I always took this stuff in jest, until the last few years when hes confided in me some of the more personal thoughts that go on in his mindand I can see that the way he processes situations is truly warped. He believes most everyone in our city is jealous of his success; he frequently attributes ulterior motives to people (like believing one of his employees made up a family members death to get out of work); he thinks that most women are interested in him romanticallyincluding those 40 years younger and lesbiansand he creates elaborate plans for how he will decline their advances when they make a move; he strategizes how he will gracefully turn down future requests from family for money or connections - almost cherishing the prospect of having the upper hand and putting someone in their place. I believe he is delusional. I didnt realize until recently how abnormal my dads behavior is, especially as it relates to me. Whenever I had accomplishments growing up he would congratulate me and say that he was proud, but he would subtly make the accomplishment about himself. When I got my first job out of college, his immediate response was to ask me whether the hiring manager (whom he didnt know) asked about HIM during the interview. When I was 26 and a fully independent working professional, he told me that he was getting me a new pair of glasses because I got sick of the way the other ones look on you. These are just a couple examples that come to mind. I am able to get along fine with him when Im in a good place in my own lifeand by that I mean we can have superficial conversations about the weather, food, etc.but lately Ive been dealing with health issues and work stress, and I just dont have the mental bandwidth. I realized that any small display of vulnerability can be exploited by him, so I have chosen to temporarily cut contact. Anyone else notice that youre less able to deal with narcissist parents at certain times or while dealing with other life stressors? When life is going well, Ive learned to almost see him as a joke, but when life is bad, his behavior takes a toll on me."

Perhaps it was when you screamed at me, telling me to pull my head in and nobody likes me. Perhaps I should have walked out the door when you bruised my face, or when I found myself surrounded by glass. Perhaps when it was when you made me sick by recounting the divorce like you tried to protect me. You have never protected me. Maybe it was when the next day bragged about how you used me as a weapon in the divorce, and somehow tied to make it sound like 8 was old enough to deal with that. Perhaps it was when you looked at me with a smile and told me I was stuck, and used it to remind me that you can't count on friends. You were trying to use my fear that I'd been left locked up in this house alone. Well, mother dearest, I'm not afraid anymore. They can leave and I'll still be strong enough to walk out that door. Just you watch me. I know that watching me be okay is scary to you, because we know that if we go head to head I will win. Always. Perhaps that's why you always wanted to destroy me. You just forgot that if I got through it, I'd know that I can survive. I can survive you. And I win because I am strong. And I am strong in sometimes the simplest of ways. I will not let you harden me into cruelty, even if it'll protect my vulnerability. I will take blow after blow and still see the kindness, the absolute beauty of the world. Every single person is so complicated and there is good and bad in everyone. Even if I only get the bad in every person, I'm not going to let it win out in me. I'm the only one I can control. I'm playing such a dangerous game at the moment. I have to be so mentally healthy for work. But here, if i come home like that, you'll tear me apart. And right now I have to take it, and it's very hard to be mentally healthy and complacent. I've lost the last three rounds in this messed up game you make me play. I know you realised when you finally stuck that fear, when you finally made me flinch. Maybe you heard me crying and screaming that night, still stuck in nightmares I can't get out of. Still waking with bruises I didn't go to sleep with. It's so hard to make me stay still. I'm playing a dangerous game between how much I can take without breaking, and how much I can not destroy myself without finally saying enough. I want out. I want to learn how okay I can be. I'm still too afraid of being you. I am very concerned by the idea that I'm bad for someone, that I'm more harm then good. I worry if my actions have harmed. I am always anxious that I'm putting my needs above someone else's. Spend so much time thinking about if I'm being like you. If I'm a problem for someone. I know some of that is also I still am negatively biased towards myself. Still too quick to diminish my good and focus on the bad. Too quick to put myself down, to ""put myself in my place"" like you always did. Too quick to assume I'm not important to people. But I'm working on that. If I was on my own, I'd be already gone. But I have a little sister and a little cousin. And they're mine. I have to help them. And what happens if I fail? I have no safety net. I wouldn't be able to offer them anywhere to go. I promised my cousin somewhere to run when she's old enough. An out. I see so much of me in her. She's in a much better position than I was, thank goodness. But I still see it in her eyes, in the way she holds herself like she's walking on eggshells, the way she is quiet like she's not important enough to speak, the way she talks about parents like you should expect them to hurt you. I know recently they were talking about depression, suicidal. I know she's on her own in the worst possible way. And there is only so much I can do to help her. She is younger than I was before I gave up, if I can just prevent that from happening, let her know someone is here and someone will help her out. I can't let her become hurt in the crossfire. I can't leave and let her face the consequences. I don't doubt they'd use her to hurt me. I don't know how to play my cards. Do I leave and start working on figuring out all the ways I need to heal? Do I risk failing? Or do I stay a bit longer and get a bit more money behind me? Do I buy to create more stability or do I rent? How long do I wait? Can I risk my mental health? But I can't risk the others. For once I don't know how to play or my way forward. I don't know what to do. "
371,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Finding happiness,1,6r5cmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6r5cmj/finding_happiness/,2017-08-03 02:28:56,"I was reasonably happy during early childhood in Croatia. I don't know if it was below average but it was more than okay. After moving to Canada my mother became much worse, and I lost that. I had gone so far from happiness that I forgot what that was like and was basically just forcing myself to do things to finish university. I rediscovered happiness through drugs. It was very quickly obvious that the good states I was finding were not some unique drug thing, but similar to good states from my childhood which I had stopped experiencing and even forgotten about. I should try to define what I consider happiness a bit, even though it's hard. Feeling good about something particular (like something you bought) or feeling good from some pleasant sensory input (like eating ice cream) isn't really happiness. Instead, happiness is an overall state. My perception and especially visual perception has various feelings associated with it. When I'm happy there are more of these feelings, they're more vivid, and generally more pleasant. That's what actually makes life enjoyable. This is easiest to observe in an objectively fairly neutral setting, like how I feel about a fairly average street. Though happiness is a complex composite experience consisting of various elements, so it's best to not assume you understand it or know all the pieces. It took a while to figure out how to access happiness states similar to what I remember from my childhood while sober. The general strategy is to think less and come more into the present moment, focusing more on sensory input from my current surroundings and body. Running a continuous inner monologue of thoughts is escapist, it takes away from enjoyment of the present moment, and it generally causes a sort of unpleasant tension. It's a bad habit and not very useful. More useful thoughts arise spontaneously when I'm not continuously thinking. I've read and heard about cognitive therapy, and friends recommended it but that sort of thing never worked for me. I don't even want to discuss that anymore. It's more like my thoughts are a result of my mental state than like they are causing it. If my thoughts are drawn in negative directions, that's more of a sign that I need to do something to improve my state than a sign that I need to just deal with the thoughts themselves. Dealing with thoughts actually might be an okay strategy if I'm in closer to the border between feeling bad and good, but I guess when I'm having this problem I'm too far from feeling good and need other methods. It's also important to figure out how to have good experiences, such as what I enjoy and planning to make it better. This can make a big difference. Seems like physical activity also helps, but for me it's always incidental to being in nature or gardening or something. I'm not really motivated to work out just for the sake of it, and not currently interested in fighting that. One thing that's both important for happiness and challenging is socializing. I very rarely have satisfying offline social experiences. This draws me online for socializing, which generally seems to make me feel worse. Yet despite knowing that I'm still drawn online because it provides some elements of happiness which I cannot reliably get offline. Offline socializing can have an anti-escapist effect which leads to difficult and painful experiences if I was doing okay before by myself. It seems my biggest obstacle to offline socializing is a depressed state, lacking the positive energy to put into genuine socializing. I can take that for granted or escape from it, but in that state I can only socialize in a rudimentary mechanical way which tends to not be beneficial. It's clear that simply suppressing anxiety is not sufficient, and a lot of the anxiety I feel is from the low emotional state and associated emotional misalignment with the desired interaction plus increased vulnerability. One thing that still surprises me is that I don't feel very good about accomplishments. Like after being away on vacation and hiking a lot I noticed how I could run and it wouldn't be unpleasant because I was in better shape, but that was just kind of cool, and not really a big deal. Similarly, losing weight wasn't really a big deal. In general, true happiness seems to mostly be related to the nature of present moment experience, and not to objective circumstances There really doesn't seem to be much of a persistent mood. A lot of what seems like persistent mood is a result of feedback loops reinforcing a certain mental state and holding me in that state. Like one pattern is if I feel upset about something, then go online to escape, and spend, feel worse due to spending a lot of time online and feel more drawn toward spending time online because of that. That feedback loop is what keeps me in a bad state then. It can be difficult to break out of the pattern but a better state may be surprisingly easy to get to after I break out. One key element of happiness is being aware of my body. Being online and/or being very thought focused tends to block that out. It's kind of like blocking out body awareness blocks out happiness energy. I'm posting here in case there are common elements in how childhood abuse and trauma puts one in an unhappy state and others can relate and/or learn from it."

Ok, then!",10,6tg052,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6tg052/lets_agree_to_disagree_ok_then/,2017-08-14 02:21:04,"Not exactly sure if the story belongs here, but here it goes. Dick's parents where narcissists and Dick has become a budding one himself... The story starts with me (Me), my SO (SO), and my brother in law (Dick) video calling (he lives a ways away) enjoying a Saturday morning together. Things start to turn sour after SO starts to tease me in front of Dick about something. I (playfully) push her shoulder to say ""stop teasing me"", but she's off-balance and stumbles out of the frame. I'm a little bewildered, but she is ok, she's doesn't fall, and she is laughing because she feels silly about it. We go on to enjoy the rest of the call, I check in with her in a quiet moment to ask what happened, and she explains she was off-balance when it happened. I nod, we move on, and we go on with the call and our day. I get a text from Dick the next day wanting to talk for minute. I say ok. He proceeds to confront me on the push - that's fine, if he is concerned about it, he should raise the concern and I respect that. Problem is, he goes way beyond confrontation, and without asking any questions, begins to berate me about what my state of mind (what I was thinking and feeling in the moment) must have been, and because I'm a vulnerable type, and not very quick on my feet, I start to agree (even though I initially didn't agree about what he was saying about my state of mind). Anyways, when the dust settles a few days later I realize he was completely wrong about my state of mind, and that the incident was just an accident, which can happen when you push (lesson learned), no matter your state of mind. I get angry because I feel mind-raped/gaslighted. Essentially, I realized that my inner-reality/vulnerability had been invaded by someone else and twisted) I try to reason with him, but he misunderstands me to the point of absurdity. Since he is unwilling to acknowledge the effect he has had on my mind, we decide a measured response would be to keep our child from Dick until our child is of the age where our child has a firm grasp on their inner-reality. He's all about agreeing to disagree in relationships and, in my opinion, gets a high off of the feeling of power he gets when he just doesn't give a shit about what people think about him. So while he is not happy about limited contact with his niece, I've decided to do exactly as he wants, and not cut him out of my life, but agree to disagree with him. So while I've settled on some boundaries with him myself, I plan to do exactly as he has asked, and stay in contact which I'm sure will constantly remind him that he cannot have contact with my child because of his poor behaviour. Just needed to get that off my chest. "

And TBH I'm getting really freaking annoyed with my therapist because she has really failed to offer me any concrete advice other than ""just keep at it, just keep trying."" I have been seeing her for the past 2.5 years originally due to being cheated on in the relationship I was in with an alcoholic (potentially n). Therapy transitioned into discussing and navigating family issues, as therapy does, and a LOT manifested about my n-mom (also alcoholic). So having given a bit of back story, I'm currently being severely plagued and carrying around a shitty burden of feeling like I'm forever the bad guy. I think I almost force myself into situations where I become the bad guy (my therapist uses the phrase ""I'm loyal to that role, I'm loyal to those messages in my head"" or whatever). So this all brings me to a current conundrum I'm facing. I haven't been able to have another relationship (or have sex for that matter) with a guy since I was cheated on. I've had sex with my ex because, you know, nobody's perfect (please don't make me the bad guy here) and I am scared as shit to move on and open up another can of fucking vulnerability worms. Ok - so I JUST started seeing this one guy (we have been on one date) who is in a wheelchair because of an accident leaving him paralyzed more than 10 years ago. He is a successful attorney and seems like a nice enough guy. HOWEVER... and I explained this to my therapist... I KNOW that this is setting me up to be the bad guy. If I so much as say the wrong thing or break things off, of course I am going to look like a POS. I feel like this is just more trouble waiting to happen. We are supposed to go out again tonight, and I'm totally caught in my head. I'm trying my darndest not to be, but I just feel like I will look really BAD if I don't want to be with someone because he: - cannot have sex properly (and I don't even want to ask because it seems like I will be a POS for asking) -have kids? -just do normal stuff -help with chores, etc. I've had a pretty tough life where I've worked my ass off and I don't really want to solely carry on life's burdens alone -always be ""second string"" to him and his issues (this is a big one - I'm very cautious of being selfish, but I'm also cautious about someone else's life stuff always trumping mine. Imagine, if anything were to ever go wrong, it would ""never"" be as bad as being paralyzed. My feelings and issues would pale in comparison to his... and kinda rightly so... but still, who the hell wants to live life being a servant?? Guys, I'm so scared here, if I'm being honest. I don't think I'm strong enough to always come in second place to someone else. And I say this because my feelings and thoughts were never validated growing up, and the absolute last thing I want to do is put myself in that position in marriage. I know I should probably just go on the second date and see where it goes, but, but, I need some validation here. Is it really too much to ask for an able-bodied partner through life?"

Today is the day. Im a golden child with an N bio dad who left at 12 years old and does not associate or acknowledge my existence. I have an N step dad who proclaims to have magical/spiritual powers that he uses to help manipulate (helps people) situations and a mother who is completely and utterly committed to the notion that she did her best as a parent and works herself to death for the betterment of the family. I played my golden child role to the fullest of my existence. I used menial tasks like chores, yard work, ironing clothes, saying yes to everything as a means of gaining favor and making up for the shortcomings I had as a child who felt unworthy to stick around for. I had to develop a sense of worth and belonging by accomplishing noticeable and recognizable things. Its the only way I thought I could be held in esteem. The only way I would be worthy of love and praise. And as I have grown older now I put myself in a lifestyle where I dont take ownership for my own condition. Ive relied on my parents and outside input to dictate my wants and needs and I did it without resistance or thought until about 18 months ago. That was when a week before Christmas my n step dad told me that my girlfriend could not come down to Christmas with me. He said somebody like that is not allowed near my little brothers or my family. He said I needed to end it. I was crushed and worse off I did as I was told. I broke up with a woman I loved because it was the easy and ordained thing to do. It was the single most cowardly and horrible thing Ive ever done. A month after, after much talking and reconciling, we got back together and we have been together since. But issues still linger. Im still the golden child. I barely talk with my family these days but I still embody and portray this golden child through my GF instead of my family. Im trying to be vulnerable and allow myself to feel the hurt for growth to take place and Im looking to take that step. Without that step, I will be stuck in golden child role forever. This turned into more of a rant than anything, but if anyone can relate Id love to hear it. Thank you all for your empathy, vulnerability, and kindness as exemplified on this site. "

Also, I tend to obscure my emotional vulnerability with overinflated language so I apologize if this is a little... didactic.] For the second time, my Nmother sent me a string of nasty text messages after I spoke to my EStepfather. The messages came in a set of four, just like last time. They started with ""I know you don't have the balls to reply,"" ""I know you hate me but I can't possibly fathom why,"" ""why do you keep trying to ruin my life,""and (after some delightfully Narc-y accusations) ended with ""Just pretend you don't know me and leave it at that."" ""Just pretend you don't know me."" Those words stick with me. I just cannot process them. She was young when she had me, and I know she resents her lost teen and college years. She absolutely hates that I am a living reminder of her age. What bothers me, and I mean really bothers me, is that me pretending I don't know her is actually what she wants. Our mutual disownment of each other would satisfy her because she could 1) continue to pretend I don't exist and 2) justify it by putting the responsibility on me. Some part of me wishes I actually didn't know her. Some part of me hates her for everything she's ever done or failed to do as a parent. Some part of me wants to keep fighting until everyone sees who she really is. Some part of me wants to give up and have a family again. But mostly I just feel lost and violently, bottomlessly lonely. My Estepfather won't speak to me anymore. He leaned on me while she was gone, but the second she came back he took her side. In that way, he made me the ""problem"" just like she does. I can't see my siblings without dealing with one or both of my parents, and so I operate generally without a family unit. My Nmother may as well keep them in a jar on her shelf, I have so little access to them. I'm lucky to have my SO of seven years, my amazing grandparents, and an amazing group of friends and colleagues. However, these recent texts from my Nmother have activated my defensive response of complete emotional withdrawal. I see myself from outside of my body being a jerk to my SO and friends, but I don't stop because it would be easier if they hated me too and I could just live completely alone without the fear that all of my relationships are fabricated like a secret second life. ""Just pretend you don't know me."" I wouldn't have a reason to tell the truth about who my Nmother is. I wouldn't have a reason to try and protect my siblings from her. I would give up the ghost and disappear, one less obstacle in her obsessively crafted Narc fantasy. I would give up what's left of my family. Most of all, though, I would do her the kindness of accepting my nonexistence. I think pretending is more than just a game to Narcs. To them, it's more like a ritual. Pretend and you will prosper, pretend and you'll be happy, pretend and everything is fine. Pretend the pain away. Well, fuck you, Nmother. I'm done pretending. I exist, I know you, and I will never play your games again. "

It was quite a hard lie to pass, though, and she was already mad, so there was no stopping her. I got out of the car before she could start telling me the usual shit again, thankfully... but she called me when I was on the bus. It was the same routine as every other time. ""Why are you such a deceitful brat"", ""I told you to do that kind of thing once you were out of the house"", etc, etc. She also said she'd pull me out of school and a bunch of other stuff that made me want to crack my skull open. Nothing I wasn't used to, but a damper on my day nevertheless. Skip to the end of school (I did everything I could to stay there as late as possible. Going home wasn't my best option since I didn't particularly feel like being offered a suicide pact again.) I called her to tell her I'd be late, and she ended up telling me I would have to talk to her about why I was self-harming. That terrified me more than anything she'd ever said before, which is saying something. I'd rather have her beat me till I'm unconscious than have to endure a conversation with her... in which I explained my mental health to her. My Nmom refused to acknowledge the stress I was putting myself through when my teachers and I tried to explain it, so I don't really see any possibility of her understanding or accepting the concept of disassociation. Forgive me if I don't wish to talk about my self-destructive tendencies with the person who gave them to me in the first place. If she spouts the same crap from the last few times, like assuming I do it to 'be cool' or to make her life harder on purpose, I might just agree with her. Exposing myself to vulnerability and thus more abuse isn't the best, but it sure is better than having her find new and improved ways of belittling my mental state. On another note, I have no idea how I'm going to survive summer break with her. I might die. It's highly probable, in fact."

At that moment, everything felt *not right.* I always look to my dad as this protector and great mentor for life and yet, here he is admitting vulnerability. It was surreal, horrifying, saddening. *He is no stranger to narcissistic abuse.* His father was a narcissist and his wife (my mother) is an even bigger narcissist. All his life, he's been beat down and suppressed. He used to be real lean and quite the looker before he met my mother, and when he got married he ballooned and became borderline diabetic. ""I used to eat to numb the pain. I ate when I was sad, stressed. It was my comfort zone, and it was a method of her controlling me,"" he explained to me. Any great ideas, big or small, were shot down in an instant. He has a brilliant, blessed mind but he's given up on his dreams long ago. ""WHY DO YOU WANT TO WASTE MONEY? WE CAN'T EVEN PAY THE BILLS!"" quoth NWife whenever he wants to bring something up, meanwhile she wastes who-knows-how-much a week. But we aren't allowed to complain. *Until two years ago,* I watched my dad become a husk of a man. Deprived of any social life, yet remained so emotionally far from his wife, he had no avenues to take. He just wasted away and almost became an extension of Nmom's wrath when she so pleased. Imagine being so sick of living with a Narcissist that you are willing to give up your entire life to escape the pain. **Identity Erosion** is literally the erosion of one's identity. It takes a long time, but eventually you find yourself thinking and acting in ways that will help you avoid the wrath of your Narcissist. You won't even know how to respond when someone asks you, ""What is your dream job?"" You will hesitate and give some mundane answer, or not reply at all. The Narcissistic persona is engrained in your conscience, closely monitoring and correcting you like some convoluted leash. You all know by now that curing Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a useless venture. The longer you stay with a Narcissist, the worse your identity erodes away, and *the harder it gets to go NC.* But still, my dad and I are planning to go NC quite soon actually. One day he found a name for the illness: ""Narcissistic Personality Disorder."" Up to today, we've been doing research and arming ourselves with knowledge and evidence for the inevitable day. He's ready to lay his demons to rest, he's ready to put 48 years of abuse behind him and start fresh. He's ready to reclaim his identity. "

She was so proud of her two children, gushing over their accomplishments &amp; how proud she was to be their mum. While at dinner my bf excused himself briefly and left his mum &amp; myself at the table. She continued to talk about what a wonderful son he was and how much she loved him. I burst out crying at the table and right in front of her. I can't even imagine someone, especially my own parent, feeling that level of pride about me let alone expressing it publicly to another person. I'm having trouble identifying what exactly I was feeling at the time. Maybe sad. Maybe I was mourning the parent-child relationship I'll never have. Maybe hopefulness that I could experience the possibility of making someone proud. Maybe even the realization that it's okay to feel proud of myself and not requiring the external validation. I apologized and reassured her I was okay. She reached out to hold my hand and in my vulnerability I simply stated it was nice to be around a normal mom. ...and now, in my deeply practiced habit of turning off my feelings after revealing any vulnerability, I'm not responding to any messages from my bf because I feel like the world's biggest loser for crying in front of his mom and disclosing a glimpse of how fragile I can feel in the presence of unconditional love between parent &amp; child.

Throughout the course of my childhood I have struggled with loneliness but as i mature im distinguishing lonely with alone. Being alone i can work through what i have struggled to cope with and make peace with it. Now I enjoy solitude without feeling like i have to chase relationships with friends i could never connect in hopes of filling the emptiness inside of me.

Sometimes I come to this subthread, which I admittedly found at a very low point in my life after a family tragedy, and it nudges me away from becoming that *N* or other dysfunctional person... There was this one post the other day that was so inspiring and if I look at my family, it is so painful because there are all of these failures and abusive or dysfunctional patterns. So someone marries and it turns out to be an abusive marriage, someone joins the military and gets kicked out, someone starts college/university and leaves before they want to, etc. I don't judge because I feel superior, but they are my kin and I am scared we are tainted or cursed, etc. I feel like *they/we* (my family) want a better life but struggle whereas on this subthread and in some of these stories...there is this sense of faith and hope. This year after a death that could have been prevented, I just kept my mind busy by reading and watching--sifting out--ok, what works and what does not work in terms of bringing one closer to a healthy life. I am grateful and I have rambled here but when I chatted with cousins, god bless them, I just felt more confused and more shame about myself and from where I came. Plus, I do not mean class shame--some of them have financially secure lifestyles that I would never want via making money in ways I could not, etc. Someone spoke about healthy narcissism yesterday and I do not want to be codependent or an enabler anymore... Plus, I sortof feel like with tv/film and literature plus podcasts and this subthread, I was able to redirect my professional path again after pretty much having a breakdown a year ago after the death. I don't think I would have found that inner strength via family--in fact, the opposite but I am not suggesting I am this great person or better than them. Am I the only one where these imaginary relations with strangers and characters literally saves me life throughout the years and then helps me healthily interact with *real* people and advance in the *real* world. I mean is everyone that on the edge? [Celebrities who overcame traumatic childhoods](URL I am still getting the netiquette down and err on being a bit self-involved and I always hope people skip reading but I remember when I first posted...there are one or two friends that *get* it and I don't want to burden others but people, including myself before the death, don't really want to face reality. I think that is why the Ns in my life were so mean--but if they accepted their vulnerability and fear plus then shared that... It could have been a different set of lives for so many of us.

382,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I've only recently realized that I had abusive parents.,542,6gzcgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6gzcgp/ive_only_recently_realized_that_i_had_abusive/,2017-06-13 21:48:18,"Hi, everyone. I've only come across this sub recently after lurking on JustNoMIL for a while. I've been spending some time reflecting on some of my negative behaviors and have been able to trace most of them back to my parents. I hope you'll tolerate me getting some of this stuff off my chest--especially since I might not be articulating it well. So this realization about my parents makes me somewhat sad. They provided for most of my material needs, which I'm thankful for. When it comes to emotional needs...well, I spent most of my youth feeling angry, insecure, and depressed. My mom was the primary abuser. My dad wasn't so much an enabler as he was a co-abuser (i.e. he rarely yelled at me or hit me like my mom did, but he sanctioned most of it). My parents are also Asian. I don't know what it is about Asian parents being their own special brand of crazy. Anyway, I grew up in fear of my parents and that has affected me well into my adulthood. My poor husband has had to take the brunt of some of my own abusive behaviors before I started to unravel all the bullshit I went through in my youth. As far as examples go, I'll start with the standard beatings and shrieking (and there was plenty of shrieking without beatings). There's spanking, and then there's beating my rear with a plastic toy putter while shrieking like a banshee. My mom would actually taunt me (sort of) while beating me--something to the effect of ""HOW DOES THAT FEEL, HUH?"" Another example: When I was 7 or 8, my mom took me to Sea World where we watched a handler/trainer do tricks with a seal named Slappy. I'll never forget Slappy's name because during the Q&amp;A period, I raised my hand and asked why he had that name. The handler didn't know the answer. My mom gave me a death glare and later chastised me for ""asking such a stupid question"" (and therefore making her look bad). There have been other incidents similar to this where I essentially got inappropriately bitched out for acting my age. I also contemplated suicide a lot during my pre-teens and teenage years (and for awhile as an adult--I'm doing better right now). When my mom found out, she actually got...angry with me. Like, ""How dare you show any emotional vulnerability!"" There was no support, no desire to understand why I felt the way I did. Just contempt for being weak. If you read this, thanks. Thanks to the mods for giving me some place to put my feelings. EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your kind words. I'm sorry for my lack of responses to comments--insomnia's been kicking my ass lately and I can't give an adequately thoughtful response to anyone at the moment. I sincerely appreciate knowing that there are others out there who have been through similar struggles as me. It means a lot."
383,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I'm presenting almost anti-social with a covert narcissist as a protective defense. It's automatic and it feels gross.,5,6hyfam,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6hyfam/im_presenting_almost_antisocial_with_a_covert/,2017-06-18 17:06:51,"I was raised by a more borderline / narc mom and an anti-social/ narc father (he was independently diagnosed as a sociopath). My sister turned out anti-social/ narc as a result. I think I'm weird, but mostly I'm okay. I generally have friends and empathy and a fulfilling life. I recently unmasked a covert narc at my work. It's a long ugly story. He was assigned as my supervisor and we are a therapist organization. The org. generally pushes employees to be vulnerable with their supervisors. This was not awesome for me in the long run. I am not convinced it is an awesome or respectful strategy at all at this point. He's not my direct supervisor anymore but I still have to encounter him a lot and we do a lot of trainings and exercises that require self disclosure and vulnerability. I try to avoid him. It's not always possible. But as a defense I have found myself slipping into almost an anti-social stance with him. It's not even a choice and it kind of creeps me out. I assume it's protective until I can quit the job. But I don't like how easily I can just remove myself and look at him like a bug. I mildly toy with him while he attempts to intimidate me because I am so damn familiar the disdainful narc stare down. It's like - oh. *that* thing again. You think I don't know that look? You think I am going to feel afraid or get knocked off balance? Huh. I pretend with him that he simply looked confused and he has to play along because he does not want to say what he is really attempting. I drop little hints that I am more connected with higher ups that he might attempt to smear me with while not looking like that's my motive at all. I find a way to signal to him through telling someone else in front of him that I just found out some news firsthand about the boss's tragic incident before any other employees. I rally others to be supportive of the boss and to help. It's something I would do anyway. But here I'm signaling I have the boss's ear and trust in ways above him and it won't be so easy to lie about me. I don't like feeling gross and game playing like this. I don't like how easily it comes. But then, also, I don't like how I was when I felt connected and vulnerable with him and trusted him and he hurt me over and over for over a year. That is until I set a firm limit and then he tried to make me feel completely crazy. Since I know what the next moves are - because of my family - I want to keep him in check while not getting emotionally caught. Obviously I still am caught. I'm thinking about it and writing here. I do care. I'm not actually anti-social after all and thank goodness. There is really no winning here. Does anyone else here feel like their childhood experience with narcissists make them more able to click into an anti-social mode with narcissists because that's who you were raised with and you know the drill? How do you feel about it?"
384,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Do you call it abuse?,15,66t9fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/66t9fs/do_you_call_it_abuse/,2017-04-22 11:01:00,"I have learned to speak about NPD in a clinical manner, which is not only due to my interest in psychopathology and me firmly believing that understanding narcissism makes it less scary and more predictable, but also because it probably is, let's be honest, a defense mechanism of mine. I can again pretend that I have control over the situation, nothing affects me *that much* and that I ultimately took away more knowledge than hurt from the experience. Which is just not true. But it is the facade I hold up for other people. The only reason I noticed this tonight, a very young realization, is because I keep finding the word ""abuse"" on this sub. And it might be opening my eyes. Especially the woman from a couple of weeks ago who told us how she was confronted by an associate of hers in being asked why she's not in contact with her family. And she answered, short and simple, ""child abuse"". It blew my mind. It wasn't some media sob story or a title given for attention and other benefits. It was a person being rational and yet so vulnerable. Very bold. Disarming. The thing I have so far not done, and I am not sure whether this is subconscious, absolutely intentional, or just my personal choice of words, is openly call it abuse. I spoke about narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder, but not about abuse. Furthermore I can detail what my father did to me. But I never mentioned how it made me feel. Or what I took away from it. I detailed the abuse done to me without ever mentioning that word. Or even thinking it. I did not make the association. It was pain, humiliation, sadism, intimidation, grooming, destruction, manipulation, stunting, neglect, malignancy, torment and cruelty, but not abuse. It could be the years of lies and gaslighting, or maybe all it is is just a fear of exposure and vulnerability. I'm curious. Maybe you told others about your background. Or maybe you would never want to. Do you say, to others or to yourself, that this was and is abuse?"

My cousin came with me and even though I didn't want to talk to them I did because I though it was more important having my dad back. It was horrible. I think they were under the impression that I was there to get for their forgiveness and I was still the same pushover I was under their roof It started with them recollecting everything I'd ever done wrong since I was 15. I didn't let them finished. I told them how disgusting it was what they did to me, that I was a child and they abused the trust I had in them. They took the most difficult time of my life (my father's passing) and made it all about them. I wasn't allowed to grieve. Their loss was clearly more important. Any sign of weakness was clearly hunting for sympathy and was disgusting. I was the reason why their life wasn't perfect. I lost my cool. I screamed and yelled at them before I left. I don't feel any better. Even after 5 years they still bring out the worst in me. I could've done so much better. I could've been so much stronger and never given them the satisfaction. I hate that I couldn't be the better person. I hate that they brought me to their level. I feel so alone but I keep going just so I can one day be happier than I am now. I'll always keep going. No matter what happens in my life, if I got away from them I can get past anything. I just wish I was there now. Don't give in to your abusers. They are toxic and will never take responsibility for their actions. Don't show them your weaknesses, because they will take any vulnerability and use it against you. You're not stuck with the family you're born with. You can choose those close to you. Being alone isn't the worse thing. Being trapped is. It took me so long to stop looking over my shoulder. I am free now, even if they still linger in my mind. I have chosen my family. They are beautiful. They laugh with me, cry with me and pick me up every time I fall down. If I don't want to talk that's okay, it's not an insult to them. I don't feel pressured into being around them. Be strong, because one day it has to get better."

I live 4 hours away, but I love my family and try to visit often. She is quite difficult to get along with and the guilt kills sometimes... It has its moments, and sometimes I go back and look at my journal when things get rough. I wrote this last year after a particularly nasty and unexpected barrage of critical texts while I was at work one day. Sometime's I read it and I cry, sometimes I get angry, and sometimes I just cringe. But ultimately I try to use it to remember that along with all the painful stuff, I've gained some great skills/traits albeit at a high cost.

I stopped reaching for her love when I realized it was conditional to my submission. I stopped crying during lectures when I realized tears made her think I accepted defeat. I stopped reacting to criticisms when I realized her acceptance depended on my conformity. It hurt when the old-me died. Bad and good things shriveled, good and bad things bloomed. I have value I am loved I never cry I never accept defeat. I reject conformity I embrace what makes me unique. I stopped aching for her compassion when she kept raising the requirements. I stopped begging for her respect when I realized it cost more dignity than I had. I stopped grasping for her help when I realized her help just hurt. I stopped depending on her guidance when she led me with a leash. It hurt when the old-me died. Im different now, I have a ways to go. I am compassionate I am respectful I wont beg I cant ask for help I dont heel on any leash. I stopped wanting her kindness when I found it came as a loan with interest. I stopped trying to be heard as she talked over me cause I was only left gasping for air. I stopped trusting her when behind my back I heard her play the victim and blame me for the hurt. I stopped letting her in and sharing my heart when she exploited my vulnerability.

387,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Still Not Sure if She's an N [advice],1,687mqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/687mqu/still_not_sure_if_shes_an_n_advice/,2017-04-29 14:47:11,"Hey, Long time lurker, first time poster. I know my mother has some things wrong with her (she goes through manic episodes and was often verbally abusive to me when I was a child, now I limit contact), but I'm not sure she's an N. I've had some serious fallout after being NC with her and it's raising old traumas. I figured I'd just post some of her particularly egregious behaviors/incidents here and let y'all suss it out with me. I'll go reverse-chronologically: 1. I got married at the age of 21 after having been in a steady 4-year relationship (we've been going strong ever since!). Throughout the lead-up to my wedding, my mother would frequently tell me (and random strangers) that I was too young to get married, and that I was doing so just so I could escape her and avoid ""cleaning house,"" by which she meant working on our relationship as mother and daughter. She nonetheless went to every extent to give me an over-the-top bridal shower and wedding, often against my wishes. She insisted on gender segregating the shower (that I did not want to have) because of ""tradition,"" but it honestly felt like it was more so she could steal another few hours with me without my partner in the room. 2. When I was 18 I became sexually active. My mother came to visit me at college one weekend and looked through my trash. She found a condom rapper, and spent the rest of the weekend telling me I had put it on the top of the trash bin on purpose in order to spite her. 3. My mother was extremely fixated on my sexual vulnerability when I was growing up, and every time I was alone was an opportunity for me to be raped. I took up running in junior high and fell in love, I've been doing it competitively ever since. When I would go for runs on weekends without my team, my mother would insist on following behind me in the car (going at 9 mph or whatever it was). She frequently tried to prevent me from going to competitions, and told me that if I ran XC (on wooded trails) men would stake out the trails so they could kidnap me. I grew up, understandably, pretty wary of the opposite sex. 4. My mother believes that she suffered a chemical injury in her young adulthood, and is therefore extremely fearful of chemicals and very specific about what cleaning products she uses and what makeup and perfume is allowed in the house because of strong scents. I was never allowed to paint my nails indoors (I had to go into the yard if I wished to do so). Once, when my friend was over, we started to do our nails inside because she wasn't home. When she arrived home, she insisted we leave. As we gathered our things to go, my friend tipped the bottle of polish accidentally and it spilled on the tile floor. My mother lost her mind. We began to clean it up, but she screamed that my friend was trying to poison her and began attacking us for being idiots. In general, though, my mother would constantly compare me with my friends (usually finding them better than me). Once she thought one was a bad influence, though, she would write them off. She was particularly sensitive to how other parents parented their children, and if they weren't as protective (re: overbearing) as she was (allowing laxer curfews, or nail polish in the house, or letting their kids go to unsupervised parties), she would try to limit my contact with them by refusing to drive me places or not giving me permission to visit them on my own steam. I guess I'm just not sure where to put her. Clearly she thinks she's the center of everything, sometimes to the point of paranoia about other people being out to get her. But I think I detect narcissistic tendencies. She constantly demanded to be yielded to. Her judgments of people were final. Her way was best. What is this? What do I call this? I've agreed to start therapy with her, and frankly I'm terrified because I never feel more miserable than when I'm speaking with her, and I obviously don't like feeling that way... so, advice? "

I was NEVER able to connect to or with anyone growing up- of course because of the forced isolation, and abuse in some parts, but also because I was always just a bit out of step/at the wrong pace/off from everyone else. I realize this is partly the autism, partly the isolating abuse, and partly that I just thought differently from a lot of people growing up, and the horrible mismatch of my environment(s). However, now I have people ... like friends or people I hook up with, who.... will say... I don't know just lots of things, but here's a smattering of them: 1.) ""You understand me so well- you're one of the few people that gets me."" ( I don't feel I understand them AT ALL and am genuinely confused by such statements...) 2.) ""You add value to my life."" (Never realized that...) 3.)""You're life has been very tragic, but you've come so far- you're so strong"" (Seems out of proportion and odd to say) And then just the sense like I might share something personal, like you know that ""vulnerability"" type sharing of yourself to others, but ... when I share things that are objectively personal... I don't *feel* anything anymore. Like I recently told someone about being NC and (very very briefly) why I was. Over a bit of time have mentioned other things as well. However, none of that felt personal... like I didn't feel anything or connection despite saying or revealing personal things- even things I don't usually tell others, I don't feel any connection. But- it's weird the other people seem like *they* are bonding with me- like they want to spend time with me, but it's totally one-sided. **Can connection really be called connection if ..it's just one-sided? Does it still have meaning?** If they get to know things about me, but, it's like they just go ""wow."" and then somehow feel moved by what I've done or said, and then they have this emotional sort of transmogrification, but I'm left untouched- water rolling off my back. I guess it feels akin to when I had to share everything with NM, nothing left of or to myself, so everything *became* nothing. Nothing held value, nothing hurt, and nothing had meaning. Very VERY rarely do I ever feel ""connected"" to people, I feel like people just don't... understand it or *me*. And, I understand that it's a unique experience, but why do people feel affected or touched by me or things I say- it's all felt so *factual* until now. I just can't feel really about it. I mean but sometimes it's either... traumatic raw PSTD pain or dissociated nothing and numbness no in-between. Just no connection no contact. But these other people in my life (in some capacity or for some length of time)- feel like or profess to feel like they are connecting with me? What the fuck is that all about.. How does it even work that way? Is it even real then?"

When my dad tried to ""Teach"" us he always did it in a condescending and chiding manner and no one was liable to listen. Most times he didn't care or was too busy dicking off about things x y and z that he was pissed off about that day. He'd sooner pull out his belt and start lumbering down the hall like an ogre than sit down and talk to us like a man. I got made fun of at school and at home by my babysitter for not knowing how to do basic things like dishes or tying my own shoes. My dad was happy to yell bloody murder at us all day for not taking care of the chores but never lifted a finger but to insult us to our faces. As a result, I became extremely rigid and compulsive, generally impenetrable and catatonic. I retreated to my bedroom where I could mess around with legos, play gameboy or nintendo, anything to take my mind off the world. My behaviors were repetitive and dictated by fight or flight responses of retreat to safety. Loud noises often set me off, and there was an abundance of abrupt screaming in my house when daddy had a bone to pick with scapegoat X. Child psychologists called my catatonic behavior 'psychosis' then 'aspbergers', then 'adhd'. Somehow daddy's anger issues never came up. I just don't find any of it fair or meaningful. It's not accurate. It's a diversion. I know what retardation is, and I know what growth is. The only things in this world that can prevent social growth are elements of fear. Fear retards growth. --&gt;This leads to repetitive behaviors. --&gt; Repetitive behaviors are always surrogating original, social goals with secondary goals in their place, for fear of punishment or rejection. This is a fact that has been borne out absolutely in my life and I am certain of it beyond the shadow of a doubt. The organic is that which grows, seeks association, parity and harmony with its environment. But when it is brutalized, the only impulses that can arise are those that take a defensive stance towards the world. Ultimately this retards growth, but it also prevents or at least limits further damage. This is the mechanism of fear. Fear prevents growth in times of harsh winter, when seeds cannot germinate, when the conditions are too harsh and unforgiving. Growth requires care, vulnerability, and fertile soil. Growth expands into the world, it is sensitive, naked, beautiful, glowing, and alive. It must be sensitive, for to sense is to be active in the world, and not passively defensive. We here are all the perennial seedlings of winters most harsh and unforgiving. We adapt, as best we can, to circumstances and impositions that by no means we anticipated in our youthful innocence. If any of you out there are struggling with addictive tendencies, try to remember who you were before the world dealt you a harsh hand. Even a crooked flower seeks out sunlight. "

It is a day that so many people clearly enjoy, but for me it just brings back memories of all of those Mother's Days that I failed to measure up. I got you a card? It was ignored. Or SO MUCH was made out of it that I was embarrassed, and it was like you were treating me like I was a small child, overpraising me to the point that it was clear you were trying to be condescending. Or I didn't write enough inside. Got you flowers? They were usually ignored. Or were compared to flowers that someone ELSE got, and of course someone else's were always bigger, or prettier. Or someone else got you flowers AND took you to dinner. Called you to wish you a Happy Mother's Day? Too bad I couldn't be there in person. Or too bad I didn't call earlier in the day, to make you feel like more of a priority. Called you early in the day? Oh, I interrupted breakfast. The thing is, you were like this all the time. It was just writ LARGE on Mother's Day. You always wanted things from me that I didn't understand, and still do not understand. You always made me feel like I was a disappointment, or was walking on the edge of being a disappointment. You pulled out my flaws (some of which, by the way, weren't fucking FLAWS at all, but were just facets of my personality that you didn't like, you nitwit) and harped on them. You smothered me with ""suggestions for improvement"" even though I didn't need or want them. You were/are always trying to improve me. To make me more like you. Did it ever occur to you to ask me if I WANTED these things? Did you consider for even a second that maybe I didn't want to be a younger version of yourself? Do you even realize how soul-killing that is to a child, even a grown one, to know that she will never measure up, not even in one million years? And of course, the few times that I did manage to accomplish something, or make a name for myself, or show pieces of my personality that other people approved of? You tried to own it. You have adopted some of my hobbies, some of my life philosophies, my opinions and then pass them off as your own, once again fashioning yourself as the Perfect Original and me the poor copy. You try to rewrite things in a context that chops my accomplishments down to bite-sized pieces that don't make you feel threatened. You treat me like I'm a small child that has just presented you with a finger-painting, and not a woman-grown, who is managing a career and a full life. You've always done that. It used to push me to do bigger and bigger things, in hopes that I would someday satisfy you. What a horrible time it was for me when all of those hopes came crumbling down, and I finally, FINALLY realized that there was no way it was ever going to happen. That I was on my own. Soul killing, is what is was. Is what it is. You've been circling me for months after I finally told you off, trying to find a way back in past my walls and armor. You have used my recent personal tragedy as a way to try to get in - you sensed emotional vulnerability so you moved in for the kill. I'll bet you were really surprised to find that my walls stood against you. I'll bet you don't realize that I'm strong enough to grieve my losses surrounded by people who truly care about me. I don't NEED to reach out to you. I have support pillars that won't use my emotions against me when it suits them. I have people who don't try to make me into someone that I'm not. I have people who are genuinely happy when I accomplish something, or hell, are genuinely happy for me when I am HAPPY, without trying to manage my emotions. Bizarre, right? But here's the thing: even if I didn't have a single soul on my side, and I was completely and utterly alone, it would be better than confiding in YOU. But still, on this Mother's Day, I find myself sad. I wish that things could have been different. I wish that you were capable of loving the person that I am, and not the pale shadow of myself that you seem to want me to be. But it is what it is. I'm a realist, and I know that these things are never going to happen. So today, I ate a fancy-pants cheeseburger at a fancy-pants cheeseburger restaurant, spent time with people who love me, ate cupcakes, and looked at pretty flowers. It was good to remind myself that life is pretty damned good these days. I HAVE made a life for myself. I DO have my own voice. I do what I want, when I want, how I want, within normal bounds of propriety. And you know what? It feels GOOD. I am never coming back. Your Daughter "

Thanks to this sub, I have been starting to take the first tentative steps in dealing with my Nmom in a more productive way than just collapsing into a ball of sad every time she decides the weather calls for potential drizzle and decimating your kid's self-esteem. I am an aspiring writer. Recently, my partner and I moved to a new city and in the interim of looking for an editing job, I've been working on a novel and studying books on different elements of writing. I've got a pretty rigorous schedule I follow, spending 8-14 hours a day working (depending on how good the writing goes). The discipline I have right now just feels immensely rewarding. I fall into bed exhausted and exhilarated every night. Still, working on this novel has been a sensitive and scary process. The story comes from a novella I started writing in high school, while I was still living with Nmom and working through the emotional aftermath of sexual abuse from a (different) relative. Once, these characters stood between me and chaos. I want to get their story right. If that's not pressure enough, I also just came off a two year period where I didn't write at all, entirely paralyzed by a deep depression--so I'm still finding my sea-legs. Now, the one enjoyable aspect of my and Nmom's relationship is that she lets me read my work to her. She gets a little thrill out of my writing and often credits herself with its origin (because clearly every child who is read bedtime stories grows up wanting to be a writer. Laws of the universe). Nmom certainly brags to family about the awards I won for writing in middle school, the pieces I published in high school and college; she just ""conveniently"" forgets that she spent my teen years telling me writing was a waste of time, grounding me when she caught me writing when ""I was supposed to be studying"" and loudly complaining to her friends that she wished her freak of a daughter would just be into normal things like sports or clothes. Whatever, I read to her, she gets her nose rubbed in the fact it's good stuff, and I get the added benefit of hearing my sentences out loud and adjusting lines as I go. Yay line edits!! Last week, I worked up the courage (after much cajoling from Nmom) to read the first two chapters to her. Of course, my refusing the first few times must have prickled her senses. She can smell vulnerability like a shark smells blood. The results were predictable. She did not like the chapters. She said that the writing was ugly, the characters unbelievable, pathetic, and uninteresting. ""Sorry, kiddo,"" she chirped. ""I think it's a waste of time."" I cried for about an hour, puffer back a few frantic cigarettes, and finally collapsed into a ball of sad on my couch. I could feel myself spiraling down to that place I had spent the past two years--it was bad. I was a failure. I was never going to write anything that moved another person. What was I doing in this city? I should suck it up, stop chasing a pipe dream, go back to school for some useful skill like computer science, scorch all copies of this damned enterprise from the earth, etc. Normally, that's where it would end. Ball of sad, crumpled paper, erasing my entire hard drive, worthless me I fail at everything spiral. But because of what I have learned at RBN, it didn't go that way. I got pissed, really pissed, at how presumptuous Nmom is--for gods sake, she finds poetry as a concept depressing. Then I got determined--This novel is mine. I am writing it for ME. Who cares if this draft wasn't up there with The Honorable Oscar Wilde or Tolstoy? It's a first draft. They're supposed to be messy. I dragged myself from the couch, heaved myself to my writing desk, and got to work. The next day, I got a text from NMom around mid afternoon. ""I have a gut feeling you might be sad. Are you sad?"" ""No,"" I texted back. ""I spent the night editing my novel. And I wrote a new chapter today. I feel amazing!"" What I got in return was sweet seething of radio silence and the reward of knowing, at least this time, I'd cut her game off short. "

Like all of us, I suck at vulnerability. I've been through a bit of therapy, I'm Life After Narcissism. I'm currently ""between jobs"" and ""between homes"" as I stay with friends and look for a job. Last fall I ended a five year relationship with a good guy who I realized I did not want to marry. I entered therapy because I didn't want to spend another 5 years with another guy I did not want to marry. I am 31. I'm seeing a new guy, who I like. I want to have kids. He's 39 and isn't sure if he wants to have biological kids, because of his age. He said that I'm ""troubled"" and that it's okay because he's also ""troubled"" and we should talk about it. I'm really uncomfortable talking about my personal (ACON) issues with someone who I don't know if I am going to have kids with. Should I talk to him as practice, or guard myself, for safety?"

I definitely believe I lived with an NDad and an EMom for the entirety of my childhood. However, I think some of it was mild compared to some of the horror stories I see on here. A month ago my dad pushed me away almost violently when I tried to speak to him regarding the relationship with my parents and my family. I've since decided to go NC. On my daughters bday he reared his ugly head again and reaffirmed my decision for NC. I blocked him from my phone following that last conversation. This past weekend my mother reached out to me. Asking me to reconsider what I was doing. She's always done this and she defends him even though she's been cheated on, yelled at, etc. I stood my ground and said no. I'll post the full conversation below if anyone would like to read it. I naturally feel guilty because I've always been empathetic towards people in general. So I kind of beat myself up a little thinking about the fact that my dad may never see his grand daughter. I know it's saving me the trouble of having to deal with him. I just feel like it's wrong somehow. I also know about hoovering and I'm sure this may be a classic example. It just gets to me because it's my biggest vulnerability. I'm also dreading future holidays like thanksgiving and Christmas when I'd normally see my entire extended family. Now I feel like I'm going to have to alter those plans to avoid my parents. Any advice on how to cope? Conversation with my mother if you care to read. Mom- ""I know your dad sent you a text this morning. I know you're upset with him. I just want you to think about how you would feel if Natty treated you this way. You have a right to be upset but he's still your dad and he loves you the best he can. I love you son with my whole heart. You don't have to be close... please just don't shut him out completely. He's cried everyday for weeks. He told me he sent you that text and I told him you said I could come see natty. When I told him that he cried again. Son we aren't perfect but we love you guys. You may get mad at me now. I hope not. All we want to do is be grandparents. Love you all dearly"" Me- ""He doesn't love me. You don't treat your son that way. The only reason he cares now is because I'm not putting up with it anymore. I'd thought I'd forgotten a lot of the stuff I went through with him but I haven't. When I left that house a month ago I felt like he ripped off a band-aid and poured acid into it. Every hatred I've ever had for him came flooding back. I'm sorry but I'm not doing it any more. I meant what I said and that's that. Everytime he speaks to me he insults me. Telling me I'm a disappointment and I don't know what it's like to work hard. To come talk to him when I raise my own family. Well I don't know what he thinks I do but apparently it ain't good enough. I guess working 60 or 70 hours every week isn't working hard. I wouldn't know what his text says. I've blocked him from my phone because I was tired of being insulted or made to feel guilty. I'm not sure how much of a relationship I could ever have with him anymore. It's not like we had much of one anyways. I'm not mad at you and I wasn't mad at you yesterday. I didn't know what to say. I gave you an opportunity to be a grandparent yesterday. I'm not asking you to choose between me or dad. At all. The reality of the situation is that I have no plans on visiting your home. We will let Natalie be a part of your life whenever you want her to be. We have no problems meeting you for lunch, at nannas or our house. I gave my dad an opportunity to be a father and he did what he's always done. Pushed me away with as much venom as possible. How many times am I supposed to forgive when nothing ever changes? I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I spoke to my daughter in such a way that she decided she'd rather not see me anymore. I'm sorry I'm making this difficult because this is the exact opposite of what I wanted when I came to your house a month ago."" Mom- ""I understand son. I know you don't see it but he does love you. This is his defense mechanism. He has always done this... if he feels the least bit threatened he lashes out and it's ugly. I'm not trying to make excuses because it's not right. It just is the way he is. Your grandmother does worse to him. I've seen it. Regardless I want to be in Natalie life. I will see her. I hope one day you'll be able to see him. I know he doesn't tell you but he is so proud of you. I know how hurt you are. He brags on you all the time. Anyway I love you and wasn't sure if you were mad at me yesterday. My heart breaks for us all. I just want to take care of everyone. I'll see you soon honey."""

I know people who are RBN typically are targets for abusive people. Whether they are Ns, toxic in general or other kinds etc. We tend to reek of vulnerability which is delicious to toxic people who sniff us out a mile away. Anywhoo...my New Year's Resolution was to push myself out of my comfort zone, make friends and eventually date. I've never had a lover and I'm 31... I wanted to work on my people skills so I've been studying up on how to be social, getting help in counselling etc and even made two online dating accounts for two different sites, hoping to double my chances. I was confident. I went on a few dates with a lovely person who I'll call ""Sarah"" for the sake of this post. It turned out we agreed to be friends and hang out etc. Then, met another woman who I'll call ""Brenda"" who I connected with instantly. We hit it off, had amazing conversations and it seemed to be a promising path to a possible relationship in the near future. Well being raised RBN, the paranoia got to me. I googled them both and lo and behold, both have prior arrest records. Sarah has domestic battery charges against her and Brenda has Grand Theft Auto, DUIs, Battery and Resisting Arrest with Violence. I am heartbroken. And yes yes I know...people change. A person's past is the past and people can change. I get that. But as a personal preference, I don't feel safe anymore and no longer want to continue associating with either and want to go NC. But how? How do I do this safely? How should I even approach the subject and will I be safe? And why do I attract people who have violent tendencies??? Why do survivors continue the same patterns of putting themselves in situations where they can potentially get hurt? Please fellow rbners, I need advice. And no I don't think people who have been arrested are horrible or evil or less than etc. I'm not trying to offend anyone. I really am trying to steer clear of the same cycles I have always known and strive for safety and healthier relationships. But I am clueless. Anyone else see themselves falling into these same scenarios? Edited for typos"

So I've been dealing with the backlash of going NC with my nmom after a good many years of abuse. The progress has been immense (I've submitted a few other posts to this subreddit about them), and I've made a lot of positive steps toward becoming independent and emotionally secure. However, I'm still struggling to unlearn a lifetime worth of defensive coping skills. One of the biggest issues that I notice comes from my ""irrationality"" in my emotions. As a child, I was unable to express my emotions to my mom or be independent of her without some backlash, and I've learned from that experience that I can't open up to anyone or be confident in my own skills because I have no idea what's going to happen. I automatically start assuming that the past is going to repeat itself and that I'm going to be stuck at square one. I know at the surface level that this is textbook trauma. When you get zapped enough by the electric fence your n puts around you, you assume every fence you encounter will have the same effect. I have the compulsive desire to replay my trauma and to kickstart the negative behaviors that got me to where I am in an attempt to get closure, and because I have no other way of handling myself. I'm constantly struggling with myself to stop the negative self-talk that plagues me, and to identify it as my nmom and her subversive emotional abuse. The counseling and self-love habits and baby steps are doing great for me, but I still have my moments when I fall back into the pit of anxiety and concern caused by trauma. There are times when I'm on my own that I worry about my ability to perform a task or get through a tough time. I've discovered that journaling and logic help with that. I have a new tactic that I use to handle these thoughts. I take out my word salad journal and write down what's bugging me - I have a stomach ache, I feel like crying, I'm worried, basic catch-all situations like that. Then I think about them in two ways: what's causing me to feel that way, and what can I do to help myself feel less that way? In other words, what do I make of the situation? Today I woke up and felt really upset and overwhelmed, and I sat down and wrote about it. I realized I felt concerned about being away from college for a week for spring break - my campus is my safe haven, and I'm going to be staying with my aunt and uncle for that week. The last time I stayed with them I was in the pits and had a horrible time. But then I asked myself, what do I make of this? Does this make any logical sense? Actually, no. The last time I was with them was immediately after a messy NC situation between me and my nmom. I'm in a much different place than I was then. I have plans for that week that will keep me from being bored and isolated - I have projects to do for school, a dog to hang out with, a job interview for the summer, counseling, and friends to talk to. I have a safety net that I didn't have before, and I've learned more about healthy communication and emotional vulnerability - if I have a problem, I can call a support line or talk to my friends or my aunt and uncle and they'll be there for me. Laying it out in writing and referring back to that every time I got anxious has made me feel much better, and it's made me realize that I won't get shocked with this particular fence. I laid this out for a couple of issues I had. I have a gross stomach ache and worry my stomach issues have been acting up? I haven't even eaten breakfast yet, and I have anti-nausea and fiber pills I can take if the issue doesn't go away. I feel like crying and screaming for no good reason? Well, first of all, the wounds of NC and uncovering trauma are very fresh, and I'm volatile because of that; I'm also PMSing, according to my birth control schedule and the other physical symptoms I'm experiencing. I'm worried about my plans for summer? Well, I'm going to be working at least 40 hours a week and making great money. I'm going to be prepping to move into my first apartment. I'm going to be going to counseling weekly and getting my own car so I can go out and do things independently. I have hobbies that I'll have the time and resources to pursue, like music and crafts and finally watching TV shows and playing video games. I have nothing to worry intensely about, because I'm doing everything right. The most interesting thing about this exercise was the fact that my inner dialogue changed. About halfway through my list, I discovered that I was moving away from ""I"" statements and into ""you"" statements - instead of saying ""I've been going through ____ and will do ____ to help it,"" I began saying ""You've been going through ____ and will do ____ to help it."" I was letting that little nurturing and positive voice in my head come out, and honing in on the supportive resources I never got with my nmom. It was fascinating and comforting at the same time that I was doing this subconsciously. I thought I may as well share this in case it worked for other people. Being such an emotional person and having such counterintuitive defensive skills has inspired me to start using my logical brain to handle these issues, at least until I can unlearn these coping skills."

All my life, I have always tried to accept the full responsibility for any problems in a relationship. My family dynamics definitely fostered this, with me often being a caretaker and mediator of sorts. Whether it be with parents, significant others, co-workers, friends, etc. I realize I've more or less been ""trained"" this way - justifying, arguing, defending, and explaining are all very honest ways of trying to deal with a situation (along with my sad tendency that goes along with this to feel like I'm just the kind of person that messes things up), but when they're used with people who are okay with hurting you it just reveals your genuine vulnerability to the wrong people and puts you under their control. My mother used to use any admissions of any sort of guilt against me, and would hold it up as a measure of how bad I am (while she, herself, would avoid ever admitting guilt, ever.) I've dealt with the apology taken out of context and used to further the other person's agenda against me. All this time, I've thought this was happening to me because I was actually a bad person and I deserved consequences for my actions. Now I see that this is a very sad thing a lot of people take advantage of. In these situations, it's never ""we both made mistakes but that's okay, we can work to make sure it doesn't happen again."" (or even, ""this just isn't working, i'm sorry it was this way."") It's ""you are bad and you must bear the responsibility for both yourself and myself."" And that's just not accurate. I have been inappropriately taking the blame and accepting when the other person won't help at all, like it's the kind of dynamic I am used to. It's not fair to have a sincere conversation about vulnerabilities and mistakes when the other person won't meet you halfway. It's a side of me these people don't even deserve to see. Aside from this, I had a lot of trauma as a kid that was set up to make me feel like a bad person (lots of unwinnable scenarios,) which really reinforced this. Are people genuine when they take your apology in very bizarre and incredibly negative ways? I guess it's probably a case by case thing, but. That has happened to me a lot (always with the same or similar type of people - people that remind me of my mother mostly), and I'm beginning to suspect it's a tactic to make me explain myself even more. There is no way I am that bad at expressing myself that so many negative alternatives and motivations for my behavior look just as likely as what I was trying to convey. "

It was rough. It is rough. Which makes me feel like an asshole for some of the things I'm typing out. (on my phone no less. i am so sorry if the formatting gets funky) It's just. I am always waiting for the other shoe to drop. No matter the event, the song, the movie, anything, I am always waiting for the air to suddenly leave the room with the utterance of, ""Your dad would have liked this."" or ""It's too bad your grandma isn't here for this."" like yes, no, by all means, let's bring the room way way down. (So far my way of dealing has been to give a sad sort of smile and go 'yeah' and try (TRY) to just move things along.) And it's usually true is the thing! They would have liked [whatever]! I wish they could have been here for [milestone/event] too! but her timing for the comments is always so - it's like any joy you're feeling is the rise to the top of the roller coaster. She is the drop. And wow, that sounds really bad. Grief is really, really hard, and it's different for everyone. I know my mom is struggling and I feel so bad for her in that regard. I really, really do. And like I don't see myself having a point in my life where I DON'T miss my dad but also... I still have living left to do, you know? I miss them so so much - but i don't want to see them again for a long while yet. My mom though. I know the bringing them up is a way to keep them alive for her - i get it. But it's almost like she's afraid if she doesn't, they'll be erased from everyone's memory or something? Which, yeah, no. That's not how it works. And I feel selfish but I would like to maybe enjoy one thing - just one little thing or accomplishment - without my mom pulling out the bodies from her arsenal. Because the way she does it somehow does feel a little weaponized? Because it's not that I want to NOT acknowledge them but. N's you know. There's something in the WAY she brings them up. I feel like I am constantly on the defense - in a different way than the usual on the defense dealing with N way - like everytime she brings them up, i'm going through a checklist in my head: is my voice soft enough? do i look the appropriate amount of saddened yet understanding? am i being comforting enough? what is my face doing, is it showing in my eyes? meanwhile, on the inside, my hackles are completely up and my heart is thrashing like a hare in a trap and it's only by the very tips of my fingernails that I manage to stave off the urge to run out into the street and howl like feral thing. and some of the ways she talks about them. it's like she doesn't really think it's affected me? like she'll open up and i'll say something understanding and she's always so SURPRISED, ""You know how I feel then?"" because, you know, the mind blowing concept of 'other people have feelings' is a thing that never quite stuck. Or if I fail my little checklist and my response - verbal or visual - isn't on point she stares at me out of the corner of her eye in a way that makes me really uncomfortable. like i'm a stranger. or a monster. because i don't seem sad enough or because i've never REALLY shown her my grief - which is true. and the reason for that is that i don't trust her with it. it'll be used against me somehow later down the line so I just wait until I'm alone to feel whatever it is I'm feeling. It just. it's infuriating in a way I don't really have words for. because I DON'T want to hurt her, not in this, the losses ARE hard and it DOES suck. But i fight the urge to flinch every time she brings them up. This morning - which is what prompted this mess of a post, i'm sorry - she was all, 'you know [kessalessa] I think there's still a lot [regarding their deaths] that i'm not dealing with. i've stuffed a lot of my feelings down.' I wanted to jump out of the fucking car. Because lololol you wanna talk about stuffed down feelings? Lady, this isn't a competition but how much time you got?? Instead I gave a sad smile and made some kind of vaguely understanding noise while inside I am tearing my hair and snarling like a lion. And I'm not trying to invalidate her feelings! That well could be true! But it's about HOW SHE FEELS/FEEL BAD FOR ME BC PEOPLE ARE DEAD. all. the. time. It is ALWAYS about her feelings. How SHE feels about the losses. And if I say anything along the lines of, 'hey, it affects me too' it's just like. does not compute or something. And I feel like such a jackass for being annoyed or angry with her over this. It's not like I want to tell her to 'get over it' or anything like that, of course not! but it's like. I don't want my dead to become a personal defining character trait. I love them. I miss them. But I can't change that they are gone. I carry them in my heart, I do, but I refuse to hang them like rocks around my neck for the rest of my life - and in all these little ways I can't rightly explain, if my reaction is anything other than sympathetic or expressing the deepest of mourning, she treats me like her daughter has been replaced by some kind of uncaring monster. This got very long and I am sorry if it doesn't all make a lot of sense. I am trying to figure it out myself while also trying not to show my vulnerability (the real kind, not the song and dance kind) around her and switching gears so fast is tiring. I am very tired. Thank you all very much for letting me vent. "
398,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,How do we get unbroken?,3,5y6qo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5y6qo4/how_do_we_get_unbroken/,2017-03-08 19:06:12,"While quite withholding about the particular details of my childhood, I am very open with most folks I know about the fact that I left an abusive household when I was a teenager, and after some years attempted again to have a relationship with my parents in my mid-late 20s only to go completly NC (for the second and final time) this past year. My 3oth birthday was last week, and my birthday has never been an easy time. Being reminded that I am wanted is something I am still getting used to. The resolution of grief requires accepting the reality of the loss, cognitively and emotionally, and reorganizing the facets of life in spite of the loss. For many years, most of my life, in fact, I have superficially accepted that I don't have it so easy when it comes to my parents. Those who know me more closely know that I have woven in and out of a relationship with them, depending on how much they can give, how much I can bear, whether my mother is seeking care (she was finally diagnosed as bipolar when I was in my 20s, but I know that is certainly not the full extent of what is going on... and they both go back and forth about ""believing"" the doctors) or my father is willing to accept support. 2016 was extremely difficult for many reasons. In the midst of a few big and otherwise scary things, I lost my parents for the last time. They are still alive, but they are gone, our relationship isn't salvageable, and it's probably healthier if I let them go. I am working on accepting that this time is the last time I'll let them do this (""this being the extreme and pervasive emotional abuse that has continued into adulthood and reopened the wounds from childhood abuses both physical and psychological over and over). There are only so many times I can reach out, only so much I can take on, and only so much power I have to make this a healthy relationship. Ultimately, the onus is not on me to heal them. I am working on accepting the reality of this loss, and part of that is saying it out loud. For years I have remained fairly quiet, often ignoring my own healing, in an urgency to forget the past. As I get a little bit older, I'm realizing that the longer I keep from healing, the longer I will remain tethered to that past. I find more often than is comfortable a circumstance that unmasks an underlying vulnerability that has been lurking beneath the apparently normal surface of my life for years - an interaction with someone who yells throws me off; when folks perceive me as anxious despite my steady reduction of internal anxiety (and a carefully honed and strong sense of when I'm being unrealistic and when I'm reacting to real outside stimuli); etc. - thus is the life of a survivor of abuse. I find myself thrown into this sort of vague sorrow that I don't know the ends or bounds of. This fog has seemed to follow me for years, dragging me down when I should be happy... It's not quite the same as clinical depression (trust me), but a grayness, a shattering of my glass walls, a heavy feeling that has been with me all of my life. I feel like this feeling is a result of not completely processing the ramifications of the abuse (even saying ""abuse"" instead of ""my childhood"" is new for me... trying to be better). There are many things that I know I am grieving: the loss of a childhood that never was, the loss of a future that I can't have, the loss of my parents. I am not sure how to handle the less concrete losses, but the loss of my parents is one I can say out loud. It is one I can tell people about and begin to live. I can stop acting as if things will get better. They won't. I know now. I've known always, but I'm ready to accept now. My birthday this year was filled with love more than I have ever known. I was at a retreat that I co-chaired, with 140 people, many of whom I am lucky to call friends. In one afternoon, I stood on a hill, whipped by the wind as a storm rolled over me - one moment off in the distance - the next soaking us all as we laughed; caught a full double rainbow and watched it fade away (again alongside many great friends); sang soulful, pensive, introspective, wordless songs, cram-packed in a room as we watched the sun sink into the hills while the clouds turned purple, then set ablaze in orange and gray. The world is full of love, and I felt it. I felt it, but something deep in me feels unbearably broken and sad and alone and separate, even when surrounded by chosen family. I'm ready to start feeling better... I just don't know exactly how to. I'm closed off, walled off, protected, scared. People can feel my anxiety even when I think I am being friendly. I am well-liked and funny, and people think I'm sweet, but they can all tell that I am broken too."
399,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Help! Who am I in a relationship with? Narcissist or FLEAS or what? (long story),2,5z21kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5z21kp/help_who_am_i_in_a_relationship_with_narcissist/,2017-03-13 11:33:25,"Me and my SO (who I believe to be a narcissist or has FLEAS, I also struggle with FLEAS from my parents) have been together for over three and a half years, my longest relationships before him topped out at 3 months, and he took my virginity. Our sex life seemed normal, or what I believed and still believe to be normal since gathering information from friends. Excitement, nervousness, happiness, vulnerability, passion, always wanting to. It was new and amazing. Being raised by incredibly strict, Christian, helicopter Nparents, It was difficult for me to drop the feeling that this was wrong because we weren't married so there was always this risky sensation for me like I would get caught and ""that was it! I'm going straight to hell for my incredibly horrible sin."" (I even cried for 45 mins in the bathroom after it happened). But then about 6 months in, other aspects of our relationship changed and it got a little harder for me to have sex with him but I still did it because I liked it. There wasn't a time of pressure or coercion during these first months. Actually, looking back. There was but I consciously made a decision that I was okay with it because I knew my parents were full of shit and I wanted to do this and if I do it safely, with my boyfriend and a man I love, why is it wrong? Anyway Fast forward to about two and a half years into the relationship. I have tried breaking up with him 7 times by this point and every time I tried, him or something in me wouldnt let me go through with it. Being in front of him and breaking up with him brought out my insane amount of love, empathy, and understanding for him and where he is at. (parents divorcing and me only being his 2nd girlfriend at the age of 23, his first girlfriend before me and her family being extremely abusive as well as his own parents. He's an only child, I'm not.) We continued to try to make it work, talking about things that need to change and him profusely apologizing and saying ""sorry, I'll try to remember to let you ___ or try to do better"" etc. He'd promise to start letting me love on him like a normal healthy girlfriend would with doing special things for him. (he wouldnt even let me cook for him or anything and I can cook.) So the lists of things to work on were made and he and I both promised to better ourselves to make it work. 3-10 days later, he was back to behaving like he always had. I had gotten to the point of not wanting to have sex with him every day (yes we were still having sex practically every day 2.5 years in) and stopped caring about it because I had no interest in it anymore without the emotional connection. Then we would have a fight. Not one fight was ever resolved or concluded and I tried so hard to get to one. After every fight, when I am still very angry at him, he would tell me ""You need to have sex with me, or touch me *motions to crotch* so I know you still love me."" My immediate reaction to this statement is always ""what the fuck? Are you serious? I don't want to even touch you right now."" Then he would turn on the charm and start coercing me and convincing me to do it and that this would be the thing to get us back to being normal. I'd have sex with him or just get him off every time. Was I raped? A couple months later I started my evening job. Of course, caused mix feelings from him because 1. he says he was happy and proud of me for going after this job and following through even though I have terrible anxiety. 2. He is very suspicious and jealous if I even talk about something one of the guys (I have a couple guy friends there) did at work. Things start to get worse because he was working in the morning then got off right when my shift was starting at my job. We stopped seeing each other nearly as much and his communication skills suck to say the least (absolutely no phone calls allowed). I actually had friends now and was talking to them about some things about my relationship- they all want me to leave him. I get to the point of asking for a break, I told him ""I want a break because I need to figure out if this is the right relationship for me."" We drafted a contract that stated it would be no contact for a little over a week and then on this set date, we would meet up and talk about us, and I was the only one who could call the break off sooner if I wanted to. He ended up leaving town for 3 days which was him by himself, in a hotel room. Plenty of time to think. He broke the contract rules even though I had already decided 2 days in go the break that I was done. He called me and we spent 6 hours talking on the phone. I told him to write a letter to me on what he was thinking about us and such for when he comes back and we meet up and I said I would write one for him as well. I spent the rest of the day dry heaving in the bathroom from the stress and I missed work. I wrote him a 4 page break up letter in the best sensitive, loving, and sincere way possible. He wrote me a 5 page letter on literally nothing It was like the entirety of the letter was the prelude to another letter, the letter that should have been written. He just listed a couple of things that we both already know he has issues with- my anxiety, my food allergies, and not being able to travel. I read his letter first, then I read him my letter out loud. I started crying on the third page because I still love him He started crying and tell me ""you know this is wrong. It isn't right! We belong together."" we were sitting on my bed and he like ""tackled"" me to hug me and then we sat up again because I didn't hug him back. I continued to read until the end. He was crying and I had stopped. He said that all he wanted was me to hug him right now and to kiss me. I said ""well I kind of want that too but its not-"" he interrupted me, pulled me on top of him straddling him and hugging me saying ""I'll take it!"". He was bawling at this point. I was in shock because he had never shown anything like this before. He went into kiss me and broke down even more kept saying over and over ""I'm so sorry, I had no Idea. I'm so sorry."" and of course what does my heart do? ""oh my gosh he loves me so much, this is what I wanted the whole time!"" aaaaand we're still together. Plus, you guessed it, had sex. It had been a month since the last time we had sex. During our break, I had a crush on this guy lets call him Cameron, got to know him a bit and was ultimately the test for me- if flirting with him feels wrong, I wont break up with my SO, if it doesnt then I'm done. So after about a week of me and my SO being back together, I wasnt happy again and figured out that if he wont let me break up with him, I'll do what I can to get him to break up with me. So I started texting Cameron (never had sexual relations with him so I dont consider myself a cheater) I tried to become a grey rock, that didnt work, then I made it painfully obvious that I was texting Cameron and trying to ""hide my phone"" while I was in the shower in the cabinet under washcloths (oh please if I wanted to actually hide my phone, you wouldnt be able to find it.) He came in while I was showering and tried to unlock my phone and read the messages I begged him not to because he doesnt need to see those, I'll tell him what it is and after I get out and we can talk about it. He put the phone down and we fought a bit while I was still showering. In my head ""ok, this has to be it. He's done. He'll leave me and wont want me anymore."" He left the bathroom and when I walked into my room, he put all of his stuff in a box and had it ready to leave. Then we started fighting and I was like ""yes, I fucked up, I know I did, you have every right to leave me. Go ahead."" And when he picked up his box, my head dropped and I started tearing up. I still loved him, I just knew that he wasnt going to try to be a better person (better than our parents) so I was sad He took this as an opportunity to stay. He asked me if I had any hope for us and other such questions. I said that I didn't know maybe a little, but I'd always have that little bit of hope. He figured that was enough then he told me to have sex with him to prove that I loved him and that we were still connected/loved each other. I did even though I didn't want to I started crying in the middle of it saying how sorry I was. He was stone cold. I'm not a cheater I've been cheated on before It sucks. This felt like my only option. I have no friends and abusive parents who could I ask to have my back so I can have strength to break up with him? No one. I had no one. Now, eight months later, still together. The past 3 months have been better than ever We're actually friends now too. He's been there for me during panic attacks, helped me, supported me and opened up to me. We still have a lot of work to do but there's the one thing that sticks with me from after the break when we got back together he said ""if things ever go back to the way they were, you have every right to break up with me."" Total of break up attempts on my end: 9 in three and a half years. Total on his end: 2 in three and a half years. It feels like two steps forward, one step back. Are relationships supposed to be this hard? I'm still confused and torn. Is there a future after all of this? There's so much more that wasnt included in this post. Is this relationship only like this because we were both raised by narcissistic parents? Am I only in this relationship because it is ""familiar"" because of my parents? Am I a Narcissist? Is he? Do we both have FLEAS and I'm the only one working on it? I've lost all of my friends, and don't know how to have friends anymore it must be me that's the problem right? Maybe if I had known about Narcissism and FLEAS 4 years ago, I wouldnt be in this mess. HELP!"
400,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My creepy mother strikes again.,68,5zd1a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5zd1a5/my_creepy_mother_strikes_again/,2017-03-15 03:11:50,"TW: I used to think these were not useful, but even reading my own words, I realize I get a little lightheaded. So, this might be useful for someone like me. If you're triggered by...jeez, whatever weird violation this is, be warned that my parents got pretty shitty when they discovered my sex life. Once again posting from my fabled throwaway. A few details are changed, the rest is unfortunately totally true. My mother and I have always had a wholly inappropriate relationship. She is, I believe, borderline, which many parties close to her have corroborated (all doctors!). She has really bad boundaries, to say the least. I am now an adult (28) and try to establish excellent, albeit sometimes cold boundaries with the people I love. My mother has persisted in her efforts to be really, really fucking creepy. When I was a teenager, they took the door off my wall and wouldn't let me change or do anything in the bathroom. Yes, I was just starting to masturbate. She made fun of how I cleaned my toys (or didn't) and snooped through my things when I was gone. The scariest sight I could have anticipated at that age was walking in to a clean, scoped bedroom. It meant anything I had written, drawn, or typed had been subject to scrutiny. Laptop had no password. I changed my email password regularly. But I was normal- I think back on that and realize that I was a pretty okay, smart, kind of strange teenager. It was around that time that I found the kink scene and ended up researching it pretty hard, often on computers I shouldn't have been using- family and friends. My parents shamed me so hard for this, screaming ""BDSM"" in my face as I retreated from them into the bathroom, telling family members. I was on Encyclopedia Dramatica in high school and they found it, asking if I thought shock porn like Tub Girl was 'sexy' or if I was 'turned on' by it. Every sexual boundary I tried to create was disintegrated, even just acting out in teenage rage. I had a group of friends who said 'eat me' as a retort to their friends. One time I was angry at my dad and said it back. My mom pulled me in the house and they sat down with me in my bedroom and said, ""Do you want your father to eat you? Is that what you want? Take off your pants if you do,"" and I ran out of the room and didn't come back for the afternoon. It was Easter. That being said, nothing ever came of my involvement and interest in kink, at least not to the shame-y extent they probably hoped for. I entered the scene in college, fucked around, and I'm a successful CPA today. I have great relationships with the people outside of my family, and I'm respected in my field. I'm not in a poly-kink leather family (not that there's ANYTHING wrong with that), I don't have nudes posted all over the internet, I was never assaulted in the context of sex, and I keep my private and my public life quiet. I consider myself well-adjusted for a person whose parents brought a spiked collar to high school and screamed in front of the lockers, ""you ordered this online, you sick pervert."" My mother and I rarely connect these days. I offered some of my tax services to her as she is expanding a business she owns, and she decided I wasn't good enough to pay, so I am no longer helping her. I received an unsolicited text from her today- she's wearing a wig, and she said, ""don't you think I'm beautiful?"" She then sent a photo of a letter I wrote myself, probably when I was about 15 or so, describing how enraged I was with my parents and the door and how curious I was about the kink scene. I didn't really read the letter. I got too freaked out when I saw it and some of the content, realizing that for me, it was obviously something private and intimate. I'm not surprised it got into her hands. I've always been curious about the things I wrote to myself and the thoughts I had, knowing they would be violated or destroyed at any possible opportunity. I hadn't thought of this in years and was disturbed to see all of it- the juxtaposition, my clear rage, and thinking that my parents read or knew about some deeply private details of my inner life and exploration. I chose to ignore it and tell her the wig looked nice (it looks terrifying) and not respond to the obvious, obvious bait she sent. But I'm feeling disturbed today, like the universe is out of alignment, like a little part of my conscientious recovery has been detached. It's the same way I felt when I read a letter from a shitty ex, or go through my old journals. But I like exploring my recovery at my own pace. Having it shoved back at me at times I don't anticipate whatever my reactions will be is...scary. How can I bounce back from this vulnerability? "

It may be bc I'm trying to begin a new relationship and this vulnerability scoots it out of me. My mom physically and emotionally abused me from ages 10-18. She gave me black eyes, grabbed my arms and smacked me so hard it left bruises, beat me with a belt, pulled me around by my hair, everything. On the emotional side, she told me I would never find someone who would love me, I would be lonely, I would be like my old maid of an aunt, that I don't have any friends because I'm so abrasive, told my little brothers to never be like me, then would tell my dad and brothers I was a manipulative liar if I tried to tell them what she said and did to me. I talked back and was a sassy kid, but keep in mind, the lowest GPA I had in high school was a 3.7, I didn't drink (except for two occasions as a junior and senior, and she knew about both and was fine with it), I didn't have sex (didn't even have a boyfriend), didn't smoke weed, nothing. All of this abuse came as a result of ""my attitude"". It created a very short fuse and bad temper within me, and I did start to say really horrible things to her at a certain point but I remember feeling like a dog in a corner being poked with a sharp stick - I could only lash out in response. I'm so afraid I'm going to drive my new SO away. I think he could be very special to me in my life and I don't want my trauma related insecurities to get in the way. "

I've found the book online and the link is right [here](URL The action steps on page 137 are the steps I mention in this post that gave me the rude awakening.** Hi, all. I've been around here for a couple of months, and I've posted a few things, but I just felt like getting some stuff off my chest to people who would understand where I'm coming from. I think that about 10 months back, I realized that my mom is a narcissist and emotionally abusive. I think that I've known that for longer, but it wasn't until then that I started doing anything about it or recognizing what a problem it was. I decided at my friend's suggestion to see a counselor at the place she goes to, and since August, we've been working through everything and trying to put all the pieces of my life together. She made me realize that since my dad died about ten years ago, I've been abused. I don't think it's extremely necessary to discuss what my mom did, since it mirrors so many people's experiences here. She was nasty, said mean things, had issues with substance abuse, relied on me like an adult, all the traditional n-behaviors and then some. Since I'm 19 and in college, I've been trying to pull away from her. I spent Thanksgiving at my aunt's house (who's not an n - she's gotten help for her issues), and went back there over Christmas when it was too much to be around my mom. It all finally came to a head after an argument with my mom that had been going on for some two months now went too far, and I ended up in the ER after being depressed. I wrote her an email explaining that I would be going NC and working on making myself better. She wasn't understanding at all. She was nasty and mean and manipulative, and it pushed me to my breaking point. I ended up being admitted to the psych ward last week and stayed there for a few days. It was rough being isolated from my usual surroundings, but it did me really well in that it came immediately after I cut contact with my mother. We had a lot of group sessions where we talked about emotional management and handling triggers and crises and the usual stuff. But I think that all the pieces of my abuse came together during one specific session. We watched a video of a mentor from a 12-step program talking about people who had issues with abuse in their past. I'm not someone who deals with substance abuse, but the video was relevant enough that I stayed. The mentor talked about how emotions are learned, and that when we're abused, our emotional responses to some situations lie to us. He said that our feelings about trust, risk, honesty, and vulnerability were all concepts that could be warped based on our experiences with abusers, and that our learned feelings about those things can shape how we spend the rest of our lives. That hit me like a ton of bricks. I went through the worksheet the nurse handed out and was able to specifically site incidents when I lost my ability to use all four of those tools properly. I shouldn't be surprised, but *every single incident* on that list was some extreme form of emotional abuse my mom put me through. Every single one of them. It was right then that I realized for the first time that over the past nine years, she had a remarkable role in destroying me. My ability to communicate with others, my self esteem and efficacy, my ability to be open with others and be confident in myself, it had all taken a blow because of the horrible things she'd put me through over the years. I think it was right then that I decided I wasn't going to take anymore of this shit. I'm not speaking to her until something gives, either when she gets help or when she finally stops leeching off of me and goes away. I'm going to call my counselor's office and get hooked up with her, as well as a psychiatrist and a social worker (since I just got discharged, they're required to see me in two weeks' time). I'm going to start going to mental health support groups to handle my depression and anxiety, and I'm going to try and find a support group in my town for people who were abused. I'm going to meditate and exercise and practice positive self-talk and try to be the nurturing parent I never had. I'm going to start relying on my loved ones to support and love me and give me counsel when I need it, since most of my friends and family have seen first hand what my mom has done to me. And I'm never, ever going to let myself be the victim to her abuse anymore. I'm not living with her when school gets out, I'm going to stay with my aunt until I get the lease on my first apartment. The apartment that I got with absolutely no support from my mother, with the money that I made all by myself, on the merit from school that I built up almost independently. It's a long road, but I'm ready for change. I'm ready to start learning to love myself and to learn how to trust and be honest and to finally realize that I do have a safety net around me when life gets rough. I'm so hopeful for what my future holds, and I'm going to start telling myself more regularly that I'm going to be okay, and that I'm going to lead a successful life completely independent of my abuse. I'm starting early so that I can put myself on the right track and lead a fruitful life. And I'm so ready to get better."

I mean something that will help with the difficulty to express feelings physically (having more of a still face),difficulty with feeling connected with others as whole, and vulnerability. This are all consequences of lack of engagement and stimulation during childhood,lack of loving attention, lack of..well,emotional and physical connections to a caregiver. Having self involved and emotionally detached parents makes you self involved and detached from your feelings and the feelings of others,unfortunately.The cycle repeats itself.You are pretty much raised to feel lonely and be alone.Isolated.Distrustful. Even if they fed you, clothed you and provided for your basic needs, if they left you alone for long periods of time and didn't interact with you,it makes for a very socially and emotionally disconnected person. Many of our parents thought taking care of us just enough so that we didn't die was plenty and we should be so grateful but they didn't love us, and therefore,we must learn how to love and connect from scratch as adults.Something that is learned as a baby.

Im 27 years old, and I got two sisters (one is 29, the other one 21) and I think we all got our fair share of horror from our parents marriage, their nasty divorce and my moms narcissitic traits. Ever since I can imagine my Nmom has used our vulnerability as weapons against other family members. For example every good thing she did to us, she didnt do in an altruistic way, but rather because she could manipulate us against our father (he never cares for you, I am the only one who looks after you). One of her favorites was also to use achievements of one sibling to ridicule and hurt the others. For years on, I have been her favorite victim, maybe due to low self-esteem and the deep feeling, that if I didnt act as she wanted shed just throw me out with the garbage. It took me years to realize all this and step by step break free from it. She did, by the way, tell me last week she doesnt want to see me anymore, just because I told her Id rather celebrate new years eve with my sisters and without her (or my dad). What Im actually up to is this: As my elder sister is not a very good victim (cause she stands up for herself and is not easily manipulated) and I myself have become a less resourceful source for her, my Nmom uses every possible resource to poison my little sisters life in ANY possible way. It is beyond my ability to describe the situation my sister has been in for years now. She quit school, she quit apprenticeship and basically shes completely down and hopeless. My other sis and me, we really try to help, tried to convince her to get her shit together and try to at least find a job. But my Nmom seems to enjoy my little sis desperation, confirming each and every bad choice of hers just to try and bind her to her will. I on the other hand am being seen as the party pooper in these situations. She got her as far as to break ties with my dad, grandparents and basically every other person my Nmom does not like or see as a danger to her. I used to have a good relationship with my sister and we do care for each other  but now that my mom broke ties with me, I was really shocked to see that my little sister  despite everything we shared together  well basically Im dead to her, just because I stood up for myself, which had nothing at all to do with her. I wish I could help her realize whats going on. I have no idea how to deal with this and apparently for my sister, telling my mother my personal feelings about a situation is bad enough to break ties with me for good. Is anyone here in a similar situation? Is there any way to help my little sister out of this hell? I really dont know what to do. TLDR: my Nmom manipulates my little sister into breaking ties with me (and others) and I dont know what to do. "

His wife (my grandma) passed away earlier this year, making him my last remaining grandparent. He's also the biggest ass. He's got a lot of support from his church for his involvement, but they don't know what he's like with his family. My dad has a slew of issues, ranging from nearly dying as a child from Encephalitis and suffering brain damage, to not knowing how to handle extreme emotions, going from spacing out to red in the face and ready to hit me. There's more, but I won't get into that, because asides from that brain damage and other past abuse, I truly believe my grandfather is to blame. Christmas afternoon, we arrived. My sister and I stood in the door way, hesitant to go upstairs to the living room. We finally go up. I nervously / happily say ""Merry Christmas everyone"". My grandfather is sitting across the room. He calls me over. I slowly walk over, with a deafening silence and all eyes on me, he says ""your dad tells me you're getting fat. Your fatness is genetics, right?"". This was a jab at my sister and my mom, who are on the chubbier side, but there was always an expectation of me being tiny, and now that I'm 23 and going / gone through my second puberty, I had to get rid of my size zero clothing because I have hips and breasts now. I'm a size 4-6 US now, and I was just getting okay with this, but at my grandmother's funeral, I was being complimented by his church friends on how pretty I was. I have a mild eating disorder, where I took paleo a little too far to the point it stressed me out. Then I started university, and the ""freshman 15"" and second puberty and stress double teamed me, along with time constraints and a difficult time finding paleo food in food courts and finding comfort in bingeing the unhealthy stuff. I'm not even that fat, but he made it sound like I was obese, and proceeded to tell me ""guess your whole diet thing was fake, since you're not into that anymore"". I have food intolerances that do in fact affect me anytime I have grain, legume or dairy products, but being so restricted at all times is very hard and to this family - too much to accommodate. After my grandfather told me I was fat in front of cousins and my aunt and uncle who I haven't seen since the funeral, I replied ""oh my god that is not how you greet people. How about ""merry christmas, how're you doing?"" like holy crap"" and I sat down and texted my boyfriend and best friend what just happened. He told my dad (his son) he wanted to give me money for school, but didn't even ask me about school. My GPA was 87% this semester, the highest my marks have been in YEARS. I got accepted into on-campus volunteering, taking control of my borderline and mental health issues.... but nothing matters to this piece of shit. I feel like he used my financial vulnerability as a means of luring me out just to use me as the punching bag in front of everyone. He's insulted my mom over the years as well, and mows down my dad in front of other family members. He does this to us the most out of all my other family members. I didn't even want to go, but I didn't want him to feel alone either as our other family members are marrying off and having kids, hanging out with the in-laws and whatnot. I'm not a model grand-daughter, but I try. I try to be sympathetic to this man. But later in the evening, he apologized for his ""bad attitude"" but nothing specifically, nor did he say anything to me about anything else. Growing up, he has given my cousins and I money at the beginning of showing up, I'm guessing as a means of buying our attention, or paying us for the impending emotional punching. He mocks us, insults us, and the phrase ""what Teddy wants, Teddy gets"" has become a common phrase. He was like this before my grandmother passed away. He's been like this his whole life. I don't even know if I can say he's a narcissist. He's a psychopath. I'm not even sure if this will bite me in the ass someday... I can't say I care much anymore. Even a cut of the inheritance, should I receive anything at this rate, feels like cursed money. They say love is a choice, and when it comes to this man, it's a very. Fucking. Difficult. Choice. Growing up, I have always dreaded going to his house for anything, and was always excited to leave, despite the fact I couldn't figure out why until years later. TL;DR;; Grandpa... you're a fucking asshole. You treat my dad like shit, and he tries SO FUCKING HARD to please you. You're not even worth it. You don't really give a shit about any of us, we are either trophies or embarrassments, often both at the same time. Your kindness was in the form of a cheque-book, and there was always fine print. Your ""love"" is always conditional, and my respect for you in return, is also conditional. My other grandparents were so kind, so sweet, model people within their own right... but they passed away years ago. When I was little, I was led to believe you were the good one because you gave us money but looking back, it was the love, the acceptance, the experiences that I look fondly upon. Merry Christmas, and may my fat ass break your stupid chairs. "

Maybe if someone other than me says it she'll consider it. Man, that's depressing. Background: I would say that we are VLC right now. Complete NC is not currently simple, because I live 10 minutes away from my parents and I rely on them for health insurance. I do not see them, however, including on this past Thanksgiving and Christmas. I just don't have them blocked on my phone. I struggle with serious mental illness and heroin addiction. My ""troubles,"" as you'll see she calls them. I'm clean (I have no idea if they believe that), so really mental illness is my main battle right now that I am receiving professional help for (that pesky health insurance again). I am facing it emotionally alone in my day to day life. It sucks. I don't feel comfortable providing any other details here. This is the text she randomly sends me: URL I haven't replied yet. I have so many things to say and nothing to say at the same time. I guess I'm also looking for some emotional support as well. I hate admitting it, but it still hurts. I hate it, because I feel like ""fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."" Shame on me for having any hope, any vulnerability, any surprise left. Although, this is new kind of low for her. I don't know if her sharing such personal information is shocking at all, but it's more that I don't think she honestly thinks she did anything wrong or thinks that I have a right to be upset about it (hence my lack of reply so far). If I was confident that she sent that text to hurt me and not as an olive branch, it'd be different. That's what this is really about. Thank you. I love you guys."
408,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,[Quick Rant] Nmom can't stop snickering and giggling at me - she's almost 80 (grow up already!),2,5m0oa8,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5m0oa8/quick_rant_nmom_cant_stop_snickering_and_giggling/,2017-01-05 05:07:38,"So, I'm very thankful that I'm out on my own (I'm mid 40s) and have limited contact with Nmom and Edad, and frankly won't miss them when I have less or no contact. Nmom has a mean streak and can be a massive jerk, and lives her life in constant worship and adoration of her late Nfather, a mean and self pitying drunk. So, Holidays 2016 were not that bad since we simply weren't together for long and I have learned, long ago, to say and tell very little and to protect myself. Nmom is not the ""mommy"" I can open my heart to - any vulnerability in front of her is just something new for her to ridicule, insult, or berate, so I treat her like a known hostile. Lots of one word answers, increasingly frequent putting down of my foot (""I did not ask and I'm not interested in hearing that..."" etc.). But she LOVES to giggle and snicker at me (and my Edad, and anyone else she can take a swipe at). Gaslights me with ""I'm laughing with you, not at you!"" Oh hell no, you are laughing in my face, because I'm a big F-ing joke to you, just the way your drunk, sabotaging father did. You are mean and you lie. She can find anything to mock - God forbid if I make any mistake (which I do anything to NOT do in front of her). Or even if I do something right! Then I'm boring, stupid (stupid boring professors who think they know so much, etc.), stiff, holier than thou, etc. Christmas featured a lot of giggling and snickering from her at everything and anything - from the cookies I brought to the fact that I run (and if I exercise, I must wear spandex or running gear, and she thinks that looks stupid, so giggle giggle giggle). She makes a big show of how she can't stop giggling and snickering until her eyes run, and until she has to hide her face behind her hands (like a child) to try to control the uncontrollable giggling. I would say that I hate her, but she almost died a few years ago and I felt a mixture of tremendous relief and indifference, so I guess I'm really indifferent. She doesn't deserve the emotional engagement of hate. The most pathetic thing? I think she's so addicted to being the center of attention that she'll be as mean and inappropriate as it takes to get that attention. Nothing is too far, too mean, too crass - as long as everyone is looking at her. Someone kill me if I ever start to act like that.... Thank you for listening, ACoN peeps. Strength in numbers...."

I wrote this letter to the Ns in my life as a way to express my emotions but as something I'll never actually send.",14,5m49uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5m49uk/i_finally_got_frustrated_after_being_told_youre/,2017-01-05 15:27:55,"I know why you're doing this. You're hurt. You take comfort in the illusion that you're in **control**. You'll try to interrupt me or tune me out because what I'm saying is too painful to hear because you KNOW it's the truth - it's YOUR truth. Somewhere along the way you've been hurt, probably multiple times and perhaps so deeply it gnawed at your very core and led you to question everything you thought you were. And it fucking hurt. You've been told, ""You're a disappointment, you're too sensitive, grow up, be a man, don't be a pussy, quit being so emotional and stop acting like a child."" In so many words you were told that **you aren't enough**. All you craved was to be loved. But over and over, you perceived subtle messages from those you tried to impress that you are empty - that you are worth nothing. You learned that you had prove your worth to receive love, to survive. So what did you do? You believed the lies and tried to prove them wrong. You're whole life you've been collecting a pedigree, accolades, achievements, trophies and gold stars that you can point to when your worth is questioned. ""But look what I've done!,"" you exclaim, ""I AM good enough!"" You remember the pain you once felt and vowed not to let others hurt you the way you have been before. So you hide behind a veneer that projects toughness and authority, to prove to others that you ARE strong and HAVE worth because deep down you still believe **you aren't enough**. Careful though, when an unsuspecting person stumbles over a fault in your armor, it doesn't take much before the whole faade shatters away. Underneath lie you're ugliest, deepest, insecurities - like boiling red lava, throbbing, and lashing out to burn anyone who happens to be in it's wake. You feel powerless exposed without your shell, so you lash out in anger at anyone who dares to expose what you really are - a **fraud.** You've been bitten. And now you're infected with emotional venom that swirls through your veins but you were never allowed the opportunity to find healing, find the antidote because to be healed implies you're sick and ""GOD FUCKING DAMNIT I am not SICK, I am FINE"" you say, And yet you feel **you still aren't enough**. You're enraged that you're **powerless** trapped by expectations that were designed from their inception for you to fail. Yet you are silent. Because you've been silenced. You've been told that not being able to control your emotions is only yet. another. failure. So you go through the motions of life. And every so often, when the lull/threat of boredom creeps up and the disapproving whispers from your past gain purchase in your mind they reverberate louder and louder inside your own skull and you just want them to please SHUT UP but you know you can't escape. You're a captive to demons who gnaw at your core if your mind stays empty for too long. So what do you do? You try to silence them by giving them what they want - by proving that you're in control. But it's only an illusion. When you don't FEEL like you're in control the only way to believe the illusion that you are is by comparison. You prey upon someone else's moment of weakness, of vulnerability. These moments present themselves most easily in the form of ""loved ones,"" - those who have lowered their guard and trusted you to love and respect us for the same in return. Someone like me. You toy with my deepest insecurities (that I entrusted to you), like a cat toys with a terrified mouse before swallowing it whole. You KNOW you inflict pain on your victim, it is your intention. It's a vindictive, twisted GAME for you, it's cathartic to torture. You thrive on this **POWER and CONTROL** - the two things you've lusted for your whole life. When I yelp out in distress and cry uncle you punish me by telling me, ""You're too sensitive, you can't take a joke, are you on your period or something?"" which conveys that my emotions are flawed. Emotions, which are at the core of my humanness. Therefore, I'm flawed. You feel vindicated because if you're flawed well then at least so am I. Silly girl, she's emotional and can't control her feelings and I'm strong because she is weak. Of course, you're careful of pushing me too hard for fear that I might realize I am worth more than a pawn in your insecurity-fueled game. You fear that one day I might decide I've had enough. It's a slow process of testing your limits, testing mine. Because you know people like me are the ones that enable this kind of behavior. If you were to dare attempt this on someone who wasn't so invested in you, you know they would ~~walk~~ run away without so much as a backward glance. I'm exhausted from having my insecurities manipulated just to provide you with a false sense of worth, all the while wondering, what's wrong with me? I'm angry that you would take advantage of my trust and love for you and push boundaries simply because you think I'm too weak to stand up for myself - that I'll always be here to serve as your emotional fodder.

410,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"Long Rant, Yet Not Long Enough",4,5m9brg,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5m9brg/long_rant_yet_not_long_enough/,2017-01-06 08:47:36,"I'd wake up at 6:45am as always. Forced into another day of despairity and pain. I had one of two choices to go about my day; full time university or my 'part time' job where I work 30+ hours a week. Oh what a joy to look forward to again and again. I'm young but I feel like I'm about to die. I'm weak and sleepless. Exhausted by the physical intake of my job and the mental exertion of my schooling. I'd like to be positive but it's hard when your parents treat you like a child but expect you to pay them your entire earnings and spend any spare time indoors doing work or whatever so they can guarantee you won't become some hellion once you walk out of their sight. On top of that they expect me to be a responsible adult and a scapegoat to their problems. I want to be grateful for the roof they put over my head but I can't. I'd say they feed me but I'm on a strict diet of not wasting their money with my hunger. Additionally, I have a cleaning criteria to abide by in which I can only use the shower for less than 10 minutes, ideally 5 minutes or else I'll be yelled at for wasting water. Same with toilet use and brushing teeth, everything I do is considered wasteful as long as I am doing it. These criteria are not applied to my parents nor my younger sibling. No it's just me. Because I was born with a different father before my mom met my stepdad. My biological parents were never married and my mother received a majority of the custody over me. In the passing years I've lost contact with my father's side of the family, including 3 siblings he had with my stepmother. I was young and he was just on the other end of the spectrum that my bio mother and stepdad are on. Either way out of four parents I never have won. Due to my biological father's absurdities I was redflagged from the moment my stepdad walked through the door. When they had my sister it increased sevenfold. I no longer was an only child at the age of 6 or anybody's center of attention. And I'm not seeing this through a small focal point or a nostalgic memory I made up in my head, it was made very clear from the beginning how things were going to be. And growing up it was only solidified more and more as I compared and contrasted the differences between how my sister and I were parented. All of which my parents ignored and brushed off in random phrases they expected me to believe. The moment my sister came into my world it shattered. I was isolated and expected to be responsible and always take the blame because the mere fact I was older. No regard for my age or lack of understanding. I was cut short of everything I held as a norm and thrown as far as they could throw me. Nothing was the same and I felt closed off to everything in my world. I no longer had a mother who wanted to spend time with just me. My bio father soon married my stepmom and moved on with his life as well. My step father always treated me like a criminal, which he was quite good at for being a cop. My mother always brushed it off as they didn't want me to turn out like my alcoholic father, even though I rarely saw him as he lived 4 hours away and didn't make the most of the visiting time he had with me. They gaslighted me all my life and abused me mentally, emotionally and sometimes physically. I hated being at home, especially with my stepdad. When my step father sexually abused me and I told my mother, she was upset because she didn't get phsycial attention from him and I did. Instead of soothing her 16 year old daughter it became another pity story for her own personal needs to clamp onto in which I was expected to soothe her or else I was considered selfish. I had mental breakdown after mental breakdown. I wanted to kill myself. I got caught up in an abusive relationship with my boyfriend nearing the end of highschool in addition to their abuse and instead of helping me when I reached out for help during my breakdowns I got gaslighted and told that I don't have real problems. That because they had a roof over my head I don't have anything to be depressed about. That because the problems of me being a middleman between my bio mom and bio dad were over I simply could get over it. I hated it there so much. I am also disabled phsycially. You can see it but it's a nerve problem which reduces the amount I'm capable of working mentally and physically but that never stopped them from expecting me to do above and beyond what they ever did. And it was never for the best of me, I was very sick a lot due to the pressure, it was so they could feel validated as if they were great parents to the rest of the world. There was a point in which I was so broken I couldn't wake up from the pain. I felt overly ambushed from every sector of my life and I was just so done. I had realized there was nobody in this world that would be able to fix this problem but me. I cut my abusive ex out of my life and his abusive family. I stopped allowing my vulnerability to be visible to my narcissistic family since I couldn't get away from them. And I expanded as much as I could my social sphere at school. I'd lie as if something was school related if I got the chance since I couldn't use my work as an outlet and they would look for me there. When I was stuck at home, I tried avoiding my family as much as possible by staying in my room focusing on my school. It was a horrible way of life, having a family who never wanted to see the real you and were never happy with anything I did. I stopped trying to please them I just tried to work my way through to get out. It was a challenge that I had my whole life. Just trying to get out. I lived in an isolated city that was 8 hours or more away from any other real city. I was expected to give my parents my entire paycheck and was on a curfew even at 21. And all my grades, receipts and banking went directly to them or I'd be yelled at and given the cold shoulder under I gave it up. It was like a never ending high school, excepted I was treated well beneath my age and really as if I was mentally handicapped. It was very painful not having anything I felt important be heard but I used whatever normalcy school and work have me. Living in their house was a 'my house, my rules' concept, and if I didn't like it then I could leave, however I didn't get to take anything if I was pushed to that option. Most of the time it was them forcing me out. There were a few times in the negative 40-50 degrees Celsius weather that I had been kicked out. Once it was for a whole night and I didn't have my boots or a jacket and I lived on the edge of a city near bears and wolves. Eventually I needed another outlet. I never did drugs or drank since I was completely unable to. Luckily I was in university and I had access to the Internet, along with it at home 'for schooling purposes onky'. Thank the Lord or I would never be where I am now. Since I constantly lived in fear I've been and still am a very paranoid person. Always second guessing if I did anything right since I was told the opposite. And anything I did that they felt disobeyed them which was not being perfection, they would use against me. So having any physical evidence of anything I enjoyed I tried to hide or else it would be used as tools of war and torture. As long as anything I owned or was given by anyone, in their eyes it belonged to them and they would indeed take away my prized items. I could hold nothing valuable. I used the Internet as my tool. I did anything I could to get my mind out of my current situation. It was an escape that held little evidence, at least to my parents eyes. They tried to threaten me that they would seek what I did on it but I knew it was a bluff. They threatened too many other ridiculous things that I could tell when they're lying and when they weren't. Of course I kept that to myself and played stupid to appease them. That too was the second major act of how I could get out. One day as silly as it sounds I stumbled on Tinder. I understood the concept and I did play with it for fun since I couldn't actually form real relationships due to my living standards. And I met interesting people. A few whom I got to meet in person too, never did much other than a coffee date in the college lounge since that was all I could do. Eventually when I was about to delete it I met this one guy and he peaked my interest incredibly. He was living in a different country from me and out of reach from my parent's radar. Apparently he was just as interested in me because we continued talking. We also deleted our Tinder apps and eventually formed a relationship. It was a risk but it was worth it entirely. He came to visit me for the first time a couple months after our relationship started. I went to visit four months after that. Eventually we found it painfully hard to be away from each other. For me it felt unreal and I second guessed a lot of the relationship at the beginning. I couldn't believe someone could love me so fully after all I've been through. It truly felt like everybody was out to get me or at least we're only in my life to fulfill their personal agenda and he changed everything. He and his family understood my situation and with a leap of faith I moved to him with minimal things and it was the best risk I ever took. We're now happily married, have a few pets and my life is entirely improved. Not even once could I have comprehended that my life could be this good when I was in my prior predicament. I now have a loving husband, my loving animals, and his whole family who treats me as their own. In addition, I did have to go through therapy, which is a blessing to have. I'm also on medication to help with my depression and anxiety and PTSD. There's obviously so much more to my story and I'm only scraping by the 21 years of narcissism I dealt with and it gets to be unbelievable to a point. I have blocked out a lot of it and it will only come out in spirts. I still have contact with them and I don't know what to do. I'm very lost in that area of my life. I haven't seen them in a year or so and I don't want to see anybody but my sibling whome they feel is far too young to travel on her own. I truly just want to cut them out of my life but I don't want to lose my sister. She means too much to me. Other than that I'm happy in my life I just don't know how to rid myself of the atrocity that is my parents. "

So please bear with me. I have been independent for the most part of my life and moved out at 17. I dont rely on my parents for anything, the few times I've relied on them for anything it has been emotional support and mental support. The times that I have relied on them, I have come to regret it because they always find a way to use that moment of vulnerability to tell me that I make mistakes and I should be perfect, which I am getting better at accepting that I will never be. I live in the US but my parents live in a different country separated by atleast 2 major oceans. Over the past year, I felt guilty for not visiting ""home"" in a long time. A part of me WANTED to visit home but only to see my friends and essentially from a tourist perspective wanted to explore the city that I grew up in with a different less painful lens. I knew that that would be impossible as my parents would fill my calendar with familial obligations. I have been able to somewhat come to a compromise with my parents where out of the 14 days I will be visiting 2 days (only 2) I get to visit with my friends. Visiting with my friend has been the highlight of my trip. It was very nice and it gave the little me inside some ability to recoup what i had missed out. My parents had a lot to say who I could or couldnt be friends with, how I hung out etc. I assume it gave them a sense of control. The remainder of the days (I have been here 7 days, 6 more to go) has been so frustrating, emotionally numbing, and anything you can imagine. I brought gifts for my family members and the first day back after 12 years, my mom says oh what you have brought isn't enough. Note that I asked her multiple times when in the US to give me a list, I lost the list because my phone ran out of space, i then proceeded to ask her via phone and she and my dad both said we dont want anything, we are just happy you are coming home. My mom then got mad at me (like yelling mad) for not bringing anything for my dad, I was in europe in October and got my dad a tie and pocket square and this time around I just brought them chocolates. I did get my mom a purse from europe which she was like oh I dont like it, you use it. (This is greed right?!) Oh, did I mention my parents were in the US a month ago during which they brought everything they needed, so I figured, I didnt need to buy them anything. Second day back, my mom starts to yell at me for not being married and how she is ashamed of me for being single at 29 and how Im practically and old maid. She was like what is wrong with you, I just put on my headphones and stopped reacting. She also started to compare my income with her sister's son's income. She was like only my life sucks, you are not married, you have not purchased a house, she continued to yell at me for not being cooperative and not just getting married to whom she wants me to get married and that She is getting old. All the men she has introduced me to have been controlling. At first I started to feel guilty and started to console her by telling her that I was successful etc. then I realized that it was not making me feel good. Like everything I say or do isnt going to give me her validation or understanding. As a child, that hurt. It was realizing that this woman was never going to change and she sucks as a person. She is so negative and depressing. When we argue, she says 'Shh the neighbors are going to head us argue' as a means to stop me from expressing my feelings. I have told her that if she continues like this, this will be the last time I will come back. She has tried to keep the peace but in ways that are insincere, it doesn't feel sincere, it feels like blackmail. As I write this I feel as if I am doing something wrong. A child isnt supposed to bitch and dislike their parents. My mom has this way of reminding me of all the things she has done for me, so that I feel a sense of obligation for her. She expects me to alleviate her anxieties and make her feel good, when in fact that is an inside job that takes work. I don't know how to forgive her because she will never understand me as a person, she will never respect me as a person, she constantly tells me that I am the worst daughter and I need to do as she says or read her mind to fulfill her unmet needs. Yesterday, she was upset over something her husband did, she dragged me into it by saying you and your dad have bad tempers, you both make my life miserable. I only get upset when she forces me to do something I do not want to do. Ever tried getting a cat to take a bath?! How do I deal with her frequent rants, her negativity, her mood swings? I have resorted to imagining myself in a bubble as my therapist recommended. But even that doesnt prevent me from becoming hurt when she says some horrible things towards me. It's funny she says I get really angry, but she's the one who has had a temper tantrum everyday since the day I landed. Does the gray rock technique work? I am trying to react less because the more I react, the more I feel like I submit power to her. PS. Sorry for the typos, I am on my phone. "

Mother is in and out of a psychiatric ward for a while in my younger years, never told exactly why. Completely emotionally unavailable, absolutely zero maternal warmth or love. To this day, I feel no connection to her whatsoever. Father tells me that he and my mother might get divorced and it's mainly because of me. Excellent results in school. Reading age of a 12 year old at the age of 5. Told I'm a child prodigy. My dad however is never happy. Always asks what other people in the class got, unless I was literally number 1 out of everyone, he was disappointed and annoyed that I wasn't working hard enough. If I do get the number 1 result, then he moves to another subject. Eventually I get to the top in all 7 of my school subjects. Then he tells me I'm not training hard enough, and that I need to start practicing my sport more. Also berated me and shames me for being shy and spending too much time in my room. Manage all of the above while still being a social outcast with no friends. Teachers in school are just as horrible. Most are indifferent to the bullying and exclusion, some even join in and belittle me some more. Start high school. (well the European equivalent) Excellent results, win awards for academic achievements. it means literally nothing to me, my reaction is relief, not happiness. Anxiety and depression get really bad. Force myself to keep going anyway. Captain of my basketball team, still seen as weird by my classmates because I'm extremely reclusive and quiet and only leave the house for school and training. Also complete fear of showing weakness or vulnerability, combined with over thinking about everything and intense social anxiety makes socialising impossible. Start counselling at 13. Find it very hard to be honest with the counselor about everything, can't open up to him no matter how badly I want to, deep down. Only sleep about 4 hours a night, and it's terrible sleep. Barely eat anything, consistently eat less than 1000 calories a day. Not allowed to take a break from studying. If I was seen watching TV or doing anything that wasn't studying my father would berate me and lose his temper. Never allowed me to relax. If I was up late at night and couldn't sleep he would again lose his temper and get angry. Helped me to develop a complete inability to relax and an absolute obsession with working Start medication at 15. Go from anxiety and depression to not being able to feel anything. Develop an addiction to pornography, the only thing that makes me feel good in life. Two to three times a day, from the age of about 14. Gradually get into more depraved things until I've seen things nobody should ever see, by the age of 16. Nothing illegal, but not far off. The loneliness is the biggest thing. Life was just school, gym, study, (barely) sleep. Looking back, I don't know how the hell I kept going. Would go months without speaking to anyone, other than one word answers. Made fun of in school and humiliated even further for being on my own all the time. Some of my teachers taunted me for never smiling and inevitably my class mates would join in. It became a running joke that I never smiled. Also called a school shooter, told I should kill myself etc etc. Never had any friends, never mind a girlfriend. I didn't even speak to a girl my own age from the age of 13 to 19. (All male school and a recluse outside of it) I've never been to a nightclub, never been to a party. Never tried alcohol or drugs. There's been less than 10 pictures taken of me over the past 5 years. I have no positive memories in my life. I don't really remember much at all. My memories are pretty disjointed, it's all just one homogenous haze. I'm in college now. I'm on a full sports scholarship to the top technical university in my country, studying computer engineering. I work 9 or 10 hours a day, I go to the gym and then I sleep. I still don't have any friends. I get a lot of female attention but it doesn't make me feel anything, I purposefully avoid it because intimacy makes me uncomfortable. I can't help it. I think being addicted to depraved pornography at such a crucial stage of development has killed any humanity inside of me. Not that I had much to begin with. I'm a robot built for academic and athletic excellence, without any kind of feelings or humanity. My dad is the only person I talk to. He's fairly content with how things turned out. My success has validated all the things he did to me in his head. He made me tough and he ""made me a man"", apparently. He's glad that I'm set up for a very prosperous career and he believes I have turned out exactly how he wanted me to turn out. I don't even feel anger towards him. I don't feel angry towards an absolutely evil man who completely destroyed my life. He's the only person I have to talk to now. Why the hell haven't I killed myself? Would any rational person put up with this suffering for 20 years? "

I did, finally, get a response, two days later about ten seconds after my mother got annoyed with our cyclical conversations about it and texted him to tell him they'd worried me. He is having health trouble that could just be aging, but could indicate cancer. Biopsy results come back on the 23rd. This has prompted my mum and maternal gran to redouble their efforts to get me to reconnect. As well as my mum's hangups about losing her own father, here are a lot of fleas and vulnerability to abuse on the female line of my family, and obsession with family image and parent relationships, due to my (probably N) great-great gran abandoning her kids early on and my (only possibly N but definitely damaged) great-gran being messed up by it. I just don't know what to do about the situation that puts me in now. My instinct is to slam my head in the sand and only think about how unfair it is that I have to deal with this when I just wanted a quiet Christmas week. I feel like the fucking N here. Nobody in my family seems to understand how shitty my dad and his wife's treatment of me made me feel. No, I was never hit, but our dynamic was miserable- he used to go out with friends day and night while I was there even though I only visited for two days a fortnight, made me formally ask for every bit of food and even tap water, never allowed the heating on even in the depths of winter when I would have to sleep on the floor, and he would constantly berate me for not 'pulling my weight' by cleaning his place and having a weekend job (it was the height of the recession and I was under 18 doing homework-heavy art school and college in a small semi-rural town). When I stopped staying at weekends, when I came by I would be asked if I had a job yet and how my grades were and that was it; we'd sit and watch TV in silence and he'd wolf down crisps. No asking after me or offer of anything. I got badly sick for a year when I was 18 and was hospitalized twice- he never visited, never even asked me what it was; my mum fed him unsolicited information now and then. Whenever he had a girlfriend I would become the butt of all their jokes and would be sent to my room whenever they wanted just so they could laugh at how under their control I was. I was mocked for being into the goth and metal music of the day instead of his classic rock, for being into art and writing and shit at maths, for being able to speak German ('ugly Nazi talk'). I was never a bad kid to any of his girlfriends, I completely accepted that he was divorced and could date whoever he liked and always went in hoping they'd be nice, but he always managed to shack up with nutters. He was threatened with a nailgun and glassed by the girlfriend before his current wife, and was so frightened by her fantasies about unprotected sex and having a baby that he had a secret vasectomy in case she was poking holes in their condoms (I really didn't want to know about that at age 15, but hey! Fuck my boundaries, right!!!). His now-wife overstepped the mark with references to their sex life, too, and did inappropriate things like show me her avatar flirting with men and then vanishing on Second Life, bringing me into sex shops while my dad was shopping elsewhere, or slipping hemp sweets from the local hippy store into my bag which I'd then get scolded for if my dad or mum found them (they came in a little packet with a weed leaf picture on; my mum hit the ROOF and nobody believed I hadn't asked for them). Other times she'd infantilise me; she'd hide stuffed toys *she* owned in my bed, and they'd laugh at me for being a baby in a single bed with cuddly toys when I uncovered them. I slept on a small, low fold-away floor bed with broken slats (my dad broke them walking over it) every time I visited for 6 years. After a blowup with his wife that stopped me visiting overnight when I was 18 (I took a can of soda from the fridge without asking and it turned out she was saving them for her son), they bought a full double bed with a wrought iron bedstead and moved said son into the spare room. He would drive her son down from and back to university every holiday, helped him move house every year, and helped her send him expensive care packs crammed with treats every term. He helped me move house *twice* out of the 5 times I had to move during uni due to unscrupulous landlords and never sent me so much as an extra penny. I went NC early in my final year when I finally snapped after being told I had to cart myself to three different venues around the county as a witness for their wedding and host at the reception while everyone else in the family was chauffeured. A few days before that request, she had pitched a fit and stormed out of the house when I came by because she thought I'd snubbed her on a bus (never saw her, and she didn't wave or call me over as I allegedly passed right by and shared a bus ride with her for twenty minutes). She refused to accept that I just didn't see her and has told everyone I'm a horrible step/daughter ever since. Did I mention the wedding task was meant to be done on the day before my 21st birthday, and they left my mother in tears on the day of my birthday when he sent her a barrage of messages about how disgusting I was for no-showing at their wedding? Despite all this my mother insists he isn't malicious towards me, just socially awkward, and I just need to forget the past bad treatment and accept the total lack of engagement with my life and the fact he refuses to challenge his lying psycho wife's passive-aggression towards me, because that's just how he is, and one day he'll be gone and I'll miss him. I get the impression she doesn't really believe some things I've told her, like the refusing to heat the place and 'earn your keep/ask nicely' attitude around food, and I know he's denied it all to her. There is some tension between me and her that I'm not involved enough with the family on a wider scale anyway, because I moved to a large city and have worked and played in some fairly fancy, busy places and have a pretty big social circle. There's a one-day window between me getting to my hometown and us going away for Christmas this year, and she wants me to invite him round and patch things up. I'm agonized. I don't want to be pulled back into that horrible orbit. I hate being around the pair of them or even just him alone; the silence is deafening, he does not have enough social imagination to talk with me, he is never moved by anything I say or do, and yeah, my pride IS still cut to the fucking core by all the mockery and accusations of laziness when I was sick and isolated and trying to get through exams and school bullying. But I feel like complete scum for even thinking of maintaining NC when he might be sitting there with cancer. My best friend who is roughly familiar with this sub and all the N-terminology, and has experienced having a parent go through cancer and chemo, has encouraged me to stay NC with the pair of them unless his results come through bad. But the pull of the 'family over all' and 'what will people think of you' fleas are so strong. He claims his wife cares deeply about me and wishes I was around, which doesn't tally at all with how she's been with me since day 1, but still jams in that 'we love you much and you're so cruel in return' barb. They were unkind to me for years and I finally turned away from them until such a time as they apologized, and they never have. To submit without an apology would be giving up the last bit of pride and dignity I have around them. Maybe VLC with him and NC with her would be bearable. But I have no idea if I'm emotionally strong enough to make that work; to enforce my boundaries, stop conversations I don't want to have, hold it together if they harass or bait me, turn her away if she comes to me, that kind of thing. But then the seriousness of what might be wrong with him, and the guilt I feel for having that apology-pride, makes me feel like I'm a selfish brat with no right to set him a boundary anyway. The elephant in the room here is... I haven't delved past the surface anxiety and avoidance into my deeper feelings yet and asked myself, actually, how do *I* feel about the possibilities, and how much contact do *I* want to have. Because the fact is, I'm afraid of what every possible answer says about me. I don't want to put a support-only flair on this because what I'd really like is honest advice from people who have been through scares like this. But I'd appreciate if it was gentle."
415,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"They aren't the whole world; vulnerability, assertiveness, cocooning... [rant/vent/catharsis]",6,5a2k6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5a2k6n/they_arent_the_whole_world_vulnerability/,2016-10-30 07:54:15,"I chose to break my NC with my Nmom this week and it's got me a little spun out, so I'm reaching out to people who can hear me. Hopefully, I'll have a better idea what to do next after I air some thoughts. This may run a little long. Within the last couple of years, as I have done my work and begun building a healthier me inside, it's been harder and harder to interact with my family. I change and grow and do the work and they just don't seem to change. One particular phone call with my Nmom left me raw for weeks - she just raked over my life with intrusive questions that made me feel like such a loser ('if I didn't interfere like this, you'd fail' is the message I often get), and it wasn't even about me - she had called worried about money and used me to manage her anxiety. Only this time, I saw it for what it was, and the next time I talked to her, I told her how awful I'd felt after our talk. She pretended I was talking like that because I had a cold and didn't feel good. I refused to visit my parents for the holidays (that felt SO good), and we quit talking. I feel like it's a huge risk to talk with her again, because it often leaves me feeling vulnerable and acting like a jerk to the people around me, and I really need to maintain the financial and mental independence I've begun building. My mom and I, I've learned through reading, have a Karpman Drama Triangle going, where, since she is obsessed with my HFA dad and has very little identity of her own, she needs to get validation through rescuing me from failure, which means I need to fail at something first, which is handy because the silent message of a lot of her talk is that I'm nothing without her since I'm nothing but an extension of herself - wait. Is she projecting her lack of self identity onto me? Hmmm... there's one to ponder. So, I fail, she rescues, I resent her help and intrusion in my life and feel like a big old loser, and around and around we go. Went. I don't want to do that anymore, so I'm working and paying the bills and enjoying the benefits of responsibility, self-care, and strength through better teachings (I'm looking at you, library). This last weekend, though, my Nmom was in an accident and could have died, and I already felt like a monster for not contacting her when she had a health scare, so I gave in and called her. We talked, and I felt anxiously relieved (maybe you're familiar - when something changes and it instantaneously relieves one anxiety while replacing it with another one?) - but now she's being chit-chat friendly and pretending that nothing ever was wrong and I just can't stomach it. I've felt depressed (lots of sleep), angry (bye bye, concentration), unmotivated... I wrote a note explaining my feelings in a very short, simple way, and saved it in a text file on my computer desktop. It felt good to move forward in a safe way that gave me relief but wouldn't have consequences until I was ready to act. So, I'm understanding what's going on now. I have so much old hurt over old stuff that she isn't capable of hearing, because she'd have to admit fault, let her denial be broken, see reality... and she can't. So I'm right that my letter might be pointless if my expectation is for her to do any of those things. I guess I need to change my expectation - arrrgh! I'm trying to control how she reacts to what I say, and I can't. So I guess my question for myself is, if I can't control how she reacts to what I say, there must be some other purpose to my email I'm planning to send her. I really need to set this boundary with her. I can't go on pretending we're friendly copacetic because we're not. I'm not. I think she's trying to use me as her attachment figure and I want out of this dysfunction! I wish she had an identity of her own. Now I'm just rambling. I think I need to go back to NC. There's often a hidden benefit to struggles, I find, and right now I can see my own FLEAS, particularly my use of projects to keep myself too busy to develop relationships, because I'm actually terrified of the vulnerability, because I spent most of my life believing everyone was some form of my dad, mom, or sister - and that simply isn't true. So the question of 'what I need to do' isn't really about how to respond to my mom. I need to risk more vulnerability with the people around me (cautiously, sure, but I have to do it), be more assertive (I've got a really bad case of the don't-make-waves), and while I appreciate the deep contentment I feel now inside after all this cocooning, I need to get out and do stuff. Get out of my head, out of my apartment, and allow the conflict I'm so focused on to subside from my attention. It'll be there when I get back and am ready to take it up again. Whew. I feel better.

But recently he pushed one of my buttons too many times and I made a comment that will likely open the door to a ""conversation"" where he will be told that he is a narcissist. Other than going for ""the nuclear option"" I don't know how to deal with it and am hoping for some insight First some background: My wife died about six months ago and she hated my father, as most people end up doing. For this reason her parents didn't want anything to do with him... which he just could not understand. So for the past few years and then particularly after my wife's death I've been telling him not to contact them every time he brings it up. Finally, a few days ago, he asked me if my wife's parents had any bad feelings towards him. And I, being worn out from grief, told him that my wife didn't like him. I then gave him a number of examples of why. I also pointed out that wanting to speak to her parents actually had nothing to do with helping them but was all about making my nFather feel better about himself. He was largely quiet on the matter and we ended the phone call. The wrinkle in my nFather's personality that makes this interesting is that he considers himself a great humanitarian. But it's a Reader's Digest sort of sympathy (not empathy) where he pities the blind and the poor starving wretches on the streets of Calcutta; shallow and lacking in any nuance. So, my wife's cancer and subsequent death has fit right into this category and has afforded me some latitude over the past number of years. Additionally, he has also been ""depressed"" for the past few years (and never fails to bring it up in every single conversation we have) because of a ""chemical imbalance in his brain."" Translation: ""he's old, no one wants to be around him because he's an asshole, and he can't get people to build up his ego like he used to."" So there is a new vulnerability there too. It seems to me that using his sense of pity for me and his own vulnerability may be a way to approach the confrontation (he will definitely bring the issue up again because he must have the final and winning word in any argument). But a big part of me doesn't want to have to get my hands dirty with this inevitable battle. I want to to quickly tell him about his life-long pattern of destructive behavior, label him a narcissist, walk away and send him a couple of well-worded articles on narcissism. I dread this whole thing but at the same time I can't go on baring the burden of his disorder. Something needs to happen but not sure what to do."

Someone who fears intimacy might reject being vulnerable and reject being known for their true self. I'm sure I am not the only one to have pushed away someone I love because of feeling threatened by the vulnerability. Isn't that part of the definition of narcissism? To hide a true self from the world? I feel like I'm really missing something. It sounds about right that all narcissists fear genuine intimacy. However, it just cannot be the case that everyone who fears intimacy is a narcissist and incapable of love. Would fear of intimacy lead to narcissistic *behavior* even though the person behaving that way is in fact *not* a narcissist? Do some people push past their fear of intimacy while others follow the path of ""narcissism"" by burying themselves more and more? Or does it not work that way? Is narcissism and inherent character trait that just comes down to the ability vs inability to feel empathy? If someone feels guilt and remorse for pushing loved ones away, does that mean they are definitely *not* a narcissist?"

She has an incredibly close relationship with our mom - to the point where I question whether my sister is an enabler or a flying monkey or even a narcissist herself. When I made the decision to go NC with our mom, I knew it would risk my relationship with my GCsister - but I've been struggling to figure out just how much it's actually affected our relationship as she is incredibly closed off from having any sort of ""real"" conversation about the matter. Recapping the last few months, when I informed my sister of my decision to go NC, her response was that she thought it was a ""shame"" as our mother was one of the ""best people"" she knows (ugh). When I responded to say that I wasn't trying to get her to believe me or even ""be on my side"" - that all I wanted was some empathetic support from my sister as it was a decision I didn't take lightly - she didn't respond.* *I should mention here that I live in another country far away from both my Nmom and GCsister which means all our communication is generally through internet/Whatsapp/Skype. From there I dropped the matter and I tried twice to have ""normal"" catch ups with my sister, but both times the conversation was strained, uncomfortable and she refused to touch on ANY topic that remotely related to being real and honest (think trying to have a Skype conversation with someone you just met off the street who doesn't want to talk to you - and then carry it for an hour and that's about as awkward as it got). So I confronted her on how I felt and said I was struggling with our relationship and how we were communicating and I didn't know whether it was because of my decision to go NC (likely) or something else entirely. I told her the ball was in her court and that I felt we needed to have an honest conversation about things in order to sort it all out. That was in July. It's only NOW (2 months later) that I have heard from her - an email detailing all this light and fluffy fun stuff going on in her life - not making mention of ANYTHING that I tried to confront her with in the past few months. All I could do was to respond and say that I was really struggling with where we are at and would appreciate it if we could set up a time to have an honest chat about everything. Her response was as follows: ""snikpohelocin, I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in hashing that out with you. There's no point in having a conversation when I really have nothing else to say on the matter. Have you made it awkward for me to maintain a relationship when I no longer feel comfortable talking about a very large portion of my life? Yes, but I'm trying and will continue to try. Do I make complete sense of your decision? No, and I don't care if I ever do - it's your decision. Either accept that, or keep dredging up something I'm doing my best to stay out of. -GCsister"" Needless to say - I am struggling with this for a number of reasons. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. For me - all I have been hoping for is a real and honest conversation about things where I can have a relationship with my sister and know that I can trust her with my vulnerability that it's not going to go straight to my mom (just before I went NC, every single conversation I had with my GCsister went to my Nmom who then used it against me). And if I can't have a ""real"" relationship with my GCsister, I am fully aware that I might have to walk the other way for my own health and well-being. Thanks for listening and apologies for it being so long!"

I've known for a long time that Ns will use our weaknesses against us but I guess I always took that ""knowledge"" with a grain of salt. Like ""yeah, yeah, they probably could in the situation where they were able identify my weakness but surely they can't and surely they wouldn't be *that* focused on *me* to bother using it against me..."" My worst fears kept being ""validated"" and brought up over and over again by people in my life. I would sort of notice the grin as he/she would ""zone in"" on a topic that made me uncomfortable. I would sort of notice that what often came next was a soul crushing comment that played on my worst fears and emotionally knock the wind out of me. Yet I refused to believe that it *really* was abuse happening and that my worst fears (of being unlovable, that no one would ever make an effort for me, that I was foolish, that I was shameful) must simply be true because so many people could not validate it ""by accident"". But it was *not* accidents. Narcissists really do undermine your sense of confidence. They really do often manage to identify your biggest fears and vulnerabilities and they really do take some kind of twisted pleasure from throwing it in your face. For me, I guess my biggest fear is getting attached to someone and then realizing that they never cared about me in the first place. Of course, being RBN, that is not an unreasonable fear and yes it has happened. I am terrified of the shame, embarrassment and ""weakness"" and ""foolishness"" that come with ""daring to want too much"". It's getting better now, but I had truly surrounded myself with Nfamily and Nfriends and any time I got ""too"" attached to someone kind, gentle and considerate, the Ns would independently confirm that ""it's all in your head"", ""you see what you want to see"", ""he must fall in love really really easily if he's interested in you"", ""I don't think he likes you, I think he's just lonely"". That really *did* happen and it really was *all lies*."

I finally trusted fully, and let myself be vulnerable. It triggered a mental collapse. A single comparison is all it took. The realization that we were different people, with different outlooks. This new friend, a person I decided to trust fully and wholly, may disagree with me. They could see past the mask I wore. Suddenly I was terrified. I could not measure up to them. I could see how they could point out all my flaws, all the ways that made them better then me. I could see them easily tearing down the real me, the part of me I made vulnerable. They could destroy me. I suddenly could not focus, I was making mistakes. Those mistakes I made because of the stress reminded me of another such time, when someone I was open and vulnerable abused that fact. That blamed me for things that I couldn't control. Blamed me for being myself. They wanted me to act differently. It was my fault... It was all my fault, you see. For not being different. For not trying hard enough. I was in tears, because I didn't know what was being asked of me. I didn't know how it was my fault. I was trying my hardest, I really was. I couldn't think of a way to try harder. I apologised to the air, and in frustration of being unable to do what was being asked, I hit myself. In the head, as hard I could. Over and over. 'My fault, my fault, everything is my fault. I'm sorry...' Memories of the first time this happened. When my distress and the mistakes I made while distressed was used to point how how useless I was. How I was bad at everything. The mistakes I made were proof, you see. Proof that I wasn't trying hard enough. I wasn't focusing. I didn't want to try. If I could not do things perfectly, I obviously did not care about getting them done. I didn't care... I didn't care... because I was a monster. 'Only monster's don't care...' but I did care... why did they think I didn't care? I changed for them. I worked hard. I worked so hard, but I always failed. I could never do it. I could never be the son she wanted me to be. Because I was her daughter. I was a daughter that loved her, but was hated by her mother. That wasn't wanted. The daughter nobody wanted. I realize now, that the reason nobody liked me, nobody wanted me, was because by trying to be the person my mother wanted, people could see it was phony. They could see it was fake. They hated it. I thought they were like my mother, and they hated the real me, and that I was failing again. I was failing because it was my fault. I wasn't trying hard enough. I don't love my mother, because I am a monster. 'But I'm not a monster, I'll prove it. I'll work harder at it... I promise...' Odd that, I NEVER break a promise. That was the first promise I ever made, and I never, ever broke it. I wore it for over 30 years out of love, to prove that I -could- love. Because while no-one could love this monster... this monster could love the world. I would have done anything to prove that I loved, and that I cared for her, except actually -acting- a monster. My own mother thought I was a monster... and I had not done anything. What little child deserves condemnation for simply being? A child that learned to throw herself at hard furniture to punish herself for failing. Who was... taught? Could she have been taught? I remember banging my head against a wall, over and over. I was forced to stare at that wall, and banging my head let me remember not to make mistakes, ever. I walked the world open and vulnerable as a child, seeking anyone that could comfort me. To say something nice. Children saw the open wound, and could not resist. They poked it. They re-enforced was I was taught in my youth. That I am inherently unlovable. Others brought violence. They were perhaps affronted that one could allow themselves to be so open. But I also think I brought it on myself. I wanted certain people to attack me. I made my vulnerability even bigger for them. I deserved to be beat up, I deserved to be punished, for the crime that I apparently committed; the failure of my birth. Eventually I had all the proof. I made myself open for years, no-one saved me. Some tried though. They saw me, and fostered what interests I had. They let me, be me, at times, and did not think it strange, or weird. They used the opportunity of my vulnerability to make me grow, to give me joy. These teachers and rare friends... kept the real me alive. The real me found escape in fantasy. In flights of imagination, of fancy and distraction. Reading, TV, listening to music, wandering about the neighborhood outside by myself, using my imagination. That is what my true childhood was. I truly was in my own little world. Thinking back now, it's like I was meditating all the time, save when I absolutely needed to. That was the only way to hide me. The real me, that was a monster, after-all. I could go on. The flash-back was... the final piece, I think, (and hope!) It let me put together my life, how I truly survived as me. I realize now, that all my life. I wanted to die, but I couldn't say that, couldn't express that. That would not be acting like I should. That would get me punished. So I never was able to tell anyone that. I would prove that I loved. I would keep my promise despite my most heartfelt wish. I am now happy to be able to express it. I wanted to die. My ultimate vulnerability. Day to life as a child was enough to make me suicidal before puberty. I was so far into despair by the time I was a teenager, puberty was barely traumatic. I had prepared myself for it. I was ready for the worse case scenario. All that from a vulnerability today... and so much more I do not wish to share. I will say however, that I have never been more happy to be alive. I feel so lucky to be here today, writing this. I am not sure why I did write it, aside from the fact I had to get it out of me, and that perhaps... someone will relate, and maybe it will help them. Maybe not. I certainly thank the community for giving me the opportunity to write this! Have a blessed evening."

If you've never encountered a narcissist, go out and buy a lottery ticket because you're a very lucky person. Most of us have had a friend, partner, co-worker, or parent who is a narcissist. Sometimes it can take a while to figure out that they're a narcissist, but once you do, it seems very clear. People can have traits of narcissism without being clinically diagnosed as having narcissistic personality disorder, as there is a full range of narcissism. Some of the classic characteristics of narcissists are that they are arrogant, self-centered, self-important, manipulative, and are lacking in empathy. While they may not be great at compassion or sensitivity (towards others), they're geniuses at making everything about them and at leaving a trail of wreckage behind them. Narcissists love to get into people's heads so they can control them, and if you're in a relationship with a narcissist, it's even worse. In an article on Thought Catalog, writer Kim Saeed writes about the secret things that narcissists use against us and how to turn those things around. 1. You'll never please a narcissist, no matter what you do. Narcissists want you to think that no matter how hard you try, nothing will ever be good enough. They do this to control you so you'll keep trying to get their approval and will continue to fail. Are you doing everything, from working long hours at your job, paying all the bills, and acting as some kind of personal assistant for the narcissist, and yet they never thank or praise you? This line of manipulation works for the narcissists because it makes sure you'll always be willing to do whatever they ask of you at a moment's notice, and it destroys your confidence and self-esteem. It's a win-win for the narcissist and lose-lose for you. In order to counterbalance this tactic of the narcissists, stop doing whatever they ask you to do and take your power back. 2. Narcissists have an extra sense that enables them to see other people's vulnerabilities. Narcissists and other manipulative people are able to detect vulnerability by looking at various facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. People who feel insecure may avoid direct eye contact with others or speak softly. Narcissists use psychological manipulation to control their victims... I mean, loved ones, and to get them so invested in the relationship with the narcissist that they can't see a way out. You may have been in a relationship with a narcissist, but the best way to turn this pattern around is to break the cycle by focusing on yourself and your recovery. The best thing you can do is get out of the relationship and be diligent about never getting in one again. 3. Once a narcissist has succeeded in isolating you from your friends and family, they'll use the silent treatment on you. After an initial honeymoon period is over, where the narcissist seems too loving and wonderful to be true, they'll start to blame your relationship problems on the other people in your life, cutting you off from the people who might give you any positive emotional support. Once isolated, the narcissistic partner will criticize you and stop talking to you. The silent treatment is extremely cruel, sadistic, and damaging to your psyche. For your own mental health and sense of self, you need to detach completely from the narcissist. With time you'll get to the point where you can heal. The narcissist will try to reel you back into their life, but you need to be strong. While narcissists may seem likable and amazing, they're never going to be there for you or be what you need to be a healthy, happy individual. "

I was abused in multiple ways (sexual, physical, emotional, financial, and psychological) by Ndad throughout my life. Now that I am an adult the sexual and spiritual abuse stopped ( I confronted him about it and told him I'd call CPS and report him. He denied ever abusing me and I had an emotional breakdown because I remember everything he did to me) . During my childhood he pitted me against my older sibling who was my best friend. He also alienated me from my mother and cheated on her. Once he hit her in the head with a hammer and I watched as she lied and said it fell on her head. He frequently told me the biblical story of Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah. He said my mother would turn into a pile of salt and my sister and I would have to ""help"" him. I was 8. I didn't know that Lot's daughters slept with their father to produce heirs. He told me I would be his main helper. He'd call me into dark rooms at night and told me this story. He would smile and nod when I naively told him I'd help and felt terrified of losing my mother. I cried daily at the thought of my mom melting into a pile of ashes and the world ending. Then the molestation and covert incest began. I became his ""wife"" and was molested weekly by having my breasts and vagina fondled. He forced me to touch him and when he finished he'd push me away and ignore me for days. I grew up feeling like I was disposable and had many suicidal attempts. He was a monster to me and my family and now he's crumbling. I had major flashbacks and fleas when I met my ex-boyfriend. I was disgusted by his affection and vulberabilty because I associated it with a premise to be sexually abused. My ndad would ask me for a hug then molest me then push me away. Comfort, kindness, compassion, and love became dangerous for me to show men. I hid my feminine side out of self preservation and fear. When I saw the post about The Beheaded Goddess and I googled some excerpts from the book. It explains SO much of what I felt and experienced. It helped me understand why I've felt like half a person or nonexistent, hated my mother and desired to be unlike her, felt attracted to men but also repulsed by male neediness and vulnerability, and my fear of abandonment in my romantic relationship. I also feel depressed and extremely angry. I feel sick and like something (my soul or essence) is trying to push through an imaginary layer over my body, like shedding of my entire being for who I really am. But I don't know who that is. I want to find out. I'm really happy I came across that post about the book. It is dead on in explaining what it's felt like being the daughter and victim of a sexually abusive ndad. I don't really know how to deal with the anger I feel. I don't know how to heal it and I think that's why I feel sad and sick."

On the other side, I have to intellectually understand that she is capable of and willing to destroy me if I get in her way and that her love for me might be superficial and conditional. It's not her fault that her brain doesn't work like other peoples' brains, and I can see her trying sometimes. Still, for my own safely I have to stay away. How do you manage this emotional complexity? It's like a puzzle I have been working out my entire life and every time I think I've made progress I fall back into one of two traps: I either love her and think I was the problem all along, trust her again until I can't take it anymore, or I cut off contact and wall up my emotional vulnerability with hatred and alcohol. I know at this point it seems maybe I'm the problem. And maybe I am. Maybe I was the problem from birth. I don't know. I just need advice or something, if anyone's come up with a workable way of looking at all this. "

I've been reading a lot of the posts today, and it's interesting how similar many of our stories can be. I always thought there was something so flawed and wrong and terrible with who I was. I grew up with a lot of shame. It's been a couple years now, and even though I have therapy and books, I fall back into ""old ways"" on occasion. Overall, it's better-when I go out on public I only feel *sometimes* that people will hurt me on purpose or say mean things, and it's practically non-existent when I've been practicing self awareness. I feel more confident that I can catch the distorted thoughts and my world view is no not so skewed. My behaviors and ability to just be there with others have improved. It's amazing to think that there are others who just knew this stuff throughout their lives. *But the fleas can suck pretty bad sometimes, and I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to manage the guilt/shame upon recognizing them*. There are days when I haven't been practicing self awareness, and been trying to establish boundaries or stick up for myself. And I feel like I take it too far. Not in an overly rude way (though maybe it can be, I don't think so) but that I forget about true love and vulnerability and those things that sort of separate me from my mom, who is sort of this cold person. The latest flea issue is that I was being too scientific and unemotional again when talking about marriage with my SO. Maybe to bystanders they might think, ""wow, this girl doesn't have much of a heart, or she's not a loving person."" It wasn't rude but just...unemotional. Saying that I don't need a piece of paper to show my love, but feeling frustrated that I don't view marriage like others do. And then he says that he loves me, no matter what we do. And I nearly started crying in public, because it felt kind and soft. It had been several days where I was in ""tough person"" mode and not my usual more easygoing relaxed self. And I feel so bad that I struggle with something so fundamental as giving and receiving love. There are other things too. It's difficult to describe but I feel like I have to work harder at (a) understanding it's ok to be vulnerable with friends and loved ones and to ask for help (b) understanding things from other people's points of view while also being kind to myself (it seems to be too one way or the other, where a middle ground might be better) and (c) keeping myself in check so as not to let my approval seeking/shallow/critical behaviors crop up. These are usually fairly minor but still not ok, like when I said I ""hated"" when my SO shaves. I feel he looks much better with a beard, but it probably hurt him for me to say that out loud. Wow, sorry for the long post. Tl/dr- How do you deal with recognizing fleas, and the fear of being abandoned or rejected for having them? it's hard enough that we might feel shame from childhood, and then there are these traits that no matter how self aware I try to be, they may still pop up, though with far less frequency and intensity.

The study shows that psychopaths (I realize it's an outdated term but that's what they use in the article) are able to pick up on these subtle cues, which helps them identify ideal victims. It would seem that there's something to the idea that there are people who go through life repeatedly victimized; our body language can be a beacon to predators. The article ends by saying that those who attempt to modify their body language are only successful temporarily. While that may be so, if you're walking alone/at night/in a parking lot/insert sketchy situation here/etc. or if you're around someone that makes you uneasy, 'temporary' may be all you need.

I need your advice. I recently began dating a man about two months ago and have been pushing my boundaries and practicing vulnerability and trust with him (huge progress for me! Woo!). He knows about my abusive upbringing, narcissistic parents, and mental illness diagnoses. This morning, we were talking about my current situation in regards to my relationship with my Nfather (preparing to go NC) and the mental health struggles that I've had (anorexia nervosa, bipolar disorder, CPTSD, gad). I walked away from this conversation with a lot of hurt feelings. I feel invalidated and unsupported. In summation, he was sympathizing with and ultimately siding with my father and was minimizing my emotions and the severity of my diagnoses. Now, I fully intend to address these grievances with him but my question is, is this a red flag? Do I give him the benefit of the doubt and try to help him understand my life and struggles more? Or should this be a deal breaker? I have a propensity to become so terrified when people hurt me that I have historically ran from them and didn't try to repair or continue the relationship, whether it be romantic or platonic. I don't want to make that mistake again but I also don't want to continue a destructive relationship and I'm not too skilled at spotting those right off the bat yet. Any insights or advice would be much appreciated! Thank you :)"
428,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Finally understand bullying,4,51xf7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/51xf7z/finally_understand_bullying/,2016-09-09 23:38:19,"URL ""The cause of bullying is simple: bullying is due to intolerable self-loathing. It's not the victim's self-loathing that's responsible, however; it's that of the bully. Bullying usually takes place when a popular and/or powerful student (or boss or co-worker) harasses an unpopular student (or employee or colleague) who has little or no power. It is always a case of someone in a supposed position of strength attacking someone who appears weaker and more vulnerable. This begs the question: Why would a person who has achieved an enviably superior social status want to waste their time picking on someone of far lesser social value? The answer lies in psychoanalytic theory: The bully is compelled to attack the victim because they are utterly terrified that deep-down, they are exactly like this weak, vulnerable social misfit. According to psychoanalytic theory, we employ what are known as psychological defense mechanisms to ward off unwanted, frightening feelings or urges within our psyche. These defense mechanisms are sometimes useful and sometimes hurtful, to ourselves and others. In the case of bullying, the bully is going through life feeling unbearably vulnerable. Despite being in a position of power, this individual feels deeply inadequate and possibly even like a fraud who has tricked others into according them the benefits of superior social status. The bully is unable to tolerate their feelings of helplessness and vulnerability, which every human being must contend with, mind you. In the case of the bully, they experience excruciating anxiety that their mask of superiority might slip and their failings would inadvertently be demonstrated to others. They can't stand the idea that they might be judged and possibly rejected for their inadequacies. Psychologically, vulnerability and inadequacy can appear contagious. For those of us who can tolerate these aspects of ourselves, the weakness of others isn't experienced as a threat. For the bully, they're terrified how the victim's weakness might rub off on them. Their anxiety turns into rage- the rage of the helpless, overwhelmed beast who lashes out at the object which threatens them. This terrifying object is the nerd, the social outcast, the person who is different. The victim of bullying is going through life minding their own business. Perhaps they are someone who is fascinated with subjects deemed ""uncool"" in the high school milieu; perhaps they have a condition such as Asperger's disorder which causes them to be socially awkward in the workplace. They might as adults have PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, and be overly-sensitive in social situations. Whatever the case, the victim of bullying hasn't done anything to provoke the bully, except appear less powerful and less socially acceptable than the average person in their midst. This, unfortunately, is the trigger for the bully's rage. The victim's apparent inadequacy is an affront to the bully, who employs the defense of projection in order to cope with being confronted by an outward manifestation of their inner helplessness. The bully projects - much like a movie projector sends an image onto a screen- their own self-loathing onto the victim. This, then, turns into hatred for the victim, who must be punished for causing the bully such anxiety. The bully can't stand to see their own inadequacy and vulnerability being embodied by the victim, and must destroy it. Everyone, in order to live a good life, ultimately must be able, in their process of psychological development, to acknowledge and accept their own innate vulnerability, helplessness and inadequacy. We must all come to terms with our weakness and our imperfection. We must be able, as the great British psychoanalyst and author Adam Phillips says, to ""bear being hated,"" and to overcome our own hatred of the awkward, inept parts of ourselves. While the socially awkward person is often aware of and has come to terms with being different, the bully is someone who rejects their own awkwardness and inadequacy. When they scapegoat or attack others, it represents a rejection of the self, an act of self-loathing and self-destruction, at least of the unwanted parts of themselves. While on the surface it appears like an act of domination and subjugation, bullying is actually an act of desperation, where the bully is frantically trying to obliterate the physical manifestation of their secret, disowned frailty. Although their acts might be aggressive and even violent, the bully is in reality a terrified child in a state of panic about the possibility of recognizing or revealing their terrible feelings of helplessness. It will be impossible to eradicate bullying and harassment unless we recognize where it comes from. Aside from empowering the victims of bullying and putting sanctions in place for the bullies, it is essential to address the deep-seated fears and self-loathing on the part of those who engage in these behaviors. Until we begin working on getting them to accept themselves, they will never be able to overcome their hatred for those threatening ""weaklings"" who represent their own, disowned weakness.""

The N in your life can't stand you- not because you're selfish, lazy, stupid, ungrateful, too sensitive, naive or whatever horrible adjectives your N likes to use. Your N can't stand you because you remind them of the void they intuitively know exists inside of them. That huge, gaping hole of hard, black *nothingness* in their heart they know they can't ever fill- a dead empty thing where there should be a living, breathing capacity for truth, authenticity, vulnerability, humility, joy, love and compassion for others. The more capacity for empathy you have, the more you offend and outrage them because you remind them of what they don't have. And with your realness and empathy, you have the capacity to live free- free from the bondage of getting your self-worth from what others do for you or think of you. Freedom from the bondage of getting self-worth through fleeting or material things. You are free because you're capable of stripping through all the bullshit that defines the N's life- and that means you can find true happiness and peace where they can't. That explains why they attack you. Why they guilt you, and burden you with accusations in order to transfer their dysfunction and disorder onto you. Why they use fear, obligation and guilt to distract you from living your free and authentic life. Why they aren't threatened by others like them, or others who are not self-aware or empathetic enough to see the N's emptiness for what it is- instead they use them...to attack you. Because you have what they don't. So rather than look inwards and try to self-reflect and improve themselves or their lives which would mean they'd have to admit something is very wrong, they choose to look outwardly by weighing you down and destroying the joy you could otherwise be feeling, because they know you can feel it, and they resent that. Understand that in the end they are truly bereft and pitiable. They can never be as genuinely free and happy as you have the capacity to be, because their self-worth is all external. They can't exist without emotionally draining others, because that is what makes them tick. They can't stand that you can be independent from this, that you're stronger than them internally because you have the capacity to feel good things and bad things without using someone else as a crutch. What they seek to destroy- protect it, let it flourish. Find your self-worth, your independence. Continue to cultivate your beautiful capacity for selflessness, humility, kindness, and empathy. Let this grow into your fullest potential- of being loving, joyful, and free."

Perhaps afraid isn't the right word. Embarrassed? I'm not sure that's right either, but here goes. I was raised by a narcissistic father and codependent mother. In reading the stories here and elsewhere, I almost feel ashamed calling him a narcissist as I clearly have not had it as bad as many. Yet, I'm still affected by their dynamics years later. I've been estranged from my father for 5 years now, though he sends a Christmas card and money (more manipulation that I choose not to respond to at this point). Life is infinitely better on that front. What I struggle with is the fact that I am still paying for his actions. After years of verbal (and I suspect some physical) abuse, my mother became obese and lacks all self-confidence. As the years (and now months) go by, her condition deteriorates and it's to the point that I worry about her daily, often going to her house multiple times a week to help with laundry, chores, etc. It's a major part of my life at this point. Perhaps I should blame my mom for not picking her life up, or at least I should acknowledge her responsibility in the current situation, but I can't. I just feel pity. I know at least in some part what she went through, and I'm lucky enough to have had the strength to stop contact, but she didn't. Who am I to question why? I feel guilty for feeling like taking care of her is an obligation. Then I feel even more resentment towards my father for his part in all of this. My brother lives in the same town and is married. He rarely sees or contacts my mom, and has even less of a relationship with my father although are still in contact. I've struggled with some resentment towards him since childhood, wondering why he was loved and not me. Lately that resentment has been due to the fact that I take care of my mother and not him. I'm too much of a coward to even raise this with him. When it comes to relationships, I've had very few. I struggle to open up to people and show any vulnerability. I suppose it's because I've seen what happens when someone is too vulnerable and dependent. Instead, I do things alone almost exclusively (concerts, trips, movies, etc.). I don't ask for help or companionship. There's always the risk of abandonment or rejection, feelings that I commonly had as a child. I cringe when a date asks the question, ""Are you close with your family?"" Even if I say that I'm close with my mother, it leads to more questions. Uncomfortable questions. I typically gloss over it by saying that my father isn't in my life, or that he lives out of town. Often that screams, ""Daddy issues!"" On the rare occasion (twice) when I've told a boyfriend about my father and my upbringing, I feel as though it's not acknowledged as something as weighty and profound as it was. I should just get over it. My last bf claimed that I had put him into my ""box of daddy issues."" I seem to waiver between being cold, aloof, and refusing to open up at all about him or being vulnerable and having it thrown back in my face. At this point, I know I'm not in a good place for a relationship, but will I ever be? I'm a very logical person and quite introverted. I know that my defenses and walls are getting in the way of my life. I know that I need to get over them if I'm ever going to realize the life I want to have. I just don't know how. Thank you so much for reading. This is the first time I've made the leap from crying about this in the shower to actually putting it into written word. It's quite cathartic. "

She got my edad (maybe ndad too, tbh) to yell at me and physically assault my husband, then threatened to call the cops on us. It was the last straw. I'm done. But... I can also remember when my mom is more normal. When we're super close and it seems like things are going well... as long as I toe the line, I guess. Whenever I speak out, I notice things get sour for a bit. I'd say she has FLEAS, if not is a full on narc, but I am pretty certain she is. And yet it's the good times in between the freak outs that have me second guessing myself. I am not about to reestablish contact. My children were put in danger today and I have to protect them, but I want to understand more, I guess."
432,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,DAE have parents that treat them differently around certain friends than others?,3,4vp3la,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4vp3la/dae_have_parents_that_treat_them_differently/,2016-08-02 08:09:16,"Like something I have definitely noticed over the years is that my Nmom will never scream or get nasty to me or otherwise show her true nature around certain people. These people include: 1. Adults who are around her age and aren't mentally ill themselves. 2. Certain friends of mine. The first one is really super obvious why she wouldn't. Someone will call her out on it and/or tell other people that she's a crazy asshole. The second one is something that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense but as I think about it, it kind of does. I have other friends who like me, are a bit mentally ill and I think my Nmom can pick up on that. ""Oh this is a vulnerable person and nobody will ever believe them that I'm crazy. I can be nasty to my daughter around them as much as I want."" These are the friends who are just as terrified and upset by my mom as I am, because they've had a taste of what kind of person she actually is. Then there are the other friends who my mom just prefers to try and covertly say bad things about me to. One friend who she's done that to is an accountant and is one of the few people I know who my Nmom puts in high regards. My friend later told me that my mom was making them quite uncomfortable and they knew what she was trying to do. Another person who I doubt my mom would scream at me in their presence would be my most recent ex. Me and my ex are still on good terms and very much so still good friends and they know all about how bad my Nmom is because they've known me for years. My mom and my ex have never spoken or met but my Nmom does know a lot about them. (Reason as to why they've never spoken or met is because my ex lives on the other side of the world lol.) Like my accountant friend, my ex has also had jobs that my Nmom considers skilled/prestigious and regards my ex to be highly intelligent and capable. Then again now that I think about it, should they ever meet my Nmom might just show her actual self because my ex is actually more mentally ill than I am in some regards and I imagine Nmom would probably sense it then. One other friend she would never be mean to me around was someone who was another N himself. Also, he would actually tell me that I shouldn't ""be so mean to your poor mom"" whenever I'd try and tell him that my mom's actually a crazy old bat who will eat your soul. \_()_/ Basically, my mom seems to be able to hone in on vulnerability and mental illness and she treats me like crap around those people while being nice and sweet to me in front of people who she perceives as being more stable. Does anyone else have parents that do this?"

I waited until summer so I could finish grade 10. I did okay. I had a job and a place to live. I wasn't homeless. But aside from that I struggled. I met three men who befriended me and took advantage of my vulnerability, innocence, isolation and inability to say ""no"". (thanks mom) I had issues with eating before I left home, and even in times when I wanted to eat normally I struggled with things like cooking and grocery shopping. I was very hungry almost all of the time. I struggled to find a highschool that would accept me as a student. When fall came, I bought a light coat at a thrift store. When winter came I bought a cheap pair of ""boots"" that were basically just tall summer shoes. Aside from the skiing stuff my parents gave me, I didn't know anything about winter clothes. Aside from winter sports, I was never outside for long in the winter. My familiy lived in the country and drove everywhere, so I had never had to wait in the wind and cold for a late public transit bus, or walk half an hour just to catch that bus, get groceries or go to work. I definitely couldnt afford a ski jacket or sport quality boots, and I tried to do the best I could with the little money I had, but I didn't know how. My thrift store jacket wasn't suitable for anything colder than -10 C (15 F), and that was a cold, windy winter. There were a lot of -30 and -40 days (-20, -40 F) that year. My feet were freezing in those shitty boots and I wore as many thin cotton PJ pants as I could fit under my jeans, and layered my thin hoodies under my coat. I was still very, very cold. I rented a basement suite and the couple above me moved out at Christmas. They turned off the heat when they left and I was too dissociated to realize what had happened, that it wasn't somehow my fault, and that I could do something about it. I didn't realize that I could call my landlord to come turn it back on and he wouldn't be mad. I turned the oven on max and I'd sit in front of it to stay warm. I was very lonely, very cold and very hungry that year. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was also so young. "

So, every couple of years or so E Mom wants to go see her mom in another state. N Dad has ALWAYS had a problem with it, but it wasn't really bad until recently. My grandma doesn't really like him (and rightfully so), and as a narc this really triggers him. The last time she was at our house he violently yelled at her because she said something about the dishwasher being loud. The last time she went (4 years ago) he exploded. He was ranting about ""that bitch"" and told us kids (my sister and I, both under 18 at the time) to pack up as we were leaving for another state. I don't remember what got him so mad, but he was absolutely psycho. I remember when he was yelling at me for not packing I said something like ""You make my life a living hell!"" and he started to tell me how he could show me how bad it could really get or something by sending me off on a boot camp. My sister was there to comfort me, but I was still really afraid. He then said something like ""the only thing you have to be afraid of is me getting my gun and shooting myself in the head"". He is usually crazy but this was extra fucked up. His N Mom, whom I kinda like, talked some sense into him so we drove to her house and he calmed down. I know narcs don't change, but she's never been that awful to me or my sister so I'm really grateful for her. Anyway, fast forward to where we are now. EMom wants to go visit her mom again (in another state) and NDad is doing everything he can to stop this. This morning I witnessed the most blatant manipulation it made me sick to my stomach. For some background, Mom eats out of his freaking hand. She never calls him out on anything and goes with whatever he wants. That makes his rant that much more incoherent. He started talking about how disrespectful she was to him. He brought up her ""interrupting"" him while talking. What he means by ""interrupting"" is saying anything in a conversation that he doesn't approve of. He brought up how she never believes in his dreams (wtf lol). He told her that he had felt a ""separation"" between our family (he brings this up anytime one of us does something he doesn't like), and that by her SEEING HER MOTHER, she was splitting us up. He pulled every trick in the book, he faked emotional vulnerability, made it seem like she actually had a choice in this, and lied his ass off. Every time he berated her, he made sure to circle back to how godly and gifted he is to make sure she couldn't doubt him. I had to sit there in another room listening to this display of pure narcissism. By saying anything I make it worse. There is nothing I can do and this haunts me daily. I'll post another update if she gets to see her mom, but that is unlikely. Sigh "

The other day I reached to the door of a support group center and stopped there. I think it's more than just fear and guilt.

I'm conditioned to think that I am a perfect person and I should not ask for help. I feel sick and frustrated and agony about this. Instead of feeling guilty, I rather felt loathed that I am actually ""deficit""(aka needs help) and need someone to help me.

436,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,I realized why I wanted to not want kids because my discovery of gentle parenting.,122,4r3wzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4r3wzt/i_realized_why_i_wanted_to_not_want_kids_because/,2016-07-04 07:29:26,"I've discovered a few instagrams &amp; YT channels of moms who document some of the ways they parent their children through gentle parenting &amp; attachment parenting. Things like natural weaning, co-sleeping, baby-wearing, emotional openness and vulnerability, etc. And most importantly: RESPECTING THEIR CHILD. Respecting that their child is an *individual human being* that they brought into this world to be RAISED and LOVED. And I'm just so obsessed with it. I'm not going to have kids any time soon, I'm 20 and single, but I'm just so into it now. I never used to want to have kids, I was against it completely and would just be ""the best aunt ever"" to my brothers kids when/if they decide to have any. And I know why now. I hated my parents way of raising me. Negative emotions were punishable, any defiance at all was punishable, hell, I learned not to say ""no"" to my mom ever when I was four years old. I was taught to be quiet, agreeable, and do what adults wanted me to. When I was sad or needed something, it was a rare occurrence to have it addressed by my parents. Me and my brothers were never human beings to them. We were like their property, we had to obey and perform to their whim. Any habits or personal traits they didn't like were squashed. I thought that was just how it was. I thought that was what parenting was. Parents owning their kids. My friends growing up also had shitty parents, I think only one of my friends had good parents who loved her and parented her positively and I always thought she was exaggerating it. So I was just used to it. The idea that any parent would actively try to make their child happy and treat them like a unique and respect-worthy person was laughable to me because I was taught that kids aren't equal to adults ever. They're inferior, they are to be directed by adults all the time and they are to be moulded into model citizens. Kids exist UNDER adults, not alongside them. Bullshit. Well holy smokes. Now I'm seeing these parents with healthy happy children and mottos like ""If you wouldn't treat an adult you respect like that, don't treat your kid like that."" who are open about the way they behave with their children. One mom (one of my fav YTers) talked once about how when her 4 y.o daughter is sad or when she makes her angry, she talks to her. She sits her down and they talk through emotions and deal with them. She even said that when she fights with her husband loudly or when she accidentally yells at her daughter, she APOLOGIZES for it and talks to her about how that was an unhealthy expression of negative emotions. She is teaching her four year old daughter how to manage her difficult feelings and showing her how to be a compassionate person. Like my mind is blown right now. If my parents had been like this, I could be so mentally healthy right now. If my parents were open to my feelings, I'd probably be so much happier. Like it's so hard for me to even believe that these families exist. Happy kids, happy parents, happy families. And when they aren't happy? That's okay. That's something we work through AS A FAMILY. Now I'm just so into gentle parenting I am in love with it. If I could get married and have kids tomorrow, I would. I'm so elated to find out about this, it's like a revelation that parents and children can have happy and secure relationships. My relationship with my parents isn't bad, I have no intention of going NC but we aren't close. I don't tell them when I'm having a tough time or when I have a secret. We make small-talk about Game of Thrones and go out for coffee sometimes. That's it. But to know that parents can have kids and treasure them? Love them? Go above and beyond for them? I want that so much. I want to adopt kids man, I just want to love them and give them good lives. I want to raise human beings that are happy and healthy and loving. I'm just blown away (in case you couldn't tell rofl). I didn't want kids most of my life because I just saw parenting as this negative thing, like a burden. Like it was some ""favour"" I would be doing my kids, instead of a loving responsibility. All I saw was the negative sides, the money, the time, the energy, the punishments, the control. But that's bullshit. That's not how you parent. You don't make your kid be a certain kind of person. You don't hold basic parental responsibilities over their heads. You help them flourish as the person they are. You encourage individuality and curiosity. You are responsible for their health and well-being AND THAT IS A BLESSING. I want to be a mom now so badly. I want to have kids that are raised to be happy and to love others. I want to teach my kids how to work with their emotions and their troubles. I want them to trust me and to share their difficulties and happinesses with me. I want to give them good lives and I never want them to find themselves on this subreddit (no offense my friends) wondering why I wasn't loving to them, or why I acted badly to them. Now that I know this is possible, that this is something you can actually do, I want it so badly. Edit: You guys are so awesome. &lt;3"

I had a fwb for eight months, and have hooked up with a couple of people casually, but I'm tired of casual sex. I've worked on myself enough that I'm not attracted to completely unavailable women or Ns. However, I'm still attracted to women that are emotionally unavailable. The general problem is that while I crave more of a connection, intimacy terrifies me, so when I find someone I'm romantically interested in, it's two steps forward, one step back (mixed signals are great to give off!) or I find ways to push them away because I'm absolutely terrified of rejection. There's a girl that I like, known her for about a month, and I know that we aren't going to date (my mixed signals at the start and fact she's leaving in a month see to that). I'm probably not ready anyway to date because of the intimacy issues, but I wanted to be for her. When I'm around her, I'm finding that I'm revealing things that I'm largely uncomfortable talking about, and it's like they just come out of me - I have no control, like these things have just decided to be spoken to her by my brain. I think that her presence allowed me to do something that I've never been able to do previously, and never thought I could. There's some sort of connection, but it doesn't feel crazy or too intense like infatuation or a crush - just solid and present, like what I have with my best friend, except I'm attracted to her. I think I'm starting to fall for her and it absolutely terrifies me. Anyway, I'm having trouble because of the increasing intimacy/feelings and I realized that I was scared and doing things to try to push her away. We're going to have to work together on a hobby for the next month or so, which means that I can't keep pushing her away, because we work well together. I'm planning on talking with her about it (apologizing for pushing her away and explaining that I'm scared), but I could use ideas on how to not freak out if we continue to get closer. Also could use general information about how to get more comfortable with intimacy and vulnerability. Or just advice that might be helpful."

Now, I'm a 24 year old single girl and I haven't dated much. I realized that not having a decent home life growing up(thanks to my nMom) left me with this incessant need to have normal things happen to me and to have people I can call my own and count on. I don't know how long this thought will stay with me but I wanted to share it in a safe place where people would understand my vulnerability and where I'm coming from. I have never known a day in my life when I haven't felt insecure. I think what I want is that assurance, that deep and honest trust and simplicity that comes from building a home and a family with another person. I don't know how it all works, I just know I wish to have it happen to me. And I believe I will make a decent mother. "

I thought it might be interesting to some of you: &gt; Individuals scoring higher on the interpersonal/affective aspects of psychopathy (Factor 1) are more accurate at judging victim vulnerability simply from viewing targets walking (Wheeler, Book, &amp; Costello, 2009). The present study examines the relation between psychopathy and accuracy in assessing victim vulnerability in a sample of inmates from a maximum security penitentiary in Ontario, Canada. Forty-seven inmates viewed short video clips of targets walking and judged how vulnerable each target was to victimization. Higher Factor 1 psychopathy scores (as measured by the PCL-R; Hare 2003) were positively related to accuracy in judging victim vulnerability. Not sure that there's really a ""news you can use"" side to this--but it does make me feel a bit less responsible, if that makes sense. If psychopaths/abusers are able to key into something so unconscious and unintentional as walking style, and it has nothing to do with ""it's what you're putting out there/your attitude/how you relate to people""/victim-blaming crap, it's kind of a relief."

So I(21F) was always an artsy kid growing up(still am). I loved to draw and paint, dance and sing, write short stories and poetry. Well I just realized for the first time how funny it is that when I wrote poems or painted things that were dark/sad/depressive, my nparents and nsis would always have the strangest reactions(when I could even get them to look at what I made.) They would look at/read it with an uncomfortable look on their face and say something like ""that's... Uh... Creepy/weird/depressing"" My nmom especially would get very uncomfortable if I ever painted a woman in the nude(which I do often, something to do with vulnerability perhaps?) her reaction was always immediately ""it's a naked lady"" Like that was the most important part of the painting. Before I realized that I was abused and that my art was simply voicing my subconscious feelings and emotions, I believed I was some sort of creep, some sort of messed up freaky teen who liked to paint naked women and write poems about death. I just realized how funny it is that they would always be uncomfortable with this. Maybe it's because they know deep down that they fucked me up? Anyway it's nice that the reactions that used to hurt my feelings are making me smile now. I no longer feel like a creep, just an artist."

But i had just read so much about narcissists and everything and it all just became too much for me. So when she started going off on me again it hit a nerve and I decided to argue back and tell her to fuck off (I didn't actually say that but u know). So essentially that whole thing was quite traumatic for me and I ended up in tears and she did what Narcs do. Laugh at my vulnerability. So as usual I never expected her to change or listen to whatever I was rambling on about before, infact I had thought she would be completely the same without a moments twitch. But she wasn't at all. Suddenly for the past day or two she was somewhat nice to me. For a moment I had started to consider the switched role thing between the black sheep and the golden child. It seemed like she started to treat me like how she would treat my GC brother. (But deep down knew this was only due to the fact that my brother was quite stressed out and took it out on her) But I knew all was not as it seemed. And I had fear for what was to come. Good on that too. Two days only did she last with her Niceness before she reverted back to the same old ugly Nmum I know her to be. So today she had some friends over. And the old Nmum took over. Suddenly she had a problem with everything I did and said. There was this moment when her friend tried to talk to me, and I replied to her and then suddenly Nmum made a comment questioning what I said. I was however talking to her friend not my Nmum and I really did not like how she was monitoring the conversation. So as to see whether I say anything wrong or anything she wouldn't say and etc. And it annoyed me. I however repeated my statement once again this time making sure everyone knew and she didn't brother to say a word about that. There was this other incident the same night where I had tried to make tea for myself and she attacked me for it. So there was the dish plate incident, where we all had to eat, and I had thought it would only be nice enough to take out plates so that we all could eat. There were three plates near the basin and I took those and placed them on the table. My Nmum however found a problem with that. She questioned why I would only take out three plates and not 6 as that was how many people there were I however did this without a moments thought and I hadn't been close to the cupboard where the plates were Nmum however was nearer to the cupboard and yet I was painted as the selfish child. As usual I rubbed it off and went on with the night. As the night went on I decided I wanted some tea. And my cup was in the basin which she happened to be standing at atm unfortunately. As usual I knew the drill about washing up my own cup cus I had god knows how lectures thrown at me about my cups in the basin. So as I was about to wash the cup she made a comment about why I couldn't just wait till she was done and then come and do what I want and etc. I found this alarming cuz before I found that it was a common thing for me to do one thing in the 1st basin while she was busy in the other. I got annoyed and I told her I just wanted to wash my cup and left immediately. So as this was going on her friend came to help her with whatever she was doing in the basin. And her friend happened to stand in the way of the draw in which I needed to get a tea spoon for my tea, which I was in the process of making. I politely asked her friend to move so that I could get a spoon. And then suddenly my mum made another comment about this. At this point I grew quite annoyed and angriliy told her I just needed a spoon that's all. As this was happening her friend tried to console me but suddenly made an alarming comment about how I needed to Get out more. At first I didn't understand why she would say this, I hadn't however naively thought Nmum hadn't spoken about me to her friend or anything. I just found the comment quite odd seeing as what had just unfolded before her. Anyways Nmum made a comment on how she totally agreed with that and if went out more, I wouldn't be home taking out my stress on her. Funny that. Essentially I made no comment on that and just had let it be. After that whole fiasco Nmum and her friend decided to go and spend the whole night at there neighbours, where she vanishes to every single day to do god knows what I'm not oblvious to there fact that she may have ratted me out to the neighbours as well. As essentially they do look and act diff to me (as to from the beginning) now when I'm around or happen to go around there for favours. So the probability of that place being the gossip hoo place of my selfish bitch daughter is fact. So initially her friend happened to bring her son who was around my age with her. As they were about to leave to go and do whatever, I had initially thought it would only seem common for her son to stay so that I could have some company while they were gone. My Nmum however did not want this. She then decides it would be best if her friends son came with them, because as she quoted Atleast our neighbour would talk to him, at least he would have someone to talk to. My neighbour happens to be around the same age as my Nmum. So I found this all quite strange. Not that having older friends was strange at all. But why would she make such a comment if I was here as well. And I had the ability to talk to him and etc. I found this very annoying and he eventually stayed. But it really did make a damb on the whole situation to begin with. So yeah, I did feel quite shitty about it all as the night ended but I eventually i got over it. If u read this whole thing thank u for hearing me rant. I just needed to get this out."
442,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Can my Parents change?

In light of feedback, I am posting it again here, for anyone interested in reading my thoughts on: Can my Parents change?) As a last note, for me at least - even if my parents did change - it doesn't matter now. They had 31 years to change. They never, ever did. Additionally, even if they did change, now that I'm a fully grown adult, I would face three problems: first, the damage is done. My brain knows that they are threats to my safety and well-being. Doesn't matter now - the damage has been done, and cannot be undone - especially, it cannot be undone by those that caused that damage. 2. It says nothing of a person that they change once a child grows up into an adult. ""The measure of a man is how he treats those who can do nothing for him."" How you treat a child, when you have all the power and they have none - says all you need to know about a person. Of course, if my parents changed now - now that I am grown, independent, and have the power to navigate my own life - who gives a fuck? They leveraged their power when they had it, they exploited me at my most fragile and vulnerable, they used their authority to harm me instead of help me. So if they change now - that they have no power to leverage and no vulnerability to exploit and no authority to use - what does that mean? Absolutely nothing. If they ""change"" - it will be of the false kind, like OP describes - and its intention will be to reel their victim back in, because they are scared to be alone and terrified of abandonment. What I needed and deserved, was for them to change while I was still a child, and to change out of an altruistic sense of cooperation and nurturance. But none such change came. Should it come now, it will be too late. Lastly, and most importantly - why should I continue to abuse myself as they abused me, by forcing myself into their presence or existence? I have suffered at their hands enough, I have suffered through their abuse enough, I have suffered through the misery they reigned on me for long enough. Why should I force myself to suffer now, abuse myself now, and reign misery upon myself now, by guilting and shaming myself back into their malicious, cold, cruel hands? Do I detest myself so much that I would do that to myself? If I return to those abusive relationships, I will never learn what true love is. I will keep myself in the loveless, careless cage that my abusers put me in, I will lock the door on myself, and I will never learn what it means to truly love and be loved, if I permit myself to stay chained to those who showed me the opposite of love for so long.

443,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Passive-aggresive joke and humiliation behavioural pattern,3,4o7tpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4o7tpa/passiveaggresive_joke_and_humiliation_behavioural/,2016-06-16 01:20:56,"I've found a reapeating pattern with my GF and I'm wondering what is going on here. She has problems with revealing her needs so sometimes she communicates in a way that I perceive as passive aggression. For example, let's say she wanted to do cooking together with me. Let's say I refused, because being busy, then she would say: ""I'm going to cook alone and that's very sad... I'm joking hahaha."". I'd say: ""I didn't know that you want me to help you, I'd have helped you if I had known."". Then she would say: ""That was a joke, you are so over-sensitive and have no sense of humour."" In such situations at first I feel like it is kind of passive-aggresive pseudo-joke. Afterwards I feel humiliated and ridiculed because I've shown my vulnerability. I'm planning to discuss that with her thoroughly, but as I've just discovered this pattern I wanted to ask - does someone know this kind of behaviour? Can it be narcissism related? Side node: I like cooking together and alone, we cook together from time to time."
444,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Poem/Short Story about my NMom (long),2,4ofddl,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4ofddl/poemshort_story_about_my_nmom_long/,2016-06-17 06:08:23,"To Mother  With Indifference I read an article once about how evolution depends on a mother falling in love with her child, and the child falling in love with their mother. Without this bond, the instinct to protect her offspring from harm would not exist, and the chances of the childs survival went down exponentially. This first attachment is apparently imperative to the perpetuation of our species. Reading on, I felt this knotting up in the pit of my guts with the unyielding question What about the child that does survive? The child that goes on existing against the odds - without the nurturing and protection and attachment and maternal care? What about her? It didnt take me long to realize I was asking about me. My mother is a force of nature. A power house. She is painfully beautiful the way most poisonous things are. Those moments where I had her complete undivided attention were so rare. She was always somewhere else, physically or mentally, just out of reach. Holding her attention for even a single moment felt the way Moses must have felt when God spoke to him. It felt the way a shot of heroin feels when you push the mix of brown and blood into your vein and suddenly there is nothing but warmth and the sense that everything is going to be okay. Oh, the absurd and ridiculous things I would do to stay in her favor  the parts of myself I destroyed to stand in her light. Love is still a drug if called by any other name. Except, this wasnt love. Not really. I worshipped my mother, and I think that was the point. That was always the plan. She was the sun - I was the moon. Always meant to complement her, like her token set of peacock feather earrings, but never outshine her. See, because love is also a weapon, especially when its snatched from underneath you like the very ground you stand on. Its a strange feeling knowing at some level that you are in competition with the woman who is meant to love you more than she loves herself. The person you depend on for your very survival. Be smart, but not too smart. Be pretty, but not prettier than me. In those moments of cold disapproval the silence felt like it stretched on for days. Sometimes it did. It was like walking a tight rope, constantly trying to find that balance between gaining her approval without stealing her spotlight. I have a daughter now and my greatest fear is passing this curse on to her. I feel like to some degree I have caught my mothers disease like fleas  narcissism by proxy. Emotional attachment is as ungraspable and distant to me as reality is to her. So, I had to sit with the big questions. What do I want this to look like? How can I stop this pendulum that just keeps vacillating between enmeshment-withdrawal, enmeshment-withdrawal, enmeshment-withdrawal? Now that Im a grown woman myself, I started noticing things that never felt right but I couldnt pinpoint where they came from. The way I questioned every single thought and feeling to determine whether it was appropriate, or rational, or going to make anyone uncomfortable. The way I knew I had this voice and these words desperate to come out, but they always got stuck in the back of my throat. The way I am incapable of emotional intimacy with another human being and not even understanding what that might feel like. Its bizarre how confused I once was, but how easily I can trace each of these things back to her today. I had no defense. Compliance was my only option, or I risked being the bird left in its nest to be devoured by some predator. And in some ways, I was anyway. There were these pivotal moments, milestones almost, where I needed so badly for my mother to be a mother, and she simply didnt have it in her. At best I was an extension of her, like a limb she would become infuriated with when it wasnt in her control, or a Barbie to be proudly displayed and spoken about always in regards to her superb parenting. At worst I was an inconvenience, a nuisance, the little pebble in her Tahari heels. I was ignored, shamed, and rejected simply for not being whatever she needed me to be in that moment. I was always second to whatever man she was trying to lure into her trap. She would endlessly wail about how my substance abuse was just Almost more than a mother could bear and would tell all of her friends how she used tough love and courage to get through that difficult time. I can count on my hands the amount of times I spoke to her during that 3 year period of my life. I always called her. Once or twice she called me and lashed me in that familiar tone about how all of this was affecting her. She lives 900 miles away. If my mother were a character it would be called The Strong Martyr. She is the lump in my throat. She is the doubt in my mind. She will not leave. Ive done a lot of work on my Mother. Ive been in therapy, gone to Family Constellations, Woman Within, scrawled her name too many times to count on 4th step inventories  always with the intention of understanding her. Why is she like this? What can I do to help her? What is my part in this? How can I better empathize with her? Her, her, her, her, her. Even in MY healing, its always been about her. How she feels. Some people call this Trauma Bonds but I prefer Stockholms Syndrome. The saddest part is that my feelings have been discounted and invalidated for so long that I accepted this. When everyone oozed on about how the solution is connection I bought in like a child racing to the dry well for water all over again. No more. I do not choose connection. Ive often considered a grand confrontation. Ive played out these come to Jesus moments where I put it all on the line, finally telling her exactly how Ive felt all these years and how I am still affected today by the horrors she treats with unsettling nonchalance. The problem is - Ive been trained not to. The reality, as it is and not how I would like it to be, is that my vulnerability would be smothered and invalidated by complete denial and minimization. Im so dramatic. Im so emotional. That wasnt her intention. Shes always put me first. If I pressed the issue, the way Im sure my blinding rage would insist upon, it would finally end in the weeping victim whimpering about doing the best that she could and how hard her life was, leaving me feeling like the bad guy. There is no win for me in challenging a person who sees no issue with their behavior. To tell a narcissist that they are in fact a narcissist is both self-defeating and futile. It is in her very nature to be oblivious to her faults. My goal isnt to hate my mother- not at all. I do not want to feel that fury and rage welling up in my belly as Im shaving my hair and eyebrows off at 14 years old in defiance of her diets  in rebellion against her gross syrupy superficiality. I do not want to wallow in the pain I felt when she moved across the country one month before I had my first and only child, and was absolutely baffled and appalled when I wouldnt Skype with her on demand. The woman who asks me Where did your ass go? with that toxic glare, after I got sober and looked beautiful for the first time in a long time. Always holding my breath. Always waiting for her reaction. My goal isnt to yearn for my mother either. The sad desperate longing of a beggar holding out his cup. I will no longer be the starving child who knows god damn well there isnt a scrap to be found in the refrigerator, but cant help opening the door every 5 minutes with that tiny inkling of hope. Just in case. Just in case. I will grieve for the mother I will never have. I will grieve for the childhood I did not get to experience. I will cry in frustration. . Self-nurture. I will embrace all of the feelings that I still dont fully trust. I will take care of myself. Ive had to learn how to give myself and my daughter the love I never received. My dream is indifference. My goal is the utter emotional freedom that can only come from total detachment. To respond to both her hysteria and her carrot dangling from a stick called love with  nothing. Total disregard. I do not want to waste one more precious minute of my life hustling for my worth - Trying to convince the woman who is supposed to love me unconditionally that I am, in fact, loveable. Trying to fix the unfixable. Vying for unattainable acceptance. Trying to prove my blood wrong. Today I choose autonomy. Ive been trying so hard to give myself permission to love my mother. Instead, I give myself permission - to love myself enough to let her go. "
445,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,[TW:All of the Above] Decided to go LC after years of effort last night. Wrote this last night in the midst of grief/acceptance. I hope some people can relate.,1,4ovmvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4ovmvi/twall_of_the_above_decided_to_go_lc_after_years/,2016-06-20 08:50:21,"(Long time lurker, first time poster. What I wrote is below. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to comment/express themselves in any way that is best for you.) I wish I had a mother who wasn't so coarse when she talks to other people. I wish I had a mother who doesn't judge how respectfully she should speak to other people on whether or not she has power over them. I wish I had a mother who could control her emotions better--who didn't seem like she catches on fire and starts firing at everyone when something upsets her. I wish I had a mother who didn't end up rationalizing blame for everything on everyone except for her. I wish I had a mother who could hold herself accountable for her own emotions. That she could talk with other people about how they're doing and what they're thinking with the same enthusiasm about the things that she wants to buy, the trips she wants to buy and all the money. The money is a means to significance in life, right? And it's an excuse. Wait, there's no depth to anything--everything is rushed, you're always getting to the next point to get to the next point to get to the next point.... So it's just an excuse, and that's the point. It's an excuse to lash out and harm. It's an excuse to call your six year old daughter a n----- for not cleaning up her room, it's an excuse for never seeming to be able to resist cajoling your children when they're sitting next to you and you're all talking to other people, ""joking"" about how they're ""lazy"", they ""don't clean up"", they're this, that, and for every one thing they do correct there's always an ability to find something else. The occasional positive here and there, but it's much more preferable to denigrate your shitty, sloppy kids, right? Because the worse they are, the better you look for having to put up with them, right? And cue your mother sagging her shoulders before your father gets home from work. I learn to play along, I learn the whole consensus that, ""Well that's just the way she is and we all love her"". But then occasionally I wonder why she doesn't have any friends. And I wonder why everyone she knows and I know has been in either a fight with her or her ""shit list"", so to speak. And it's because she'd rather have control over other people than connect with them. To do that shows vulnerability, you have to relinquish a little bit of control. And then you wonder why I just ended up crying for a half hour instead of raising my voice even though yours just got louder and louder and louder until it finally ending with the standard cutting insult towards me. And I am left with each bolt of years upon years of the same scar tissue, caged in my own mind with the ruminating echoes of contempt-dripped words, the motion to slit my own wrists with the blade on my bedroom floor, the pouring of the acidic tincture into the gaping wound you'd instructed me to create, the annoyed huffing as I screamed from the burning, the nonchalant shrug of the shoulders when my father asks why it sounds like I'm hurt upstairs. All of them layer in the swath of plaque that suffocates my malnourished heart, mutating each memory of closeness with another human being into blistering torrents of fear. Maybe I wanted to keep talking because I was hoping eventually you could calm down and end the conversation without feeling like you have to charge me down like I'm some sort of target. But then I forget that's not how you treat people. And I forget you couldn't care less that you do. I won't be punished with the inevitable guilt blackout from you this time, the refusal to speak to me. I won't accept you off-loading your responsibility as a mother and human being to treat other people with care onto me. I welcome the silence. I will embrace it this time, and, through the anguish of accepting the loss of a connection that was never really there to begin with, one that I tirelessly fought for in the face of egregious self-centeredness, apathy and cruelty both casual and malevolent: I will let go, and I will heal and grow."
446,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Anyone else out there who is extremely unemotional?,9,4gdcgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4gdcgj/anyone_else_out_there_who_is_extremely_unemotional/,2016-04-25 23:38:52,"In my continuing adventures in therapy, Therapist poked through to some interesting moments and issues last week. The memory that came up in context, was a very vivid recollection I have of being 6 years old and going into the bathroom in the house to get away from nMom because she'd been screaming at me about something, and I just stood in the bathroom telling myself not to cry, because if she saw that I cried it would give her some satisfaction. Even then I knew that at times she was yelling at me or hitting me because she *enjoyed* hurting me. Therapist says that this was me learning that I can't trust others with my emotions, and shutting myself off from vulnerability. I have to admit - I don't cry, I rarely get excited, I don't get angry really either, I just sort of go about my business most of the time. I always minimize when I talk about my past, and I don't discuss my feelings. Instead I learned to ""perform"" the appropriate reactions (happiness, sadness, excitement) so others wouldn't notice. At first when we were discussing these things, I was pretty pleased that this was ""just"" a result of the abuse I went through, and that maybe I could free myself from it. But the longer I thought on it the more part of me says no, this is you. You simply ARE unemotional. The fact that you are is WHY nMom reacted to you the way she did. Your emotions are not locked away - they were never there to begin with. "
447,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,That time when I tried to be myself/an adult and deal with an issue with M (ndad) but only made it worse. [rant] [comment] [advice] [text heavy],1,4gwqfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4gwqfa/that_time_when_i_tried_to_be_myselfan_adult_and/,2016-04-29 09:26:58,"Cast: M: sperm donor T: woman M lives with, has two small children (not his) Twin: No one has seen nor heard from her since 2011. She's cut all family off and I'm thinking she has the right idea. D: beloved (now) husband Myself: SexyBleuBox Against my own judgement, I allowed D to meet M and T. They are usually very judgemental and I end up hurt after any interaction. I really wanted my dad in my life, so I've really been trying for the past 7ish years as an adult. I knew D and I were going to get married (YAY we eloped!) so I figured this is as good a time as any for them to meet. DAMN I could have skipped all this and just gone to the comfort of my own home and watched Netflix. Letter to M: I wouldn't have said anything and would have kept everything the way it was except that T (woman my ndad lives with, 2 kids that are not his, 11 and 13) decided my actions were somehow an insult to her instead of attempting to understand what actually happened. I've finally recovered enough to write this out, which has obviously taken some time. I'm going against my #1 rule here, which is ""Above all, show no weakness."" I'll likely live to regret it, but here it goes. The day D(fiance, now husband) arrived, I told T we would not be staying. I knew certain things would happen and I wanted to avoid them so she responded to that by trying to convince me to stay. I wanted to finally give D a chance to meet you as this was (I have no idea why) very important to him and I've been saying no for about a year. As you can probably understand, since none of your shit got done (M asked a week before we arrived if D would help him rearrange his garage/basement, they moved a few boxes and accomplished nothing due to M's lollygagging) and none of mine got dealt with and the only thing that was accomplished is that you guys finally got a chance to meet, I am frustrated with the whole experience. I deeply regret allowing this meeting to happen, but at the very least, he'll stop asking now. Remember I said he is nicer than I am? He is. He is always willing to give people another chance and has a great heart. My response to people hassling me is to cut them out completely, right after they show me they will never change. You know this. Because of him, I'm giving this another chance. Since you and T are always trying to help with life lessons, I'll just say it. Whatever you think my reality is, it's totally misguided. I have some very real issues but obviously, the ones I tell you about are generally not that big a deal. See #1 rule. I've pretty much-done everything on my own for a while now, and the life lessons you choose to share generally don't have any practical application to my life or I learned them years ago. I'm 25, I've been experiencing a variety of major issues for quite some time now. I don't appreciate T telling me I have no idea how some things are as I've never experienced them. Ex. custody issues (I experienced them at 15-17), living on my own (various forms of this since 2009), relationships (boyfriends off and on since 18). I can provide specific examples if you feel that's necessary. How would she like if every time she did something I thought was stupid, I criticized her? Ex. living in a huge house and doesn't purge the shit she doesn't need/use, eating out all the time while complaining about money, jumping to conclusions about people she has never met (crticized my mom, who she has never met). I don't, because while I might not agree with her decisions, it's not my life and I was not asked for advice. I have established these boundaries in every aspect of my life (years ago) except where the two of you are concerned. I thought that if I didn't deal with it, I wouldn't have to. Clearly I was mistaken. I feel forgotten and like I don't matter when you guys ""forget"" my bday and Xmas but for some reason, hope springs eternal. It's time for this to stop. Remember it, forget it, whatever. I've stopped celebrating Xmas because it's just so damn sad. D and I went to Steak n Shake Xmas 2015 because when I was presented with every possible option, I just wanted to be left alone. The month of December, I gifted him things he needed and he got me things I wanted. No gifts Xmas day. Since I keep feeling pressured from all sides to take a meaningful and high paying job, I want to be a waitress out of spite. I realize what qualities I need to look for in a job, I've been job searching for years. I've probably done more research than both you and T combined on that particular subject. (T is currently out of work and freelancing, money issues and tells me that I should find someone with a lot of assets, nothing else matters). I assume at this point you've likely read the text I sent T which you may need to interpret as she seemed to have trouble comprehending what I said. (It was a list of 10 things I was going through which culminated in me almost checking myself into a psych facility, straight forward and her reply turned it around to be my fault). Now, you have two choices. You can accept this or reject it. Our relationship is not the same as it was anymore. You can thank T for that. Getting upsetting texts for an unavoidable action I took will no longer be tolerated and if we want to play the nice/mean to force any answer at all/nice game again, I'm not playing. Option 1) Accept it. I'll treat you exactly the same as I treat everyone else in my life. Stop all special treatment entirely and I'll tell you what I'm really thinking instead of giving you non-answers. I know you don't really care about D, but I suggest you start liking him if you want me to keep coming around. He could be your greatest ally in our relationship so you may want to reconsider your original position. Option 2) Reject it. Let me know what address you want the phone sent to and we will likely never speak again. It's cool if you want the phone back, I was preparing for this anyway, it'll inconvenience me a bit but nothing earth shattering. Anyway, let me know which one you choose. Which M took a week to respond to: OK. I've reviewed the written, the spoken and the acting out. Because of your projections of condescension and contempt towards those who care about you, me in particular, I'm unwilling to argue about your stated grievances. I know what I know. While I see a little wiggle room on some of your contentions, by and large your arguments don't really hold water. As I've said, I'm unwilling to argue with this scoffing nature you now present. For example, we had a good score on an account, so treat you guys with dinners out. Result, you say we're wasting money and throw that in my face. Well, you'll not get an argument from me on that point now. We don't even take ourselves out like that. You're welcome. It's notable how you're ready to discount a very tough summer with the job loss, having to take T's mother from skilled nursing, to hospital, to hospice to funeral parlor (all around the time of your birthday), to say nothing of Trish grieving a parent (who did NOT throw her out of her house when she was 18). You're answer? Mary died. I'm on my period. You didn't remember my birthday. From the wreckage that had become, yes I did remember and told you so, but I'm only worthy of your contempt and punishment? There are some very significant factors you are overlooking entirely, some of which shall have a direct bearing on you and your life going forward. I would discuss those, again but for this bewildering presentation of contempt, which apparently confers upon you license to lash out at others indiscriminately. So be it. Here is my word to you, my daughter: First, beware the perils of circular logic, especially when you feel anger and resentment rising hard. It should be suspicious to you; meriting investigation. It is a vile thing to later find that you betrayed yourself. Second, recognize that people from both sides of your family have been dealing with varying degrees of depression for generations. Some very profound. In my lifetime I have seen a great many coping mechanisms to counter these. None, in my estimation, worked to any great degree. In almost every case, therapy was rejected and the very idea supplanted with weighty rationalizations as to why it should not be considered. I cannot speak in any great detail about your mother's side of the family, but I know Darren (her cousin) died (1990/91). Do you remember the circumstances? (No, I was 1) (I I know his parents were depressed, (before he died). Your great grandmother, your grandfather Duane, his wife, his children, the Achey's; it's a notable factor here. From my side, your great grandfather (suicide), all aunts and uncles from my father's side, (Uncle James dead of alcoholism at 41; died in our home), your great grandmother, your grandmother, your grandfather, all my siblings and myself have struggled with depression. Some of these people were strong; some were not. I am very well acquainted with the condition and the attendant ancillary problems and conditions that present. You and D are depressed. (I have no idea what gave him the idea that D is depressed) It is of a kind that can foment ingrained dysfunction or bring life to a halt if it is not effectively countered. Since you find your father so worthy of contempt, effectively shutting down any hope of useful dialogue, I urge both of you to make a first priority of seeking out a therapist that you can connect with. I understand that this would take effort, but it can be done. Many times I heard at my grandmothers table, aunts and uncles poo-pooing the idea of therapy based on one shallow experience. It was to their own great detriment and they took the pain of their existence to their graves. Functional vs. non-functional: from my side, my parents, my grandfather on mothers side, grandmother from fathers side, my Uncle David, your Grandaddy Duane, did have something going for them, and that was strength. It plugged them into a functional role and let them access their power to produce, despite their depression, disappointments and counterintuitive and even sometimes counterproductive behaviors, like anger; like a great deal of anger. Find a therapist you like. Tell your story. Begin at the beginning. Tell them about your parents. That they met in March, married in December. That your mother was in a hurry, and that your father filed for divorce three months into the marriage That he was not permitted to know you had been born until many weeks after, that he was not permitted to know your name. That the first birth certificate didn't identify me as father (public record). That you do not bear my name to this day. Tell that I did not get to see you until you were three months old. Say how your father knowingly returned to a loveless marriage to live with a woman who had gone down the aisle not loving him. That he gave up much to make this happen. How he was unwilling to leave you and your sister's side. Tell him about the control and abuse your mother doled out to the people in the family and then, tell about your mother's liaison with Gary Brevko, what he did, (molested my 15/16 year old twin, I don't know what really happenend, there was no real proof) how I went to State Crimes Unit and got the sexual battery unit detectives involved on behalf of your sister. How their investigation was frustrated by your mother. How Politician office refused to prosecute, because the key witness was deemed uncooperative, in their opinion at your mother's instigation, that nothing could stick. How your father filed for divorce again, fifteen years later, how he lost all worldly goods and assets before attorney's fees during a $44,000 grudge match instigated by your mother, who was determined to damage me even more. Tell how I earned and took loans to pay for the pleadings to get you to school, evaluated, therapy, etc. (I dropped out of highschool at 17, best thing I could have done, now have a bachelors and half my masters) How not a single penny was paid toward division of assets. Tell how all of my pleadings were granted, but not even one, not even legal fees, were granted to your mother. Tell how your mother defied each and every court order and how she was found in contempt as a result. Judges are finders of fact. Don't forget that like me, you were forced out of the house with whatever you had on you; me with whatever I could quickly stuff in the car. Take a moment to consider what kind of commitment, patience, resolve and strength it might take to go through a gauntlet like this, and for years, and this, but a partial list; just the highlights. That time is past. The public record shows that all of my pleadings to the court were about your and Twin's welfare only. Remember how the top priority was to attack me, to defeat me and how you and your sister readily signed up for that. Tell how Twin won't speak to me, your mother or you or even some people we just know in common. Tell how your mother is persona non grata, with her own family and how her brother had her trespassed wherever he can (she borrowed a van from her parents that her brother dropped off at the hospital to use and then filed a police report for a stolen car back in March 2015). (We live out of state 1000 miles away and my grandad passed after he had a stroke in March 2015, Memorial Day 2015) That she and you were not only shut out of your grandfather's funeral, that the church (the funeral wasn't even AT a church, it was at a Veterans cemetery) was told not to disclose the location of the gravesite. (She found out by accident when calling the local courthouse that he had passed days before). After you've raised this partial list of issues, then, by all means, get to your grievances regarding your father and the horrible people he deigns to introduce you to and lay out how you are offended. See what a therapist has to say about all these and anything else you would like to raise and then I urge you to listen. It is incumbent upon both of you to examine, ideally with a therapist's help, the idea of co-dependency; what it is, how it starts and what it can become. After that, ask if there's a group rate we could all take advantage of. Tomorrow is Easter. My hope would be for resurrection of truth, in your relationship with yourself, and me, knowing you to be an adult who can do whatever she chooses, and take it to success. There is nothing wrong with being a waitress if that is the full and best use of one's talents and abilities. If you choose to act against the talents, intelligence, abilities and education that you possess, you must do what you think best. Many people would be thankful to have half as many of the above-mentioned attributes as you've been blessed with this time around. Gifts and achievements can be dashed against the stones; it doesn't kill them. They just end up going to somebody else. Somebody else will get the benefit. Somebody else will get the job. Somebody else will do the job and reap the benefits. My Happy Easter wish would be the Resurrection of Truth in each of us. Every moment that we rise above pettiness to see the big picture, we become more whole. Family are supposed to help each other. Consider becoming the change you want to see. With regard to your withholding yourself from your family, and withholding as you call it, your weakness, all I can say is, no one can truly know and love you if you are not truly present. It smacks of dishonesty toward yourself and others, bcse it closets you away; this argues a feeling of great vulnerability. So, by withholding yourself from family who actually love you, you are creating significant impediments toward your own happiness and the joy of knowing that you are truly known and truly loved. If you want to stop using the phone, keep it or sell it. Just let me know when you're done with the number. Dad How can you say so many things that are so hurtful but not actually say much at all? It's a true talent. I cried for a good hour after reading this, this morning and resolved to buy my own phone/plan and from now on I'll just tell people he's dead. I'm moving 1000 miles away in July, won't be hard. "

I felt I was targeted because he read my ""Free writing"" papers where for some reason I wrote about my parents. Only my brother and best friend believed what happened. My narc parents outright denied it, saying my active imagination was shaming them. I'm bring this up because I found out 2 more teachers this year abused kids, but the dynamics of a small mostly migrant town makes it hard to come forward. I guess I just want to say to the teens, please be careful who you confide in. I know a part of you wants to have a mother/father figure instead of the monster your living with, but there are adults who will take advantage of that vulnerability. The sick people can sense our pain and exploit it. On the other hand, I now have adults who I found in college who really did end up being mother/father figures and cared for me in a non-exploitative way. I'm sorry that school may not be a safe place :("

They are remnants of a person I am not, and I'm trying to find them and shed them one by one. It's slow going. These things ARE TRUE when you are being abused by an N, but they are so false and get in the way of the life I want to live now. 1. Vulnerability is to be avoided at all costs. Genuine emotion and true feelings will be weaponized. People will hurt you. Every time. 2. Lie. Lie over insignificant stuff that doesn't matter in order to avoid ""being in trouble,"" or provoking the anger of my mother. 3. Run. If something is bad, confronting it and telling it how you really feel will make things 1,000 times worse. Avoid, ignore, dodge, manipulate. 4. I'm at fault or could have done it better. There needs to be someone at fault. 5. Be in control or you'll be controlled. "
450,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,My friends suspected I had autism. My therapist believes these traits are symptoms of my abuse.,207,4k83rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4k83rq/my_friends_suspected_i_had_autism_my_therapist/,2016-05-20 22:55:54,"A few years back, I met a girl my own age in school. She and I went for lunch one day and started talking, and we bonded immediately over things that I've never believed anyone else could share before. We had so much fundamentally in common. Then she dropped the bomb that ""my psychologist says I have these tendencies as a result of my autism... maybe you should be evaluated."" I talked to my friends first. Almost all of them, when I suggested I might be on the spectrum, said things like ""Duh"" or ""I can see that"", including people I'd known since I was 11, and former roommates. I found someone at my school to evaluate me and jumped through all the hoops, but in the end she told me she wasn't comfortable diagnosing me as autistic. She said that I did have a lot of the traits - more than most neurotypical folks she talked to - but they weren't as pervasive or severe as she would have expected if I had ASD. One of the issues was of course related to social skills, physical affection, eye contact, etc. What we found when we started discussing it was that it was clear I wasn't *always* touch-avoidant or socially challenged. I have a lot of memories from early childhood of making friends easily, and of cuddling up to my dad or my grandparents, or even Nmom a few times. I was a pretty affectionate child. In fact, one of my most horrifying and earliest memories of Nmom is of a time when I was about 4. We were at the store and I was trailing along well behind her with my little legs, when I suddenly felt I loved her very much and wanted to give her a hug. So I stretched my legs, walking faster to catch up until I was right behind her, and then reached out to hug her. And she turned around and snapped at me to ""**Back off and get out of my space!**"" I told her I just loved her and wanted a hug, and started crying, but she just continued shopping, and I can remember the rest of the trip I counted the tiles on the floor behind her to make sure I was 3' away from her the whole time after that. Now that I'm finally in ongoing trauma therapy, I've talked a lot with my therapist about these things - the fact that I struggle to make friends although I'd like to, my complicated relationship with touch, the way I don't make eye contact anymore, how often I think that I just don't feel emotions in the same way others do... and my therapist sincerely believes, given I have memories of *not* being this way as a kid, that these issues are all a response to growing up in a house that spawned stories like the one above. When I talk about my childhood, the two things that come up the most are unpredictability and fear. I never really knew the ""rules"" of talking to my Nmom. I never knew how she might react. One day she might be friendly and encouraging, and the next she'd rip me to shreds for doing the same thing. I learned to be afraid to touch people, because they might hurt you. I learned to be afraid to share myself, because someone might use it against you. I learned not to look people in the eye, because they might take it as a challenge to their authority. And I learned not to show my emotions, because someone might use the vulnerability to rip you apart."

Desperately so. With a couple of things I need to deal with, but which would seem unremarkable to non-agoraphobic/mentally ill/struggling people. But I can't bring myself to do it, to ask. Even though I know people who would. I just can't do it. And it is driving me crazy =( Admitting you need help means being vulnerable, this is a big NO for a lot of us, because vulnerability has been weaponised against us. Accepting someone will help can be a challenge - feeling unworthy and undeserving Guilt. Because I don't feel safe asking for help which i Know to be a cruel slander on those who DO care - I can't get out of my own way on this and it makes me feel guilty because intellectually I know these people don't deserve the taint. Shame. Because we often learn to be self-reliant (even if success levels may vary) because no one was there for you. So needing help means what little you have in your toolkit (because they didn't do anything much as you grew up) has failed you. I need some help, I don't seem able to ask for it =( And what's worse maybe? I catch myself fishing with hints - because being offered is easier than asking (and was also how I was raised - never ask, wait to be offered) but it is manipulative to do that and manipulating is what N's do =( (sorry for formatting, I'm upset and can hardly see)"
452,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Having to think the worst,5,4819m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4819m4/having_to_think_the_worst/,2016-02-28 21:30:40,"Today, when I really should have been in a pleasant and content mood (and was, right after I cried for like half an hour and waded through all of this) I realised something. No only do I have great difficulty voicing that something is wrong - especially if that something is to do with me feeling not good enough. I will honestly swear nothing is wrong as I cry in front of someone. And this person is the most understanding, non-reactive person out. But I was afraid. Afraid they'd get mad for me ruining the mood by being sad, or mad at me for being upset at things. Having emotions, especially bad ones, is vulnerability in the worst way for me. I shut down rather than try and work through it with someone. Cause have you ever tried to tell your parents you're upset about something, let alone something they were a part of? Oh boy. And when I was small, they decided I was too sensitive and that they'd get that out of me. So they teased me until I cried, and then laughed, and then teased me some more. Mocked me for being upset. I was so upset as a small child (I was about waist height tall so small) I ran to a perfect stranger and hugged them because I was just so upset and wanted it to stop. So I learnt not to react. I can school my emotions to physical pain, I can force the bad emotions away. The very fact I was comfortable looking upset, the fact the lie was unconvincing, shows how much I trust this person. I don't know how to bring up stuff I'm upset about, even if it is something without blame. I don't know how to be unhappy and not feel vulnerable and afraid. No doubt that is half my problem normally, I try too hard to escape being upset. I need to fix this, and some guidance on how if anyone else dealt with it would be good. The other thing is, I have this need to think the worst. It's like if I'm not thinking the worst, I have the ability to have been fooled and have it ripped away from me. And I know where this came from, with my parents being unpredictable and destroying my self esteem, and then the first person I tried to trust after them completely betraying that trust. So I get it, but it's really unfair to everyone else. Take today, the same person as above, I was upset because I felt like I wasn't good enough for them to want to spend time with. Even now I'm feeling this pull to accept that. Because otherwise I'm just embarrassing myself, everyone will be laughing at me like ""haha she actually thinks she's good enough"". Either way, when I actually think about the person, I'm able to be like, okay I'm being unfair and assuming, they could be looking at it like this, or like that. But it's really hard for me to not accept the worst, even when I'm directly told it's not true. I've been working on this a while, trying not to assume. Trying to not have rock bottom self esteem. But it's really, really hard. Did anyone else struggle with this? "
453,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Nparents coming for holiday and exhausted before they arrive,2,48eov6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/48eov6/nparents_coming_for_holiday_and_exhausted_before/,2016-03-01 16:14:40,"I'm a first time poster and occasional lurker because frankly I haven't wanted to think about my NParents let alone share. That might change because I've got stuff to process but for now I just need to talk abut right now. Standard wall of text apology, and thanks to anyone who works through the lot. I live in a different country from my NParents and have been LC for most of my adult life even when living in the same country/city. We've had a little more regular contact since we've had our 19 month old daughter. The safest way has been occasional phone calls with my NMother sending very formal, nicely worded emails. She's an elementary school teacher so it's got the style of something you'd set as homework for a kid. Enjoyable and light. For the most part they stay in the deep cover/denial and only get really vicious/controlling when the chips are down. It's comfortable to sort of have parents and get a version of the emotional connection, so it's been nice and flareups are manageable through distance. Recently, my partner and I were looking at IVF after a long series of investigations into subfertility. We were able to have our beautiful daughter naturally, so it's been frustrating we haven't been able to conceive again. IVF is something we've been reluctant to do for religious reasons, but on investigation we found out that there was literally no other way we could conceive. We're both able to on an egg and sperm level, however haemorrhaging after a Caesarian section has meant eggs just won't reach the womb and the only surgical procedure that could change that is unavailable. Suffice to say it was a heartbreaking process and we had to make a number of hard thought decisions before going to the final step. At that point, we needed money. We're single income so we can give our daughter the best start. We knew we had a couple of large lumps of money coming in, but of course IVF is timed to biological cycles. My MIL was prepared to loan us the money, but we didn't want to place the entire burden on her so I commited to asking my parents as well. I warned my partner not to expect a positive result. The initial phone call went well, if not successfully. I got my father - always a better option as he's somewhat saner outside of his addiction issues, which at this point of his life recur only very occasionally. He indicated that they couldn't help us because they were financially committed. It wasn't the answer we wanted, but it left everybody with dignity. That didn't suit my mother. I shortly received one of her nicely worded emails but as well as news of a play she'd seen with a friend, visits from family friends, there was a dense paragraph of guilt and manipulation about how I shouldn't be ""making"" my partner have another child, that the pregnancy was hard, and the lowest blow mentioning another couple who had a child with Down's Syndrom - a subtle reference to my other half who has just turned 40, which is *why* we're so urgent to try in the first place. So do what we want, or you're going to bring a disabled baby in the world. Thanks. I dealt with it at the time by writing back and specifically responding to every bit of the email except that one, and followed up with a birthday call that included a jab of ""I'll do what I decide to do, as I always have."" Yes, denial and passive agressive moves are dysfunctional, but sometimes a small and sane amount of dysfunctional dealing is the healthiest way of handling Nfamily. Which leads us up to now. On Friday, they're coming over for a three week holiday. This is normally at this stage ok and punctuated with only minor bickering and some fair amount of exasperation, but even a little bit of joy. Except. Except my mother can't let go of something once she's decided she has to have her say. Except the round of IVF failed, leaving us thousands of dollars spent on literally nothing and dealing with feelings of mourning for a child we might have had. Except if it gets mentioned and my other half is anywhere in earshot she's going to explode. It won't be me taking my parents aside and setting them straight, which I can do well having had years of practise, it'll be a meltdown I can't contain. I feel like I'm facing the ticking time bomb. That what could be a manageable experience isn't. I feel preoccupied and worried. I feel all the unhelpful N methods of coping they taught me wanting to burst out behind from my eyes. I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to bring up the topic in the drive back from the airport so they can have their say out of earshot of my other half. I don't want to be waiting to see if they do. If there's one thing I know it's that they have an unerring sense of vulnerability, and I feel so raw about the wearying journey we've been on that I'm afraid they won't get the measured, patient response from me that I normally have the strength to give. Those of you still with me, please know that I don't want much more than to hear that how I am feeling about this is ok, and maybe some well wishes to be my best self rather than joining them on the dark side. Insights from your journeys are of course welcome. Those of you who pray, that would be appreciated to. OK, thanks. :)"

It's so confusing because he was the one who helped me start to talk about my past relationship with my Nmom, and come to terms with a lot of stuff, and other trauma in my life, but at the same time I now see how narcissistic he was himself and how much he damaged me too. So many of the patterns were reciprocated in what I had previously experienced with my Nmom, reinforcing all those beliefs I was trying to clear, of not being loveable, worthless etc. The problem is the person I opened up to about it all was a guy I had been with for almost a year. We weren't officially together because I wasn't sure about getting into a relationship because I was feeling very emotionally fragile at the time, and he didn't want to commit either, but we ended up as close and intimate as a relationship would be, emotionally and all the rest. I really trusted him and thought he was helping me so much, supporting me, giving me a safe space to talk about it and for the first time ever someone who wanted to listen, someone who cared. He was the first person I 'let in' and allowed to see my vulnerability too. However, a few months ago we broke up because he slept with someone else, which he didn't seem to understand (or care) would hurt me. So I asked for no contact for a while because I was so deeply hurt and he didn't respect that. He kept messaging me and trying to draw me back in. He made me feel like I needed him so much, I was feeling so fragile. Since we broke up, and since i've now completely removed him from my life (which was so difficult for me to do), a lot of things have come to light that make me feel so used and abused because he manipulated me, made me feel so small and worthless with the little comments he continually made, he made me so dependent on him by destroying my self confidence and self esteem so that over time I thought I couldn't be without him but at the same time made me think he loved and cared about me. I feel so completely hurt and used, but what's worse is that he's in the pick-up artist community and I have recently seen (but didn't watch) videos he has made about picking up women and I know that he has this obsession with sleeping with 18/19 yo girls (he's much older and i'm in my mid 20's). It makes my skin crawl to think that I was intimate with him and trusted him and opened up to him so much when he was just using me as a reliable back up option. The whole time we were together he was looking for other women to sleep with and probably would have if he had been given the opportunity to do so. He always checked out other women when we were together and commented on how hot they were, making me feel so disgusting. But then behind closed doors he would tell me I was beautiful and make me feel safe and loved. He hurt me so much but at the same time he helped me with other things. I feel so conflicted and confused. Sometimes I still miss him and I don't think he's an inherently bad person, I just think all of this treatment comes from his own insecurities. I'm not even sure he was aware of what he was doing. I feel so stupid and confused. He's made my association with sex even worse. I feel like sex is something a woman has to protect, and if she gives it away she loses and the guy wins, and takes something from her. It's a horrible view point. I don't want to feel this way but I feel so used and discarded. I don't know what to do. The PUA community makes me feel sick (without wanting to generalise but that's just my view of it now due to my experiences). I have lost trust in ever being in a safe, loving, respectful relationship. I feel like such damaged goods and I don't know how i'm ever going to get my self esteem back. Tl;dr Guy manipulated me and preyed on my vulnerability to make me feel small and stay with him whilst he used me but he also helped me a lot coming to terms with past traumas. Confused."
455,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,The joys of being an LGBT ACoN. Who else can relate?,4,49t6to,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/49t6to/the_joys_of_being_an_lgbt_acon_who_else_can_relate/,2016-03-10 23:14:43,"It's funny how many posts in this subreddit trigger memories I'd apparently repressed; I've come to realise that my memory is actively shit, probably for self-defense purposes. Needless to say I've been saving every single thread that triggers a memory so I can actually catalogue what I've lost... Anyway. One thing I'm currently hung up on is the way nMother has treated me in regards to all things LGBT. Long story short, I'm her eldest child and she wanted a little dolly to live vicariously through. Along with eventual harassment over weight and stupid passive-aggressive demands to conform (read: a 'Christmas present' containing no less than THREE different products for removing facial hair, more 'Christmas presents' of underwear, 'gifts' from her travels overseas that were blatantly in her personal style rather than mine, the list goes on but almost every one involves the giving of passive-aggressive gifts), she was constantly trying to mold me into an extension of her. Of course, at the expense of my little sisters' sanity and dignity. Needless to say I was her little GC, but it's not as rosy as you'd expect given the sheer amount of manipulation and humiliation that came along with non-conformity. She wanted a little mini-her. Inconveniently, I was a little Dad stuck in a girl's body and she was having NONE of it. Don't cut your hair, it will make your face look too fat. Don't wear t-shirts, they don't suit you. Here's a shitload of makeup, it cost me a fortune, you'd better wear it. Here's a tacky silk scarf and the most femme leather gloves ever. Look, they're your favourite colour. You'd better wear them, I got them in Italy and they cost me a fortune. Here's a gift of hideous female undergarments, you'd better wear them, they cost me a fortune. Of course, anything I ACTUALLY wanted, was absolutely off the list. ""No I am NOT getting you car parts, you've spent enough on the blasted thing already!"" - needless to say, anything remotely masculine was off the cards. (I should note at this point that despite hating me spending money on modifying my car, she HAD to go and buy one herself - same make but newer and faster, literally the next step up from mine, and she explicitly barred my father from buying the car he wanted because ""I have to have an STi first!""...I wish I was kidding) All this time she'd spent 'warning' (read: manipulating) us kids all into genuinely fearing what would happen if our father found out any of us were LGBT. We'd be screamed at and disowned, he is a monster, he will have our heads. Imagine my surprise when, after coming out at 27 as a trans man (at this point with short hair, and no I didn't look too fat thank you very much!), she quite quickly made it all about her, and how WONDERFUL she was about it, and SUPPORTIVE, but LONG-SUFFERING and WORRIED. She gatecrashed my sisters' planned holiday visiting me at the opposite end of the country. She backstabbed me to said sisters, ""BUT WHAT ABOUT [DEADNAME]'S MARRIAGE AND CHILDREN NOW, HOW WILL [WRONG PRONOUN] DO THAT NOW"" (note: from about the age I learned to talk, I'd been professing my hatred of marriage and children, and had remained consistently disgusted for 28 years to this point). She rifled through my washing every time she got a chance and hung it up despite my strict, repeated and explicit instructions not to (for one, because there are goats outside, and secondly, JUST NO THAT IS SO RUDE). And she sold me the sob story that my father was going to eat me alive. Actually, my very traditional Asian, superstitious, Catholic father was barely even shocked. The only question he asked was ""Oh, so you were meant to have a penis?"" and that was that. He quickly rationalised it and marched on, quite content that his eldest was now the son he always wanted. Narcissists HATE being upstaged, I'll tell you that. It all culminated in her, against my explicit instructions, creating a photo album of every single picture of me that existed, 100% wrongly gendered, plasted with my deadname, and selling the cover story that she was giving it as a gift to my father. No, she just wanted to shove it in my face. Which she did, about 10 seconds after me explaining VERY FUCKING CLEARLY that photos give me panic attacks. First time I've ever shoved anyone across the room, or flung a heavy object at a window. Also first time I've gone to deliberately stand in traffic. Heh, actually I wasn't intending this post to be a ""How I ghosted my hellcat of a nMother"" but there you have it. It's true that a narcissist is the bride at every wedding and the body at every funeral, but it seems they're the transitioner in every transition as well, while they try to live vicariously through their children. This is pure hell, as I'm sure you'll all understand, for us LGBT people in our hour of need and vulnerability. I live at the other end of the country nowadays, I've been NC for well over a year despite her feeble attempts to both regain contact and 'wait it out' so I can 'calm down' (shudder). Rest assured I have spent plenty on my (now three!) Subarus as a nice big fat middle finger. Today is my 1 year on T mark and I've not looked back. Despite the sheer hell that transitioning anywhere near her was, and as torturous as the years of being ignored, invalidated and harassed were prior, I'm doing damn well these days and I hope everyone else can reach this sort of content, safe nirvana. Similar situations? What are your experiences? I feel a reach-out moment coming on with you lovely people. TL;DR: nMother is a covert narcissist that's obsessed bloody BLIND by control, putting on the perfect face and being the Only Good Person Left, but her mask has long since melted off and I'm NC because of the abhorrent pirate takeover she tried to perform over my transition.

About a year and a half ago, I did a search online for ""children of emotionally/mentally"" abusive parents and like a trail of breadcrumbs, it led me here. I had NO idea that I wasn't the only one. I had gone searching online because I was still working with the nagging logic of, ""This is all in my head, it wasn't that bad, I'm crazy, right?"" What I found disproved that theory. I turn 41 on Monday. There is SO much that's been done to me (and my two older siblings) that it would be a ridiculously long post. Plus there would be gaps because I've forgotten/minimized so much crap. It took me two weeks to finally decide on a way to share on here and bite the bullet and make an account. Due to the sheer amount of crap I have to share, I've decided to just ""leak"" it in small chunks, trying to work in chronological order. And just reading all of your experiences makes my heart ache, knowing that other people have suffered what I've been through and (to my mind) much worse. You're all amazing in my book. I also have a hard time talking about what I and my siblings (particularly my sister) have been through. It always feels like ""complaining"" and ""being a drama queen"". Because our home was PERFECT. We didn't know how good we had it. (I despise the word ""perfect"". I feel physically ill when I hear someone use it. Everything in our house growing up needed to be PERFECT. And as any SANE person knows, perfect is generally in the eye of the beholder. My true gut feeling on it is that perfect is a complete illusion-or delusion if you're dealing with a narcissist.) I am married, almost 20 years to a really great guy from an equally-but-differently fucked up family. We've been in counseling since year one of our marriage because we're both terrified of hurting one another and strive to NOT do what was done to us. We often joke that we work so well together because we wouldn't have worked with anyone else. Also, I wonder that our marriage worked out, because my Nmom had her nose all over in our relationship and pushed the marriage because SURPRISE! she thought my husband was a push over and could control him/us. That didn't work out so well for her. It came up in therapy that we choose someone like our parents. I was attracted to my husband because he was the exact opposite. Easy going, rarely raises his voice, speaks his truth in a gentle way. This also pisses off my parents. Have been in therapy since I went NC, am now to ""as needed"" sessions when things come up or I'm struggling. Proud mom to two kids- son 9, daughter 7. We are pretty socially isolated. Can't really see extended family because of e's and fm's. Between my husband and I we have three true friends- the kind you can call in the middle of the night if your house burns down. I have problems with relationships due to lack of trust, but those I do trust I know I can trust implicitly. My one female (and also best) friend is like my sister. We consider each other family. If I've learned anything, family is where you make it. I was raised with the whole ""Family is the only thing that matters, no one else gives a shit about you, your family are the only ones who care about you, but you're a piece of shit but we have to take care of you anyway because we're FAMILY. And you're a fuck up."" I suspect (can't ever really know because they'd need to be seen and diagnosed and that's never going to happen because they're PERFECT- it's everyone else in this world that's a fuck-up) that both my mother and father are narcissists. Or at least have an overwhelming number of the characteristics with a generous sprinkling of other delightful quirks. Together and making lives miserable for 53 years. (Part of me wants to sneak over to their farm and hang a banner up with that on it for their anniversary-not that I'd really do it. Fun thought though.) I've moved passed the anger for the most part. Some days I feel it well up in me briefly when a memory pops up. Most days I feel.... nothing. My attitude is this: They had my unconditional love. I would have crawled over broken glass, cut off limbs, done ANYTHING for them. THEY killed that. They slowly murdered it, poisoned it over years of abuse. The final death blow came when they tried doing to my four year old daughter what they'd done to me. Something just snapped. And when I found out what they'd done (I wasn't present for it, and NO, it didn't involve physical or sexual abuse- nothing I could take to the police, because believe me I would have and still wanted to hurt them so badly) I quietly packed my children in the van, drove away and have never looked back. (She made sure to call me numerous times and leave me horrid messages which I saved and played for my therapist before deleting). I was standing in my kitchen after I had the kids safely home and I started to cry after listening to her first evil rant..... And a thought popped into my head: ""Was it okay for her to do that to your daughter?"" My response was, ""NO. I swear I'll kill her if she ever gets near my child again."" My thought back to myself: ""Then WHY IN THE HELL IS IT OKAY FOR HER TO DO IT YOU?????"" It was like getting slapped in the face. I went immediately still. No more tears, no more feelings of guilt, nothing. It was that moment of epiphany you hear people talk about. My daughter walked up to me, and hugged my legs, and repeated some of the nasty shit my nmom had said. And I was done. Just like that. No one had been there to protect me. And I saw how little, and vulnerable, and sweet, INNOCENT she was, and I could IMAGINE myself at that age, and my nmom saying/doing horrible things, to a little child (Let alone ANYONE-NO ONE deserves that) and I realized how WRONG it was. Because my husband and I have NEVER done that to our children. We've been hurt too bad, crushed too much, we don't have a home like that. And I was HORRIFIED at the idea of doing that to someone. Though I'd been perfectly accepting of her doing it to me. Once I made that connection, it was all over. For ANYONE reading this.... Love isn't supposed to BE that way..... Try to picture your nmonster saying what they say to you, to ANYONE ELSE. Your CHILDREN, Your PARTNER, your FRIENDS.... WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH IT??? (Hopefully, your answer is no.) Then you need to ask yourself, ""Then why is it alright for them to do to ME?"" Thank you for listening to me. I appreciate all of you. You're stronger, I'm stronger, we're ALL stronger, better, SMARTER and ABSOLUTELY WORTHY of being loved and respected. THEY are the monsters. They take and they hurt, because they're twisted, sick, angry, bitter people. We have dignity. We're worthy. We're not ""bad"" people. We're not losers, whores, sluts, garbage, stupid, pathetic, whatever POISON they've been feeding you. Because that's what it is. It's a poison and a paralytic. They paralyze you with it. Take away your ability to move, protect yourself, take your free will... then they slowly poison you with the thoughts/ideas they force feed you. To make you into a puppet, a zombie, a VICTIM. They like victims. They like people to be smaller, more hurt, more broken than them. So they can feel better about their sad, sorry, small selves. And they PLAY on your pity. On the compassion and vulnerability of their children, who are hard wired from birth to BOND with their caregiver, they USE our own inborn survival instincts against us, twist it, warp it, and ABUSE the most basic, most AWESOME gift a parent can receive. You. And you're better than that. I'm better than that. We're ALL BETTER than that. Take yourself back. You BELONG to you. You are yours. Not theirs. They don't own you, never did. And when they VIOLATED that bond with you, used it in their perverse way? They voided the terms of that bond. Null and void. You have a HEART, A SOUL, and MIND. And they're yours. NOT theirs. And you know what? You don't even HAVE to ""Take them back."" Because you know what? They were NEVER theirs to begin with. They may have mind-fucked you into thinking they were THEIRS (because everything always was, right?) but here's the secret: Nope. Never was. They only MADE you believe that. And secretly, I think it pisses them off. Because on some level, they KNOW it. They KNOW they can't TRULY own you. Only a shadow of you, of me. So they act more mean, more horrible, hurt you more, in a sick attempt to actually accomplish it. The joke is on them, you rebel. Because despite all their efforts, despite the brain washing, all the crap, you STILL belong to you. You just didn't know it until now. "

459,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"Finally had the courage to ask for help...and reaching out to CPS made things way worse and now I am stuck under the thumb of my n-parents (I'm 17). Please, I need help coping for these last few months.",67,44pn3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/44pn3d/finally_had_the_courage_to_ask_for_helpand/,2016-02-08 17:00:54,"I know this is going to be long, but there's really no way for me to summarize. Please just hear me out. My mother had me when she was 14 and has been a drug addict ever since (she used to do mostly cocaine but in the past few years has been heavily abusing prescription drugs). I was raised by my grandparents, who were quiet, hardworking people with hearts of gold. We were pretty broke all the time, as my grandmother worked at a nearby canary and my grandfather worked at a grocery store, but I am so thankful for all the sacrifices they made to keep me out of foster care. Fast forward to seventh grade, and my mom gets remarried for the 4th time, and forces me to move in with her husband. Keep in mind that even though my grandparents raised me and received some government assistance to do so, my mother has always been my legal guardian. My biological father bounced before I was even born, and the last thing I heard was that he is in prison for 2nd degree murder (he was into our local Mexican gangs, and so apparently it was a drug deal gone wrong). Anyway, I start living with my mom and soon my first sister is born when I am in seventh grade. Because my mother has absolutely no intent to care for any of her children and has zero maternal instincts, she basically forced my grandmother to live with us too so that she could care for my sister when I was in school. Any time that I was not in school, I was caring for her- which I am thankful for because caring for a child so much softened me around the edges and gave me patience and strength that I never had before. However to be honest it was very difficult to balance trying to do homework while caring for an infant, and I realize that this was in no way supposed to be my responsibility, but they're the cards I was dealt so I played them as best I could. My sophomore year of high school, my next sister was born. In the spring, my grandmother had a massive stroke out of nowhere (she never had health issues prior) that completely disabled her in an instant- she couldn't do anything. It was terribly unexpected and I am having an incredibly hard time coping with her having passed away this past fall. My mother never visited her once, and it was just a terrible way to go. At this point, I was caring for two children, and they became everything to me. Throughout the time I lived with my mom and her husband, I was slapped, beaten very harshly, pulled by my hair and shoved into walls, had my hands and feet zip tied, was sat on, had remotes thrown at my head, and was constantly degraded in any way they possibly could. My mom's husband literally told me that his ultimate goal was to make me feel as bad about myself as possible. To this day I struggle with trying to not degrade myself 24/7, but it's not that easy. There was tons of terrible shit they said, and they frequently would try to get me admitted to mental hospitals (I never was). They told my whole family that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder- 100 percent bull shit but it made it so that none of my family would believe what I had to say if I did try to reach out. To be concise as possible, this last October my stepdad's friends were over, and they were all smoking weed and drinking and watching porn as usual. I did not have my own room, as I always slept on the couch, so I was just off to the side reading or something. It was late at night, and I remember I was drinking tea or something as I normally do. I do not know exactly what happened, but someone must have slipped something into my drink at that time because I started feeling really weird, I was panicking and felt incredibly paranoid and felt so out of touch with reality (this wasn't like a nervous breakdown, I was doing completely fine beforehand). Sometime that night, I ended up in the car with my stepdad and his friends, and we ended up in the nearby town where I am from (about 30 minutes away). Long story short (no really, I can't get into the details because they fucking terrify me just to think about) I was brutally raped by my stepdad's friend. I woke up in the morning lying on the bathroom floor, and everybody was acting like nothing happened. I wait until they're all gone (God knows where they went) and I called 911. The police showed up, I made a report (we went to the police station and I had to go to the hospital what not, police took pics of my bruises on my back and what not, etc.) . I told them my sisters were at home and I was worried that they were in an extremely unsafe environment and would be better off in protective services. I had tried calling protective services on my family in the past, but each time fucking CPS found the evidence ""inconclusive"" and I've basically been punished with even more severe abuse ever since for calling CPS. I hear stuff like ""If you didn't want to get hit then you shouldn't have called CPS you fucking slut"". So I have always been terrified of making reports, but at this point I knew I had to do something for the sake of my sisters. My stepdad didn't exactly know yet that I reported the rape that next night when we went back to our apartment, but he did know that I made some sort of CPS report because my mom was going fucking bat-shit crazy and told him that CPS took the girls away. So there was some sort of CPS intervention, but I don't know what exactly happen because I found out about a month ago that my sisters were staying with my stepgrandmother the whole time, and were not technically put in foster care. I have a feeling they were put in protective custody for a night and then my mom probably got them back and then just gave them to my stepgrandmother because I told my mother that I was leaving. So I just left and began staying with my aunt, who is also a crazy bitch. My aunt wouldn't give me a key to her apartment for some crazy reason, and so I would have to wait outside if I couldn't get any, usually late into the night. So come early November, my photography teacher notices that something is up with me. He encouraged me to talk to a school counselor, and I did, although I gave very limited info because I didn't want to risk it being reported. My photography teacher, let's call him Ben, asks me if I'd like to go out to dinner that night. Mind you, I have known Ben all throughout high school and we have been very close. I know this sounds like a weird scenario but it was 100% not weird at all. I gladly accepted, and that night we went out to dinner. He brought his wife (who we can call Tricia), and instantly I felt such a connection with her. The 3 of us ended up developing an amazing relationship over the next couple of months (they don't have children and are very well-off, in their early fifties); we went out to dinner often, me and Tricia talked on the phone every day, they helped me get a new and better job, and we even spent Christmas and Thanksgiving together. Now I know this sounds incredibly shady, but please please hear me out when I say these are truly genuine and kind people who want to pay it forward and be a family of choice, not narcissists who are preying on my vulnerability. I know I have been in abusive situations, so I understand why people would question my judgment of relationships like this, but they are the real deal and I am incredibly lucky. I truly do love and trust them more than anything. About two months ago, I began going back to my mom/stepdad's apartment at night, because I just couldn't handle not having a key to my aunt's and having to wait until midnight or so. And here's where things get bad and it is hard for me to admit to this but here goes: I let my stepdad and his friends sexually abuse me in return for me being able to stay there. I wanted to tell somebody so bad, but I couldn't. I should have, I know I know. I feel like such a fucking idiot. I wanted to tell Ben and Tricia more than anything, but I just kept on telling them that I was staying at my aunt's because I didn't know what else to tell them. I never meant to hurt them by lying but I was so screwed up emotionally I don't even know what I was thinking. About a month ago, my mom's husband began harassing me at my workplace. I finally made a CPS report. I reported EVERYTHING to CPS. EVERYTHING. I stayed with Ben and Tricia for a few days while the investigation was going on. My social worker said there was no way that I would end up going back to my mom/stepdad's care, especially given that I was sexually abused and because we had a past with CPS. I seriously do not know what the fuck happened, but when CPS went out to the apartment to investigate, they closed the case that night. No questions asked. My mom called my school to see if I was there (I was) and THEN made a missing person report. Tricia gets a call from my social worker saying that they have to take me to the police station so that they don't get in trouble, particularly because Ben's position as a teacher could get them into trouble. We get to the police station, and the police start treating me like I am just some little angsty brat, about how I should make things right with my parents and how I need to be an adult and act like an adult and go back home. I was forced back home because the CPS case was closed. I just remember hugging Tricia for a good 2 or 3 minutes, and we were both shaking and crying. Then I got into the cop car, and she told me ""I'll call you tomorrow sweetheart"". I get back home that night, and it dawned on me that these people weren't going to physically abuse me anymore- they were going to psychologically torment me as much as possible because they know they have shit to hide and got lucky this time, but they don't want me to report again. And I will never make a CPS report again because of this. Ben and Patricia found out a few days prior that I had been staying with my mom at times, and were shocked. Tricia told me over and over that they weren't mad, that they just wanted to understand. They to this day know nothing about the sexual abuse or rape. I told them there is stuff that they need to know about this situation, that I wasn't just lying out of cruelty or something, and that I will tell them when I can. But I know they still felt lied to at least to some extent, and I feel terrible. Absolutely awful. They are not spiteful people though, and I truly do believe Tricia when she said that they are not angry. I know they are not angry. I know they don't resent me. I know they still love me. But I know they must be confused. I never got that call from Tricia. In fact, we haven't had any contact whatsoever. Since Ben is a teacher, he could get in trouble for encouraging me to do anything, or for having this sort of personal relationship with me. Well, maybe not get in trouble, because Ben and Tricia did go through the principal to make sure that it was okay for them to take me out to dinner and spend time with me outside of school, but accusations could certainly be made and considered. And the fact that they loved me so much and understood my fear of CPS that they never made a CPS report knowing all of this could get Ben in trouble. Which is the reason I never told them about the sexual stuff, because I didn't want to get reported. I do see Ben, of course, at school, and we are friendly but things just aren't the same. He's like a father to me, but I think he feels like he has to suppress our relationship for the sake of professionalism. It hurts a lot, but I understand. I have been writing letters to Tricia every other week, and she reads them but cannot respond. We have had no contact whatsoever and I miss her like hell. I love them so goddamn much, but we can't have any contact until after graduation (graduation is May 23). My parents are making me leave my last day of school (which is May 19) and then I am gone from them forever. They won't let me leave while I am still in school because I have that connection to CPS. I have even told them that I won't make reports if they just let me leave, but they won't. They're so fucking stupid. But they keep reminding that they can't wait to never see my face again after these next 3 months, and I'm glad. Ben and Tricia have always made it clear that they want their home to be my home, that they want to be no different from anyone else's parents and to give me the life I've always dreamed of. I understand that we can't have those things right now. I worry about losing them because I haven't spoken to Tricia at all and Ben is scared to talk to me on a personal level, even though I know that might be an irrational fear. I love them so much, and this is incredibly difficult. They can't have any contact or personal relationship outside of school with me until after graduation. I don't turn 18 until September 2, and I hope that Ben and Tricia aren't so scared that they go no contact until my birthday. I think that this is only for the meantime while the student-teacher relationship between us still exists, but Ben has not said anything about the duration of this estrangement. I miss them so much. It never gets any easier. It's hardest to think about how we were so excited to become a family (they were trying to become my foster parents as were pretty positive that I wasn't going back home), about how Ben was thrilled to take me shopping for my room and to put out 3 bowls in the morning instead of 2 for breakfast. I am going to a community college near where Ben and Tricia live in the fall, and I assume that I will be living with them as they've always made it clear that they want me there and that I am of no imposition to them, that they are excited to help. I don't know if I will be able to stay there over the summer or have to wait until I am 18, but I have really nowhere else to go. Their families are amazing and have all accepted and embraced me, and I am so thankful. I will see Tricia at an upcoming charity dinner put on by Ben and the students in our school design academy, and I know I am just going to break down when I see her. How do I cope with getting through these next 3 and a half months? "

I'm now in my early thirties. They physically abused me throughout my childhood - until I was 14 and I grew big enough and strong enough to fight back. Then, once I fought back and defended myself, they lessened their physical abuse (although it never stopped completely.) They did not change; my biology changed - I grew big enough and strong enough to fight back. Their verbal abuse lasted through my adolescence. Once I grew smart enough and quick enough to verbally counter them, their verbal abuse lessened - but never stopped. Once I left and moved out of the house at 18 and only came home to visit, though they were still abusive - they peppered fake flattery and random compliments, and threw in some kind honey-moon periods of being nice to me - in between their random, unpredictable, and attacking meltdowns. They were still abusive, but they threw in some kindness here and there to reel me back in. Now I am physically, legally, and financially independent. I am no longer legally bound to them, and I am no longer weak, vulnerable, dependent, and powerless as I was when I was a child. So - even if they do actually ""change"" at this point - so fucking what? When I was a weak and vulnerable child, they exploited my weakness and took advantage of my vulnerability. When I was defenseless and powerless, they leveraged their power over me and used it to hurt me. They attacked me when I was defenseless. They crushed me when I had no power to change the situation. They hurt me when they knew I couldn't fight back, stand up for myself, or escape. So... now that I can escape - so what if they change now? It will not make me feel better. In fact, it will make me feel *worse.* Because what defines a person is not what they choose to do when they have no other choice - but what they do when they are in a position of power and control - and they still care to show respect and love to those more vulnerable than them. It matters not at all what someone with no options chooses to do. It matters when someone has the choice to be kind or be cruel - *and they choose to be cruel because they know they can.* That says everything you need to know about a person. I see alot of people on this forum who wish their parents would change, and who are trying to change them and hoping that their parents will change. Even if, by some miracle, my parents did change - I can promise you, that would make me feel *worse.* Because if they changed now - now that I am strong, independent, and can defend myself and escape - then tell me why *they chose* to exploit my weakness and leverage my vulnerability to hurt me and harm me when I was a young, defenseless, little child. They hurt me when they could; when I could not fight back and they could get away with it. Now that they can no longer hurt me free of repercussions, it is absolutely irrelevant to me now if they choose to stop hurting me. If one only stops hurting someone because of the repercussions - but leverages their power and exploits their authority to hurt and harm when they know full well that they can get away with it without consequence - then I know all I need to know about that person, and I have no interest in engaging with them in any type of relationship.

It's hard to put into words. For decades I waffled between NC, VLC, and getting roped back in. For decades I dealt with physically-violent EDad and struggling to see him as a pathetic castrated enabler, or the violent abuser of my childhood who my mother relished in the sympathy from and poisoned me against (never leaving of course) while raising consistently the level of ""covert incest"" between us as we fought against my father - me and her vs. him, me and her vs. the world - you all know the shit I'm talking about here. The fact is, I'm looking at my daughter wriggling in my wife's belly and it's clear: My parents are terrible people. It doesn't matter what my Dad's reasons are, or how much my mom pushed him and got sick pleasure from the violence and used it as ammo to make me hate him, he's an abusive asshole. He's a terrible person. My mother is a terrible person. She is a childish narcissistic hillbilly who only knows how to play childish games. She deserves to be with a violent asshole like my father because she chose it, decade after decade. My father deserves to be with a crazy woman who hates him and gaslights him and controls him. Those two miserable abusive pieces of shit deserve each other, because nobody else on this fucking Earth deserves them, least of all me. But they don't deserve me. I see my daughter growing and I know - I fucking KNOW, there's not even room to discuss it - that I won't be a perfect parent, but I'll be an actual fucking parent. I'll actually care about my fucking daughter. If my wife starts hitting my daughter, we're leaving. If my wife hits me in front of her, we're leaving. Forever. It won't happen, it really won't, I'm just using that as an example to help me understand what my mother and father did to me again and again. My mother doesn't fucking deserve me. They don't deserve my time and consideration. As an almost-parent, I see that now. I see it so. fucking. clearly. My parents are horrible, horrible people. Why do I even think about them? Why do I even write this post? They're terrible people who have brought me naught but suffering and unhappiness, and they don't think about me kindly at all. All that sympathy I have towards, the moments of weakness where I contact them, the times where I actually give a shit - they view that as a weakness and they exploit it. Any sympathy I have for them is my vulnerability to them. For 33 years my kindness has been punished, simply. I love you baby Nina. OK now I'm crying like a lunatic. Thanks for listening.

463,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"[Progress] I found out my mother is a narcissist four month ago, that is what happened.",32,3ypbdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3ypbdg/progress_i_found_out_my_mother_is_a_narcissist/,2015-12-30 08:40:35,"It's the end of the year. 2015 was the biggest setback for me academically, socially, and personally. In the last four month I struggled to direct my life toward where I want to be. I can say that I managed to get back on my feet. I want to apologize about my grammar in advance, English is my third language. I try my best, but let me know if something bothers you a lot. Things started going bad in November-December 2014. I struggled with school. I tried too hard to socialize and do well academically at the same time. I failed at prioritizing. My grades dropped low, and I was on academic warning. No big deal, I thought. Spring came by. That's the period where I had to find a co-op job. At that point, I didn't have any relevant experience and my GPA was very low. Did I mentioned I cannot drive? I applied to over a hundred job applications and had around thirty interviews. Since I still received interviews, my resume was not too bad. I knew that without a licence I had very little chance to receive an offer in my city. As I apply to more job postings, the more interview I attended, the more my confidence diminishes. This created a downward spiral. Eventually I was unemployed throughout the entire summer. You might ask, how is this related to my narcissistic mother? Let me built up my story. So during the four month of summer, I had my second major depressive episode. Since it is not the first time I had a depressive episode, I knew exactly the symptoms of my depression. * I couldnt get out of bed. * I didn't want to meet up with any of my friends. My friends are concerned about me, and they are amazing people, but I felt too shameful to see them. * I couldnt control what I put in my mouth. * Excessive porn use. * Very low self-worth. It was the worst four months I ever experienced. I was very aware that I was depressed, but I feel so hopeless. If you have depression, you have my full empathy. I don't have any magic motivational speech, but you just have to keep fighting the monster in your mind. Because it is not the first time that I was in depression, I tried every technique I knew that can help me to get out of depression. I tried breathing techniques, running, thinking of positive experience, listening to upbeat music, but it fell short. I still felt very depressed. It did not make quite sense to me at all. It is as if I was working on a giant jigsaw puzzle, but I was missing an important piece. **(Skip to here, if you don't want to read background info)** At that point, I have been on /r/raisedbynarcissists a couple of times. I could relate to /r/raisedbynarcissists. Yeah yeah my parents are not the best people and yada yada. I only read a few post, I thought it was a subreddit for sorry ass teenagers complaining. Nothing on this subreddit was of value to me to help me succeed in life. I am extremely sorry that I thought that way. I was completely wrong, I should have took /r/raisedbynarcissists much more seriously. It is /r/raisedbynarcissists that enlightening me about my troubles. What really hit home for me was that I did not want to see my parents. I did not want to come home to see my parents like any normal people would love to. Thats when I made the connection that my mother is a narcissistic, and I should take this problem very seriously. It's sometimes crazy to think that my mother should be the most caring and supportive person in my life, but she is actually poisoning me bit by bit since day one. The most important thing I learned on /r/raisedbynarcissists is that **I cannot change my narcissistic mother**. I thought I was strong enough to change my mother. That's my mistake. I have to learn to accept I cannot change my mother. I have to be humble and accept that I am absolutely powerless. I finally found my missing piece, but the piece came much larger than I expected. In the last four month I had to reconstruct the puzzle around the new big piece. It might sound insane to some people hearing what I do, but I will do anything to make my life not get ruined by an actual insane person. I found a way to force myself to sleep on schedule. I turned off all my electronics one hour before sleep. I drank chamomile tea and took 8 mg of melatonin every night for the first two weeks. I brought a face mask and earplugs. I sleep at 9 pm and wake up at 5 am every single day for the last four months. This new sleeping pattern helped me to create a solid routine. It made me more grounded, and more on my purpose. It also help be more concentrated at school. It is easier to go LC with my mom. Whatever my mom throws at me, it didnt affected me. External force are damped when I follow my purpose. That is what my therapist told me. I started going to therapy. I fixed my sleeping pattern before going to therapy. My therapist was astonish. What I am about to say is purely from my experience. I do highly recommend anyone to go to therapy for any type of concerns. Okay, my experience with therapy is that it is not that useful. Let me explain. 90% of the changes is my own efforts and only 10% might be therapist or friends giving guidance. I made up those numbers, but you get the idea. I couldnt go to therapy that often, because thats all my university can offer for free. I didnt go often either, because my therapist reassured me that I am quite self-aware and resilient. I already read a handful of self-help books and I understand how basic human psychology works when I had my first depressive episode. I still go as a checkup. It is nice to have a third party to affirm what Im doing is indeed correct. Also, therapist are professionally trained to listen. Friends sometimes have preconceived judgement and biases. Theres many changes I made during last four month. I stopped drinking coffee. I am not saying that coffee is bad or anything. I love coffee, but I relied too much on coffee to fix my sleeping disorder. Since I woke up early, I started running again in the morning. Eventually I moved to weight lifting. I learned how beneficial strength training is and Im getting results. I am more conscious of what I eat. I have to stretch every morning because of the soreness, I take that moment to take deep breath and meditate. I have been working on being more vulnerable lately. Vulnerability helps to create deeper connections with people. My grades are higher than my first two years of university. Im not top class standing, but I improved a lot. Im still living with my parents, but Im in LC. Hopefully I find a job, finish my degree, and move out asap. Finally, you have to treat yourself kindly. If your parents cannot take care of you, become your own parent. Learn about self-parenting. Every time you make a decision ask yourself ""What is really best for myself?"" Thats something one of my friend told me that really stood out to me. **tl:dr** * I was really depressed and my Nmom is the cause * **I cannot change my Nmom!** * Take care of yourself: * -&gt; Sleep well * -&gt; Exercise * -&gt; Eat well * -&gt; Breathe * Be kind to yourself"
464,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Update: My son tried to kill himself? Well I didn't get any NYE texts. (Long!),79,40i5p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/40i5p2/update_my_son_tried_to_kill_himself_well_i_didnt/,2016-01-12 05:41:23,"So my dad did come over a few days after my brother's attempt. It was tolerable. My brother took his max dose of valium to get through it, and offered me some but instead I just coughed hard every time NDad said something I was in danger of reacting to. For example, he started talking about how he can't drink vodka because it makes him aggressive, and he went so far as to say ""you know what I'm like normally, but when I drink vodka I'd pick a fight with anyone!"" as if the idea of him being aggressive was shocking. Spoiler alert: it is not. So yesterday my brother wanted to go see Star Wars. He hasn't been out except for appointments for several months, and asked me and mum to go with for moral support etc. and it was very hard and stressful but he did it. He really enjoyed the film but the sensory overload exhausted him. He was a lot more chipper on the way home than on the way out, and overall it was good. I was over at mum's for a while before we all left for the train, and we got on to the topic of NDad. Oh, I remember how it happened - we were talking about Carrie Fisher's emotional support dog, and how the cats pick up on our sadness and come and purr at us, and I said the dog of a person I used to know was the sweetest when it came to that. This got my brother remembering the only time he met that dog, which was on an absolute day from hell a few years ago which ... ok, long story: I was friends with an evil bastard, it was his dog. I used to go hide at this guy's house because NDad tried to kill me and point blank refused to leave when mum tried to make him leave, so my home wasn't safe so I stayed with this evil bastard. His home wasn't safe either, he was a psychological torturer and a rapist, but it was preferable to NDad. I had a tiny puppy on this hell-day and he was too small to travel so I was stuck at home for a while and evil bastard wanted to come meet the puppy. I didn't want this but couldn't find a way out. My best friend also wanted to come round that day, like 12 hours after evil bastard so I thought she'd be safe from him but he refused to leave and then when she got there he was intolerably creepy and awful. They left together and the dog was too small for me to go with her to keep her safe, so I had had to watch her walk into a secluded area with evil bastard and there was nothing I could do (I later found out she got away with only a very awkward hug but you can imagine my distress). Also, puppy peed on the floor. So, I was on my hands and knees crying and cleaning up pee, and NDad got home from work and immediately shouted at me because the puppy had peed. I rose, dropped the cleaning products and released an inhuman screech. Ran outside and locked myself out and cried my eyes out. The windows were open and I heard NDad go into the living room and shout at my brother, ""what the hell was that about?"" So, brother bringing up the day from hell brought all that back to the surface and we talked about it, and the many other occasions when I have screeched at NDad because after he tried to murder me all of my patience dried up and will never be replenished. If he ever tries to parent me, or shouts at me, I go from zero to AOEJWOTAEWAAAAAA!!!!! in no seconds. So that turn of phrase brought something up for my brother. He almost never talks about how things affected him back then, in fact up until now the story was that they didn't affect him at all. His therapists think some of his issues right now are due to a delayed reaction to it all. Anyway, he said that the night dad tried to murder me, when he came home he went into my brother's room and told him off for still being awake. My brother just stared at him, but he kept going. Eventually brother caved and switched his lights and electronics off, and he says NDad must have finally picked up on the fact that he was ... he struggled for the right word here and I suggested ""terrified?"" and he said yeah. So apparently then NDad said something along the lines of, ""I make one mistake and everyone acts like I'm the devil."" We talked about all the distortions NDad came out with about that night, and our various perceptions of what had happened. My brother apparently took to carrying a knife. I just stayed away as often as possible, even if it was in other dangerous and horrible situations. I also wanted to ask my brother if he remembered NDad screaming after he had been pulled off me by the combined efforts of my mum and brother. I remember him screaming things like, ""you don't know what she is!"" ""if you knew, if you knew what she had done...!"" with the implication being that they would agree that I deserved to be severely assaulted if not killed. My brother agreed that he had been screaming things like that but couldn't remember anything exact, whereas mum can't remember it. One thing that really shocked me was when we got on to talking about the day NDad finally left. Mum went abroad for a charity thing and we were left with him. My brother kept to his room most of the time which was standard, but I felt like I had to take special measures to make the week tolerable and safe. So we had movie nights and played board games and had nice meals and generally it was as pleasant a week as it could be considering we were alone with that man. On the night mum was due home, time was ticking towards her ETA when an email comes in. NDad turned completely cold. He said, ""your mum has just emailed to say that she isn't coming home."" I didn't say anything. I was bracing myself, thinking that I might need to defend my life. My brother got his knife. We were both ready to fight or run. NDad called us over and I remember planting my feet and trying to remember everything I knew about self-defence. He asked if we wanted him gone and I just said nothing, he said furiously ""I'll take that as a yes."" Anyway, he did leave. Finally. Left us alone. Left an email open on the computer on purpose so that we could see his diatribe to mum about how we were heartless, cold and evil and that the week with us had been a living hell. So that's that story. But as my brother and I talked about how it looked from our respective perspectives, and learned new snippets from each other, mum said ""it never crossed my mind that he would harm you."" Generally speaking I have forgiven mum for the ways in which she failed us back then, because she was also a victim of abuse and NDad is so manipulative that he kept all of the various ways he was abusive to each of us secret from the rest of us. However, this floored me. This was months *after* he slammed me into the kitchen cabinets by the throat. The idea that he would hurt or kill us was at the forefront of our minds, but it never crossed mum's? I restrained myself to saying ""mum, he *did* hurt me!"" emphatically but I was thinking ""it never crossed your mind? That's nice for you. I don't have a choice about it crossing my mind."" Clearly it had a similar impact on my brother, who was 14 or just turned 15 at the time - I was 16. My brother obviously does not see any silver lining in his current situation, but it has already brought us closer. Mum says she thinks that one thing that made the situation back then worse was that we were all separate units. So I had no idea what mum or brother were going through, and so on. Maybe if we could have compared experiences then we would have seen patterns that would have helped us protect ourselves or deal with the emotional fallout sooner than now. But the point is, it is happening now and I think it is important. Emotional vulnerability is a new concept to my brother but I think in the long run it is going to do him good - of course I don't mean his painful and awful symptoms will or are doing him good. No-one should have to go through what he is going through, but if coincidentally going through it means working through those issues that we all share then an awful thing has catalysed a good and beneficial thing. I hope that makes sense and doesn't seem callous towards him."

To be real, honest, and raw, and to have that vulnerability be reciprocated with support. I have very few experiences of this in my life. Going back to my childhood. Now that I'm an adult, it's even harder to be so vulnerable and open. I haven't formed many healthy relationships where I can be this version of myself. Most of my relationships are excessively formal and professional. I always feel a pressure to have my shit together, but I'm kind of a mess. And it's okay. It's not the end of the world. In fact, it's the most common thing in the world. Every child at some point feels strong emotions. Every child cries. My cries never got tended to, so I never learned to expect help to heal my pain. So I stopped asking for help. But I want to start again now. I want to start crying again now. It's not a sign of weakness, it's the courage to go back and to try to rewrite a childhood. To have tears met with compassion and acceptance instead of anger and rage. I want to be able to ask for help. Asking for help is what makes us a team. It's what makes us stronger. It's what unites us. I want to find pride in my asking for help. It's good for the other person too. Asking for help means I trust you. I need help, and in my time of need, I come to you. Trust. I want to trust. But to trust, I have to be willing to open up. To expose my sensitivity, and hope for love instead of hate. It takes a leap of faith. It takes trust. To open up and hope for love. From today onwards, I will try to hope for love."

I used to browse this subreddit alot when I was in college because while I didn't think my dad was so bad, this sub really resonated with me, I just couldn't put my finger on why. I think I just didn't want to see how bad my dad really was. I guess I was in denial. In therapy I have realized how much anger I have towards him and I don't know what to do with it. All my brother and I's life we were dad's outlet. I remember being as young as 5 and being screamed at for not learning enough in class. (he liked to test us when we got home from school and if we could not list enough things that we learned I knew I was in big angry trouble). This is just one things in a long series of cruel angry things he said to us. I grew up with incredibly low self worth. I was never good enough for him. I tried so hard and participated in all of his hobbies while he never payed attention to mine. He belittled me every time I expressed my emotions to him. I got taught that my emotions are a nuisance, too much trouble, and that I am too needy. I don't know why I'm writing this here. I'm sorry. I guess everything just came to a huge fight over thanksgiving where my dad screamed at me that he wanted to strike me and that he wanted nothing to do with me for the rest of my life. He has tried to cut me out of his life many times before but then my mom cries and stops him. I moved in with my parents a month ago (just got back from a job overseas) and I don't have enough money to move out yet until I find a new job, which I am trying very hard to find, because who the hell wants to live in this environment. Now that I am grown I can see how much my mom enabled all of his behavior. I had a moment of vulnerability with my mom and I expressed to her how deep dad hurt me all my life with his screaming and his tests and teaching me that I'm never good enough. Her first response, I shit you not, was to empathize with my father. I guess I didn't want to admit it to myself because it's not convenient. But I guess it's time to face it. I was raised by a narcissist bully and his enabler. Thanks for reading this whoever you are. It's just so hard to lose the parents you thought you had. Does it get better?"

I feel like my life became full of narcs, and I have been carrying out the narcissist trash. Be careful ever thinking LC is a solution, I actually went NC before I knew what it was for almost three years in my 20s. Major damage was done to me doing the LC thing for many many years. Did anyone ever go NC, and then start removing people from your life? I have broken off with at least 3-4 ""friends"" in the last 6 months. I am disabled and Aspie, so let's just say my social circles were limited before hand. One was a college ""friend"" of 30 years duration. I realized she was a workaholic like my narc parents, and feigned vulnerability and I was only a source of narcissistic supply. My feeling of being away is relief. I feel kind of scared because there is that feeling of no one being left. I am happily married and have a few online and long distance close friends, but I have walked from 30 plus people now in the last few years. The ex-friend was against my NC with my family and said, ""Youre cutting off everyone you're going to be all alone"". I decided I'd rather be ""alone"" then around any narcissists anymore. It makes me sad that my life became so full of toxics, especially as I unfriended other people who treated me like a disabled charity project and more enablers and flying monkeys. I am even leaving groups I was involved with where I feel like things are going nowhere. I even want to move so none of the narcs know where I live. I'm not sure where I am going with this, but it's like a complete housecleaning and the room is almost empty and I'm thinking NOW WHAT? The narc family and extreme sociopathic/NM mother set me up to take abuse on multiple levels. I realized many of the people who I have kicked out of my life had no respect or loyalty for me. The ones who truly loved and respected me are the ones still with me in it for the long haul, but this is a lot of people I have had to get away from. I want to talk to anyone who has gone through this. Did you have the feeling of whose going to be left? I and husband have each other and sometimes have discussions about how we are middle aged and on our own in the world. Most of his family is deceased and he has acouple close long distant friends."

My loving partner and offspring have gone home for the holidays, I feel good about that. Balance eludes me. I'm quite gregarious (disinhibited?), but also craven, I yearn for acceptance and yearn to not be ostracized. I feel satisfaction in exercise, and building, and learning, but my accomplishments usually feel soaked in a syrup of hollowness unless they are acknowledged. The true proud humility of personal respect is effervescent, and I feel guilty of seeking external validation (a guilt which I subconsciously invite). This is a huge impediment to any social life. I've become a bit of a hermit (despite attempts, and desperate attempts, at connection). You see I just realized this morning that I can't feel love unless I feel guilty. When someone absolves me of guilt, they must acknowledge that guilt as real. If they think I'm not guilty then I take my own view of feeling guilty as something to be sorry about. ""Sorry."" I hate that word (""I'll give you something to be sorry about!""). The household of my youth was a juggernaut of the ""Dark Triad"" of abuse. They were extremely covert about the abuse of intimacy, physical pain, our emotions, our finances, our social connections, any privacy, and therefore as you know our self worth. They weponized a religion they didn't hold to, actively dismissed that I was different, and purposely destroyed my memory to protect their image. I dropped out late into a pre-med program because (although I didn't know it) I was so adrift I needed to feel guilty or the desire to terminate my life would well up. I then investigated religions to see if could escape that way. I could not. I shredded my high school romance when my parents divorced. I didn't date anyone else until my best friend, who had been fishing for me to chase her invited me to her home for a holiday one year and I saw love as blatant as a Norman Rockwell painting. It was genuine, impromptu, and deep to the core. She wouldn't promise to marry me unless I relented on my desire to remain childless. She is now my wife of a decade (amongst her other accomplishments ;). Her father, an honest man of kindness, wisdom, effort, honor, and humility, asked us to push back our engagement for a summer (that we'd be apart for) because he wasn't sure about me. I can't blame him, I wasn't sure about me. I was raised as a servant, strike that, I know what service looks like: The people who pick up my refuse, clean our home, or tend to the neighborhood gardening are good people, and I thank them with words, gifts, and respect (a bit too much to tell the truth). It seems hyperbolic to say I was raised as a slave, but I think the proper mentality is best described as such. I was ignored, hurt, or helping ""because I wanted to"". I escaped. I tried to find utopia in star-trek, or hiking with my dog (who was later killed out of malice), or lego, or books, or videogames, or even into fantasies in my head where they would be safe. I dreamed of being the last person on earth. Food was the only drug I could get my hands on (an addiction I'm over now), it was great how it made me feel guilty, for in me love and guilt are enmeshed. Dealing with acquaintances or authority ends with me cracking under the pressure of this dynamic. I feel as though I was prepared for Azazel, and get this, I now feel guilty about my guilt because of the huge martyr complex that was in my life. It's pretty messed up that I can only feel love when I hate myself. I'm happy that the desire to manipulate others into thinking fondly of me is headed off by my humanitarian view on the world. My siblings weren't so lucky. I truly wish to have a real friendship with my brother. But he has long since detached from me, he never reciprocates or initiates even though we have similar hobbies and live quite close by. He's my hero, and he's [I feel safe using an absolute here] never wanted anything to do with me. My sister is a lost cause, caught up in her own megalomania before I was born, perhaps it was a defense mechanism, but it's hurtful and remorseless. I've been silently slandered as a sadist and a sociopath to cover the abuse, marginalize my ability to speak out, and to hurt me so they can feel better about themselves. It's sad. In the movie Joy, there is a grandmother who is a genuinely kind person who believes in the protagonist. I had an aunt like that, except she didn't encourage me to build, she validated my desire to value kindness. Since my mother (who I took on the responsibility of ensuring her last wishes were followed to satiate my desire to see one of my huge efforts in life was completed properly) died a couple years back I've lost her to the story too, and think I'm being kind to her to not bring this to her attention in her advanced years and in our extended family. No one in our extended genealogy talks to me, it hurts that we drifted apart but I understand, and I have little desire to engage any of them (I said I was craven, right?). I have improper boundaries, I open too easily, unload too much, feel guilty for unbalancing the interpersonal dynamic, and then push away, so I can simultaneously avoid vulnerability and generate subconscious guilt that makes me feel not so irregular. I am profoundly lonely. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for years now, a nice man who was understandably wrong about what my malfunction is. He called me yesterday to make sure I was okay being alone today (I so am). I've also started seeing a lauded specialist abuse councilor and have registered for two month long intensive daily group program. My immediate desire is to stop thinking externally (which I was trained to do to) and stop interrupting people (WHY DO I DO THIS?). I've been trying for a decade without success. This morning I realized almost my whole foundation has to go if I'm to stop mitigating life and start participating in it. I live too much in the future, trying to control possible problems before they arise. Happiness is more a method of living day to day and less of a state to be reached and rested upon. Such happiness is foreign to me, although I desire it as a cold hungry child with their nose pushed against the window of a warm family supper. My true, deep, sincere thanks to all of you for opening up, sharing, encouraging, supporting, reading, and advising. Your kindness is not wasted, you are helping, you are paragons in my eyes. And you inspire me to be one to my wife and offspring (and myself) by responsibly making life not about this intoxicant family dynamic, but to let it fade as the safety that comes from the joy that casual un-assailed vulnerability creates is focused upon, and then not focused upon as it replaces my current background emotional truth in life. Post Script: I feel like sharing these here as I don't have authoritarian martyrs to worship and be punished by anymore.

My parents are in their 70's, living in another state and my mother is dying from cancer. More and more frequently, I've found myself avoiding phone calls to and from my parents and then feeling massive guilt at not being the good daughter.

For the first time I spoke (wrote) to them about a lonely, miserable, terrifying childhood and how I never felt loved or safe. I told them how becoming a parent helped me to realise that what i went through was wrong and made me determined to be a hero to my children. I finished by telling them that I needed them to acknowledge what they did was wrong, and that they are sorry and want to try to move past it and finally work on being a family. &gt; It was an anxious 2 days but this morning I finally got a response, from my dad.

What I do know is that I'm upset and angry that I've opened the door for a conversation and shown vulnerability, in the hope that they can see that they can actually help me to heal, and it's been used as a weapon to invoke more feelings of guilt and unworthiness.

I had given her up in what was supposed to be an open adoption, but as soon as the adoption was final, the family moved and I never knew their new address or phone numbers. My parents didnt know of my daughters existence until this reunion. My moms reaction to the news will probably haunt me forever: not long after hearing, she said Im glad you never told us or came to us for help. I would have told you to do exactly what you did. My dad changed the subject to his opinion of the menswear on Mad Men within minutes of hearing the news. Getting my sister to meet with my daughter was like pulling teeth, but she did agree to show up for a meeting at the eleventh hour. I believe that she may have consciously or unconsciously struggled with guilt over the fact that she had never offered to help me raise my daughter, and how blatantly she took advantage of my pregnancy. She lived in a free apartment, never taking me to any medical appointments  I even drove myself to the emergency room for a lumbar puncture, although she did manage to try to make herself look like a hero at the birth, after I had made other arrangements for someone to be with me. In the end, she even tried to swindle me out of the security deposit on the apartment. Shes since half-heartedly apologized for some of this, but I mention it because its still relevant to this story. I dont want to make this about my daughters adoptive family, but its essential to this story to say that they were extremely exploitative of me, using my daughter as a lure to get me to agree to increasingly outrageous and inappropriate demands. When I saw how negatively this was affecting my daughter and my life, I started to say no to the demands, resulting quickly in my daughter being manipulated to break off our reunion. One of the ever-growing list of demands was that my daughters adoptive mother would monopolize me in long, daily or twice-daily phone conversations where she would be in tears about how disappointed she was with my daughters school performance, how overburdened she is by trying to parent her, in long, run-on monologues where I barely was able to speak. I finally snapped and could no longer bear these conversations at all. When I told her that Id no longer could listen to these phone calls, I urged her to call my dad, whom they had met and liked very much. I then warned my dad that shed be calling, and he agreed to take the call. This was the the day before my daughter broke off the reunion. They called and my dad didnt pick up the phone. Sometime around that time, my sister sent me an e-mail asking if there was anything she could do. I replied that I wanted her to set up a get-together with her son and my daughter. She never answered that e-mail. Later when my partner talked to her, she claimed that she had offered help and I blew her off, I guess forgetting that the evidence was there in an e-mail. Since my daughters adoptive family had asked me to move away from my state, back to their state (and my familys state) to be closer to them, I had given notice on the lease of my house and was prepared to move. I ended up moving in with my parents for a short time. My partner and I knew that the relationship between me and my parents had always been troubled (my parents seem blissfully unaware of that) but that it could be a sort of healing occasion. My Nmom had been very disrespectful to and dismissive of my partner, and he was aware of that, but he always treated my parents with the utmost kindness and respect, and gave them the benefit of the doubt for as long as possible. I do believe my mother is at least somewhat unconscious of how very nasty she can be sometimes. As Thanksgiving approached, I had been there for more than eight weeks, still reeling from everything that had happened  the failure of the reunion, turbulence between my partner and I, and of course, everything around how my family dealt with (or didnt deal with) my daughters adoption. At the time of my pregnancy, one of the reasons I had chosen not to tell them was that my parents marriage was in trouble due to my dads drinking and philandering. But I also didnt want to expose my child to the same abuse I had grown up with. My parents are addicted to Fox news, and are quite vocal on their opinions about single mothers or people who need handouts. Yes, my parents would have helped me take care of my child, but shed suffer even worse than I did, and shed always have a beggar or lesser status in the family. My Nmom is a professional martyr, and every act of nurturing that she ever gave, no matter how tiny, was always accompanied by a grudging, sighing, suffering act. Also, so much of my moms verbal abuse of me as a small child was expressing the idea that I was unwanted and a burden, I thought it would apply doubly so to a child born to an unwed mother, whose biological father had his own issues and would not be in my life. Even today, I take an extremely cold, extremely thin comfort that whatever happened to her, at least I didnt let her get damaged by the exact same assholes who brought me up. I thought at the time I was at least giving her a chance at a normal life. I found in 2014 I could not keep my feelings about these things under the surface as I had throughout my entire life. I had always kept my parents at emotional arms length. It has always been a running joke with partners and friends how crappy my parents treat me, and how oblivious they are to that fact. I always knew that if I had ever gone to my parents for help with a problem, I would have had two problems. But now that I was seeing how my parents dealt emotionally with the spectacle of me needing help, my memories were jogged of how my parents had discouraged me from seeking psychiatric help when I was suicidal as a young adult. I realized with dawning horror how very preventable my brothers horrific suicide must have been. I moved out before Thanksgiving of last year, having stayed there only since September. I had one last talk with my parents, at my partners urging. He was by my side at that time. I told them that I could no longer hide my feelings about how my sister had treated me, or about how they had treated me. I asked my dad why he refused to answer the phone when my daughters adoptive mother called, and if he regrets that in light of the fact that our reunion was broken off the next day. He affirmed that even knowing how much that hurt me, if he could go back in time he would make the very same decision again. Since that moment, any emotional investment I may have had in my relationship with my father, utterly vaporized. My mother declared in a very martyr-like fashion that I clearly had a grievance against them, and so I did. I talked about the abuse I suffered as a child and as an adolescent. My mom alternated between logically contradictory defenses of denying that the incidents had ever happened; and declaring that I had deserved them or brought them on myself. What would have been entertaining if it had been happening to someone else was when my mom claimed that I had clearly disliked them ever since I was a toddler, and thats why they had been forced to treat me the way they have. She didnt try to outright deny more recent memories. To give an example of her defenses, when I mentioned that after they learned of my separation from ex-husband in 2012, when I was staying in various hotels after moving out of the marital home, they went on vacation and never even called once to check in on me. My mom declared that since ex and I had not invited them to our wedding (we eloped  for reasons that should be blindingly obvious at this point) that justified her lack of concern for me at the time of the marriage ending. I could go on about this particular conversation, with more ridiculous examples, but suffice to say that at no point did my parents acknowledge any responsibility for their actions, empathy for my feelings, or regrets. They made it clear that they believed that all of their actions were completely justified, that they had never made so much as a single misstep in all of this, and moreover I was not being respectful of their feelings. I did offer a possible way to get through this, if they would agree to go to counseling on their own, I would consider maintaining the relationship. At the suggestion that they should attend counseling, I immediately saw my parents faces twist into expressions of disgust. They declared that they would attend sessions with my therapist, (I suppose so they can inform her of how difficult I am, and direct her how to fix me) but that they would not be willing to see their own. If I were offered a deal like that to be able to see my daughter, I would jump at it, but my parents clearly considered it to be beneath them. I was devastated at this time and suffered from panic attacks. Although my parents were incredibly callous to me, for whatever reason they were quite solicitous of my sister, waiting until after Thanksgiving to tell her so as not to ruin her holiday. Unaware, my sister texted me asking about how to make mashed potatoes and it hit me like a ton of bricks, the stunning contrast between their treatment of me and their treatment of her. Angrily, after recovering from a panic attack that I had after reading her text, I replied asking her not to contact me anymore. After I moved out, my partner made it clear to my mom that he intended to be an open line of communication, but when he wrote to her on Facebook, she ignored his letter. He was amazed that nobody in my family reached out to him to ask about how I was doing (it took a while for all of this to sink in.) Knowing them better than he did, I guess they were probably wondering why I was not showing more concern for their feelings. The holidays passed and I received no invitations or holiday greetings whatsoever from my extended family. I dont know if that was overtly or implicitly demanded by my parents, but I was told that people didnt want to step on their toes. It seems silly now, but at the time I was devastated by thisit was a slow process of realizing how alone I was in the world and how spiteful and petty my family could be. I felt kind of used realizing that after all of those years of my mom telling me what to buy for whom, that was just her showing off. I thought I was having an actual relationship with those people but it turned out that without her say-so, I was a pariah. Even though I would never want my daughter to suffer rejection from others even if she is angry at me, my parents dont have those kinds of feelings for their oldest child. When my nephews birthday rolled around in March, I had reflected enough to know that I missed him terribly and wanted to see him. I sent him a birthday card with a check and a note inviting him to visit. Although this might not have been the perfect approach, I was very surprised to find out how unwelcome it was to my sister. There was no response to the card, and the check was uncashed. I tried to follow up with her on Facebook, and she told me that she would not let me see the kids, because she believed I had become crazy like our brother, and thus she was avoiding me. She told me I was delusional for asking to see the kids. I think later on, she realized how this made her sound and backed away from that. At the same time, that was when I started to realize how important it must have been to my family to have my brother be the crazy one, so much so that they now needed to cast me in that role. In retrospect, I probably should have dropped everything and ran right then. After more than a month went by, and the dates of my invitation had passed without acknowledgement, I asked my partner to call my sister and find out what had happened. She had a tearful conversation with him where she informed him that she had ripped up my check because she was angry at my implication that she had supported my daughters adoption because of the financial benefit to her of living in a free apartment. But also that she had given him an equivalent amount of money herself, and that my nephew missed me. This was also the conversation where Nsis told partner that she had offered her assistance to me, but I had blown her off because I am a person that doesnt know how to ask for help or show vulnerability. However she later denied most of this conversation, angered that I pointed out the inconsistencies. She then sent me a letter with the check I had sent enclosed, so clearly it had not been ripped up. She said that she hoped we could reconcile someday. Taking her at her word, I sent her a letter detailing what my problem with her has been. In that letter, I also asked that she send my daughter a card for her 18th birthday, along with the address, date and let her know it was very important to me. I kept the letter very factual, just listing the things she had done and how they impacted me. That letter was met with total silence. In September, I asked our cousin A to try to set up a three-way conversation with Nsis, and when they spoke, that is when I found out that my sister had found my Reddit account and had been reading it for some months, and was hurt by the things I wrote. I confirmed that she had found my Reddit account by making a post to her. It was somewhat sarcastic in tone, but I urged her to seek a therapist, and I pointed out how her behavior of spying on my anonymous postings was so poignantly reminiscent of our mothers style of snooping. She said some extremely vicious things to me in reply before the mods deleted her post. The next day I called BIL. He affirmed that the kids missed me, and that he didnt want estrangement to be a part of his kids lives. It wasnt until after the conversation was over that I started to realize that BIL had been given the typical N-style highly selective version of the truth and knew virtually no relevant details of the estrangement. Naturally, they tried to leverage my relationship with their kids into trying to get me to reconcile with my parents. After this week has gone by, and BIL did not keep his word that hed call me again to discuss this, it is starting to get through my head. I thought I had seen every level of my parents selfishness, but the attempt to use the grandchildren to coerce me (whether it was overtly or implicitly demanded by them, clearly this is being done to serve their interests) is an astounding new level of selfishness. I cannot imagine the mindset of people who are willing to sacrifice the childrens relationship with someone they love, just to meet their own ego needs. My parents expectation that I serve them, even in the midst of the most horribly traumatic scenes of my life, continued without missing a beat. Shortly before I left them, in the aftermath of my failed adoption reunion, my mom said to me, Youre going to have to be the one to drive us around and do stuff for us. Your sister will be too busy with her children. I asked her, who will take care of me. With no hesitation, she declared, Your daughter will, shell come around. My lip curled, as if I would ever feel entitled to have my child, who was given up for adoption, cart me around in my old age. This episode shows my moms absolute mastery of skill of denying empathy, where she denies it to two entire generations of people in one sentence. My sister, and my parents refuse, absolutely refuse, to so much as send my daughter a fucking greeting card in the mail, yet they dont even question that they should be entitled to my service. They are offended that I even asked for a card to be sent! I have seen people gasp, and even eyes fill with tears when I talk about this stuff. But at the same time, I think a lot of people who have gently admonished me towards reconciliation, genuinely sense an absence of malice with my parents. I would ask them to consider what Ive come to realize. All of my parents behavior can be explained by a profound, abiding belief that they are the only people who matter. It isnt as if they considered whether other people might matter, and spitefully rejected the idea. No, they are unaware that other people mattering is even something that is possible. When my mom said Im glad you never asked us for help she was sincerely trying to be helpful. She was benignly reassuring me that my troubles had not perturbed the people who mattered, and that they were generously offering to ignore that my problems had ever happened. When my feelings or experiences are mentioned, when my mom is asked to consider what I might have suffered, I believe her profound confusion and offense at this idea is completely genuine. When they tell BIL that they are open to a reconciliation with me, they think they are being similarly generous. For some reason, even though my parents had three children, only my sister was allowed into that tiny circle of the people who matter, and I think my experience with her amply demonstrates that she is the worse for it. I would not trade places with her for the entire world. I think if I hadnt posted this letter, what ultimately after many emotionally exhausting phone calls, all initiated by me, what would have happened was that Id be allowed some kind of degrading supervised visit situation with the kids. Certainly they would never again be allowed to have the fun experiences they used to enjoy with me. And my sister would enjoy her position of power and control, and feeing like she is able to withhold something from me. I believe she is sincerely very unaware of how her awful actions are percieved. She has has been milking the Reddit thing for all its worth, naively thinking she has found something that will appear to justify her treatment of me -- if she can tell it in a misleading way, or at least embarrass me enough to get me to shut up about it. She really sort of thinks that people will sympathize with her over me at the story of her having stalked me online. She doesnt even realize how much everyone has sympathized with me on this, that they know her actions were creepy and inappropriate. She just doesnt get that the whole world isnt mommy and daddy, they dont believe her bullshit. She is the kind of person who makes fulsome ""suicide awareness"" style posts about how much she misses our brother, as if nobody is going to remember that she has a living sibling or know about how she treats that sibling. She just doesn't get it. As Im reading over this, its setting me free already. I think I must seem almost as mentally ill as my family claims I am, to have put up with as much crap as I did, for as long as I did, and to have tried so hard not to leave the kids behind. A lot of my people who know us have remarked on how cruel it is that my sister yanked her kids away in the wake of my adoption experience, and thought it seemed like she was trying to kick me when I was down. Certainly her reasons for keeping the kids from me morphed and changed as the situation evolved. For whatever reason she did it, I dont believe for a second it was done for the kids benefit. I dont believe for a second that she wanted her children to lose their aunt, after they already lost their uncle. I think she forgot that she was even supposed to pretend to care about that. It was all about her entitlement to act as if she is the only person that matters, and her feelings being so hurt to discover that I had independent thoughts and feelings about her awful actions. In her last email to me, she was still claiming that all of the familys problems were my fault, and I think part of her actually believes that, and its just so sad that she needs to do that. Although my family has accused me and patronized me regarding my mental health, my life has been remarkably enjoyable and stable throughout this ordeal. I have been working for the same organization for the past 10 years, and the past couple of years have been as professionally rewarding as any Ive ever had. I have a great relationship with my ex-husband, and I am blessed to have an incredible partner, through this. Both will corroborate everything Ive said, and more. They and many other wonderful, supportive friends will corroborate the things Ive said and vouch for my sincerity. Virtually everyone who has known our family for a long time has reassured me that they know my sister is full of shit. In spite of everything, I enjoy my life. In spite of everything, I know that I have the better end of the deal. "
473,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,How do you not hate yourself for being so scared and weak?,5,3ryka9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3ryka9/how_do_you_not_hate_yourself_for_being_so_scared/,2015-11-08 13:00:47,"Hello forum, I was just reading someone else's post, and it got me thinking: I really beat myself up for feeling scared, and for having felt scared in the past. Processing my childhood trauma has meant delving into the fear and terror of those experiences when I was young and defenseless and my abusers overpowering and harmful. I used to just think that I was very angry at my abusers; by the time I was an adolescent, I fended them off by acting aggressively and fighting back. I got good at physically defending myself, and quick and smart in verbally defending myself. Since I was a teenager, I've mostly felt angry at them. I had a period of time in my early and mid-twenties, where I was not very angry or aggressive. But, beginning in my late twenties, all of this anger and aggression and rage boiled up. I spent several years just going round for round with my abusers, again. I was diagnosed with PTSD a bit over a year ago, and dealing with processing the trauma, at first brought only rage and anger and hatred and a desire for vengeance, but then, over time, I've realized that beneath all of that anger is fear, lots and lots of fear. Fear of my abusers now, fear from my childhood that I could not handle at that time, and fear of nearly all other people in the world now too. I realize the main reason I became so angry, is that it protected me from my abusers. It also made me feel empowered, because after years of being overpowered and having my vulnerability exploited and my weakness taken advantage of, I got tired of being constantly terrified. The anger empowered me, and made me feel powerful instead of powerless. But underneath it all is fear. And I do not deal well with processing fear, be it from the past or the present. When I feel scared, I feel weak. When I feel weak, I hate myself. I hate myself for being so weak that I stayed in a relationship with my abusers past the age that I was legally or financially or biologically chained to them. I hate myself for having been so scared of them - I wish I had defended myself against them better, more strongly. I hate myself for having cared so much about them accepting me. I hate myself for feeling scared of them, even now, as I am scared they will come after me now to try to hurt me some more. I hate myself for being scared of people in general in the world now. I don't trust people and I am still scared of them. I hate myself for feeling so much fear, in the past, and in the present. So someone else was writing a post where they said that they can give themselves more compassion knowing that they were/are just scared, rather than angry. I'm exactly the opposite. I think I'm strong and ok when I'm angry; I think I'm weak and pathetic when I'm scared. Does anyone else relate? What, if anything, has helped you with this?"

The tendency to make disparaging comments seems to be linked to the personality trait of narcissism. For example: *People high on narcissistic tendencies see themselves as being more important than others and therefore deserving of better treatment, a quality called narcissistic entitlement. *These individuals spend excessive amounts of time polishing up their appearance, and believe themselves to be the center of the universe, an extreme form of egocentrism. *The belief that theyre better than everyone forms the core of narcissistic grandiosity, and these people often take advantage of others. *They lack empathy, so they dont realize the impact that their remarks or behaviors have on their targets. *They pronounce judgments on people they perceive as inferiorwhich is almost everyone. ""Narcissistic people simply look down on others, seeing themselves as superior. Whether they actually feel superior (grandiosity) or are trying to compensate for weakness (vulnerability) could not be determined by this study. ""The upshot? Narcissistic people are more likely to make you feel bad about yourself. Theyll be the ones whose negative evaluation will readily turn into a verbal insult or insulting behavior. The best way to counter these feelings is to consider the source. When someone insults you, consider it a reflection of them, not you. And if you find yourself insulting people without knowing why, its possible that you have a narcissistic streak that you need to learn to control."""

Here is my story: I knew from a very young age that I was ***not*** heterosexual. Sometime around age 7 or so. By 13, I came out to my mom. She was and is very supportive and nurturing, and this was right around the time my parents divorced, so it was easier for me to share things with her without worrying about Nfather finding out. It took me three years after that to come out to him. He ended up telling me that bisexuality ""isn't real."" I continue exploring my sexuality, and for several years went NC with Nfather. Years pass and I come to realize I am not bi, that I am a lesbian. I was about 23 or so. There was a lot about coming to this realization that had to do with the rigid structure Nfather had raised me in, about growing up in a very homogenized area with no other LGBTQ* exposure, etc. Details upon request, but not necessary for this post. I was dating a woman when I decided to reinstigate contact with Nf. It was a weird experience - I had set a filter on my email so any messages from him would be archived, and on a whim started going through what I had missed, and I found That Letter - you know the one. The ""I""m sorry for everything and just want to have you back in my life"" letter. The kind that you *wait* for and never get. Anyway, so that explains why I reestablished contact, though filled with trepidation. I'm giving him limited details about my life, and felt it was important to say something along the lines of ""...I suppose this is a good time as any to fully come out to you as a lesbian. Hi. Questions? Shoot. My male relationships were stepping stones and honestly I've known about all this for a very long time. Longer than I originally realized. I apologize if that startles you or makes you uncomfortable in any way. Please be honest. I'd rather handle someone's discomfort than their silence."" Among other things, the primary part of his reply was ""Wow, . . . I'm really surprised about what you think I know and what you think I don't. I love you, and have known you were lesbian for 10 years..."" Isn't that interesting? I suppose I might have seen that as a red flag, considering how cautious I was being, could only reply with ""For the record, coming out was more for me. I know what you know."" It's really important to set boundaries and stick with them. I realize now many signs and patterns I did not see then. That email correspondence was April 2013. Anyway, there's an added layer of vulnerability growing up LGBTQ* with N parents. Please feel free to share your stories, or ask for any advice, I would love to help how I can. I'm also wondering if mods would be down to have a sub dedicated to this sect if there are enough people who find they relate. I'd be happy to help moderate (this isn't my main account, but I check it nonetheless). Thanks for taking the time to read. "
476,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,"Narcissism, immune response, and emotional allergies",5,3o5vhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3o5vhz/narcissism_immune_response_and_emotional_allergies/,2015-10-10 10:52:10,"I found this in an article on ""healthy narcissism."" == beginning of snippet == Freud considered narcissism a natural part of the human makeup that, taken to extremes, prevents people from having meaningful relationships. It was in the 1930s that Paul Federn introduced the concept to cover an adequate sense of self-love, but not until the 1970s in the work of Otto Kernberg and Heinz Kohut did the idea come to the fore. Kohut spoke of a child's ""normal narcissism"" and of normal narcissistic entitlement; and considered that if early narcissistic needs could be adequately met, the individual would move on to what he called a mature form of positive self-esteem; self-confidence: healthy narcissism. Neville Symington challenged Kohut's belief in positive narcissism, arguing that we do not get positive narcissism without self-hatred, or negative narcissism. While one could talk of healthy self-confidence and positive self-esteem or self-confidence, he considered that it is meaningless to talk about healthy self-centeredness - that (self-centeredness) being the core of narcissism. Nevertheless pop psychology has taken up the idea of healthy narcissism as an aid to self-assertion and success. It has indeed been suggested that it is useful to think of a continuum of narcissism, from the healthy to the pathological, with stable narcissism and destructive narcissism as stopping-points in between. == end of snippet == These two paragraphs above outline a history of looking at or establishing as a thought model the continuum of self love, self-esteem, self-confidence on one end and destructive narcissism on the other end. I also think they're pointing out semantic issues of ""healthy narcissism"" and thinking on whether the name is kind of like saying ""healthy"" and ""bad"" in the same name because the word ""narcissism"" does not (yet) connote self-love, self-esteem or self-confidence. == beginning of snippet == Ronnie Solan uses the metaphor of narcissism as an emotional-immune system for safeguarding the familiarity and the well-being of the individual against invasion by foreign sensations and small differences. The innate immunization vacillates between well-being, in the presence of the familiar, and alertness as well as vulnerability, facing the stranger. From childhood, the familiar is tempting and the strangeness is intolerable from within (illness) or from outside (otherness). Hence, narcissistic immunization might be compared to the activity of the biological immunological system that identifies the familiar protein of the cell and rejects the foreign protein (bacteria, virus). Thus, from infancy to adulthood, getting hurt emotionally is inevitable because the other, even if he or she is a familiar person and dear to us, is still a separate individual that asserts his otherness. The healthy narcissist succeeds in updating narcissistic data (such as acquaintance with the unfamiliar) and in enabling the recovery of self-familiarity from injury and psychic pains. Healthy narcissism activates immunologic process of restoring the stabilization of cohesiveness, integrity and vigorousness of the self and the restoration of the relationship with the other, despite its otherness. Impaired functioning of narcissism fails to activate these narcissistic processes and arouses destructive reactions. Thus, the individual steadfastly maintains his anger toward the other that offended him, and might sever contact with him, even to the extent of exacting violent revenge, although this other might be dear to him, possibly leading through impaired narcissism to fragility and vulnerability of the self, to immature individuation, narcissistic disorders and pathological phenomena. The healthy narcissism contributes to improving emotional intelligence as part of the process of adapting to changes; to intensifying curiosity and investigating the environment; to relating to otherness, and for enhancing 'joie de vivre' or the joy of life. == end of snippet == I think this last snippet is an interesting way of looking at how narcissism involves both dynamic and static constructs. The static construct involves a static level of emotional intelligence which steadily develops throughout a person's life with each successful experience with adapting to change. I inferred a dynamic construct from the immunological metaphor implying that if we experience heavy counts of ""otherness"" our system would need time to adjust and work toward a stabilization. So even a mildly narcissistic person involved with a steady stream of otherness would act wildly narcissistic until given some time to recover from adverse events. For example, an American under some wild circumstances is forced to live in China for 5 years and then begins to exhibit some typical narcissistic traits. So in all people we can see a fluctuation of narcissistic behavior; yet people have a static level of developed emotional intelligence which effectively sets our base level of narcissism."

Tips/ideas/help gratefully received as feeling scared/nervous.,10,3prvdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3prvdy/support_needed_imminent_funeral_where_my_nc_18/,2015-10-23 00:59:58,"Tldr: How to survive funeral with NC nParents attending. It's already going to be a tough day as the funeral is for my SO's mum who died in tragic circumstances. Any tips/help/ideas on handling them and keeping myself and my SO psychologically safe. I feel scared/nervous about seeing them again after 18 months of NC. This is a throwaway due to the details included below but could really do with some support/advice/encouragement. I've included a bit of background... sorry it's long but needed to get it off my chest. If you don't fancy reading all of it, that's fine! Just scroll to the bottom to where it says HELP NEEDED :-) So last week my SO's mum committed what looks at this stage to be suicide, suddenly and unexpectedly. Very very sad. Mental health issues from being in a marriage with a charming, adulterous sociopath for too many years and she never really recovered. SO is gutted, as am I. It's been very very difficult for my SO. Even with these issues my MIL over recent years has been far more supportive and respectful of our boundaries than my nParents. Now we are having to organise a funeral which means family. However, my nParents also knew my MIL reasonably well (though neither were the biggest fans of each other privately) so are coming to the funeral. The thing is, I've been NC for 18 months so haven't seen my nParents since then. We said we needed to take time out to deal with our own issues and recovery (we're both in therapy for the shit we've each been through inc. SO's history of abuse) - of course my nParents tried to make NC all about them and how we were punishing them, isolating ourselves etc. Happy days. So half of therapy time has been spent dealing with their ongoing shit - thanks guys. I've had 2 recent conversations with them. One to let them know (kind of felt I had to as [currently behaving nicely] GCbro knew) - this turned into an argument as once I told them about the death, I asked them what they'd been up to and try and build a little bridge (mistake?) and they immediately launched into how difficult the last 18 months had been and how bad NC had made them feel (I'd kind of expected them to share practical stuff like shopping or seeing friends etc). This was off the back of me telling them about the suicide... (apparently NC is so bad it needs to be brought up in comparison to suicide?!) I launched into them, saying I could no longer be responsible for their pain and that psychologically it was damaging to me for them to keep sharing how much pain I/we caused them IN and out of relationship with them. I also said (again) I couldn't meet their expectations and that they needed to let me go. They insisted/shouted they loved me etc. And that's why they want relationship even though it hurts them. Somehow finished the conversation with them saying I could take as much time as I needed but asking if we could consider doing cards on special occasions because not doing so 'hurt them' (Mother's Day did come up...?!). Ok, fine I'll think about it... (Um, no thanks - haven't told them this yet!) Fast forward a couple of days. I was bruised from the convo but pleased with myself for standing up to them. They then wanted the details on the funeral so I called to check there won't be any 'issues' on the day following our difficult conversation and you could literally cut the atmosphere with a knife. They were silent, angry, cold and distant. So much for the 'supportive' end to last conversation. I think my 'nParents coping ability' battery reserves were already well down at this stage (especially with everything else that is going on plus they've made the last 18 months difficult too) They just said 'yes it will be ok' crossly/coldly. I didn't want another major fight on my hands by this point so (unfortunately) I didn't challenge the atmosphere and ended up capitulating into giving the funeral details without asking what was wrong. I (or rather my inner child) gets terrified when they are like that so I'm guessing that's why I didn't stand up for myself. It's damn hard/exhausting - will chat to my counsellor about that. They then proceeded to try and grill me about what the autopsy results were (I managed to hold my boundary on this one saying I didn't want to talk about it). They then changed tack and asked 'when was the last time you spoke to MIL?' in a very direct, I want to know the answer kind of way. I said a couple of weeks and they followed up with an accusatory 'did you know she was suicidal?' sounding like they were implying that it might have been our fault for not being in touch sooner. They tend to do this - put me under the inquisition and asking questions that put me on the back foot. Fortunately I held another boundary and said I wasn't comfortable with this conversation and they said 'ok, fine' in a huff. Who asks these kinds of questions - we've struggled enough without them apportioning blame on us. I'm sorry - the suicide wasn't in my diary. If I'd have know that was coming of course we'd have done something different - as would everyone else. Makes me feel sick as it is. They also tried to insist MILs abusive ex husband came (just misunderstood and may want to come to pay respects). I said hell no but they still challenged me! Anyway, funeral is next week and nParents are coming. Sympathy card from them arrived once they'd got what they wanted (to come to the funeral). HELP NEEDED: I need to keep myself and my SO psychologically safe on the day. They aren't dangerous physically - just toxic psychologically. I know in an ideal world they wouldn't be coming at all but that horse has already bolted :-( I/we just can't deal with the massive fallout if we turn round and say they can't come. Hopefully they'll behave and keep a low profile. However, what we need from you guys is any ideas/help/tips/tricks/support to keep ourselves present and safe on the day. I know some of you have survived similar events with NC family present. What worked for you? Some of my concern is how I'll react and how to keep myself psychologically safe - I feel scared seeing them again. I feel scared to be emotionally vulnerable on the day. I don't want them to see me cry - but then I can't make this day about them. Both me and my SO will be at the front for bits of the service saying nice stuff. We're both scared of their jealousy. I'm scared of their resentment if I show love/grief to another person that isn't them - especially as I've gone NC with them. I'm scared of them using this vulnerability to their advantage to gaslight me/us or manipulate us into relationship with them again. ""we miss you so much - we want to repair things etc. etc."" or ""why wouldn't you do these things with us?"". I feel trapped and stuck when they do this and never know what to say in defence or to deflect. I get stuck both ways: angry/resentment &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; love bombing and I literally don't know what to do with myself. I know medium chill is one option but I kind of feel past that, certainly for my nParents. Smile or not to smile a fake smile. Ignore or not to ignore? If they talk to me/us what do I say. If they complement us for a 'lovely service' or have a dig at us for something else. If they drop hurtful or pointed comments. I've no idea how they'll be - pretending (gas lighting) everything is fine or fuming in the corner. Or trying to sit on the front row. I really have no idea. Needless to say a more permanent NC will resume following the funeral. Might need some help on what to say on that one but funeral first then worry about the other bits later. Fortunately we live in another state so won't bump into them accidentally, but until then I just need to get through the next couple of days. I might not be able to reply to our comments as it's going to busy few days but thank you so much in advance!"

So, recently I went on a few week tour of a few states via hitching. Being very depressed my whole life, it was a very nice escape. Well, something happened out there that made me need to be home. I plan on going back out, but I need a minute. I'm crashing at my nMom's so I can see my sister and talk things out. She hates this but feeds on my current vulnerability. I went out with a few friends to my old local pubs and had a few while catching up. My friend drops me off and nMom hears the end of a conversation where I forgot what Hydrogen Peroxide was (friend had a slight ear infection and I was throwing some pointers his way.) I walk in our garage and she smugly says I'm drunk, while she is pretty plastered. From the past, I know when she's drunk she wants to belittle me. I say, yeah, had a good night with the boys. She instantly starts going into picking on me for drinking. I had problems in the past, but am on a road where I am totes fine having a few drinks and controlling myself fine. That's when I looked down at my phone and didn't say a word. She starts trying to cut deep. She brings up my dead brother, alcoholism, failed marriage, etc. I gave her nothing. She starts pleading as to why I'm not responding. Nothing. She continues to say I'm a failure because mental issues got me medically discharged from the Army and that I'm not a real man. Give her nothing. About 20 minutes in she's gone from all this to bringing up my military buddy probably killed himself because I'm a bad friend, it was my fault I got sexual abused as a kid, no one loves me. Then, she starts to ""call"" my father to get me. 12 times she sat there and dialed his number while reciting it out loud but never dialed. Didn't get a raise out of me, so a few fake calls to 911 and she's getting nothing. Eventually, I stood up and grabbed my ready to go vagabond pack and walked off into the night. I ended up camping in the woods where I completed two books and allowed myself to calm down. My mental issues can cause me to lose myself for a few days, but I bounced back fine. Checkmate, bitch. Checkmate. EDIT: So, got my first gold by going reverse super sayan on my nMom, eh? Thanks, you beautiful stranger. I wish I could cut her off, but the validation of Internet gold will carry me for a while :)"

I've discovered this forum a few month ago, and I've been really interested by all your experiences, which are really hard to believe at first, and harder to live. It helped me understand better the relationships some of my friends had to endure with their parent, and the amount of crazyness they have been subject to. The level of support you are showing each other is a real gift, and I hope you will be ableto help me do something for my brother, who is currently married to a possible narcissic girl. I've recently heard of a lot of behavior quite harsh from her, and I will try making a short but exhaustive description of their situation. My brother had a hard time finding a girl loving him, surely due to lack of confidence, and a lot of emotional vulnerability (his relationship with our father was never really good, and as the elder child, he got it harder than me and our other sibling). I know he was for several year on the leash of a girl that played with him, and that episode of his life left him quite distressed. He met in his mid twenty his future wife while they were still students, and they got engaged a few year later. It seems that she invested herself a lot in the relationship at this time, because she got through a lot of trouble with her own family to get them to accept it(different culture/ethnic background, not very acceptive of foreigners). Later, my brother found a job, and she stayed unemployed, often telling it was because she wasn't good enough in our language. They then proceed to have a son, and 3 year later a daughter. So. Here come the real problems : * after some 8 or 9 years, she hasn't worked a day, and my brother is the only one bringing money to the house * their appartements have always been dirty, except when her mother came from abroad to 'visit' * their children had a shitty education. Boy is near 5, and really difficult to manage, due to a lack of authority from both it's parent or sabotage of my brother by it's wife. Since his sister is 2, it seems though he get yelled at for anything he does or his sister does. Because she cannot be responsible (""she's a baby""), he must be. Girl is 2 near 3, and still treated as a baby that cannot be responsible for anything, including when she do bad, tricky or reprehensible things to her brother, another person, or the environment. She do not speak our language, but it is said she speak her mother's. She usually scream to get things she wants. The girl slept in her parent's bed for a very unhealthy long time, so did her brother. It is very hard to put them to bed, or to use autoritah over them (boy is defiant even when he did visibly bad things, girl doesn't conceive you are telling her she did something wrong. She close her ear until mama come back to grab her. * SIL often mock my brother for it's lack of adress (he was born in advance, and has a very small lack of coordination of it's right and left body). It has been said to me it was quite cruel, and engineered (tasking him to do one thing, another while doing the first, and another,.. until he forgot something or do something bad). * SIL is lazy. She needs everyone else to do thing in her place. When eating, she never get up to pick thing or to make space, she contribute very little to the domestic workload (she doesn't work either) * SIL is entitled: her mother come every year or so from accross the world, and she is expected to behave like a near slave. Spoiled child etc. My brother seem to accept this situation as normal, while I'm shocked. I do remember eating at their place while she did everything, retreating to the children's room once the preparation were complete. When I started doing the dishes (I like doing that), I was told to stop because she will take care of it. Very disturbing. * I don't know how to caracterize that, but she also have creepy habits. A few weeks ago, in vacation, she had him accompany her to toilet at night because she was afraid of climbing down the stair. At night. She woke him. Same story at the beach, she woke him repeteadly to put sunscreen on their children while he napped. Couldn't do it herself visibly. * SIL is also very infatueted with her beauty. She is older than him and take a lot of pride in looking way younger that her age. Visibly, it's something she really take care of. * Again on the money side, she has a stash of money she didn't touch for year. My mother gifted our brother a very important sum (80 000) to help him buy an appartment, and he decided to share it with his wife, against her wishes. She never used this money for anything related to their expenses, and is living of my brother wages. * SIL was raised as a one child, and probably spoiled for a good amount of her youth At the moment, I'm quitte afraid to have a possible SG/GC situation, with a fairly creepy mother, and the role already assigned. But from what I've read, it will likely start in 2 year when the boy will reach 7 and get a better sense of himself. Anyway, that will be difficult, because everytime we tried to discuss children education with him, we got a barrier erected ""You do not have children, you cannot possibly understand"", aka ""shutup, i'm not talking to you about this"". My real problem is my brother situation. I love him, but he is exhausted. He works 40-45h a week a job he doesn't like, and is expected to do a fucking lot of things at home (I don't the exact repartition of task, if there is any). He doesn't give himself any time, any love, any care. No sport, no reading, no relaxation, no rest. I tried speaking to him about doing some sport with me once in a while, taking the time to self-rub his feet, anything to do something for himself and no-one else for once, it's like talking to an automat. He promise me he will see to it, and then don't. Worse, he is starting to behave with his son like our father did with us when he was at the peak of his unparenting skill. Talking of contract with rules that are tantamount is not really an efficient thing to do with 5 year old boy. He recently tell our mother that he (they) doesn't want to have anything to do with her anymore, while she regularly took care of the boy to help them/him have a breather. Similarly, it's really hard to have meaningful conversation with him, since he is quicker to confrontation than ever, always lashing at the slightest opportunity about uncommon hobby, or commenting political subjet with level 0 subtility/reflexion (he used to be very interested in that, that's a shame). My sibling and I fear he is going at top speed to a burn-out, and that his wife will do nothing to help him or prevent that. I've been thinking of gifting him some book with insight on the world or life (like The Prophet of Khalil Djibran, that I discovered thanks to this sub), but truth be told, I'm lost, and don't know what to do. So, here I am, RBN. I don't know if this is relevant to this forum or if I should go to /r/relationship instead, but I am really afraid he picked the wrong one, and she already did some serious damage to my brother and their children. Also, english is not my primary language so there may be some spelling / grammar / orthographic mistakes. I apologize! Edit: trying to reformat a bit"

These situations are typically with an entitled person who expects something from me for whatever reason. I'm of the opinion that you should not expect, ever, and especially not from me because i make it a point not to owe anyone anything. The catch is that i am sometimes cornered by these people and cannot easily escape. So what's plan b when you can't escape without physical contact? I'm not a small or young man.

I knew it was a risk, but I was cornered into it because the pain would not remit. Now though, I see that no matter what Nfam is up to, my body, as it exists today with PTSD, is entirely unable to process stress without exercise and I must return to focusing on achieving a short yet crucial list of Wellness activities daily to help myself. This includes hydrating, showering, making sure I have clean clothes to wear. feeding myself properly, daily exercise, sleep hygiene, and LC with the internet- as triggers seem lately to come through the screen unexpectedly as though I'm CarolAnn in Poltergeist. And I am, by doing these things- actively engaged in my escape plan, because if I am not well- it will be almost impossible to escape from living with Nfam. I must do this to escape. So I will.

I live in constant fear of my NMom ever figuring out that I am not as OK with her shit as I may pretend, so I am going super anon on this. My background: I got the one-two punch of an Nmom and an Ndad. Childhood was a mess, followed by early adulthood. After 10 years of therapy, I've learned to accept that my parents' behavior is about them, not me, and no matter what I do, I won't change it. I am low contact, which has helped. If anything, it's given me a bit of power back in the relationship. I see them a couple of times a year, and only on my terms. After a few years of them blaming me for being an ungrateful jerk for not calling them and visiting every single weekend so I can deal with more of their emotional abuse, they seem to have improved. They realize that if they piss me off with hostility and judgement, I'll just leave. I know this just adds more dysfunction, but it keeps the relationship civil and superficial. One of the times I see them is over the Fourth of July. I took time off of work to travel and stay with them over the weekend. My brother and sister-in-law came this year as well, and brought my brother's best friend (We'll call him BF). BF's mom and my Nmom go way back and are very close, and Nmom has known BF since he was born. She often says hurtful things like ""He's my favorite child"" in front of me and my siblings. I moved far away from my family so I do not have to deal with them very often - siblings included. So I haven't seen BF for I don't know how long. He's not really anyone I ever was close with, but he is *always* around at family functions. I've never had a beef with him, however, I don't understand why he is always around and inserting himself into family events. I got strong armed into inviting him to my wedding a few years ago, which I did, just because it wasn't worth the argument. I have absolutely no interaction with him other than situations like this - I'm expecting to see my family and am prepared with certain techniques I've learned through therapy to deflect N behavior, and now there is another person hanging over to add to the dysfunctional dynamic. And trust me, he does, because he has an opinion about everything. I tend to ignore him other than mild small talk when I see him. Anyhow, over the weekend, he just kept starting shit with me. At first it was playful ribbing, but it kept getting more antagonistic, and passive aggressive. For instance, I was talking to my sister-in-law about a pizza place I missed from my hometown (where she, my bro, and BF live). BF inserts himself into the conversation and says, ""You only miss it because you had shitty taste and you didn't know what good food was."" Big deal? No. Hostile? Absolutely. And a whole weekend of crap like that took a toll. He was really unpleasant to be around. I sucked it up because I kept waiting for my Nmom to point out that he was being an ass. After BF left for the weekend, I made a comment to Nmom that I really did not appreciate the way that BF spoke to me over the weekend. She shrugged and said nothing, which actually pissed me off even more. So I decided to take the risk and actually explain why this bothers me - showing dissatisfaction in my household was a sign of vulnerability, and vulnerability triggers N behavior from Ndad, so please understand, it's a real big deal for me to tell my Nmom that something makes me uncomfortable. I told her that when I decide to take time off of work, travel a distance, and spend time with family, it's unfortunate that I'm made to feel attacked and uncomfortable by someone who isn't even part of the family. She told me I should be telling BF this and not her, and while she sort of has a point, I really just want her to tell me that she feels bad that I was uncomfortable. I want her to be a mom to me for once in the past 40 years and make me feel safe. I told her that as a house guest, I decided not to create tension by fighting with another house guest, but I wanted to leave letting her know that I was extremely uncomfortable and, once again, if I'm going to be with family, I should have a reasonable expectation of not being attacked by outsiders. Then my Nmom said, ""He's like a son to me and is part of the family"". I just let it go, because really, what is there to be gained by continuing this discussion? But I'm just super annoyed now. Nmom wonders why I don't visit, and when I do, and I open up and am honest about something that isn't right, I get crap like this. Someone reading this may think, ""what's the big deal"", but what she essentially said was that my feelings don't mean shit, and she's more concerned about the happiness of someone who isn't even her offspring. Thanks for letting me vent."
484,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Narcs and their attitude towards negative emotions,3,3d11u3,http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3d11u3/narcs_and_their_attitude_towards_negative_emotions/,2015-07-13 03:09:27,"In recent years, I've tried to analyze the narcs in my life to understand a lot of the messed up and difficult things that have been done to me. I'm irritated as f*ck that there's barely anyone I can even vent to or begin to describe these things to, because they know nothing about narcissism or NPD and all their intricacies. Here's something I've begun to unravel about the narcs in my life, and I wondered if anybody else dealing with Ns or Nparents has seen this same strange display of behaviour. I've noticed that my Nmom has a very strange and unhealthy attitude towards any sort of negative emotions such as anger, fear, or sadness. She actually gets annoyed when people around her are angry or sad, and accuses them of not trying hard enough to be positive when they can't stop being angry or sad. Likewise, she hates people being happy around her when she's in a sad or angry mood herself. When she's annoyed or upset with a particular person, she follows them around or harasses them through texts to make it doubly clear that they should be feeling ashamed of what they've done (often, that punishment doesn't fit what they did, but that's for another day). Another angle to this, is that she can't heathily discuss or understand anything which involves negativity in some way. As an example of this (not an exact example, but very similar to ones which have happened), you could be talking about a moment in a movie you recently saw that really moved you, because a character in the film died unexpectedly. You might then go on to say that you think this is the part of the film that made it so gripping for you, because it was well written into the plot and really made you wonder what would happen next, and so on. Whereas a lot of people could relate to this, my Nmom would say ""That's not very nice, though, is it? It isn't a happy thing, so it's not nice."" and proceed to make out that you're sick in the head for finding appreciation or enjoyment in something that wasn't purely about happiness, or rather ""somebody dying which isn't very nice"". She applies this to everything. Films, books, and even songs. If they involve something like dealing with death, or melancholy emotions of the characters, they're dismissed as 'not nice'. If they're about nothing but somebody singing about how happy they are, or having fortunate things happen to them, she wholeheartedly approves of it. To her, there is no beauty or understanding in anything to do with the darker side of life. Another slightly different example of this sticks in my head, too. I remember one time we were talking years ago, and I mentioned a book I'd read as a young kid. I simply commented that it was the first sad book I'd really read. I wasn't sad while I said that, I was completely normal, it was like a ""That's kind of strange to think of, because when you grow up you read and see a lot of sad books and films."" But her response was to start saying ""That's so sweet"" in this patronizing voice, and acting as if I'd just broken down into tears when I was sat there totally normal. It was that day I finally began to realise, it's as if she quietly saw being angry, sad, or going through any sort of problem as weakness. She seems to think that even mentioning something relating to the topic of sadness or anger, is a sign of vulnerability which she can exploit to gain some kind of control over the person by being the one to 'fix their problems'. The problem with this is that I've noticed because she has such a f*cked up definition of negative emotions, anything at all which involves negative emotions is mutually exclusive with 'vulnerability' in her mind - Looking for a spoon you lost in the kitchen, sorting out that loan you have to pay off, anything. Simply expressing that these are things you're going through, makes her quietly believe that you're weak or there is some weakness you're hiding she can make her mission to unravel and cure you of. She portrays herself as the opposite of this. A highly sensitive person with an ""I'm always here to help the poor souls of the world"" persona, and in a backwards way I think she really does believe she's very understanding of people. But ironically, I've realised that it's that very front which represents how she has a misguided view of how to deal with negative emotions adequately. It's infuriating. I've looked back and realised just how much these twisted ideas of how to feel about expressing your emotions were engrained into me growing up, particularly making me feel there was a stigma that came with being sad or angry, or liking something because it was moving, and all I can guess is that my Nmom was never taught a healthy way to deal with those feelings by her own parents? I feel as if she's ashamed of these emotions in herself, and so projects how she feels about her flawed inner self onto others. Constantly convincing herself she's 'happy' and can only allow and appreciate 'happy' (in a superficial sense of the word) things is her escapism from this."

I've gotten closer to my friend's dad which offers more guidance and for that I'm grateful. The other day, I was telling him how I felt guilty and lonely all the time. The guiltyness is an attribute of me not being able to ignore insults, but the loneliness comes from something more overwhelming that has everything to do with my upbringing. I'm strange in the way I'm a very open person and most people love that and grow quickly attached to me. It's nothing I'm not used to and always confused me. I'd find out even though I'm very open, i have a lot of emotional guards and it's very difficult to make me feel both vulnerable and loved. This may explain why when i have a crush, it's a race to find out how crazy they are before i get too deeply involved with them. He tells me I assume the worst in people. Easy solution is learn to be vulnerable and the loneliness will go away. The reason that is so difficult for me is because in the past year, the few people I have gotten vulnerable and emotionally connected to have intentionally hurt me and taken advantage of me and i knew i should have listen to my gut. The other part of vulnerability is the risk of getting hurt and I'm really tired of getting hurt and the loneliness gets worse when i get dissapointed by someone.

My SO has an Nmom. I could tell from the moment I met her. She manipulates him into taking care of her and then puts him down (in front of me and his two sisters). As a response, he defends against any input from anyone. He does not take advice from anyone close to him (just says ok with blank stare) and lashes out when he gets frustrated. There have been many incidents where he yells at someone because of what he thinks they said when he only misheard them. And he does not meaningfully apologize after. It is more of a shrug off than apology. As time goes on, I am growing more and more frustrated with the both of them. When I am around his family and a fight pops up, I try to see both sides and deescalate the situation, but it's like the yelling is more important to them because they never resolve anything. They cool off in some corner alone and then randomly everything goes back to brewing just below the surface. It is really awkward for me. This behavior pattern he has with his family spills over into our relationship. He rarely expresses his true feelings to me. When I have something to say to him that is important and about our relationship, he explodes back at me as if he has to get out all his frustrations right then and there and then shuts down. We rarely have a meaningful discussion about our relationship because he goes from defense mode to spazzing out within seconds--there is no assertive level in between. Any uncomfortable situation is fight or flight with him. I have never seen him take criticism and then assert his position. It is like the criticism shatters him and he just lashes out then closes up. From observing his arguments at home, I think it comes from the way his mother speaks to him. He can't get a word in and it's like a constant barrage of underhanded character attacks from her. When I try and talk about something serious like how he needs to set up his health insurance, his shoulders slump, he huffs and puffs, and then gives me this look of utter deflation. This look continues through me talking and him saying ok. He does not contribute to the conversation and then just starts spazzing and telling me how that's not a priority for him or how he's overwhelmed. It does not matter who else can hear, he will just start yelling at me as if I am some super hulk that he has to overcome. We just had an incident about something having to do with sex and it ended in him cussing at me and calling me a bitch loud enough for both his roommates to hear. I am at my wits' end. he always apologizes after, but I am tired of being the one to deal with the leftover bullshit between him and his mom. I want him to let me in on what he is struggling with so that I can help him fight his battles. I don't want to be the one he lashes out at. I would like to hear how he feels on issues and aspects of our relationship before he blows up. I would like to hear about his favorite color or how someone at work insulted his favorite movie and how it pissed him off. Or even his observations about people he interacted with that day. I get none of this. I makes me feel as if he shuts me out. I have opened up to him about 3 times now in regards to my sexual abuse as a child and how messed up I was from it and sought out his advice on how to deal with emotional issues related to it. I had never done that with anyone else before him and he knows that. I think I deserve the same kind of vulnerability from him. He won't even discuss his mom issues with me or his drug addict father with me (his sisters give me more information on this than he does). He attributes his depression growing up to his diet and lack of physical activity so he is now a strict vegetarian and tries to be minimalistic. Like he is the nicest guy until there is conflict. After reading some of these posts in RBN, I am thinking he just does not have access to that part of himself or that it is underdeveloped because of the environment created by his Nmom. I do not think he ever had room to assert his point of view. I am sorry for the extra long post, but I am worn out looking for a way to make this relationship work. Sometimes I think it would be easier to be with someone that is more well adjusted, but then I realize that I have hella issues too and start thinking that I should just be patient with him. I have tried therapy and writing him a long letter about how I feel, but we keep ending up in this same spot every 6 months or so. I am ready to get married and have a family, but I am from a big family and know how stressful family life is. Remaining calm when you are frustrated is like the only way to work through conflicts that pop up in a healthy manner. I am afraid that if we do not try and work on this now, our family will not work and we will just create a broken home and make our kids suffer through it. "
488,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Father's Day phone call hijacked by N's,29,3apmbg,http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3apmbg/fathers_day_phone_call_hijacked_by_ns/,2015-06-22 23:59:29,"Hello RBN, I'm sure I'm not the only one dealing with some kind of Father's Day fall out. So the set up for this saga began Saturday night/Sunday morning around midnight. Which as we all know is the best time to text message a novel to someone. So I'm watching Netflix with my SO when this massive text message comes into my inbox. It's N-Step mom who says verbatim: *""Your N-gma really has her feelings hurt. She commented on your Facebook and you did not respond but your SO did. She is pretty hurt. Without her knowing I told you to, could you reply and call her?""* What? This just in RBN: My Ngma has discovered the fountain of youth and has reverted to a 13-year old girl. Second, my N-step mom is now the champion of all the people in my family who I have wronged with my insensitiveness. I've posted in the past about Ngma. But trust me, she's not really that upset. And the comment she posted? One of many commenting on a picture of flowers from my SO that I shared. I didn't know I needed to reply to that? This is gearing up to Father's Day. So I worked on Sunday but on my break I called my Dad to send him the obligatory Happy Father's Day. Two minutes of it is me being quiet on the phone while he talks to a car dealer. The next minute is him telling me he's buying a new truck. Ten seconds is ""Oh congrats on the new job. I know I've been busy but I'm proud of you. Here, Nstepmom wants to talk to you."" *Wait don't go....* Nstep mom lights into me as soon as my dad walks away. Apparently my ngma called and told my Dad that I was ignoring her on Facebook. That she was hurt. She knows I have a new job. What the flowers were for. Why won't I talk to her? Apparently my actions sadden my NDad so much he was moved to silence and had to give Nstep the phone to finish the phone call. I know guys, she is the martyr we all need. So Nstep comforts my Ngma and assures her I will be dealt with. I also learned old people don't know how to work a phone and it's our duty to always be the one who calls. The kicker was she mentioned my dead grandmother, who I am incredibly close with. She said that if she was alive and my mom asked me to call her, I would. Why couldn't I call Ngma when she asked? That I'd regret not calling Ngma when she finally dies. Thanks, Nstep. Now I will admit I didn't handle this best. This week I have been negotiating with two companies for a new job. I also got let go from my old one. We had a tornado warning at my weekend job on Saturday which seemed to be the breaking point of a high octane stress week...I had an anxiety attack at work. It was my first time ever dealing with that. It messed with me. When she had first texted me Saturday night, I was still not in the best sorts from this so I engaged. Sunday I was still angry she had tried this and it devolved into a screaming match. My break ended and I had to go back to my weekend job. She left it saying she would be calling me back to discuss this on Monday night, tonight. I doubt my Ngma seriously put her up to this. I think this is just my Nstep meddling where she isn't needed especially since I've had good news this week. I don't want to call my Ngma. She has never been there for me growing up, I am okay with letting her have an audience style view of my life from Facebook. I think Nstep saw this as a golden opportunity to butt in where she had no business being. What do I do when she calls back? My mom wants me to go NC but I feel like that's pretty extreme. I'm so angry she started this on Father's day. I'm angry she managed to take advantage of my emotional state and that I was stupid enough to engage her. I'm furious she tried using my grandmother's death as a bargaining chip for me to call a woman who gives no shits about me. I'm irritated she thinks I'm still a child she can guilt trip and order around. I'm sort of laughing this is all over a possible Facebook comment. **TL;DR: Nstep mom takes it upon herself to become a champion for my Ngma and tells me I need to call her, since I hurt ngma's feelings for not replying to a Facebook photo comment. Many rude comments including one about my dead gma abound. She must have smelled my vulnerability from states away and chose post-first anxiety attack to text me with this, and Father's Day phone call to deliver the final blow. She is calling me tonight to continue accusing me of being a terrible person for not calling my Ngma.** "

Just like any quarrel, at the start he said some mean, unbearable things, which hurt me badly. Today, I was telling my colleague I lost my sim card somewhere on the road. Ndad interrupted immediately ""what? You lost your sim card?"" I didn't need his opinion, tbh, I think he should (for once) try to keep quiet and respect my conversation with another colleague. So I didn't respond to him. Kept telling it to my colleague. Suddenly, my Ndad get his phone from his pocket, with a very LOUD (attention-seeking manner) voice, he called the phone company and said, ""HELLO? Is this X company? I want to say I've just lost my sim card. What? Can you help me please?"" - I don't need someone to decide for me what to do. (note: in the past, everything was decided, manipulated by him, I was never given a real chance to deal with anything, unless I fight for it.) Mumbling in his mouth, ""Damn, I'm gonna pay money if they pick up and use the card!"" I was upset by this, not a simple case, but linked with all the past of how he treated me like an ""extension of his"". (What? I don't hear your voice, let me ""help"" you do all the things!) On the way, I couldn't stop recalling how bad it was, when I was a child. Tonight, I went home full of anger. With anger inside, I said to him things in full of irony tones, personal attacks, swears, all the anger that inside me. Of course, he did the same too, which defence him and somehow made my attacks in vain. I saw there is no way out, and I'm also draining inside. So I tried another way - I turned to a peaceful voice and said, in honesty(no crying cause that will expose vulnerability.) of what he did was so disrespecting, and upsetting. ""X, do you know how upset was I at lunch? Did you know what you said?(the thing makes me still angry is that he said he forgot what he said when I question him, F*ck) You told me all those things - I can't understand why? Dad, I'm already 18 years old, almost turning 19. I know how to get a new sim card, and cut the old one. Did you ever think I can actually do it? Do you know how much upset were I when you held the phone and did that call? Did you know for so many years you never let me to deal anything that I can actually deal myself? Dad, may I put this way? - I'm so upset I'm 18 years old, and my father still helps me clean the sh*t in my asshole.(like that's what parents do when we are babies.) I'm so upset."" Him, ""WTF, I don't want to say anything. I have nothing to say to you."" Me, ""Don't clean my sh*t again."" Him, ""hahaha.."" (ironically laughs) My heart almost broke when my confession fails. He kept saying ""I don't want to say anything to you."" no matter what I said. Is he saying this because he know he is wrong, just not brave enough to verbally admit it? Will he at least fine-tune his behaviour next time? Please, I'm so afraid, I'm putting hopes on a narcissist, which I'm so afraid that my hopes will be disappointed again. (P.S. I tried this kind of confrontation before, the subtle difference is, this time I let go, learn to withdraw, no need to get the last-line for arguments, so I'm wondering if it will anyhow make a difference. Because bitting it, not let go will just keep pissing the person off and squash his willingness to change if he has any.) Pls, comments? Any?"
490,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Just had a nightmare about Nmom,3,3atdua,http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3atdua/just_had_a_nightmare_about_nmom/,2015-06-23 20:33:26,"So I just had a dream in which I was driving a car in an ice covered parking garage in NYC. I was making my way out slowly, as not to slide, but the line of cars behind me was long and getting pissed at my slow driving. My brother was in the car yelling at me to go faster but I was afraid to. Later in the dream, I was with my mother in a department store in the city, still shaken from the screaming drivers behind me, asking her to validate that my actions were the safe and right ones. Just like in real life, she began to contradict every little point I made, saying ""I agree with you, but why do you have to be so right all the time? It wasn't a big deal, calm down. Let's just drop it."" We began to argue and at one point she lunged at me (she used to do this when I was younger) and so I ran away, and I woke up in a panic when I hit a dead end. Now I'm sitting here thinking of everything she's ever done to me, and I hate this because I feel pathetic. I just want to get some things out. My mom provides very well for our family. She does a lot of things for us kids, and has been there for me when I've needed it, emotionally. This I truly appreciate. What I do not is the way she holds it over our heads like a 100 lbs anvil. When things don't go her way, she flips out, calling us ungrateful. She once said to me that if she knew how difficult raising me would be, she would have never had children. I'm not sitting here saying I was always a great kid. I had an attitude problem to start out for sure (I'm talking around 10,11,12 yrs old). But instead of addressing it like an adult, she chose to combat my immaturity with more immaturity. For a long time, I thought I deserved the things she said and did to me (horrible insults, gave me a black eye in grade school, dragged me by my hair, threw me on the ground). But now I see that despite my being a mouthy kid, she tended to escalate the situations with screaming and violence, which made me mouthier (read: scream louder because I was scared), and were it not for that, I would not have been nearly as agitated, hostile or angry with her through grade school and high school. It's not just me that she's delusional and weird around, it's other people too. My mom is incapable of empathy, unless it's fake, overdone, or for other people to see. for example, we were talking once about when other people say hurtful things to us. I made the point essentially that hurt people hurt people -- sometimes people need to appreciate that the insult someone throws at you, hurts you less than the pain they're feeling to begin with (ironic, given that my mother's the one person I struggle to remember that with). She then launched into a counter point story about how one time, her friend who doesn't make a lot of money was talking to her about how her son was injured and they have trouble paying the bills, and how the stress of it wakes her up at night, finishing with, ""It makes me sick that you don't have to worry about that"" (bc my mom makes a lot of money). My mom told me she replied, ""well, I don't have to worry now, but in college, I lived on my own and maxed out my credit cards for groceries, blah blah blah so I do know how you feel."" Could she not see how DIFFERENT the situations were? That in college my mother didn't have CHILDREN or a HOUSE to pay for? That she pretty much just invalidated her friend's horrible fear to ""clear her name"" so to speak? My mother is always so concerned about portraying the squeaky clean image of perfect working mom, and her insecurity around that matter is often tended to at the expense of her personal relationships. She is so prideful that she refuses to let even her own family ""bring her down"", so to speak, meanwhile I have never felt one honest moment of vulnerability and trust with her, even when she's ""been there for me"" because I fully expected her to use it against me at some point (which she did). Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get it off my chest, I'm living at home again this summer and she's driving me bat shit crazy...."

Have you got any clues for me? 7 days later your beautiful, gorgeous niece turns one. mom is making an identical shaped cake to your first birthday cake, but toby and clare have banned sugar (which seems a bit harsh to me) so not sure it will be so tasty and full of smarties as yours was. Charlie Rory Max will all be here plus wives and children and it would be wonderful if you came too to meet your beautiful niece. She will give her uncle unconditional love. Alex and Justine with whom you stayed will be also be here that weekend. On the day toby and clare arrive on the 18th your uncle peter and Stephanie, whom you once said you really like will be staying and like everyone else they would really love to see you. I know toby wants to try and find peace with you too. Please john will you give some thought to seeing your family who all love you and want to see you. It would be tremendous if you could come over. Thinking about you Love Dad ****************************************** I was particularly sickened by the ""she will give her uncle unconditional love"". Apparently N's get along great with very small children because they can feed off the attention, vulnerability and need. To me, it's pretty obvious that this email is written with the hopes of avoiding any awkward questions about my absence. I mean, he didn't say anything about the past (never does) or even ask about how I am getting along. Last time we spoke, I was broke, homeless and going through a tough break-up. I guess it isn't worth asking about that stuff? "

WELL THERE YOU GO CHANGING YOUR MOOD ON A DIME AGAIN! I'M HANGING UP BEFORE YOU GO TOTALLY OFF THE RAILS!!!"" Sweet Baby Jesus. This literally just happened. Now, my Mom isn't a full blown N. Lots and lots of fleas, untreated BPD, serious depression issues. When she's medicated and things running pretty smoothly in her life, she's pretty much okay. At a distance. For short periods of time. When she's not medicated, not even distance can totally save you from the batshit crazies. As an adult, we have a pretty decent relationship as long as I keep the boundaries firmly in place and don't take the occasional WTF outburst personally. I've made the choice to occasionally hang out with the proverbial monkeys (it's just not my circus any more), can't be too pissed off when I get hit by flying poo. It's been said here before. N's gonna N. And I have no issue with wiping off the shit and moving on with the day. Not to say that I don't have a bucket-full of issues myself. Mom and I have a decent - tho still entanglement-prone - relationship now that I'm grown there's several hours of distance between us. But growing up, I literally lived with a madwoman. I won't get into all the horrors - and they WERE horrors - of growing up in that house in this post. I struggle with severe depression and anxiety (diagnosed / medicated), as well as diagnosed PTSD issues both from how I was raised and from my career as a first responder/emergency call-taker/dispatcher. Oh, and I have codependent tendencies like they were on a buy-one-get all you can carry sale. You know. The usual. It's been a rough couple weeks here. My psychiatrist moved out of state, so I've been struggling to find a new one after a god-awful session with the other doctor at the practice (who I strongly suspect is an N herself). My long-time friend and partner - friends for over a decade, partners for nearly five years - dumped me on my ass for another woman over the phone. And I've been struggling with the realization that my career as a first responder is most likely over (I took a life-changer of a call back in August of last year and have been out on medical leave for severe PTSD since April of this year). Understandably, there's been a LOT of crying, a lot of wrestling with my depression, but overall I'm managing okay. I've got a great support system up here, thank God. But  sometimes I still just want my mommy. Even tho I know that showing and sharing emotional or mental vulnerability to her is just an awful idea all around. When things are good, tho, it's all too easy to fall into old habits and the entanglement trap because she can just be so NORMAL. That, and over sharing details of my life was a coping mechanism I developed early on in my teens. If I owned everything that was fucked up in my life, if I shared all my screw-ups and struggles, then they were SO much harder to be used against me. And being an emotional wreck the past couple weeks, I have DEFINITELY over shared, which in turn has resulted in Mom trying her damnedest to assert control again. Thing is, it doesn't work so great when your ""kid"" is in her thirties. Okay. So finally on to the story itself. This all started earlier this week when Mom decided she was going to call and I was ""going to listen to some hard truths about myself, no matter HOW old you are."" These are all the same things she's thrown at me since childhood. I'm lazy. I'm unmotivated. I need to just get out of bed and get over it. I keep a messy house. I need to exercise. And for one of the first times in my life I decided - yeah, enough is enough. I remember actually taking my phone away from my ear - Mom still pontificating - and looking at it going WTF? Is this for real? Put it back to my ear ""and you need to get rid of those damn cats"" ""Hey, Mom?"" I interrupted, ""I'm not going to sit here and listen to a lecture."" Calm as anything. Might as well have been saying that I was stepping out to check the mail. I swear to god I could HEAR the gears jam in her brain. ""Well you're going to hear some hard truths about yourself"" Ah, yes. If at first you don't succeed, start over and try again. I think I actually started laughing at this point, and very cheerfully talked over her and said ""All right! So I'm gonna go ahead and let you go, and I'll talk to you later! Bye!"" Click. While she's still sputtering mid-sentence. Flash forward to today - she still has not acknowledged the earlier phone call - tho she did text several hours later that same day and ask if I was ""feeling better?"". She and I are talking on the phone - just general weekend pleasantries, have you seen such-and-such video online, so forth and so on. I mention that I've been keeping a no contact calendar for myself as a bit of an empowerment thing in regards to my ex. (Shoutout to /r/ExNoContact for helping me keep my sanity as well as my dignity). Her response just made me shake my head. ""Psh. He is already out of my mind. You just need to get over it and stop letting him control your emotions and not let it bother you."" See, the thing is, I am ""over-it"". The calendar is for me, to make me feel empowered. Look how long I've been without that asshole in my life! I said something to the extent of it ""it doesn't bother me at all."" ""Well OBVIOUSLY it does bother you and "" I tuned out at this point. And just like I did earlier in the week, calm and cheerful as could be, I say, ""Mom. Please do not tell me how I feel about a given situation."" ""Well THERE YOU GO, changing your mood on a dime! I'm hanging up before you just completely go off the rails!!"" (Holy projection, Batman!) ""Okay, cool! Have a good one and I'll catch you later!"" Cue her hanging up in a huff. It took me actually writing this post to realize that she was trying to use the same tactic on me that I'd used on her earlier in the week. And when I did realize it, I got tickled all over again and started laughing at the absolute absurdity of it all. ""You hang up in me, I'll hang up on you! And it's YOUR fault because YOU went off the rails!"" Meanwhile I'm over here proud of myself as can be because 1) I threw down some boundaries, 2) I KEPT those boundaries, and 3) I'm on day 5 of no contact with my Ex, I'm happy about it, and it's getting easier by the hour.

Recent conversations between she and I have revealed such wondrously bigoted quotes from our Nmother as the title says. To me, she has always been my evil stepmother, and I think partially she hates my sister being anything like me because of blood relation. I've always been the half child, but since graduating I've become GC to her face, but still SG in that crock of triangulation N's love so much. My sister has been on the receiving end of various other put-downs, discouragements, weight-shaming, etc., leading my sister to hate herself. They buy nothing but junk food, try a new diet every few days, and my sister has gained 50+ lbs since I saw her at Christmas. I experienced similar things at home, which is why I left as soon as possible, but it seems like since they can't take their BS out on me anymore, they've doubled down on my sister. I feared that my sister had become the SG, as she's always been teetering between SG and GC while I was home. (Nstepmother, despite a 6 year difference between my sister and I, pit us against each other constantly. It's gross, there's heavy triangulation, and the extended family is super enabling.)

It's a bit of a shock. A little background: I've always known my family weren't like other people's. Most people's parents didn't constantly say ""I can't wait until you're 18 and move out - send me a postcard every now and then to let me know you're ok."" Most people's parents didn't alternate between saying ""You're my brightest star"" and throwing them across the room like a right doll - I still have scarring on my scalp where the radiator cut my head open. Most people's parents didn't play their children off against one another, or blame their anorexic daughter for attention seeking. But I'm a classic middle child - I've always excused, empathised and tried above all to keep the peace. Always there with a quick excuse for her, when she ignored us, or to give her a hug when she was crying and saying she felt guilty. Always listening when she told me it was my father's fault ( - and some of it was, but that's a messed up story for another time). Until now. Everyone in my family has been diagnosed with a mental illness at some point: I have general anxiety, panic disorder and anorexia ( - in recovery, don't worry!). My younger sister has always been very vulnerable - she gravitates, like my mother, to situations filled with drama, and gets sucks in to them. She is also a rape victim, with a history of self harm. At 24 she has the emotional maturity of a 12 year old. Recently she became involved with a dangerous group of people who drew her in, playing on her vulnerability and causing her to have a breakdown. This happened over a period of months and I tried talking to my mother about it, but she refused to engage, saying she didn't have the energy to deal with little sister's drama. When little sis went home for a visit two weeks ago, mother finally acknowledged that something was wrong and demanded she move back in with my parents, to distance herself from this group. Sounds great, doesn't it? Little sis went for psychiatric evaluation; they wanted to take her as an inpatient, due to the risk of harm to herself. My mother refused and took her home. Within 48 hours she was telling little sis that she couldn't be bothered to deal with her, shouldn't have to have a child at home at her age, and couldn't cope with my father and sister at the same time. She said this all directly to my emotionally vulnerable, and very messed up sister, who has never had a stable relationship with her mother. Talking about this with my older sister made me realise what my mother is: she's not a basically kind woman, who has a difficult time - she's the woman who deliberately leaves her anti-depressants at home when she comes to visit for a couple of weeks, knowing what will happen. We confessed to one another that we still want her attention and affection - the things we never had as children. Both of us feel vile for it, but can't help wanting a real mother. Since I've decided not to call her any more, and she only calls me when she wants a favour, I guess I won't be speaking to her much in the future, but I do feel sad. It's tainted the few good childhood memories I have. Sorry this is so long, but it felt very cathartic to put a little of this mess in to words. "

Of course, telling us that was itself an attack on our peace of mind. ""I've been recording all phone calls made in the house for the past month"" he liked to tell us. But for me, he had a special tactic: Waiting until I had something good in my life, and then shitting on it as much as possible. Am I looking forward to some time away from home? That's the best occasion to make me worry about something else, and to assign hours of manual labour right up until the anticipated event. Major life event coming up for me? Let's make it as stressful and negative as possible. Is there some small source of joy in my life? Destroy it. Ensuring that I had a better life than he did was not his goal. It's not home unless my spirit is crushed. Sometimes he'd break something of mine and then lie about it. His lies were always completely transparent, and what he chose to break was always something I used for recreation. A snipped phone cord (""Must have been friction from the carpet""); a stone chess piece snapped in two; a missing bicycle. I still don't know whether he also intended the sudden disappearance of pets to be a punishment as well, or if that was some other outlet for his inner horror. Of course, the physical abuse was also psychological. Slamming me onto the floor and ramming his fist into my jaw was one way he vented his anger. When you're a child and an adult man rushes you at high speed and tackles you, it tends to stick in your memory. After it happens again, you get a little jumpy. I've made enormous progress over the years, but I'm scared of success. I'm terrified of the visibility (and, therefore, vulnerability) that success brings. As irrational as it sounds, I'm afraid that if I truly become the person I want to be, I will be punished for it, mercilessly. So... Thanks, ""Dad""!"
498,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,The reason I didn't know I was raped until years later [TWs galore],29,32kewk,http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/32kewk/the_reason_i_didnt_know_i_was_raped_until_years/,2015-04-15 00:35:32,"This sub has astounded me with how much it's causing me to remember things from my life that I'd forgotten, and how it's causing me to look back at memories in a different light. This is probably the worst and most upsetting realisation I've had so far. When I was 21, I worked in a job through a temp agency because my parents wouldn't let me live with them unless I worked and I'd just dropped out of uni for the first time due to my mental health problems. My first long term boyfriend of over 3 years broke up with me, one thing led to another and I ended up in a mental health unit for 6 weeks because I had a breakdown and wanted to kill myself. My parents made it a living hell and made it all about them and how I was causing them an unfair amount of stress. I just needed to pull myself together etc etc. I was fucking suicidal. Aaaanyway, back to the point of the story... In this temp job, I met a young man. He knew I had a boyfriend but he was very persistent and flirtatious, and made it very clear he was interested in me. I have never been good at flirting (consciously) so didn't know if I was being flirtatious back. I had a boyfriend and had no intention of cheating on him. I loved him and would never do that to anyone anyway. I was attracted to this new fellow, but not in an active way at all. I was young and attraction to people was common. It didn't mean anything. I found lots of people attractive. So, my boyfriend broke up with me for reasons unrelated to my job (FLEAS, actually - I realise now that he ended it because I treated him like crap due to FLEAS, because that's how I was taught to treat people in close relationships) and I ended up in hospital. Several people from my job came to visit me as I had to inform them where I was because I could no longer come to work. It was a temp job so there was no sick pay, so the job ended as soon as I was admitted. One of the people who visited was this young man. A lot. And he texted me too, a LOT. He wasn't really interested in my health and just continued to flirt. I was vulnerable, *very* vulnerable, and his attention felt both good and bad. Good because I'd just been dumped, so he made me feel attractive. Bad because he made me uneasy that he was so interested in flirting despite me being in a mental health unit. He was taking advantage of my vulnerability. 6 weeks later, I could go home. I was by no means better but I was no longer actively suicidal. I was on heavy medication and a therapist was coming to see me at home often. I had to report to the psychiatrist weekly, or something like that (ten years ago now, memory fails me on some aspects). I was still very, very depressed and now had no job, no boyfriend and had just dropped out of uni. I felt like there was no future and no point. Of course, as you can imagine, my parents were being fucking horrendous throughout all of this. The guilt trips and lectures about getting myself together were unrelenting. It's as if they were actively trying to stop me getting better. This young man was still contacting me. His flirting was getting more sexual and I was reciprocating by now. I equated being attractive to self worth, and I needed some self worth. I also thought why the hell not - after all, I'm single now. He suggested we go away for a weekend together, to help me ""get away"" from everything that had been going on, and so we could be alone. He told me he didn't have a girlfriend (there had been some doubt and scepticism on my part), so I agreed. We went to stay in his friends flat 200 miles away as his friend was away for the weekend and said we could go over. He lived in the middle of fucking nowhere, and I mean it was just above a converted barn amongst miles and miles of countryside. We were very alone. Said young man got me to drive there since I could drive and had the use of a car. Before this weekend he'd managed to convince me to drive him to a job interview in another town, too. I realise now that he was using me. We took some booze and DVDs, and after eating a meal we started drinking. I was on all sorts of new medication that didn't interact well with alcohol, and I drank at least a full bottle of wine if not more. I wanted to escape reality and quash my nerves, as he made me very nervous because I knew what his expectations were. They were unspoken but I wasn't completely naive - he wanted to have sex with me. So I got way too drunk and just thought I'd wake up the next day with a massive hangover. I think we kissed a bit, which I remember not liking, and then I passed out on the bed. The next memory I have is being woken by a tugging feeling. I was still absolutely out of it and in no way lucid. I looked to see what the feeling was, and he was pulling my underwear off. Then he had sex with me while I drifted in and out of consciousness. I hadn't said yes, but I didn't say no either. I was in no state to give consent either way, and I didn't instigate it. I passed out again then woke several times throughout the night to vomit. The day after, I woke with a massive hangover and feeling violated. I told myself ""Well, what *else* did you come here for? You led him on just by agreeing to come away with him, it was expected that you'd have sex with him. It's your fault and he's done nothing wrong. You must have given him signals to go ahead"". The next night, I just let him do it again. I'd already done it once, how could I say no the second night? I wasn't drunk and it made me feel hideous. I was looking forward to being back home and not with him. I felt awkward around him to say the least. I drove him home at the end of the weekend, dropped him off and never saw him again. I think he texted me a few times asking to get together, but I said no. Something felt wrong, even though I held myself responsible. So, how do my parents fit into this? Well, they taught me that if I ever felt bad about anything whatsoever, it will have been caused by something that *I* did. I believed this so strongly that it took me at least 5 years after this event for me to even consider that something very wrong had occurred and maybe, just *maybe*, I didn't ""deserve"" it after all. Even then, I didn't call it rape. Just... I don't know. Just not rape. It wasn't violent and I didn't say no. But it wasn't consensual. I've only ever told two people about this before, one of them being my husband and the other being my mum. My husband, naturally, wants to hunt down and destroy him for doing this to me. He wants justice and hates this guy. He loves me and has normal empathetic reactions to things. I don't even remember my mum's reaction... I think she feigned a concerned look and said ""oh dear"" or words to that effect. She certainly wasn't upset and never mentioned it again. Turns out this guy is my brother in law's friend, and a few years ago I saw him. It immediately instilled intense panic, flashbacks and probably PTSD, and I went out my way to avoid him. As anyone should - he's an absolute scumbag. TL;DR: Got raped after a mental breakdown and blamed myself because my parents taught me not to trust my emotions and that if something bad ever happened to me, it was always my fault somehow. Also my mum didn't care when I told her about it. "

My girlfriend of 1.5 years was raised very much in isolation by abusive parents. It astonishes me how well she has grown into a mature and confident woman, but she bears the scars of improper, narcissistic parenting. Because I am her first long term partner I have been a catalyst for a lot of realisations on her part about the unacceptable ways she has been treated in her life. She would be casually discussing some occurrence which would make me (pampered son that I am) stop in shock, and would be laughing about it. I talking real physical and emotional abuse, perpetrated unintentionally but consistently over her entire childhood. She was constantly told that she was stupid, and bound to be a failure. She was shouted at and demeaned and disbelieved as a matter of course, and any complaints about anything resulted in hour long shouted rants or physical abuse. To this day she doesn't complain when people mistreat her, or at least not to anybody but me, and even then she acts like her suffering is no big deal compared to that of anyone else. She is a very private person, and unwilling to expose vulnerability: I am the first person in whom she has confided. She is very self aware and understanding of her parents who she knows did it not through malice but through dogmatic self-belief bred from isolation and their own neuroses, and is now on fairly good terms with them. However she knows that she will never get an apology for or even an acknowledgement of the damage her parents, especially her father, did to her. She is defensive of her family, and feels a great deal of guilt for having told me what she has, because her strongest desire is to protect them from the harm she thinks they would experience from knowing the damage they did (having heard her out, I agree with her assessment, these people have nothing to fall back on except their children). I have managed to convince her that it is not her responsibility to bear this alone, and she has opened up to me in a big way, albeit slowly and apologetically. We have had a few conversations, in which I have had to constantly reassure her that the entire affair was not her fault, and more than once she has cried, and then apologised for daring to show emotion. She acknowledges that these are issues she has to face, and luckily she is someone with the intelligence, self assurance and analytical skill to do so, but only if she has someone to compare experience with, sympathise and most importantly listen. We have agreed to, at some point in the near future have a proper discussion of her day-to-day childhood, which will be a long and painful process for both of us. If there is anybody out there who thinks they can offer me advice for being the best I can be for her in this sensitive process (beyond the obvious ""listen"", ""reassure her"" ""let her choose the level of conversation"" etc) I would be very grateful. Many thanks "

My mom was raised by a narcissist, who was literally her evil stepmother. My Ngrandmother did the beating, delighting in cruel punishment, neglecting her children, favoritism, the whole bit. My mom, however, was really scarred by that, and so she never did any of the blatant behaviors like physical abuse, or ignoring her kids. I think she really identified with being a good mom. The thing is, her narcissism is all of the deniable stuff. She talks down to me and my dad, she uses her emotions as tools of manipulation, she's always right/you're always wrong, etc. All in all though, she's a step up from her stepmom. Just an example, when I was 14 she found out (not from me) that I had been molested by a man in the community- she wept and screamed all night about how stupid I was talk to this man, what was I thinking, etc. Never once asked me what happened or if I was ok. There are hundreds of other examples, but this really shows her game- it's all about her emotions and how she can guilt you because of how she feels. Btw, for context, I'm the scapegoat and my sister was the golden child. To deal with this, as a kid I was a huge liar, very secretive, and rebellious. Every time I opened up to my mom she betrayed me and abused my vulnerability, so generally I lied as much as possible to keep my real feelings safe from her. I was and still am very susceptible to guilt. I've been so fucked up by her negativity, meanness, etc. and my father is such a nice and compassionate person that I have none of those traits. I'm genuinely supportive and kind to the people around me. But I do have some of the emotionally manipulative traits and that really scares me. In conflicts, I've noticed that I often feel victimized and trapped, much like my mom does. I can cloud my brain to mask my motives, and then it's obvious that I'm lying, I stick to it and try to cover it up, and then when I can't anymore I feel victimized by the other person. I think my mom feels like a victim all the time, and this justifies all of the nasty manipulation that she does. I also have a tendency to focus on my own feelings in a situation- if my husband is really upset over something and I'm trying to help, most of my focus is on how well or poorly I'm helping, instead of actually being there with him. I will get all wrapped up in blaming myself if I feel I didn't handle the situation well which just adds to the drama and keeps me from actually helping. I think the scariest thing for me (and my healthy/normal husband) is the willingness to cover the truth within myself. Like, if I have a simple selfish motive and act on it, I'll feel guilty and pretend that the motive was something else. (My family also has major issues with baseness i.e. they don't talk about/attach distaste to lower order human desires). I can feel when I do it most of the time, but only after the damage is done. I often worry that if I'm feeling victimized or wronged in some way, that I'm just doing that to protect myself like my mom does... but then I have all that guilt stored up that kicks in any time I don't blame myself for problems... what a mess!!! Does anyone else have these emotionally manipulative traits? I'm a practicing buddhist and I have found that meditation helps a great deal, but only on the days/weeks that I do it consistently. If any of you have had success with counseling or any methods at all I'm all ears. Thanks!"

I don't know how to explain what emotional validation looks like or anything because as an ACoN we know that isn't necessarily my strong suit. And usually, my SO is fantastic at emotional support. But sometimes, he is so wrong in his attempts to help, and just can't see why it upsets me (probably because my explanatory skills go out the window when I get super emotional). Thinking about all of it doesn't make it easier for me to formulate those thoughts, because when I'm about to touch a huge emotional nerve I tend to do everything in my power to NOT do whatever thing I find threatening.

How do you that have gone NC quell this feeling of vulnerability? It feels good to be free, but it is very new and kind of scary.** My brother is 7 years older than me (he's 33, I'm 26), and I have, until the past 2 or so years, looked up to him (idolized may be a more proper word here) and found him to be one of my greatest role models and a kindred spirit. That was until I moved to live near him and work for him a few years ago, and I found out he was a huuuuge N. I knew he had some N qualities, but it was hard for me to think of things any other way than ""Oh he's just wiser and cares about me,"" because we were always mostly together one-on-one. He sort of became a father figure to me when some stuff (which was somewhat perpetuated by him) went wrong with our parents. Then, I started working for him and saw him play other people against each other and manipulate them (along with me). He pits everyone against each other and accuses them of ""not being a team player"" and chastises them if they dissent. It creates a sick loyalty, and all the while, they are all incredibly underpaid and overworked. I am one of the few people who has seen every facet of his life (like his marriage, where he's terrible to my sister-in-law; where he turned against our dad and refuses to talk to him) and see how the drama plays out. For me personally, he slut shamed me publicly and spread rumors around about me (some true, some not true) and sided with a person who was sexually harassing me. I quit working for him and moved to get out of what had become a very toxic and unsafe (he is a giant man and flies off the handle) feeling relationship. The last month I worked with him, he ignored me completely. We were able to start talking again months later, but everything he would say would have some condescending undertone and he would spread gossip about me but deny it to my face (he told a bunch of people I had squandered my money, which wasn't true, and that he had invested his into his business [which also isn't true; our parents paid for his business]). Since I've moved away from him, things have been much better, but he'll still call me. I've gone LC, and I wanted to get rid of him on social media. So I deleted him. He found out and confronted me (via text haha) about it. I told him I was tired of him spreading rumors about me, and if he was going to do that, I didn't want him privy to my personal life. Then he said ""I unfollowed you on Instagram a month ago. If you have problems with me, you need to have the balls to confront me. I don't have time for your drama. I see where I stand."" I decided just to not answer back, which I normally would have done. I have nothing left to prove here. I am done with the hypocrisy. I feel free now that I've calmed down, but I also feel very vulnerable (and especially did initially). For a long time, he was seemingly the only family I had and especially the only one who ""got it"". I feel almost like a little kid being scolded/cold-shouldered for doing something naughty and like I am completely screwed. I do not have a very strong support network in my family, and this kind of feels like the end of it. "

(if I had told him the response would have been ""you're being too sensitive"" or ""that's because you have a psychological disorder""), then they became sentimental, ""I remember how happy I was when you were born"", and now they're desperate, ""is there anything I can do for you?"". When I get these mails I feel an intense sadness because he's obviously hurting, but he'll never show the vulnerability to actually apologize for his actions (which he knows, but has never acknowledged) or show that he accepts the fact that I'm an independent human being. I've been down this road before and I know where this leads --more abuse and nastiness. At the same time I feel an intense grief about the father I wanted but never had. When he passes it will cement the fact that I never had, and never will have, the relationship I craved with my father (or better put the parent I wished I had). No reconciliation, no closure. It made me realize that much of my hate for him was fear of being hurt more, the constant invalidations, told I was worthless. Now that he is weak and pathetic and can't try to dictate my self worth, and worse, knows that he can't, I feel one last urge to reconnect in order to resolve things for the last time but I'm pretty sure I'm acting out the usual script as the ""child parent"" who feels responsible for their parent's feelings and does everything they can to make the Nparents happy at the expense of themselves.

Tbh I sensed a little bit of resistance, but maybe I'm being paranoid. She asked me to describe why I think my mother is a narcissist, and I outlined some of her basic traits with specific examples. We'll talk about it more, I'm sure. I told her about Nmom getting a job where I work and bringing on my sister as well. My sister has her fair share of FLEAS, and has come to my cubicle to talk at me a couple times. She can be embarrassing because she talks really loudly and has strong opinions. For example, she's in the military and had no qualms talking to me loudly the other day about her political opinions, which I don't think is very professional. I mentioned this to my therapist, and she replied ""You seem to be very concerned how others perceive you."" That stung a little bit, because I don't particularly think that of myself. Obviously I care about appearing professional and competent at work. But I'm not trying to please any specific person. Which made me worried that *I* was being narcissistic, which I don't think I am, but maybe it's a FLEA? And around and round the thought-cycle goes. I believe therapy will be productive and good for me, but honestly it's unbottling a lot of unpleasant thoughts, and I hate losing control of my emotions. I think that's another remnant from childhood -- showing emotion meant vulnerability, which meant I could be scolded, made fun of, and taken advantage of. I guess I don't really have a question, just thinking out loud and wondering what you guys' thoughts on this might be. Thanks for hearing me out. "

This isn't the worst thing my NMum has ever done, but it's the one that cuts the deepest (apart from the time she moved on after my dad's death, her husband of 40 years, within a month, and when I called her on it she said ""yeah, but I looked after him for 8 years before he died"". He wasn't even sick for anywhere near 8 years, but that's a story for another day.) When I was 16 I got a rare leukaemic blood disorder called aplastic anaemia, which basically meant that all my bone marrow up and died one day. As a result I wasn't producing blood cells for a few years and they couldn't find me a suitable marrow donor, so I had problems fighting off disease, my blood didn't clot, and I slept about 16 hours a day. My NMum used to be a nurse (back in the 80s) and my dad was pretty squeamish, so she used to attend all my hospital appointments with me. Every time we went to the hospital everything had to revolve around mum. If the doctors were talking to me directly about my condition, she would hijack it so I was cut out of the conversation. If the nurses came to chat to me she would burst into tears and tell them how sad it was for her, and they would all rush round her and hug her and give her cups of tea. I've learned from a young age how to take a backseat to my mother's theatrics, so I just sat there in the corner while they consoled her about how hard it was for her to watch her child in pain etc. I had to be the stoic one, who was strong for her (in fact one nurse told me I had to be strong for my mum because it was hard on her). I never got to cry when I was having giant needles stuck in me, or express my feelings of fear and vulnerability, and I was still trying to stay on top of all my schoolwork so that I didn't get left behind. Friends of the family would bring her gifts, flowers, write cards, and she got a lot of attention out of it (and she's pretty materialistic so she loves getting stuff). After a while I started to gradually get better, but I had to do my AS and A level exams (exams at 17 &amp; 18 to get into uni in Britain, unless you're Scottish in which case you probably do highers instead) in a room on my own with an invigilator because there was the chance that I could die just from catching a cold from someone. By this time the sympathy train had mostly run its course for my mum, no one keeps feeling sorry for you and giving you shit years down the line, but because of the illness thing I couldn't use public transport and I wasn't well enough to pass my driving test. This meant that she had to drive me to and from college (sixth form) on her way to and from work (it wasn't walking distance) so I could do my exams. By this point she was really angry with me. Apparently her employers were getting cross about her having to take time off to take me places (the hospital), and she was getting shit about it, which she passed on to me. I wasn't helping out as much as I could, was I working hard enough so I didn't have to repeat my exams the following year, my blood tests were getting better so I must be able to get the bus on my own soon, right? etc. I couldn't go out with my friends anywhere because I couldn't hang out in public so I spent all my time at home, I couldn't get a job for the same reason, so I had no independence. I will be eternally grateful to the two or three school friends who regularly visited me and kept me sane, because my parents wouldn't take me anywhere in the evenings because then they couldn't drink that evening if they had to pick me up later on, and all my friends had weekend jobs after college. She still professes that she couldn't have behaved any differently because she HAS to express her feelings. I have 30 years of feeling suppression under my belt so I guess I'm better prepared to be the parent, as I have been in our relationship for most of my life. I find it so strange that it took me so long to realise that our relationship isn't how mother and child usually interact, but I can't hate her for it because I honestly believe she lacks empathy so much that she doesn't realise how her being self-absorbed negatively affects me."

Honestly, just some fucking empathy and admittance of fault would let me forgive her entirely. But it just never ends. Her arrogance and narcissism is infinite. I can't even ask a simple question without some flippant remark; the constant agitation she expresses seems to be because I can't read her mind. This is fucking bullshit. It just sickens me so much. I spent so much time learning empathy and vulnerability, trying to fix the damage my nMom has inflicted upon me growing up, but she won't even give the simplest of kind gestures. Zero fucking respect. Honestly I've been debating on killing myself from all this lately. You know that feeling when you can't move any of your body parts? Kind of like claustrophobia. I've been feeling that constantly. It's like the air itself is thick with the anxiety and tension I feel from the constant transgressions from my nMom. Life doesn't have to be so bad. It doesn't have to be so bad. I just want to be treated like a human. I don't know why that's too much to ask. But it is. And my nMom will eventually age and die, unchanged. And I will die as well, one day, perhaps by my own hand, never knowing freedom from the pain that one receives from an abusive childhood. Christ, I told her once, when I was young, not even a teen, that I was deeply depressed. She just laughed it off, said I smile all the time. So fucking heartless. I'm going to sell all my possessions and do something. I'm not sure what yet. I feel like it needs to be far away somewhere. Perhaps in a place where no man or woman has walked in a very long time. All I ever wanted was a little kindness. "

My dad says I'm a attention whore for having a councillor. See, i did not want to even let him know i was given one. The school has protocols which in their midst to keep me 'safe' shot me in the leg two yearw ago. I'm a whore. Right. I have no face or identity. Only words and they are not from my mouth. Whore, or bitch is the word of the week. Thag from dog since i stoped engaging in conversation with him or my mum. I'm paying for doing what i thought was the right thing Last month i tried to work out. Get back tk health and my chest failed on me. I used to be healthy? I had a lung infection? How the hell does that happen to me at my age. Even the wind can kill me. Or blow me down into ny bed. I am good enough to do excersice now. I'm slightly fragile and i am back being slightly skinny. You can see the light edges to my bone definition in contrast of light, but still there is a finish of thin muscle stuck after a year and a bit. It screams to be looked after. Which i will in the morning if i don't cough up, I've had a lot but nothing yet to kill me so i got that going. Ive had a cold for off and on forever. It's funny. I'm haven't got any conditions. Anything in fact. It's just dumb pure luck i get a cold. Fever or infection like a lung. Who i meet or sit for a year has fucked things up. The worst luck in the world keeps playing out. My brother comes home soon. Fuck him. I have work to do for exams. A lot. So much. I feel bad for the kids who did no work up until now. I see them failing. But then so do I. A re take or the year is not unusual as AS. But that's if i dont completely to a 180 and fire truck the exams some how. A re take seems like a death sentence. I am not in the mood. And that's selfishness as it's lowest. Then again it would give me time to recover, build myself again and just think about life in the slower lane. Tomorow i wake up. Run. Eat. Study and sleep before dreaming of nothing. Melodramatic yes, but it's just hard now. I feel like i take something away from posting. Like your time. Or judgement. But it hurts to do so. Or rely the fact i will break myself thinking about all of this. I'm not a whore, or needy. But then i am now, right now. In life I've had to be people's sholder and support. At school be silent of my pain or thoughts to help you, and no one asks of me and yet you will cry on my lap asking what to do. I tell you. Act strong and you run off happy. Smile to me and chat to me then again. They all do that. Even my friends. I have no escape and i would not want any. To look weak to the poeple who know my face and sound would be degrading. To cry in life is tragic. A vulnerability which i can't situate myself in currently, and to need a sholder would be selling myself. The one time i was low, cried and finally let a wall down she just saw an in point to use me. Objectified. See i want to let people in, in my real world but how do you do it? How easy is it for you who is reading to open up the door to lingering thoughts and bring them to your level of issue or sadness. Tell about the times you were beat up or hurt mentally. It's weakening. But justified to remain muted. I want to know what happened the first time to folded out to someone. Did you feel like you were a bitch."

So here's my story, as abridged as possible: A few years ago, I went NC with my NMom, with the help of my Father (formerly EFather, but divorced and seemed appropriately apologetic about my shitty childhood). Father was very emotionally supportive and seemed to care a lot about my emotional well-being and my mental health, even setting me up with a therapist and paying my copay. I crossed state lines to move in with him and his new wife, who seemed like an amazing person at the time. She told me that she was going to make sure that we had the cohesive and supportive family I never had growing up, with love and hugs and puppies and rainbows...blah blah blah. So I move to this town in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, where I know no one, and that's when it starts. By about 3 months in, she had me convinced that I was mentally unstable, had some sort of processing/learning disorder, and was an entitled, lazy mooch who was only working at a shitty minimum wage job because I ""hadn't tried hard enough."" Needless to say, we stopped talking, and I started to avoid common areas of the house to avoid seeing her (resulting in a bunch of unhealthy weight loss because I wasn't eating). I had no friends or family that didn't know and support her, and I thought about taking my own life. My father occasionally talked to me alone, and sometimes would promise specific things to help me. But then he would talk to her and promises would be broken. Every. Single. Time. I was finally kicked out of the house unceremoniously because I was, ""causing problems in their marriage."" So I went NC with her but tried to maintain a relationship with EFather. It was always 1 step forward and 2 back. Some days, he would respect my NC with NStepmother, other days, he used various tactics to pressure me about talking with her. I finally went NC when he used the vulnerability of a medical emergency to try to force NStepmother on me. Now, the various emails I've received from him since sound remarkably like NMom and NStepmother (but I haven't heard directly from NStepmom in over a year). He has financially stalked me, denied my ability to make choices for myself, and tried to use my sweet (somewhat senile) grandparents as leverage and middlemen for his message of supposed reconciliation and forgiveness. Never mind the fact that he has never so much as hinted at feeling responsible for my (now officially diagnosed) PTSD. I'm living in a good place now, nowhere near them, with people around that support me. But it keeps gnawing at me that he once knew how to be supportive and was even apologetic about his role in my shitty childhood. It's really hard for me to keep reminding myself how important it is to be NC with him when I know that he isn't wholly a narcissist like NMom or NStepmother. He honestly seems like a sponge for the personality of whoever he is in a relationship with at the time (there was a second wife in the middle and he was vastly different then). My therapist even mentioned when she met him that it seemed like there was another person in the room who couldn't be spoken to. Has anyone else experienced this?"

I've known her family for so long and I was so upset and couldn't stop crying that I had to leave work. Since then my Nmom has texted me asking if I was ok and needed to talk. I told her thank you and that I was fine. My concern is that my mom is going to take advantage of my vulnerability and use this as a way of ""bettering our relationship."" Which of course would mean I will need to come around more or make personal changes. I haven't lived with my parents for 3 years now and have fairly low contact. When I did live with them my mom and I fought literally every day. I honestly don't want her to try and comfort me because it usually feels fake. I know on some level she may care about how I feel but at the same time I know she's going to use my feelings to complete her agenda. I'm sure she'll say something about making the most of relationships and family to make me feel guilty. But as sad as it is that my friends mom died, that doesn't change the things my mom has done to me or make me less angry toward her. I honestly don't want to deal with her because I'm so upset right now. Unfortunately I have a family trip to the coast coming up and so I'll be spending the weekend with her. Tl;dr My friends mom died. I'm afraid my mom will use this time to make me feel guilty for our relationship and not coming around."
511,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Borderline personality and narcissists (long),17,2s0j1j,http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2s0j1j/borderline_personality_and_narcissists_long/,2015-01-11 11:37:11,"I remember there was a post about this from a mod a while back and it has gotten better since then, but it always hurts when I hear people on this sub speak of people with BPD as one in the same as Ns here. I would like to share my perspective on this. We never really talked about feelings much when I was growing up. OK, we never talked about feelings ever. I have since learned that in homes with healthy upbringings, feelings and how to deal with them appropriately are discussed. When a child is having strong emotions about something, the parent validates them and if the child is behaving inappropriately, it is explained that while it's OK to feel this way, it's not OK to behave this way because it hurts other people's feelings. Not mine. I distinctly remember my little brother crying about something, and my father screaming ""you wanna cry? I'll give you something to really cry about!"". My Nmom is a doctor. I remember when I was going through the tumultuous teenage years, not knowing how to deal and not getting any support. In fact, when I tried to talk to my mom about it, she made me feel like some kind of specimen under a microscope. Everything was so... clinical. She wasn't flat out abusive, but she is certainly an ice queen. Enter adulthood. I'm not coping with life as an adult at all, and after years of struggling just to stay fed and housed I'm feeling like I might snap and lose the one thing I have, my ability to stay employed. Has anyone ever seen the show Enlightened on HBO with Laura Dern? Short lived but absolutely brilliant. Just like that. I go see a therapist. I find out that the way I interact with others is not normal and it's likely due to BPD. Note, my therapist is a predoctoral intern and he is not legally allowed to diagnose me but he has made it pretty clear without an official diagnosis what is going on here. He gets his PsyD and licensure as a clinical psychologist this summer so I'll find out for sure then. I trust him completely. Anyway, BPD causes people to think of others in black and white terms - good or bad. This can cycle back and forth, called shifting. It is also characterized by a chronic feeling of emptiness, and intense fear of abandonment and rejection. So intense that when they feel even the threat of rejection, they can't handle it and go off the deep end. Can you imagine what this feels like? It's absolute hell. Yes, people with BPD can be manipulative and abusive but not all are this way. Thankfully I rarely take it out on others, but the flipside is I take it out on myself. When I feel abandoned, I'll go on a binge of self-harm - drinking myself into oblivion, drugs, recklessness, promiscuity, cutting, whatever. I just don't care. It's so hard to go to work every day and maintain a professional appearance when all of this is going on inside me. You know what else often goes along with BPD? Vulnerability to narcissistic abuse. They're so desperate to be loved and accepted, they'll take whatever they can get. N's love this because it's really easy to manipulate them and turn them into their puppet, or emotional punching bag. I've never had a healthy relationship with a man, wouldn't even know what one is like. Being someone's verbal punching bag, emotional dumpster is all I've ever known. It's normal to me. I just assume I'm lucky to get anything at all, even if it's someone else's table scraps. I call it the kicked puppy mentality. And it just gets better! You want to know what is theorized to be the cause of BPD? Childhood abuse, and/or invalidation of emotions. If you never learn how to appropriately deal with feelings as a child, you may very well end up like me, an emotional trainwreck cycling back and forth between extremes. Hungry for love, yet fearing rejection. So, so hungry. A bottomless pit of need. For the acceptance and love we didn't get as children. Isn't that the kicker? Abused by narcissists as a kid, set up for the same as an adult. I'm still a long way to recovery, but learning about all of this has been extremely helpful to me. Please, please, please, before you characterize all people as BPD as bad and unworthy, think about the little kid they once were and how awful it must be to be them. If you have been abused or manipulated by someone BPD, I'm truly sorry. No one deserves to be treated that way. But please understand, you were abused by an abuser. You were manipulated by a manipulator. Not all people like BPD are like this, and a lot of us are good and caring people who would give our loved ones the shirts off our backs. I'm so grateful and lucky to be loved by many and they have no idea what I'm really going through. I just had to let that out. Thanks for listening. Just turned 30 last week, FWIW. Like always, afraid to post because I'm afraid I'll be berated or something. "
512,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,Subtle NDad. Done feeling guilty about his behavior. [trigger warning],5,2svy7c,http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2svy7c/subtle_ndad_done_feeling_guilty_about_his/,2015-01-19 12:28:17,"I've been lurking here for a few days, couple responses, and, like many here, I need to let this out of my system. I've felt really, really guilty about talking to people about my nfather for a long time; I can't point at any bruises or scars, he never hurt me physically, but I'm starting to realize that the things he *did* do were no less damaging. It's hard to know where to start. My two older siblings are what my mother kindly refers to as her ""character builders"", and they both were out of the house but causing hell and chaos about the time I turned nine. I remember that Christmas night, as I tucked my 3-year-old sister into my room to keep her out of the drama that nSis was causing at the front door, kept her busy playing with the toys we'd gotten that day. That's about the time I really started being aware of my emotional vulnerability, the fact that nfather didn't care and Mom flat out didn't have the energy to look out for our emotional wellbeing, she was too busy with older sibs and keeping her marriage together. And the time I started sheltering my sister from... everything. I also remember my first D on a report card. It was a year later. I've managed to suppress most of that memory. See, the bottom line with nfather was that so long as we were performing well and not raising hell, he frankly didn't give a shit, and as much as pretended we didn't exist. When I was a kid, we jokingly called it his phenomenal disappearing act: anything came up that was emotionally-related, he'd be gone so fast we literally didn't know when he'd left or where he'd gone, usually to some unfinished project outside. But so help us gods if we didn't do things exactly as we should be, in his mind. I refuse to play piano (something that brings me great joy, honestly) if anyone is anywhere in earshot because of his pressure to do it, do it right, do it right the first time, and practice religiously... when he remembered that I was taking lessons. This coming from someone musically talented enough to memorize pieces by the fourth or fifth time I played them. I have a deeply-seated fear of failure that stops me dead. No thought, no movement, literally cannot function, I'm so afraid. I'm just as afraid of breaking rules, enough that at 25, I have just become comfortable with the idea of bending a few that I've held strictly, but only in rare cases, and with people I trust. And while we're on fears, men, particularly father figures, scare the shit out of me. It makes for interesting times as a tutor, when kids' parents walk in. This alone could probably have left me pretty messed up, but remembering successes is almost worse than failures. Nothing I did right was ever my doing, it was his good parenting, his guidance; I was never an individual separate from him unless I was screwing up. At 14, I was anorexic, because I knew that my father was royally fucking up family finances and we were a lot poorer than we looked (easiest option a 14-year-old can think of is how fast food adds up, so stop asking for lunch money/eating breakfast/eating at all), and I hit my first suicidal depression. Mom found my suicide note, and for a brief time, made a point of spending time with me and my younger sister, making sure we were okay, but this is also when the marriage REALLY started to spiral out of control. To this day, nfather has not once spoken to me about it. He was physically there when Mom told me she'd found the note, but not once did he ever offer anything on the subject. Even when I almost did it again at 17, between more older sibling drama and my parents' separation. For the first time, I skipped classes, so emotionally fraught that just the impending need to pull out paper and pen to listen to a lecture brought me to sobbing in the middle of English. I didn't understand, at the time, that he was the source of the negativity in the house, and decided to move with him. It lasted about a year and a half before I got so fed up with his passive aggressive bullshit (he killed my cat--twice, same cat, long story, and ruined my only professional clothes after I'd specifically asked him not to do my laundry and even hid it from him, and refused to grocery shop, though he knew of my existing anorexia, but refused to admit I had it). The time apart actually worked wonders of my relationship with my mom, and we're really close now. While she did enable while I was young, she was never a flying monkey. Nfather worked to undermine her all the time, insulting her when she was away, working to mend finances with an independent consultant job, about how stupid her job was, how she was dumb, how she couldn't do anything, how she thought she was so great, but SHE was really the one at the root of all our problems! Gods, how he deluded me. I left the church, emotionally, at 15. Nfather said that didn't matter, I would see right, and I would continue going to church every Sunday. I was 17 when I finally got to stop pretending. Told me, in the middle of a conversation about our awesome gay neighbors, that if I ever brought home a woman, he'd disown me. I came out of the closet three years ago, but he still doesn't know I'm bi. To top it off, he started dating Dolores fucking Umbridge. This woman is *EVIL*. Sent my then-13-year-old sister back to Mom's with three-inch shorts, shirts with inappropriate phrases, all a size or two too small. Bullies her every time she, in sis's words, 'doesn't bring a buffer person'. Every comment is backhanded, constantly downplaying our accomplishments, treats us as inhuman, the kind of woman who plays pity party because noone loves her, if she didn't care about herself, no one would... ugh, she makes me ill. And nfather does his normal non-intervention parenting, unless ""Dolores"" gets upset that sis disagreed with her/had previous plans/whatever. Sis comes back home crying more weekends than she doesn't because of the abuse, and I just don't understand how one person can be that cruel to another. I can't count the number of times nfather forgot to pick me up from school, events, sports, youth group. I can count how many events he went to to support me: Exactly the number of high school shows I participated in, because Mom dragged him. He left me for hours, waiting all over, because he forgot, including the time he then rushed me to the hospital because my ankle looked broken. I told him I wanted to study musical performance (again, musically talented, had worked at it hard by this point). Told me I'd have to get lucky to be successful, and he didn't have any money for me to go to college anyway (YOU MAKE NEARLY SIX FIGURES, WTF?!), but he really couldn't support me unless I got a real degree. I switched to EE, he still refused to help with college in any way. Then casually supported his would-be stepdaughter, transporting a full state away for voice lessons on a regular basis, because she was going to be the next Idol winner, for sure (no. Just no.). Anyway, this is SUPER ranty, and though I tried to put it in order, it's just not... I've gone almost NC with him and his girlfriend, keeping a link just enough to support my sister, as she's still trying to have a relationship with him, but needs buffer bodies that scare Dolores. I'm so exhausted with the guilt, I'm tired of his innocent charade, I'm tired of him refusing to admit he ever did anything wrong, and tired of not being respected as an independent, narrowly successful young adult with a legitimate future. And I'll always be haunted by him telling me, one day, ""There's no greater joy in life than having children."" TL;DR: Passive aggressive, inactive parent, narcissistic father. Damage he did, guilt he inflicted, my refusal to accept any more guilt. He's flat out a bad human."
513,vulnerability,raisedbynarcissists,So I'm pretty sure NMom drank while she was pregnant with me...,20,2u7pt6,http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2u7pt6/so_im_pretty_sure_nmom_drank_while_she_was/,2015-01-31 04:10:29,"So, looking back on events that happened throughout my childhood, I've found a lot of evidence that this may have happened. Here's what I know... Age 7: I had some testing done revealing I had a weird neurological profile. My verbal IQ was much higher than my performance IQ and I had some sensory/ADD issues, which as far as I know, no one else in my family has had. Still, I had a good childhood, with an awesome nanny who filled in for what NMom couldn't do. But then NMom lost her job and became obsessed with taking me and EDad to therapists because she ""couldn't deal with us anymore"". This becomes my life for several years. Age 11: EDad has been unemployed for years, NMom is stressed, and I have basically a mental breakdown. My school notices I'm having issues adjusting to middle school. My doctor tells my parents to ""switch roles"" - so my mom takes this to mean she can stop being a mother. Another doctor says I have Asperger's and gets my school involved. Mind you, this is just TOO MUCH for NMom. By now, our nanny was no longer able to take care of us, so NMom starts drinking even more than before. Age 15: NMom takes a new job alternating between traveling and working from home, so she is always either absent or drunk. She notices my vulnerability and takes advantage of it. At one point, she cries over me drunk and says ""It could have been the drugs they gave me to induce your labor."" We hadn't been talking about that, so I didn't understand what she meant? Age 20: NMom is now unemployed and uses my ""disability"" to get me social security, which ultimately I need to use to support my unemployed parents. I'd been going to college locally but realize now I need to get out, so I transfer to a better school, out of state. You would think NMom would be happy, but she could care less. I realize now it was because she couldn't control me, but the question I keep wondering is - WHY isn't she happy for me? When she controlled me, she felt alive. I think she may have had Munchausen by Proxy. But why is she so SURE that I was ""born"" the way I was? You are not ""born"" with Aspergers, ADD, OCD etc. It's possible she doesn't understand, but she acts so sure of it. And once the disorder was found, she didn't want me to get better. It was like she just wanted an explanation. I still don't understand it!!! Anyone else have (N)parents who drank while you were pregnant? How did you turn out? And if not, what do you think this is about with my mom? EDIT: I forgot an important detail. Two of my cousins have confirmed they saw NMom literally drinking wine while she was breastfeeding me. EDad of course denies this, but admits that it could have happened when he wasn't looking. Since both my parents have lied extensively when it comes to this stuff, I don't know what to believe anymore. I didn't think she'd drink while breastfeeding, would pregnancy be any different?"

I am 23 and I ask my parents permission to go to her house or go out in general. What ticked my girlfriend off before this is that she wanted to go on a short vacation with me to spend sometime alone, to which I responded with hah my parents will go after you.

It really hurt to hear this because I have always tried to be a good daughter and help him despite everything. He has lived in the US almost 30+ years and has refused to learn English so I've had to interpret for him and help his sorry ass. My mom is the breadwinner while he sits around all day on his phone. He frequently verbally abuses my mother over her weight and controls her. If she goes and does her nails, he will yell at her over the cost despite us being well enough off. He does the same if I go grocery shopping for something I need. Meanwhile he bought himself another flagship IPhone because he didn't like the green color. Granted I got his phone but I didn't really need a new phone. Well anyways, I've enabled them for a very long time. I ask them permission to hang out with friends or my girlfriend to avoid conflict. Regardless, conflict comes up. For the first time in March I didn't really care so I left to my gf's and came back the next day. I received passive aggressive silence for this and my dad asking why I stayed in a ""stranger's"" houses'. In early May I did the same because it had become too much. I asked my mom and she didn't really care but my dad started yelling about how I was going to get them sick. I just walked to my car and left. I didn't tell them I was sleeping over so they got agitated when I said ""eh I drank too much and I'm tired, I'll see you tomorrow"". It was a lie, I wanted to sleep with my gf because it had been over two months since we had seen each other. So yes this is how my life goes. I'm embarrassed because I built a facade that I was a tough woman but realistically I'm a tiny weak person who lets their parents walk all over them. My girlfriend is probably the first person who has been honest to me about all of this. It hurt to hear but now I know the truth. But I'm really lost. I have never worked a day in my life because my dad always prohibited me from getting a job. I don't really own anything or have money to my name. I got stuck with a degree that I really don't care about because my parents pressured me into medicine (despite recently telling me that I was the one who wanted to do it). Now I'm pursuing nursing which I like but I'm not crazy about. Part of me wishes I had done computer science to work in cybersecurity. I just feel like its too late but my girlfriend says otherwise. On top of this I've just been having a hard time with my depression and anxiety. This covid stuff has been another way for my father to exert his control so I've been stuck here and haven't seen my best friend since March 18th and have very limited contact with my gf. My suicidal ideation has gotten worse and I just feel like after all this, it's better to just end it. But part of me really doesn't want to die because I have people who love me and my dream one day is to be able to buy my own house and never have to worry about my parents encroaching on me again. I'm sorry it was so long but this stuff has been going on for years. TLDR: My girlfriend made me realize that I have let my parents do whatever they wanted with me for too long. In the process I have enabled them and myself to continue this cycle. It's just been a rude awakening but I needed it."

Heres the backstory: As a Masters of Cybersecurity student I have developed an **IMMENSE** hatred towards social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, etc., basically anything that is identifiable via photos and personal information. This being said, I was recently notified that my parents created Facebook posts from photos that I sent them of my wife and I, just to keep them up to speed on our life events. They essentially screenshot my photos and put them on Facebook after we explicitly asked them not to, on numerous occasions. Yesterday, I confronted my nDad about it as my nMom was coming in the door from work. She heard me ask him, again, to stop posting our photos and events on Facebook. This immediately set off a 2 hour long **BALLISTIC** beratement of my character, my wife and how ""lazy"" she is because she doesn't work, judging me for not purchasing a house, events that happened when my wife and I got married four years ago, etc. Hearing my own mother scream all that to me yesterday, as a 30 yr old man, was *deeply* troubling to hear. I dont know where to go with the relationship from here, so any advice and supportive suggestions is immensely appreciated..."

Thats not metaphorical. Ive just always paced and so much of the world cant hold my attention. My brother had a swim meet and I walked right into the stairs area of the municipal swimming pool. My mother was so angry. She claimed I did it on purpose for attention. Always with that You wanted ATTENTION! bit and always with YES, YOU WANTED ATTENTION! when I say that its not true. The abuse had really made me a klutz. I mean, in high school, nothing couldve woken me up. I was just so depressed. The first times I had stood up to my masculinely aggressive brother with a thing for entrapment and intimidation, I had felt fuzzy in my arms and legs. Well, Im so glad that school is starting next week. Ill spill it. One day, in the future, I plan on moving to Victoria, British Columbia. Compared to Vancouver, its less rain, less city, less hippie. If youve been following my posts, then you know that I have a criminal record. Thankfully, Canada has a criminal rehabilitation application. If your crime is less than 10 years in prison in Canada, you can be granted admission. My mother thinks it wont ever happen. Ive told her. Itll happen. I hope my mother isnt lying when she says shell help me obtain French citizenship. She thinks its a trick and she keeps asking a haughty Why do you need French citizenship? Shes a jerk. I cant say that the French are snooty. Ive met a lot of really nice French people. This woman is full of it, though. Part of my plan is to eventually obtain 10,000 Canadian Dollars to take across the border. Thats the maximum that can be taken undeclared. I plan to take the rest in Bitcoin. I purchased a Librebooted ThinkPad T400 to use as a permanently offline wallet, Revlar paper for paper wallets, and a digital camera to take photographs of QR codes. Of course, given all the discourse thats going into regulating Bitcoin, that may not work itself out. I also have a TransferWise account and the TransferWise international debit MasterCard. My plan is to get my associates degree, go as far as I can at my next school and get a doctorate if I can manage it, hopefully obtain French citizenship, apply for the Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, make it through the TPD Discharges three-year monitoring period, get my crime expunged, and move. In all this time, I might want to get a private pilots certificate at a local community college and go for the Offensive Security Certified Practitioner certification. Its a nearly 24-hour exam where you then have nearly 24 hours to provide documentation. If you pass, its good for life. The nearly 4-hour Offensive Security Wireless Practitioner is also good for life, so I might want to go for that, too. See, I get great grades and Im very focused, but if I get into Computer Engineering, then I can go up to a doctorate. If I get into Cybersecurity, then I can go up to a masters. I might not get in at all! There are a ton of rules for importing a car into Canada and I hope I can work that out when the time comes. I also plan on getting my teeth fixed through Smile Direct Club. I didnt wear my retainer when I was in high school and I was only able to get over the sensory pain of the braces after I had first done things on my own."

When ever I right something, I end up writing a book and deleting it because I don't see why people would read all that ranting etc. So today I have 2 missions : 1)KISSS (Keep It Short and Simple, Silly). (I couldn't respect the first rule... I'm sorry. I'll do better next time. There's a TL;DR at the end though.) &amp;#x200B; 2) Post it no matter what. And don't delete anything you write. I'm a 21M and I think I have a Nmom. It's hard to tell because I've been basically living on my own since I'm 10. She was in the same apartment but unless she screamed at me because I hadn't finished my home work I didn't really have any conversations with her. I guess I barely know her. I wanted to say that because I'm afraid of being a fraud and a dumbass by saying ""I have a Nmom"" when I'm no expert. &amp;#x200B; Anyhow, I've been in University for 2 years now. A quick context: When I entered university, and until this day, I lived in an apartment my mother owns in europe while she lives in japan for work. The first year I didn't know what to do, so my mother said ""you like video games why not computer science"" and I liked the idea of working in video game so I thought why not. I wanted to write things but there wasn't any ""narrative"" degrees I could pursue. She wanted me to go into a school specialised in cybersecurity because ""there's more work in that department"" but I wasn't interested in going and thought it was more expensive. I picked a public University instead. So I tried, and enjoyed my year. However I was already getting sick of my whole family telling me that I'm 19 and still haven't finished my studies and am relying so much on my mother etc... So I decided I was going to pay for my studies. I ended up thinking I still wasn't sure of what I wanted to do, so I went ahead and just payed a small fee to have access to class to see how it was, and then if I'ld like it I would continue. Of course my family wasn't happy about this. I was loosing another year doing nothing, with no achievements what so ever, and still relying on my mother to feed me and have a place to live (which wasn't entirely true since she gave me pocket money to buy my own food but also asked me to pay rent with it so I had to work if I wanted to do anything else than just sit all day in the apartment. Not the worse though). When I explained I was paying for my studies the first thing they would answer is ""with what money? The one your mother gave you?"" which hit hard. My mother was the maddest, telling me at one point that I was wasting her money and mocking her by doing nothing with all she invested for my success. &amp;#x200B; In November of that year, a close friend of mine killed herself and I found the body. I felt like my heart shut down and I didn't talk about it to anyone in 3 months, not even my girlfriend which lived with me. I don't know why but I couldn't. My mother came home and it was a mess (I was depressed and didn't take care of myself or the house, so it was covered in dirty laundry and stuff like that. Nothing was broken though. But it was still very bad.) She came in and started screaming about how I was a horrible person for doing this to her, that she came home from japan for a week and was hoping for a surprise party and instead she gets to clean. She even said to me ""you're trying to get me to kill myself."" which was the thing that really struck me the hardest. Not only for my friend who had died but also because the first time I thought of killing myself was around age 11, which I think is quite early, and that has been a part of my life ever since, and it's usually always linked to her. All in all, it was quite unfair. She also accused me of being depressed (yes, it was weirdly worded but if I was depressed it was basically my fault) or doing drugs or both, and started showing pictures of her place to all of her friends and family. Not a great year. &amp;#x200B; (this is when I wanted to delete everything. I'm trying not to but if you see mistakes in the last paragraph it's probably because I didn't want to check it). &amp;#x200B; Fast forward the end of the first year and I understood that computer science wasn't my thing. at the end of november and all through january and febuary I worked in the cinema industry because I had the opportunity, and I completly fell in love. I knew I wanted to tell stories and I thought writing was going to be the easiest medium for that because it didn't require so much investment but as soon as I worked on a set I knew this was it. &amp;#x200B; I discussed it with my mother and she wasn't having it. I started computer science I was going to continue and not abandon my studies for a hobby with no future. I ended up getting bullied into my second year. It is my fault for not standing up and saying ""no this is what I want to do I can do this"" but it was easier to just say okey and sign up for another year in uni. &amp;#x200B; I ended up never going to course and working the hole year in cinema. When I wasn't, I was either writing, playing, or too depressed to do anything. Honestly, I'm ashamed of it, but it feels like from september 2018 to today, I've so unproductive and worthless... I'm glad I have my girlfriend with me to support me. I wouldn't have gone this far without her. &amp;#x200B; I guess I couldn't respect my first rule. But I'll add a TL;DR. It was also supposed to be about my progress but in the end it was just ranting. Too bad. I'm gonna fast forward till the last 2 weeks so I can talk about the real good stuff. &amp;#x200B; 2 weeks ago, I decided I wasn't going to take it anymore and that I was going to study cinema. I hate cinema schools and the systems they have but there's one in particular that isn't too bad which I signed up in. Then I told my mother about it by mesenger, and she seemed okey with it, which I was really glad about. Then I got a call a week ago, and I talked with her and this is how it went down: ""I'm disappointed in you and how you waste your time. You say you want to do cinema but I don't trust you, you change your mind every year I'm not falling for it this time. I'm giving you 2 options: either a) you come to japan for 3 months to work in my company and learn japanese, then you go back to CITY and find your own work and place, or b) you stay in CITY but you find your own place and you work and when you feel like you know what you want to do you go ahead and pay for your own studies, if you ever study."" &amp;#x200B; Last year she had threatened to kick me out as well, but this time continuing computer science wasn't an option for me. &amp;#x200B; So I talked about it with my GF and we decided to find a place and to work and study at the same time. I'm getting out of this mess. I don't want to go NC yet, because she has a temper and when she has a bad day she's horrible but she showed me that she could be a nice person too and I don't mind having her in my life as long as I don't have any strings attached to her. I don't want people screaming at me that I owe her anything, I didn't ask to be born or to like arts or to have to eat. If I could I would undo it, but now I have people that care about me and I can't just killmyself for you to keep a little extra money every month ! I know that if I told them that they would loose their collective mind other how I could say such a thing, and that it's not *just extra money* but that sure is how it feels. I was scared in the first place, but in the end getting my own place might be the best opportunity I've had in a while. So I'm planning on doing just that. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR After refusing to continue the studies she wanted me to pursue, my mother threatened me (again) to kick me out of her apartment. Turns out I'm ready to go and I'm looking for a place to bounce to."

I got my ITC in Network and System admin and got my ATC and Associates of Applied Science in Cybersecurity. I decided to attend commencement to celebrate this. I did this. I accomplished this by myselfmy parents didnt help with anything. I did this without my NMom who told me I would amount to nothing. I did this without my father who has turned out to be just as manipulative as my egg donor. But I dont want to go, no one is going to be there. All of my sisters decided not to go, one of them bought concert tickets today (graduation is tomorrow). The other ones couldnt make it for other reasons. My dad who I was barely struggling to keep a relationship with decided that he probably wouldnt make it tomorrowI asked him not to come after that. My step-mom (now separated from my dad) is still coming. My husband is going to be dealing with our two year, and since her bed time is when commencement starts, Im sure hes gonna spend most of it dealing with her meltdown in the car. Everyone else in my family, Aunt, Grandma, other Aunt, cousins, etc, arent going to the dinner I was hosting before (everyone that had said yes they were coming messaged me yesterday and today saying they couldnt make it). Something that I was so excited for and excited to share and celebrate has made me feel incredibly isolated. My accomplishments feel like nothing. I feel like nothing. I feel like that dumb kid getting my hopes up and getting let down. Im being stupidly selfish right now, but I just wanted to show everyone that I FUCKING did and I worked damn hard to get here. I worked damn hard to get my internship after I finished my ITC and I worked damn hard to turn that into a full-time job. And I did that while juggling a two year old and a surrogate pregnancy. And I just wanted to celebrate my accomplishments. Instead I get to call the restaurant tomorrow and cancel my reservation because they dont need to prep a table for 20 when there will be three adults and a toddler. Instead I get to walk across the stage and receive my diploma with two important people there to witness it. And Im hurt. And Im disappointed. And Im angry. And I feel small."

I'll try to make it somewhat readable. This is also a throwaway account in an attempt to stay slightly more anonymous. &amp;#x200B; Backstory: Im 17 years old and still live at home. To serve as some backstory my mother was diagnosed with a disease (I can't say on here as it could possibly lead back to me) when I was 12 years old. Since then her physical and mental health has massively gone downhill, because of this situation, I've never truly had a mother. I dealt with a reasonable amount of physical and psychological abuse as a child. As a result of that, I started heavily using an array of opiates, stimulants and pretty much everything under the sun. Regardless, I just hit a little over a year sober. Due to the general trama paired with some other things I can't say here, I've been dealing with some massive trust issues that have had an impact on my day to day life. I can't bring myself to attempt to find a relationship or friendship. Nevertheless, this is something I've been actively trying to improve and started making ""baby steps"" on. &amp;#x200B; Now let's get to the details. In this time of sobriety, I've been forced to keep my mind busy constantly to distract myself the endless urge to relapse. I've used this time to do some freelance web development and social media marketing work. (my end goal is to land a job in cybersecurity, ultimately being on a red team and i spend hours a day learning as much as possible) Web dev is just a hustle and really doesn't pay great but I enjoy it. So I saved up a little over 5 thousand dollars after a few months. My dad's work has ""been slow"" and trying to improve my trust, I ended up letting him borrow 5 thousand to pay rent, cell phone bill, electricity bill, etc. In the last month I've noticed him being on some weird website when he was in the car with me, and swiping through pictures of different women. I had a pretty bad gut feeling about it. After an hour of research, I found a profile with his name on a site matching sugar babies (who are MUCH younger) to sugar daddies. So... How was he getting this sugar babies if ""work has been slow?"" well, after gaining access to his email, bank, and google voice (which he uses for text messages) I had the pleasure of knowing he has spent that money on these women. This left me in a difficult spot. as I can't say anything to my mom, because she is mentally unstable and will probably try to hurt herself, and because of past abuse im terrified of my dad. After a few months of contemplation, and constant questioning of when he will pay me my money back. I finally got the courage to confront him. His reaction? &amp;#x200B; ""You tell your mother and ill kill you. What spent is spent. You aren't getting shit back."" &amp;#x200B; Every day of my life is a painful hell. He pretends like nothing ever happened, and im living with this burden and has started to bring back flashbacks of past trauma. This has killed any progress I have made with trust. I have lost all motivation for life knowing what he did to my mother. I plan to keep every cent I have in cryptocurrency from here on out to avoid this again. &amp;#x200B; Conclusion: I typed all of this out in a hurry, I apologize for any grammar mistakes. I would also to make it VERY CLEAR that I am looking for no sympathy. I don't have any friends or anyone to talk to in real life, so this seems like a good way to get it off my chest. &amp;#x200B; Thanks, \~ Dexter"

Im finishing up a cybersecurity degree while working as a network engineer. Im really tired. My two year has regressed into whining and fussing when she wants or needs something, even though she has a very full vocabulary for her age and has always been quick to tell us what she needs (we taught her basic ASL as a baby so even if she doesnt have a word, she has a sign). Its been so frustrating to deal with because its this guessing game of what she could possibly need when she could literally say one word and have her problem solved. An hour after she woke up this morning, I was already frustrated to the point of tears. She wanted breakfast, but didnt want cereal, and then she did, and then she wanted a bowl of dry cereal and a cup of milk. Then she wanted to cup of milk poured in the dry cereal. And of course she didnt want to tell me this, she cried and screamed until I figured it out. I had to walk away, I felt my temper flaring up, Im sleep deprived, Im fat and uncomfortable, my emotions are out of wack, Ive been having false contractions consistently for three days and they hurt like the beginning of the real thing. But I walked away and cried in another room and came back to my daughter. I calmly got to her level and said Baby girl, if you want something or need something you need to tell me. And guess what, she cried and fussed every time she wanted something for the rest of the day because she is two. But I won, I didnt give into the urge to scream and yell at her. I didnt put my hands on her (not that I ever would). I didnt blame her for making my life hard. I didnt take my emotions out on her. Because she doesnt deserve it. I won. While I would have liked nothing more than to scream and rage and let me emotions get the better of me, I didnt because I am a better mother than what I got stuck with. "

I have a Chromebook and live in a different state, and BIL's account credentials still show up when I open Reddit, etc. We asked BIL how to remove his login credentials, but he never fixed it. So, we've resorted to deleting it and typing in our own logins whenever it comes up. Basically ignoring it's there. Today, I clicked on the ""Manage passwords"" link because I got tired of the process. I discovered that Google has been saving passwords for me, Nmom, Edad, and BIL. It's obviously a major security risk, and I don't know how to fix it. I think my Nparents are too technologically illiterate to have discovered it, but I'm afraid they will eventually. I'm not much better at technology, but I did have to teach my Nparents how to attach a file to an email. I thought about just deleting mine and BIL's. I don't know how I should handle telling BIL because I'm afraid he or my sis will tell our Nparents. I doubt the Nparents have ever logged in as BIL, because he would get an alert that someone from a different IP address accessed his account. I think it's the right thing to tell him, though. He might prefer to delete his own saved passwords. **TL/DR**: We all have Gmail, and have logged into Edad's computer at some point. I discovered Google has been saving passwords for me, Nparents, and BIL. I don't think Nparents have ever logged in as me or BIL, but I still want to discreetly delete our logins/delete mine and tell BIL so he can delete his own, before telling Nparents. Nmom has asked me for my email password within the last year, so I'm wary. She's read mine and my sister's journals. I'm afraid she might abuse this list of passwords.

It was that year when I started the legal process that would one year later partially free me from that same ""brother"" who was also the one I had to run away from, and this process would also be the one to, one year later, free me from my n-mom. **Four years ago** Three years before last I won partial legal emancipation from my n-mom in a court of law and was starting to make a life for myself, enforcing better boundaries. That's the same year when I came out as bisexual and unfortunately had an incident with my n-mom and stepfather regarding that. **Three years ago** Two years before last I was still living at n-mom's house and being bullied by two of my teachers, constantly on the verge of suicide. That was the same year when I had to physically run away from my abusive older ""brother"" (the same mentioned earlier) for my own safety. That was the year as well when I had to come out as lesbian to my father and stepmother. **Two years ago** The year before last I spent almost a month in an inpatient psychiatric unit in addition to another two weeks in the same place a few months later, as well as several trips to the psychiatric emergency room. That year I was self-harming regularly, making repeated attempts on my life, and otherwise hurting myself. That was the same year that I tried to cut out my best friendmy sister by choiceand all my friends out of my life, not because they were unhealthy to have in my life but because I was convinced I was a bad person and a bad friend who didn't deserve their love. My friends and most importantly my best friend (my sister by choice) stuck with me and remained as my friends. The year before last was the year where I was missing copious schooldays for my psychiatric treatments. I was out of control: I got two Saturday detentionsalmost an in-school suspensionfor a verbal altercation between a friend and I, as well as for skipping class. I was frequently getting in verbal spats with my teachers and having rampant outbursts, refusing to do my work, and getting in fights at my dad's house. **One year ago** Last year around this time I was in the throes of interpersonal conflict, trying to get my n-mom to sign the papers for my legal name change while simultaneously dodging her devices of manipulation. I pushed through it, I refrained from my impulsive urges (i.e. lashing out, saying things that although true would be counterproductive to my goals, exacerbating the situation further, etc.) and I got my papers signed. My legal name change is complete and I have reached the age of legal emancipation. There is one more thing I will need from my n-mom, and those are some bonds held in my nameI'm waiting awhile to pursue those and thankfully there are the courts if she is uncooperative. Although she can use my little brother as a pawn to try to get leverage over me, she hasn't been successful and has stopped doing it. I wasfreed of her meddling. Last year around this time I was scared, uneasy, anxious regarding university: I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to major in or what I wanted to do for work. I found my calling, Cybersecurity, and now I know my plan. I know what I'm going to do and I'm not so scared anymore. &amp;#x200B; ***I was in a very tough spot for very many years*** ***but*** ***things are different now...*** &amp;#x200B; **TODAY** Over the Summer, after graduation, I'm going to take calculus at the local community college, in addition to going to a Cybersecurity camp for a second year at a nearby university. For the next two years I'm going to be taking my prerequisites and our community college before moving onto the aforementioned university where I'll be taking the bulk of my classes and aiming for an accelerated MS/BS program. Maybe I'll shoot for my PhD. after that, I'm not sure yet. In a few months I'm going to use my savings to buy myself a work and research laptop and I'll use that one for class and to keep learning CSEC/CS (Cybersecurity and Computer Science, respectively). I'm going to try to get some work in this field during the next few years. I may try to get into a government scholarship-for-service program (if I can meet SF-86 clearance). I'm going to keep saving my money, put some of it into CDs at the credit union, and be thrifty. I'm going to do my best to stay on track as far as personal development goes. I make mostly good marks at highschool and I'm ready for the next step. I do have PTSD. I do have MDD. I do have unresolved trauma and unhealthy thought patterns. I do have a history of abuse. But I have my little brother here, I have my sister to support me, and I have an army of friends in my corner.

(And lock it down with 2FA as well...more below on that.) 2) **Enable token-based 2 factor authentication (2FA)** whether you were using no second factor or you used SMS-based authentication. First, set up your 2FA app that you're going to use. [Authy](URL is a helpful app because it backs up your tokens to the cloud in case you lose your phone. [Lastpass Authenticator](URL also has cloud backup. Don't lose your password to your authenticator! Without a working token, you will be locked out of your account. *(Click your username, User Settings, Privacy &amp; Security Settings, Two-Factor Authentication, activate. This will take you to the older version of Reddit; it's okay.)* Tokens are more secure. [Any account is more secure with 2FA than it is with no second factor at all](URL (it requires you - or anyone else - to have both something they know *password* and something they have *token* to get into the account). 3) **CREATE AND DON'T LOSE YOUR BACK UP TOKENS!!!** **Can't stress this enough. Save them somewhere safe.** A flash drive with password protection, Google Drive if nothing else (probably not paper if your narc tends to sift through your stuff constantly). But don't lose these! If for some reason your authentication app doesn't work, you will NEED these tokens to get into your account. 4) **DISABLE Search engine indexing** - it allows search engines to index your user profile *(Click your username, User Settings, Privacy &amp; Security Settings...)* Disabling this helps prevent Google, Yahoo, Bing etc from being able to find and present your user profile when someone searches for you. Definitely helpful to stay under the radar if your N is geeky and sneaky and likes to Google for your whereabouts and whatabouts. 5) **DISABLE Log outbound clicks** - Allow reddit to log my outbound clicks for personalization *(Click your username, User Settings, Privacy &amp; Security Settings...)* I think this is for ad personalization...but the more Reddit logs, the more hackers can steal. No need for Reddit to have this info on file. As an ACON who is posting personal stuff online, I just felt like this might help you guys be informed and make the best decisions that apply to your case. Stay safe out there, folks. :) And by the way, the above suggestions are honestly just healthy basic cybersecurity practices. Bank accounts, Facebook, almost all major online services you use these days are able to use 2FA. It can save your bacon, especially when you've got a narc on your tail. "
524,cybersecurity,raisedbynarcissists,Tips for staying safe when using a computer,231,5apk0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5apk0g/tips_for_staying_safe_when_using_a_computer/,2016-11-02 23:23:14,"Hi all, I've been reading a number of posts on this thread, and it seems like N's like to go through computers, browsing history and stuff. I wasn't raised by narcissists, but I work with computers, and sometimes deal with people who have had their computers compromised, so I thought I'd write out some general tips that may help stop your N's from pawing through your computer. These tips may not apply to everyone. Like everything, you'll know what could work and what may not. Sorry if some of these sound condescending, but not everyone knows everything, so a gentle reminder never hurts. Also I don't want to make anyone paranoid. These are provided as either a ""eh you never know"", or a ""N is a CIA mastermind capable of cracking anything"". You can never be too cautious. Be careful out there! ## Keyloggers and other loggers First things first - If your N seems to know stuff you're doing on the computer, even when they're not around, they might have installed a keylogger or some other kind of logger on your computer. These products come in two flavors - Software and Hardware. Software-based loggers are installed on your computer. They're somewhat easy to detect by an anti-virus unless **someone has gone in and told the AV to let the app through**. These loggers can read what you type on the keyboard, what you click on, can take screenshots (maybe even taking a screenshot when a word is typed, like ""mom"", or you visit a specific website), can turn on your webcam, can browse files on your computer and can even run when you're not logged in. The possibilities are almost endless. Hardware-based loggers are easy to find but are expensive depending on what sort you get (approx $50-150+ USD, but an nmom's love knows no bounds, right?). They plug in to your computer, and stuff plugs in to them. A keylogger would plug in to a USB port and then your keyboard into the logger. The logs can then be sent via Wi-Fi to another computer (or cellphone) either **in real-time**, or after the fact, or in the case of the cheaper ones, will ""type out"" the logs when you type the special password. There's also screen ""ghosters"" that plug in to your computer's video out port and you plug your video cable in to that. When connected, it takes screenshots at regular intervals of what's on the screen. You can then plug it in to a computer via a little USB port (using a cable you'd normally use to charge your cellphone) and show up like a USB device, full of static images of your screen. The good news is that both are relatively easy to remove. If you don't want to remove them, then you can change the password on them. If you find a hardware-based logger, look up the manufacturer and find the instruction book. That'll tell you what the default password is, how to clear the logs and so forth. Handy stuff! If you can't / won't find or remove the keylogger but suspect one is installed, try obscuring the passwords you type. For example if your password is `password` (please don't make your password `password`, I beg you!), type it like this: &gt; poison[backspace][backspace][backspace][backspace][backspace]ask[backspace]sjdhf[backspace][backspace][backspace][backspace]w ... So that when someone looks at the logs, they'll see the above and may be too frustrated / lazy to sit down and work it out. Takes extra time to type, but hey, if it stops them from getting access, that's only a good thing! I put this section first, because the other stuff is moot if someone can see what you're doing! EDIT: I just found out about another tracker. This one is a car tracker! Thanks to /u/dashestodashes for bringing this to our attention. Check out the post [here](URL If you find one on your car, head to Verizon and ask to have it removed, or at least tell you who put it on. If you're feeling mischievous you could find another way to power it, then sit it somewhere, plugged in to power so it'll look like you haven't moved all day! ## Passwords A long, strong, unique password goes a long way in the world of cybersecurity. There's programs out there that can try millions of computer passwords a second, so make your passwords safe. You can check yours at URL (make sure you've checked for keyloggers first!). Also, don't re-use passwords, or use easily guessable passwords. If N gets your computer password and your Facebook / Emails are the same, they've got access to those too, especially if your password is something like your dog's name. On the subject of passwords, you can very easily remove a password on a Windows computer with a USB stick (I've done it many, MANY times after people legitimately forgot their password) and you can do the same on a Mac without a USB stick. On top of that, you can browse (and copy) all the files on a computer without knowing the password. There are ways around that, which I'll cover later. If you have a phone, put a PIN, pattern or fingerprint unlock on it. Facial recognition is not recommended, because someone can use a video or photo of you to unlock your phone. If you can, turn on Two-Factor Authentication (called Login Approval or 2-Step Verification) for your online accounts. These require a cellphone, so only turn it on if you know you'll always have your phone with you because without it, you may be up the creek, sans paddle. Two-Factor Authentication (TFA) means that when you log in you need both your password AND a unique code that is sent to your cell via an app (Facebook) or text message (the two forms of proof are why it's called Two Factor). So unless someone has your password AND phone, [they can't get in](URL The unique code changes every few minutes, so they can't use the same code to log on later. If you can't turn on TFA, turn on login logging. Whenever someone logs in to your account, it shows up on the list. You can even be notified when a new login happens so if someone does log in to your account, you'll get an alert. And don't store your passwords when your browser asks, especially for sensitive sites. Incognito mode is good for this sort of stuff. That also has the added benefit of logging you out when you close the window Also, never write down your password. If you do, store it somewhere that only you have access to. Locks can be picked, mattresses can be lifted up. Also, don't write the password down directly. Mix it in with some other stuff, so if your password is ""I love bacon"", maybe write it down as part of a recipe (""I love bacon, here's how to make bacon pancakes"") ## Protecting your files on your computer As I mentioned before, with or without a USB stick, you can access the files on a computer. That includes browsing history (which is stored in a file in your computer), browser passwords (which are encrypted with your password, unless your password isn't strong enough) and lots more. Here, you have a few options: 1. If you have a Mac, turn on [home directory encryption](URL 2. If you're on Windows and the computer is solely yours, you could [turn on BitLocker](URL If it's a shared computer, don't do this, as it prevents others from using the machine unless they have the password. If BitLocker isn't an option, try a [BIOS, HDD or system password](URL but those passwords are easy to remove if you open up the computer and remove the clock battery or short out two tiny pins near the battery. 3. Store your sensitive files on Google Drive, Dropbox or something similar. Don't download the Google Drive / Dropbox apps though, because they just make a folder on your computer and that can be read like any other folder 4. Store your files on a USB stick that you can keep with you. They're so tiny with lots of storage these days, so it's easy enough to slip one in your shoe, pocket or wherever. If you can't get access to one, ask around. My friend got one from the lost &amp; found at her son's school after his was stolen from his pencil case. It'd been sitting, unclaimed, in a box for a year or more, so they let her have it once they deleted all the files from it. Be careful with anything that encrypts your files, because if you forget the password, you're screwed! ## Timefreeze This one deserves its own section, because it's amazing, and can effectively help keep your computer safe. [Timefreeze](URL is really cool (no pun intended). You install it on your computer, set your computer up how you want it, then turn Timefreeze on. **Then when you turn your computer off, your computer is reverted back to how it was when you first turned Timefreeze on**. This means if you install software, browse the internet, download files and stuff, they're all undone when you turn your computer off. You can set ""unlocked"" folders so things you save in there, stay in there. This is a really good way of foiling your N's attempts to install parental control software, or check your browsing history, or just protecting yourself, as you can ""automatically log off"" accounts like Google, Reddit etc. when you shut down the computer. ## Other things you can do 1. Use Incognito Mode on Chrome (or Private Browsing on Firefox / Internet Explorer / Edge) when browsing sensitive sites. Logging software / hardware can still catch this, even if you use secure sites, so be wary. 2. If you're using Windows 10, you can turn on Virtual Desktops. This creates a second (or third or fourth or..) ""desktop"" that you can quickly switch to with a discrete shortcut key. Each desktop has its own taskbar, so if you open Reddit on one desktop and switch to the other desktop, Reddit is hidden until you switch back. You can have one for ""homework"" and one for the real stuff you're doing online. To create a new virtual desktop, Press `Windows + Ctrl + D`. To switch between the two, press `Windows + Ctrl + Left` or `Windows + Ctrl + Right`. Regularly practice switching between the two, and see if you can stop any reactions (like a panic jump or shifting in your seat). I spent a large part of junior and senior high doing non-school related stuff in the lab, so I had the sneaky switch perfected. Teachers were suspicious, but couldn't catch me off guard! 3. Mac also has [virtual desktops](URL through Mission Control, though I've never used them before so I don't know how effective they are 4. Strike before your N's do. Put a password on your modem / router's configuration page if there isn't one already. Stops them poking their head in and seeing what is connected to the wireless, or setting up stupid rules that stop you from visiting sites. It could also let you set up a hidden wireless so if they somehow stop you from accessing the first, you could connect to the second. 5. If you're using Facebook Messenger to talk to ""devil spawn"" such as friends, boyfriend / girlfriends or people who don't worship your N, look into turning on Secret Conversations which offers one-tap delete of messages and encryption. I've never used it, so I can't vouch for its security, but it could help keep N's out. 6. A lot of N's like to take away social security cards, birth certificates and such. Store them digitally if you can get to them. If you get kicked out of home, at least you've got something as proof of your identity. 7. I haven't looked into it, but I'm certain there's audio / webcam recording software that can be started with a discrete shortcut key. Perfect if you need proof of an N treating you badly. That same software might even do motion detection or can snap a photo of whoever logged in. EDIT: I asked a programming buddy of mine if he could make something, and [he did](URL It's [opensource](URL so if you know Visual Basic, you can change the code! 8. Look out for logs being kept elsewhere! Just because your computer has no logging software on it, doesn't mean your N's aren't watching your activity via logs on the modem / router! When dealing with an N, assume you're always being watched! 9. **This one might be pretty big news for some of you**: If you've got an Android phone, you can install software that fakes your location. A college buddy of mine was trying it when looking for Pokemon Go cheats, and I thought it was cool. You install it (I tried out [this one](URL and it seems to work quite well) and then tell Android you want to use that app to provide a location. This is all used for testing apps to make sure they work all over the world, but could be useful for you guys. There's a step-by-step here: URL . Note that it may not be perfect, so be careful! ## Suggestions from other redditors: (note: I've simplified or paraphrased here. Look through the comments for their post for more info * Get a laptop lock. Also called a Kensington lock. Also encrypt or password protect your USB sticks and store them elsewhere. School is good if your locker is safe, as is a trusted friends' place. Even a double-sandwich-bagged stick buried in the yard could work in a pinch. [Quote from /u/just_play_one_on_tv](URL &gt; Laptop lock: URL &gt; Removing a hard drive: URL &gt; Password protect a flash drive: URL &gt; Scan for keyloggers (download free version): URL * `Windows + L` instantly locks the computer, while `Windows + D` minimizes everything. On a Mac, I believe you press F11. Honestly, I never leave my computer, even at home (where it's just my SO and I), without locking it. Note that `Windows + D` just minimizes. A virtual desktop actually hides the fact that you've got the app open, so for some of you, that might be better. * Also look into [making a USB with Linux on it](URL (Ubuntu is a great choice). Linux is a free, open source alternative to Windows and after you learn the basics, is easy enough to use. Big thanks to [/u/armahillo](URL for the Linux suggestion and [/u/Aperture_Kubi](URL for the Linux and `Windows + L` suggestions! * Make extra copies of files! As [/u/JuarX](URL pointed out, if your USB stick breaks (or if it gets taken off you), it's gone, so make extra copies when you can, and give them to trusted people. * /u/JuarX also suggested [using KeePass](URL to store your passwords. KeePass also generates passwords and can be run from a USB stick, so you don't have to worry about password re-use. But like most things, if you loose the database file, you're out of luck. So weigh up the options! * /u/OldPolishProverb has a [great suggestion](URL If you can't install software on your computer, check out [PortableApps.com](URL These programs are designed to run from a USB stick, and the majority of them don't leave any obvious trace on the computer. I use them all the time at work because I don't want to install too much junk on my computer, so this works great. Thanks! * [/u/throwaway23er56uz](URL gave a good suggestion, and this applies to any computer, N-fected or not: **Don't share your account!**. Give the N's their own account with limited access if possible. If they're not that computer savvy, they won't know the difference and you can just shrug and say ""I couldn't do &lt;thing they're trying to do&gt; either. Must be the computer"". * throwaway23er56uz also suggested putting something over your webcam. I do this anyway (can't trust anything these days!) so it's worth doing regardless. Most (if not all) webcams should have a light on them to let you know when the camera is on, but the reality is, you can [disable that light](URL (geek talk alert. tl;dr is: They modified a program on a computer to disable the webcam light). [/u/Patch_Ferntree made a great suggestion](URL of using a bandaid to cover the lens. Perfect! * [/u/netzvieh_ suggested](URL VeraCrypt if you can't use BitLocker. I haven't tried it, so I can't vouch for it. But it looks good. It basically makes an encrypted file that shows up as a new drive on your computer. Put your files in there, tell VeraCrypt to close the file / drive, and your files are secure. Thanks! * /u/Mr-Mick has some great info about secure email and zombie machine prevention in [this comment](URL * And /u/AtomicMayonez offers [this comment](URL which gives some good advice: Virtual desktops and the like won't stop an N from finding data. It can prevent some arguments for a bit, and may be ""good enough"" if your N doesn't know how to use a computer, but yes, at the end of the day, encryption and a strong password is best. * /u/jjl2357 offers a [great suggestion](URL Get a library card and do your naughty internetting (such as looking for apartments or speaking to friends) at your local library card. You could possibly explain it as doing assignments or just wanting to read books so you can do well enough to enter [whatever field your N thinks you should do, but you're not going to because you're your own person] ## Final Thoughts / Edits: Thank you for the gold! For anyone that has messaged or asked questions / given suggestions, I'll get try and get to everyone, and I'll try my best to update the original post with great ideas from the comments. As I said at the start, a lot of these are ""aww shit the CIA is after me"" levels of security, but I spent a lot of time in school doing everything but work and even got in trouble for breaking in to the school's server rooms to see what they looked like (hint: a gift card or a pair of scissors works great for getting through doors!) so I figured I'd use my computer security skills for good :) If you've got any questions, comment or PM me. I'll get to them as soon as possible. Good luck!"
525,cybersecurity,raisedbynarcissists,I was forced to obey my Nmom under threat of imprisonment for a year,184,4yvzcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4yvzcw/i_was_forced_to_obey_my_nmom_under_threat_of/,2016-08-22 03:30:14,"I did an AMA about the situation that led to me getting kicked out of my Nmom's house, it's quite a unique one, I'll link it here for some context: URL Someone told me to crosspost here and share my story. This might be a bit of a rant. Alright, let's get into it. So the TL;DR of that AMA: I pulled a harmless prank on my school which technically may have accidentally counted as two separate computer crimes punishable by a year in prison each. I took the plea deal and was forced to live without electronics for a year under threat of prison. TL;DR of the TL;DR: forced to be Amish against my will. Another provision in my parole is that I had to obey every command spoken from the holy mouth of my Nmom. Yes, if my mother wanted to, she could send me to prison for a year for not washing the dishes correctly. All brought to you by the great United States of America Justice System, patent pending. Some backstory. My parents were and are radical Christians. Radical Christian Conservatives to be exact. Don't mean to stereotype Christianity here, but there is a darker side to it and many people use it to abuse and indoctrinate their children. It's basically gaslighting on a global scale. So just know, every time I make a mean comment about Christians in this thread, I am not talking about the nice ones. I'm talking about the rotten eggs. I'll split this into Acts because this is gonna be long. Basically full life story here. Sorry if it's too much, but I need to vent. I haven't told this story in it's entirety to anyone. #ACT I: THE INDOCTRINATION OF AN INNOCENT SOUL The early years. Before hitting puberty or going to high school, back when I thought Bakugan was actually cool and wore Sketchers. I was born an overly large baby to a mother of 17 years and a father of 18. Technically not illegal as they were both underage at the time of my conception, which puts my mother knocked up at 16. How's that for premarital sex, mom? I have no memories of before I was around 6. It's actually kind of weird I can't remember anything. Probably the traumatic experience of my parents divorcing when I was around that age. Anyway, parents divorced, Nmom had sole custody. I grew up in Sunday School with a hatred for my runaway father and a burning love for Jesus. I was homeschooled for preschool which I remember none of, and went to a local Christian academy for elementary, to learn shapes, numbers, and the bible. Eventually the Christian Academy raised tuition higher than my mother of three without a full time job could afford. In comes public school, which is a very bad thing, because Jesus isn't taught in public schools. Don't want me to get corrupted and knock up a crack whore! #ACT II: TENSIONS RISE, LARGELY DUE TO BLACK MEN BUT ALSO PATERNAL FIGURES Black men meaning Obama. Oh, my mother hated ""that n-word"" (did I mention she was a racist too? comes naturally with ""radical conservative"". Also automod caught it the first time around so I censored it). Obama caused her political views to stray further right than I thought they could go. Though at the time I agreed with her, because everyone knows mommy knows best. Two years or so of middle school pass, in that time two major things happen: My dad wants to get back into my life. And my mother goes apeshit. She was not having it. She told him to basically fuck off as she had full custody. After a long court battle, eventually it comes to light that she doesn't actually have full custody, my dad has visitation rights. Eventually they work out a deal saying I have to see a counselor first, and we'll work from their. Let me tell you, the mental health system is fucked. I went through about four different family counselors before we found one that was even ok. One of them petitioned my mother to put me on ADD medication (I don't have ADD), the other on antidepressants (I didn't have depression, at least not at the time). After about a year, maybe 7th grade or so, I finally see my dad. He brings in an iPad and we play chess and some other games on it together. Nice time, nice time. Keep in mind my dad is well off and my mother lives off child support from my father and part time jobs. She got her EMT certs around this time so we're not doing as bad, but we were still pretty poor. So, daddy brings in nice flashy toys, my mother goes apeshit. Apparently he's trying to ""buy my love"" and that he hasn't done anything for me and that she's the one who has raised me which I guess is technically true but she damn well hasn't been doing a good job at this point. Basically blaming me for being ok with seeing my father. Hint Hint: daddy isn't the bad guy in this fairytale. #ACT III: AN AWAKENING OF THE MIND AND THE BODY This act comprises most of the story and is going to be pretty long. Body means sex if you didn't get that. Time for hormonal me to go through a sling of girlfriends! And don't think I'm just bragging about my sex life because I still never have sex with any of them. Because that's a very bad thing to do if you had my mother. Around this time I started high school and started to realize that I had different worldviews than my mom. I mostly kept these secret as I was still figuring out what I believed and didn't want to get sent to some Jesus camp. First girlfriend came around freshman year. She was really shy and didn't really talk to anyone except me. One day I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend. Yes, those exact words. I was inexperienced. But she said yes! 1-0 for Pussy Slayer Me. I came home and told my mom I had a girlfriend. Her reaction? ""You're not old enough to start dating"" See, this poses a paradox, seeing as I'm already in a relationship, but I'm not old enough to be in one, time space breaks and everything goes to shit. I argue with my mother because good pussy is worth the potential of being sent to Jesus camp (I wanted that as my senior quote but apparently I can't have it). My mother argues back. We reach a compromise: I can date her, but only under her direct supervision. Hurray, almost. I'm raging with hormones and want to fuck, and I'm not about to fuck in front of my mother. She is an ugly woman and I've seen enough pornos at this point to know where that leads. So yeah, she comes over, we have a nice 'date' just chilling on the patio outside while my mother cooks food. She makes hamburgers, I find out my girlfriend is vegetarian. That was pretty funny. After she left she scolded me for my disrespectful girlfriend not eating her food. Also, she only calls her ""my friend"" and refuses to acknowledge the 'girl-' part. Girlfriend number one dumps me. But that's ok, because next year comes girlfriend number two! Girlfriend number two is much more outspoken than girl#1. Band kids tend to be. Same shit happens, I invite her over to watch a movie. We get on the couch and I put my arm around her. My mom calls me into the kitchen and tells me not to do that because apparently that leads to kissing which leads to sex which leads to getting knocked up at 16 and dying of AIDS before you meet your child. I go back in and put my arm back over her, lean down into the couch and cuddle a bit. Mom scolds me again. It's snowing outside and Girl#2 brought her winter coat and gloves, my mom tells me to go outside and get off the couch. We do. We walk around in the snow for a bit while my mom cooks in the kitchen which has a direct line of site to the backyard. Eventually girl#2 and I start furiously making out in front of my mother. Mother gets hardcore triggered by this, comes storming outside and shouts at us to stop. We come inside and eat dinner in silence. Date is mostly ruined, but girl#2 understands. She leaves, we spend the next month and a half sneaking a few kisses, hanging out before class, she came over a few more times. Eventually it dies down and she dumps me (though it was mostly mutual). Time for the final one, girl#3. Girl number three is perfect. We've been friends for over a year before dating. She had just gone through a break up with her old boyfriend who didn't give a shit about her, and I helped her through it the whole time. This is my first emotional connection to anyone ever outside of my family. Other two girls were just about the prospect of sex, this girl was an actual connection. In the next two months I'd come to realize that I really loved this girl. In the meantime while we were emotionally connecting, we were physically connecting as well. She lived right down the road, and my mother was getting a little more lenient and trying to let me out more. Good for you, mom. Most of the time between walking from house to house we spent making out. 16 year old me was loving the action. One day we were in her basement ""playing xbox"" when her parents walked in on us. We're weren't having sex btw, but she was topless giving me a lapdance. Her parents are Christian as well so they freaked out, kicked me out, called my mom, she freaked out, nearly kicked me out as well. I wasn't allowed to see her for two weeks. We nearly didn't stay together, but we pulled through as both of us understood (her mom is an Nmom as well; ex-heroin junkie, terrible person in general). Got back to seeing her on a regular basis. It was summertime, and we hung out nearly every day. One day we were making out in the pool and her parents saw. They kicked me out again. Parents scold me again. This has happened before, it's ok, we'll be more careful next time. Well looks like there won't be a next time as I get a text a few hours later from her saying she doesn't know if her mom is going to let us stay together. I start freaking out. Queue the first time I ran away. I contemplated what to do for about an hour, then decided I was going to go to her house and formally apologize to her mom. I give my parents no notice, and just leave. I get to her house and nobody is home. I still have enough time to go home before my mom notices, but for some reason I didn't. I think I was just high on the feeling of breaking the rules, I ended up spending most of the night walking around the neighborhood until I was picked up by a cop car. Apparently my mother had called the police and filed me as missing, and my girlfriend's family had been looking for me as well. I felt pretty bad for causing such an ordeal. Tensions settle down and we stop making out everywhere we go, which calms things down a bit. We start sexting but our parents never caught that (good lord, I would have been dead). Everything is pretty chill for a while. We start school. I'd been accepted to my local Governor's school, which is basically a half day STEM program. So I didn't really see girl#3 except during lunch, where we were always with her friends. We texted and sexted but didn't really get any personal time outside of school. Due to some shitty circumstances on both sides, we ended up having a huge fight during which we broke up and went NC. Cue Act IV. #ACT IV: THE LONG DARK TEA-TIME OF THE SOUL So here comes the depression. I'd realized about a month after cutting ties with my girlfriend that she was basically my only support for the shit my mother pulled. So down goes a long path of a spiral into depression. First coping mechanism was computers. I'd been a tech savvy guy before, but I really got into computer science. Most of my fucking around was done in my Basic Technical Drawing class. We'd finish drawings on paper and then do them on the computer. Our teacher would just give us two weeks worth of drawings at one time and we had to turn them in at the end of the two weeks or so. This took everyone a long time but I was pretty good at CAD so I'd whip up two weeks worth of drawings in about half an hour, print them off at full size, and then trace the paper drawings off of the printed copy. Let me finish a month's worth of work in about two days. Me and a few of my friends did this, and in the remaining days we'd just have one large Halo and Minecraft LAN party. Pretty fun. I'd also occasionally DDOS the Minecraft server that was always running by some kids in Graphic Tech, because those guys were dicks. I was in the class with my brother and his friend who was also a tech guy. We got along well. Our school had security holes and we loved exploiting them. Making keyboards of library computer type gibberish was a fun one. We basically devised fun ways to prank people on the school's network all day, and talked about cybersecurity and hacking. Eventually I pulled The Big One that would land me in juvie, but I'll get to that later. Second coping mechanism was the more harmful one. I took up cutting pretty regularly. I wasn't really suicidal when I cut, it was mostly just a bad way to relieve stress. I was getting more and more depressed and I didn't really know why at the time. Eventually I came to know that it was because I was finally deciding to accept my own views and come to terms with who I was, and those views would cause my family to hate me. I'd rejected Jesus and (for the double whammy) finally accepted that I was bisexual. I'd never been able to explain why I felt weird urges around attractive guys, until I realized that they were sexual urges, and I'd buried them because Jesus doesn't like that. I haven't told my parents or anyone this yet. #ACT V: FUCK YOU, MOM, I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME TO In comes the reason why I've posted here and the reason for all the backstory. After one pretty huge fight with my parents (they'd found out I'd installed Minecraft on my Governor's School laptop, which is against the rules) and they told me they were going to take it back to the school. Now this next part seems a little shallow without context. That laptop was my primary coping mechanism. I had nobody to talk to and spent most of my time learning IT skills on the internet. It made me happy, and I'd come to realize that it was the only thing at that moment that made me happy. Nothing else did. So, I freaked out. My parents were scolding me with the usual ""you've broken the rules again you're such a bad kid"" banter, and then mid sentence I sprinted to my room and locked the door. Grabbed a knife and made some pretty deep cuts. Parents called the police, busted in the door, and took me to the hospital. So I got sent to the looney bin for a week. They ended up putting me on Zoloft which didn't work. About three other meds I don't remember the names of, but they didn't work. Turns out - I don't have a chemical imbalance, I have a shitty life. Meds can't fix that! One particular traumatic time was when my parents forced me to take seroquel against my will. Basically the doctor gave them a bottle with a few doses of it to give to me ""whenever they thought a potential 'blow up' could occur"". I agreed seeing as I didn't have much of a choice in the matter. One day I was doing the dishes when my mother came in to yell at me about something, don't remember what. But it was definitely something I didn't do as I argued with her about it. She disregarded my opinion and basically said I'm lying and she doesn't tolerate lying. So I kind of shut up and finished the dishes. She starts screaming at me as I'm silently washing dishes, asking why I'm not saying anything, at this point I don't know what to say so I just walk off. She grabs me by the arm. I struggle from her grip and she chases after me. My stepdad comes in, and pins me up against the wall, tells my mom to grab the seroquel. I've had it once before, can't really describe it's effect other than it made my thoughts weird. I don't like it. I refused to take it. They're screaming at me. I start to have a panic attack. I don't know if you've had a panic attack before but it is the scariest thing. It felt like my conscious mind just stopped working, I stopped having thoughts, and my subconsious took over. Unfortunately my subconscious is filled with nothing but unmatched terror right now. I start hyperventilating, eventually they force me to take the pill, and just sit there and watch me as I feel like I'm dying. I calm down a bit, and go to bed. I didn't really talk to my parents much after that. #ACT VI: IT'S GOOD TO BE AMISH So yeah, eventually I decide to pull The Big One on my school's network. I pull the prank, get arrested, the whole shebang, and basically have to live in this hell hole of a place for a year, forced to obey every command from my mother. Luckily I've been visiting my father pretty recently (about every two weeks) and it's always good to spend time down there. My mother always railed me with questions about my visits, down to the conversation topics. Fucking control freaks. Eventually parole wore off. I was allowed to have my electronics back. My source of happiness for the prior year which I'd been deprived of by court order. I was so excited, I'd been counting the days down from 365. Day comes, I ask for my phone back, parents said no. Yup. Can't live in this house and use your phone, you'll get it when you move in with your runaway father in a month to go to stupid liberal college. I wasn't putting up with that shit. I got home and quickly stole it back from them. Kept it a secret for about two weeks, until I got kicked out of the house. I got kicked out initially for staying at a friend's house after my senior prom after I told her I was coming straight home. After like three days she caved and let me back in, I stayed for like a week before she stole my phone and read my texts to my dad during the period when I was homeless. Basically we both said it was a shitty thing for her to do and he was looking into getting a fucking hotel and a taxi to drive me to and from school everyday because that's the length I needed to go to to finish high school, lol. So she kicked me out again after that. Stayed with a friend down the road. Basically just threw all my shit on the porch, I grabbed everything my friend and I could carry and walked it down to his house where I stayed for a month and finished school. She came back a week later crying and asking me to come back, I basically told her to fuck off. Haven't talked to her since except one time my brother got caught supporting Sanders and she hijacked his Facebook and messaged me. Told her she should stop trying to control him and that he can choose his own worldviews. Other than that, I've gone no contact. So yeah. That's my life story. Thanks for reading all of that, if you actually did. Nowadays I'm in college studying cybersecurity and own my own business doing freelance tech work. Safe to say I'm doing mostly ok now. Except the relationships part, I've stayed away from dating since I've still got some pent up issues I'm trying to resolve. But yeah. Life is better."
526,cybersecurity,raisedbynarcissists,gah - she got me on the phone,8,2zjhru,http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2zjhru/gah_she_got_me_on_the_phone/,2015-03-19 13:06:56,"I've been VLC with my mom for some time. My daughter usually calls her, and I *thought* she hadn't noticed that I was never on the call. Tonight, my son hands me the phone, and I stall long enough to hit the record button. Just in case I'm being oversensitive.... I suspect everything she says as fishing for ammunition to be used against me. Right: * ""I havent talked to you in awhile"" - guilt, much? * (telling me about a birthday celebration) ""Their son K, whos a sort of a show off, took us to a superfancy restaurant. I got to ride in a *limousine* which I never did before. Anything we wanted, we got them to wait on us!"" - sums up her personality in one bitchy, infantilized, entitled, snobby sentence. I like the way she slams K, too. She has met him twice. * (finding out I was one state over last week) ""Come see me sometime"" - whining guilt. She's warming up. * ""Are you still working for this um... cybersecurity thing?"" - Ah. She was here visiting last summer. She knew I had started my own company 7 months prior to their visit, but whatever. I took an entire week off work to show her and my sister around - she 'forgot' my first husband's name and minimized my sister's urgent health issues. * ""What are you doing?... I didnt know that. What kind of commissions do you get?"" - She meant $, but I took it to mean what type of work. *As if* I'm going to tell her my income. No freaking way. * ""What type of work is (my daughter) doing?"" - she talks with my daughter regularly, at least once a month. My daughter insists that she has Aspergers and is just socially clueless and non empathic. I think she's a devious manipulative witch. Because she says things like ""I didn't know you had any scientific aptitude"" - at my graduation with a chemistry degree. Combined with her 'offer' of helping me pay for school if I promised to 'stop breeding'. Yeh. I don't think that's Aspergers. **** On the other hand, I got to break out the celebratory beer an hour early. I didn't actually let her bait me. Triggered, but not fired. Feels good. "
