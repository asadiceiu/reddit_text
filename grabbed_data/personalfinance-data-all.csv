Another email said the same about my Chase Zelle Account. I logged in my account, to find my number still there, except another UNKNOWN number (beginning with a 640) was also added as an associated number. I immediately called Chase (I doubled checked on Chase.com that the number was legit). The customer rep told me he didn't see any additions in phone numbers, which weirded me out. I immediately deleted the phone number. But right now I don't know what else to do. I can't change my password either on the computer or on the Chase mobile app. What should I do?? Any help is deeply appreciated, thanks."

Is this likely a vulnerability from the large merchant I exclusively use this card at? Is my computer suspect to a spyware of sorts making my card and keystrokes available? Im okay, but at a loss at how this happened? Appreciate any feedback. Thanks!"
2,vulnerability,personalfinance,Are card payments in physical shops safer than online card payments?,1,g45ygx,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/g45ygx/are_card_payments_in_physical_shops_safer_than/,2020-04-19 21:08:38,"Even during the epidemic, even despite her age and particular vulnerability to respiratory sicknesses due to her health conditions, my mother firmly refuses to pay for anything online and *especially* not with her card. She fears she could have her money stolen. This seems interesting since, as far as I'm aware, [security specialists consider online card payments to be among the safest ways to make payments](URL I am particularly interested in this piece of my mom's reasoning... She says if she made an online payment with a card, she would have to give the card's data to the shop, which will then deduce from the card as much money as they like and may continue deducing money, fraudulently, later on. She says: &gt;Paying with cards online is like giving the shop clerk keys to my home with a password to my safe - if I kept my money in a safe rather than in the bank. I then trust the clerk to take only as much money as they say they will take. This would be ridiculous in all cases but in the case of online payments! But since people are so in love with new technologies and since everything prefixed by an 'e' or 'i' is automatically so cool, people forget about most basic rules. I will not entrust anyone with all my belongings, except - out of necessity - my bank. Instead, I will go to my home, open my safe, take as much money as I need to pay, and then pay the shop clerk this money; or, at least, I will tell the bank to pay them as much as I, not them, want. Interestingly, she has no objections to paying with her card in a physical store - as long as this is not a proximity card. She says: &gt;This is quite different. In a shop I insert my card to a terminal, which, as far as I understand, is connected to the bank. The terminal displays the amount of money that will be paid and then I enter my PIN. So the terminal is like a little bank teller in the shop. I do not entrust the shop with my whole account balance, instead I tell the bank to make the shop they payment, and I've already entrusted my bank with my account balance anyway. In this way no one, not even the shop, can deduce more money from my card if they don't know the PIN. For this reason, she says, she would only accept online payments in the form of bank transfers: She logs in to the bank's website and tells the bank to pay someone as much money as she wants. (She's very reluctant to do so anyway). Interestingly, as far as I'm aware, [security specialists are very careful about online transfers and do not view them as a very secure way](URL I'm curious, however, if the analysis about online card payments vs card payments in physical shops is correct? Is it true that the terminals in shops are connected directly to the bank? Or is this similar to online payments in that the shop deduces money from the card on their own? My mother is confident in having online payments blocked on her card. But I read that [sellers can bypass such limits](URL Apparently, whether a card transaction is classed as an online payment or a payment where the card is physically present, depends only on the seller. So is it possible that the shop later on deduces more money from the card on their own, by incorrectly classing the transaction as a physical one (even though they no longer have the card?) Does the shop, by virtue of having received a physical card payment, gain any information about the card that would allow them to deduce more money from the card later on? In short: If I make my payments by physically inserting the card to a terminal - do I depend on the honestly of the receiver of the payment any more than if I make online payments with this card?"

They were all for businesses in a different province than I live in, and amounted to a few hundred dollars. I immediately contacted Groupon and let them know I did not make these purchases, within 3 hours of them having been posted (before the items had even shipped). They assured me they would look into it. I immediately called my credit card company and they cancelled my card and reissued me one. Two days later they get back to me and tell me that the purchases were all ""authorized"" and they couldn't be refunded. I told them that was ridiculous, and pointed out that the purchases could have been cancelled when I notified them. They then got into repetition mode, just repeating over and over that the purchase was ""not unauthorized"" and would not answer any questions directly. They closed my Groupon account I logged into my account and saw that my credit card info was stored (never asked me), and that you could make a purchase without ever having to confirm my billing address or type in my CVV. This issue seems to be a persistent problem with Groupon based off of other message board postings and is obviously a vulnerability. The person who used my card had included their name and address for delivery. I contacted the local police non emerg of that city and filed a fraud report, but they never responded. I contacted the canadian anti fraud centre and consumer protection bureau and they all recommended I contact my bank. I contacted my bank and let them know that Groupon was refusing to acknowledge any breach of security (and had closed my Groupon account/locked me out) and disputed the charge, providing my police report number and all documentation. They assured me they would cover this. In December/January they reversed the charges. Looked at my bill today and found that I was charged again for those transactions--it appears that Groupon disputed the chargeback. What are my options? This was a not insignificant amount of money (several hundreds, which is a lot for me right now)"

In order to link an account, it looks like I have to literally give them my username and password for that account. They say they don't store it and it is stored with a company called Yodlee, but it's still stored somewhere (encrypted...hopefully). From my understanding, retirement accounts and investment accounts aren't insured by the FDIC like banks are and they don't have zero liability policies like credit cards do. Most are covered by SIPC insurance but that is protection against the brokerage firm failing, it is explicitly NOT protection from theft or fraud. Cybersecurity insurance policies generally only protect if the ""hack"" wasn't your fault (like leaving your username and password written on a piece of paper on your desk). You must keep your credentials private. I'd assume that giving your credentials to a 3rd party (like Personal Capital) is clearly NOT keeping your credentials private. So, in my (not really outlandish) nightmare scenario, a hacker gets access to a Personal Capital database (or Yodlee in this case I guess), finds they aren't encrypting correctly or some other storage vulnerability, gets all my credentials, steals all my money, and all of my investment account companies say ""you gave your credentials to a 3rd party so you didn't keep them private. This is your fault, we're covering nothing."" Does anyone see anything blatantly incorrect with what I'm saying? Is there some definitive info out there about this kind of scenario? I can find info about protection if an actual broker (like Fidelity or Vanguard) get hacked and I can find info about Personal Capital's security but I can't find anything specifically discussing a similar scenario to above and what happens in that case.

As in the title, my GF and I (late 20s) are planning on children in the future and want to get a leg-up on saving for their college due to the magic of compounded interest. We've been exploring setting up a 529 account but I have a few questions before we do that. 1. We're not sure how many kids we'll have exactly, or when. My understanding is that it's possible to change the beneficiary of a 529 plan, and also to transfer funds between plans. Ideally, we'd start one plan today with one of us as the beneficiary, which we would then change to the first child when they're born. When second+ child is born, we'd start a whole new 529 account, and fund it with money from the first account. Is this feasible or is there a better way to do this? And will all plans permit this, or only some? 2. Will transferring funds between 529 accounts trigger a tax or penalty? 2. There's always the unplanned possibility we won't be able to have children, we'll split up, one of us will die, etc. Is the value of a 529 attached to an estate? And with just one of us listed as the beneficiary to begin with, and all contributions considered gifts, my impression is that even if we were married, the money would belong to the beneficiary, not to both contributors. Is this correct? I realize that's a small vulnerability to the non-beneficiary, even if I don't foresee it being an issue. 3. If we aren't able to have children or decide not to, is there any detriment beyond the tax on the gain of the investment plus the 10% penalty tax if we close the account? 4. Is it easy to change the investments within an account? Ideally we'd be able to start with all of the money in equities, and when the child is born, transition to a target-age fund."

As the public becomes aware of the tactics, criminals seem to always be one step ahead. Because of this, the attorney general of California sent out a warning to [protect consumers](URL from being victimized by timeshare scams during their distress. In the article, Xavier Becerra discusses the initial sales process and specifically addresses the strategies used by fraudulent timeshare resale and recovery companies. First and foremost, you have to understand that most questionable operations have to give away free stuff to persuade consumer consideration. Companies involved in timeshare scams often use large complimentary [gifts in exchange](URL for sitting for a short educational seminar on timeshares. These gifts often include free hotel stays, lavish meals, or tickets to local shows. Resort sales teams know exactly how to make attendees feel indebted because of the extent of the seminar meeting. It causes consumers to believe theyd be foolish not to agree to such an amazing deal. All of the shiny objects presented during seminars normally distract potential timeshare owners from the often large upfront costs and [maintenance fees](URL In addition, there are rarely stipulations in the contract of how quickly the fees can increase. If you decide to sit in for one of these educational seminars, make sure the salesperson points out any promise they make in the contract. For instance, if they state that you can sell back the property at any time for full market value, have them point out exactly where it states that. Since this is such a large purchase, do your due diligence and ask follow up questions. If at any point they cannot show you what they have stated, be on high alert. If you catch them in one lie, you have to expect there are more to come. ## The Resale Market Can Be Misleading Since timeshare scams have been frequently publicised over the past few years, consumers are beginning to look into secondary resale markets to [buy a timeshare](URL This can be dangerous for those not thoroughly educated on ownership. Similar to a new car, a timeshare loses a lot of value after first being sold. Far too many people dont look past the price tag to see what timeshare ownership actually entails. If it seems too good to be true, then it probably is. If someone is looking to [get rid](URL of their timeshare for next to nothing, then you know the financial burden of the purchase was underestimated. Why would you make the same mistake? Even after the mortgage is paid off, many are forced to [sell the property](URL simply to escape annual or quarterly fees. The ability to travel to a condo in a tropical location for less than a thousand dollars may seem like an amazing deal - but the sellers desperation to [get rid](URL of the timeshare should be a red flag. Make sure you thoroughly understand all costs, fees, and reservation processes before taking on someone elses remorse. ### Proceed With Caution During a Timeshare Resale As more people sell their timeshare, more fraudulent companies crop up claiming to be resellers that facilitate the process. Although there are legitimate resale platforms, dont assume legitimacy and learn from exposed timeshare scams as well as the mistakes of others. In other words, do your homework before working with any company to [find timeshare relief](URL Research beyond the Better Business Bureau or Yelp reviews, as many companies simply rebrand themselves to avoid their paper trail of fraud. Reviews or recommendations can be easily fabricated online and companies that *seem* good can easily sell you something that isnt beneficial. This is especially true when it comes to [timeshare resales](URL As with any real estate transaction, make sure to have a contract that protects all parties included. Be hesitant to work with a company that mandates upfront costs, even if there is a money back guarantee. Also, be hesitant if the reseller states that they have an interested party looking for a property exactly like yours. This is a common pressure tactic used to get timeshare owners to sign up for *cant miss* [resale *opportunities*](URL ## Dont Get Victimized Twice The last scam timeshare owners tend to run into has to do with [recovery fraud](URL These companies promise assistance to persons that have already been scammed by the timeshare company. They target their vulnerability by promising restitution, only to re-victimize the timeshare owner shortly after the sale. When seeking out a company that helps victimized timeshare owners, make sure to completely investigate their reputation and never pay fees up front. In the Attorney Generals warning, you can tell he was genuine in his attempt to [protect consumers from timeshare scams](URL At the same time, he realizes there is only so much he can do. Without documented evidence of corruption, its nearly impossible to win a legal battle with timeshare companies that are built to protect themselves. ### Avoid the Scam, Cancel if You Can... If youre tired of the deceit and are looking to cut your losses before things get out of hand, Vacation Ownership Consultants is only a phone call away. Since 2014, theyve helped [every single one of their clients](URL terminate their timeshare contract and eliminate the financial burden of vacation ownership. Thousands of timeshare owners are scammed every year and its their goal to help them find the relief they deserve."

Wont stop stalking, harrassing, and straight of creeping her out to where she fears every shadow on our property i find such comfort in. even over a week away he still sneaks around and fucks with her sense of security. 3 nights in a row (looks like being laid off helped. No way in my 55 hour work week could i EVER do this) i had to stay up till sunrise cause of him and how he made her feel. Joseph has court Nov. 9th. I have talked Pepper into filing a restraining order. I am too. Hell I do think we could press more charges for all the death threats to her and me. We will see. On Nov. 9th i want to go to the courthouse with ALL evidence we have of his obsession and psychopathic tendencies and file for a restraining order or more if possible. Joseph does have warrants out. So I've been told. maybe in GA, he has a charge here in SC with that firing a handgun deal. I need any public information on him so i have evidence of his character in pushing this restraining order to other charges to fucking stop his terrorizing of people on our damn peaceful property. And to other women in general. his ex wife had to move to the midwest just to get away from him and he is never ever able to see his kids until they adults. Its court things of that nature i would like to have on the nov. 9th to help rid this psycho from poor Pepper's life. Honestly that would mean so damn much! If someone could help with that. If i still worked I'd do it in a heartbeat and help with a layer. Since me being laid off i can barely pay rent. Landscaping comes hard in the winter here at times. Anything would help but most of all his past exposed in this. If anyone has ANY advice, wishes to have some of this cleared up (sorry in such a rush! just convinced her today to take it all to the cops. rushing to try to get evidence together), or any other help or words of encouragement, please message me here or email me at jonf.marshal@gmail.com \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I have this friend, Pepper is her name, that was and still is running from this person. It's a long story. and being non violent and believing that fighting isn't the answer has made him think i am of no threat. Nor Pepper. In fact she stays with me and feels completely unsafe. for good reason. he texts her on all kind of internet phone numbers all over the night saying hints/clues of her nightly activities. we live in a heavily wooded area and its nothing but family around. We have tried to search for him on some of those nights. but not enough coffee can help us comb this place. So here is the financial issues and legal issues. Financially i have been laid off right as this happened. Halloween actually. I didn't make much but with a rent of 200 a month and electric of 50$, those 500$ weekly checks went far. Actually Got a truck and a car from the savings in 6 months. Pepper had been isolated, verbally abused, and even because of said stalker can't go home to her mum and her kids. this guy discharged a handgun all drunk on her mums property. After that Pepper ended up on our property because the stalker is actually a 15 year friend of my cousin here. James is his name. and offered Pepper a place to stay. Needless to say The stalker attacked Pepper, with my dad as witness (drunk as hell he doesn't remember having to pull him off Pepper) claiming Pepper in no way started the physical confrontation, she was kicked out of James's place. They don't do ""drama"" Well I come home and Pepper tells me she was kicked out. Having no place to go and family states away and not to secure financially she had and still has nowhere to go. I lived with a 57 year old room mate who has strokes do to alcohol nearly bi monthly. I do my best to help him. but as he says ""I'm just an old hillbilly from West Virginia"" and that's that. I ask my roommate about Pepper and says its fine for the weekend. This happens the weekend before halloween. i do believe Sunday between 1 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. The stalker refuses to leave. He had been arguing and frustrated with her all night. I want him to leave. its getting old. He lives 2 miles away. It had been 45 minutes. i text Pepper n tell her to get home with my car. She gets home and he's in the car. that is when i stop being nice and understand as i usually try to be. i ask Pepper why is he still in the car? She says he wouldn't leave. So she brought him back. Right away i went to the passenger side and told him that he HAS to leave my property NOW! and oh man thats when shit got real. and by real i mean Hollywood definitely didn't make this experience any easier. After yelling at him to leave for a few minutes i begin to call the cops. he started the property and did leave. i told the cops it's cool he left. Somehow Joseph manage to take Pepper's phone. Five minutes later, after he left, Pepper tells me she sees a light in the woods. I tell her...blah it's probably those darn tweakers in the Trailer Park over yonder. They ok guys, dont fuck with us and have respectable hustles. Little did i know that Pepper had been trying to get away from Joseph. Going as far as breaking her phone because he was mad she wanted to see her sister in NC. Buying her a new one 2 or 3 days later. And now that i think about it a bit after breaking the phone Joseph's tire mysteriously got ""slashed."" Upon further examination by my father he said it wasn't a slash. and if it was someone with a small pocket knife or something had a go at it. i believe he did that so he didn't have to take Pepper to NC to visit her sister. Apologies, I digress. Pepper is really spooked by the woods and I'm like.... Dude this place aight love it here n never felt safer. Pepper is about 10 foot behind me. i am about 3 foot from edge of the woods/brush. all the sudden Joseph, the fucking stalker, charges out of the woods Straight at her! Completely ignoring me. lucky Pepper wasn't far from the door. and she made it. where she shout her frustrations and countless obscenities at him. Somehow in all of this i Lost my damn phone.... I also need to say this. I am on Parole and would rather not get cops involved, I am non violent as possible for good reason, i was drunk, and i just do my best to see good in folk and want to end any negative situation as positive as possible. Pepper was also on Parole. She discharged from parole a month ago. Here is her deal. Joseph and her had been friends on FB before she went to prison for a few years. In prison Joseph started to write her. Pepper's family had always been estranged from her for she was adopted at 15 and didn't turn out how her adopted mother wanted her. she never knew her real parents. Only 2 people from her life and family before prison stayed in contact with her. Joseph somehow capitalized on this and fucking ran some crazy ass good game. taking advantage of her vulnerability and trying to isolate her from everyone for some reason i wish to never know. Pepper also don't like cops for 2 hours this crazy guy ran into the woods. threw crap at my house. doing that creepy shit where he puts his face on the windows or in part of it to fuck with Pepper. at one point he calmed a bit and i went out. he wanted me to hit him first! i tell him to just fucking leave. i don't want to put hands on you. i don't want to hurt you. your freaking out Pepper. go sleep off whatever you drunk come back tomorrow. dude wouldn't leave. as i was talking with him Pepper Stepped out and started to have her words. i tell her to just go inside stop inciting him. stop giving him power. your just feeding him i tell her. Pepper finally turns her back and goes inside. Right as she turns around Joseph makes a Beeline to hers and does his best to tackle her to inside my house. That was the only, maybe second time, i laid hands on him. All i did was counter tackle him. Man i sound fucking lame and just useless here. As i tackled him too. It was odd. somehow he was able to slow his full charge at Pepper. restructure his position. stand ground. and prevent me from taking him down. was so odd. this dumb crap goes on till about 3:30. i tell Pepper, ""Shit I'm so wasted from all this. And I aint stopping the drink now. Take a few more rounds relax, and enjoy how pathetic he is acting right now."" she can't do that as easily. and with great concern. she is terrified and scared for her life. Hell. I can't stand being around guns cause of my felony status. I even went to my roommate to ask him for his. damn old west virginia hillbilly sloshed himself into next winter and no gun i can fire off in warning. That's how frustrated i got. and how scared she was. For the time being she sleeps with a 12 gauge under her bed and a great Paw Paw with a handgun on his nightstand. In conclusion. This Joseph is screwed up. Wont stop stalking, harassing, and straight of creeping her out to where she fears every shadow on our property i find such comfort in. even over a week away he still sneaks around and fucks with her sense of security. 3 nights in a row (looks like being laid off helped.

As you may know, Fidelity acquired eMoney Advisors and was switching its Full View app from the Yodlee API to their new in-house software. Curious, I decided to see what was different. The first red flag was when entering the new app it would not load until I had loosened my internet security to allow all cookies. This took some time, as I realized that despite ""allowing"" cookies, the page wasn't loading because I only allowed cookies from sites and domains I had actually visited. In other words, it won't even function without Third Party Cookies allowed. Upon allowing cookies from ""all sites,"" I was able to load the ""new, improved"" Full View. Well, let's just say the only account that was accurate was my actual Fidelity brokerage account. Every other account was now classified as ""manual entry"" and needed to be re-linked. Fine. So I attempted my first non-Fidelity account and it wouldn't work. At all. Discouraged, I decided to check what cookies this new Full View had added since it required Third Party cookies, and I wanted to test to see if I could simply create additional manual exceptions to my preferred blanket policy of excluding Third Party Cookies. Oh my goodness, I now had bing.com cookies, ad.doubleclick cookies, and all kinds of cookies from other third party, adware and tracking type sites. I deleted them all, re-tightened my security settings, and promptly terminated my account enrollment in the Full View app. I know that periodically questions come here regarding security of banking aggregator services, and the Yodlee/Mint APIs seemed safe and secure as they used encrypted tokens for their account linking and didn't require something as ridiculous as a completely open cookie policy to load. Fidelity's new API is cookie-based, and they also utilize adware cookies on their site. This, to me, is an unacceptable security vulnerability, and so I'm posting this in case anyone else feels similarly and would want to know about this unfortunate new development."

I was kind of floored that I had never thought about this before and am afraid kind of afraid to pay with a check. Is my fear unfounded?

However, they have an image from a Vanguard paper that [""shows the impact of adding bonds to dampen volatility (as measured by standard deviation), while not drastically reducing returns""](URL It seems like most people here are 100% equities, as am I.

I figured this would be a great place to share what I learned. Hope you enjoy! ##Principle 1: Buy experiences instead of things Experiential purchases: Made with the primary intention of acquiring a life experience: an event or series of events that one lives through Material purchases: Made with the primary intention of acquiring a material good: a tangible object that is kept in ones possession. Which of the two makes you happier? *Why are experiences better than things?* - People adapt more slowly to experiential (vs. material) purchases because they remain novel longer. - Experiences are unique and varied. Objects remain the same. - People anticipate &amp; remember experiences longer than they do things. [Van Boven &amp; Gilovich (2003)](URL found that: 1. 83% of a sample of college students reported mentally revisiting their experiential purchases more frequently than their material purchases. 2. A majority of adults sampled viewed their experiential purchases as more self-defining than their material purchases. - Experiences are more likely to be shared with other people &amp; other people are our greatest source of happiness. ##Principle 2: Help others instead of yourself Human beings are the most social animal on the planet. Social relationships are a strong determinant of our happiness. Anything we do to enhance our connection with others improves our happiness as well. A national sample of Americans were asked to rate their happiness and to report how much money they spent in a typical month on (1) bills &amp; expenses, (2) gifts for themselves, (3) gifts for others, and (4) donations to charity. The results indicated that: 1. Personal spending was unrelated to happiness. 2. People who devoted more $ to prosocial spending were happier, even after controlling for income. *Why does prosocial spending enhance well-being?* - Strong social relationships are universally critical for happiness, and prosocial spending has a strong effect on social relationships. - Although the benefits of prosocial spending are robust across cultures, they are invisible to many people. - [Dunn et al. (2008)](URL found that a significant majority of college students made an affective forecasting error: they thought that spending $ on themselves would make them happier than spending on others. Other research has found that simply thinking about $ undermines prosocial impulses, making people less likely to donate to charity or help acquaintances. [(Vohs et al. 2006)](URL ##Principle 3: Pay now &amp; consume later - Consume now &amp; pay later has become common in our society. *Credit cards* *No money down!* *Dont pay for six months!* - The shift toward immediate enjoyment &amp; delayed payment represents a fundamental change in our economic system that undermines well-being. - The consume now &amp; pay later heuristic leads people to engage in shortsighted behavior. People rack up debt &amp; save little for the future. Vast literature on delay of gratification have shown that impatient people end up less well off. - This heuristic eliminates anticipation, and anticipation is a source of free happiness. For example, the person who buys a cookie &amp; eats immediately receives X units of pleasure when it is eaten.The person who saves the cookie until later gets the same X units of pleasure when the cookie is eaten plus all the additional pleasure of looking forward to eating it. - Research shows that thinking about future events triggers stronger emotions than thinking about the same events in the past. [Van Boven &amp; Ashworth (2007)] (URL Students felt happier while anticipating an upcoming vacation than while reminiscing about the same vacation. ##Principle 4: Buy many small pleasures instead of a few big ones - We may be better off devoting our finite financial resources to purchasing frequent doses of lovely things than infrequent doses of lovelier things - Happiness is more strongly associated with the frequency than the intensity of peoples positive affective experiences [(Diener et al. 1991)](URL *Why?* - Were less likely to adapt to small frequent pleasures. - Things that delay adaptation include novelty (weve never experienced the event before), uncertainty (were not entirely sure what the event is or how it will turn out), and variability (the event keeps changing). - Having a drink with some friends (a small pleasure) meets each of these criteria  its never exactly the same as it was before, theres a chance to experience something novel (e.g., a new beer from England Old Speckled Hen), and meeting new people. - In contrast, a dining room table (a big pleasure) meets none of these criteria. ##Principle 5: Buy less insurance - Research on how well people cope with a wide variety of traumas and tragedies  from heart attacks to terrorist attacks  suggests that people are not emotionally fragile. - Were very good at spinning events so as to avoid self-blame &amp; regret. *Yet, research indicates that people overestimate their vulnerability to negative affect.* - Businesses capitalize on this tendency toward risk aversion by offering all types of insurance against unhappiness. - Extended warranties reach as high as 50% of a products original cost. - Extended warranties are a good deal for the seller &amp; a very bad deal for the consumer. However, even if a product fails (which is rare), we quickly adapt. TL;DR: 1) Buy experiences instead of things 2) Help others instead of yourself 3) Pay now and consume later 4) Buy many small pleasures instead of a few big ones 5) Buy less insurance "

I decided that since signing up with one of the big-three will be honored by each, I'd try it through TransUnion or Experian. I tried TransUnion first, but they require that one sets up an account. After trying, they said that it appeared that I *already* had an account set up, which I don't recall doing anytime within the last few years (though it could have happened around 2013 when I was trying to improve my credit). Upon requesting the password recovery option (since I have no clue what It would be), they brought me to a 'secret question' page. The secret question was simply 'SECRET_QUESTION8', which is a little disconcerting (see [screenshot](URL ) . Either TransUnion has a weird bug in their database queries, or someone used a script to create an account using my info. Either way, I'm a little spooked. Of course, TransUnion wasn't reachable via phone probably because of the panic that everyone is in over the Equifax breach. Luckily, I had no problem setting up a Fraud Alert via Experian. They also generated a credit report after setting up the alert, and I didn't see anything on there that looks too suspicious. I suppose I'm posting this to see if anyone else has had a similar issue, or maybe as a warning for others to check if this has happened to them. There could be a very real vulnerability in TransUnion's account-signup if someone could hack it with a script. "

I didn't get in, but was able to get a Technician job in my field at MD Anderson. Luckily, I didn't lose anything in Harvey, but seeing all the destruction around me made me extremely cognizant of my financial vulnerability. A little background: After completing my undergrad with no debt and about 7k in savings 2 years ago, I bought a cheap motorcycle and taught English in Cambodia for 6 months, loved it so much that I came back to the US and bought another motorcycle to complete a dream of riding from Alaska to Arizona. I worked odd jobs ranging from washing dishes to hay ranching to pay my way, but wiped my savings out. Dumb? Probably. I wouldn't have done it any other way. Now I'm content having traveled and looking to be more aggressive in saving to secure a better future. My budget is as follows: Post tax Income: $1440/mon from Technician job $640/mon from Nursery work on weekends (cash, untaxed) =Total: $2080 Monthly Expenses: $575 Rent $300 Car + Motorcycle Insurance - ($280 for car, $20 for motorcycle, both paid off) $70 Electricity &amp; Internet $40 Phone $200 Food - (assuming $50/wk and not including...) $100 Liver Tax - [$25/wk High Life Tall Boys (they make you feel like a cowboy) + Friday Night Cheeseburger] $30 Gas =Total: $1,315 Automatic Monthly deductions: $340 straight to crappy normal bank savings account ~$60 extra on average saved thanks to Acorns $100 Car/Motorcycle maintenance fund (coffee can, disappears faster than it should) = $500 Or, in summary -$2080 Income -$1315 Expenses -$500 Savings = $265 discretionary/incidentals Latte Factors (besides miller time) : - Plants. Employee discount helps to mitigate this, but going over statements from the last few months, I spend between $20-50 per month on houseplants, gardening supplies, new bonsai projects, etc. - Books. I'm a voracious reader, and once a month I wake up with $20-$30 worth of amazon paperbacks on my doorstep. I've got a library card now, but the Houston inter-library loan system is very slow and unreliable. - Literal lattes. Not huge, but again, statements show around $20 per month, or one latte a week. The expense I have the largest problem with now is my car insurance payment. I was shocked at how high rates are in Texas compared to most of the other places I've lived, but I'm hesitant to deny full coverage because drivers here in Houston are **awful**. Luckily, my employer covers health insurance, and the motorcycle means I don't have to pay for parking (expensive!). Still, I'd like to be a little more aggressive in my savings plan. I have 2k in the aformentioned crappy bank savings account already, but my goal is to have 5k put away for a Roth IRA by the end of this year, and then re-apply for a Ph.D program with a comfortable safety net next fall.

To me the pros are: Cash back Greater security Ability to challenge charges without waiting to be reimbursed Other the con side it seems that the only issue would be the discipline of paying off your tab monthly.

30,vulnerability,personalfinance,Idiot seeks advice: 30 year old vows to set up 'financial plan'.,0,5ak5p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ak5p9/idiot_seeks_advice_30_year_old_vows_to_set_up/,2016-11-02 03:46:11,"Hello r/personalfinance. I will try and be brief. I've been a financial moron for a very long time. The whole of my 30 years, in fact. That said, there are areas of life in which I believe I have shown tremendous promise. Examples include things like licking egg beaters perfectly clean [REMOVE THEM FROM THE MIXING DEVICE, TRUST ME ON THIS ONE]. I come to you having read the guides pertinent to me: (15-20, 18-25, 25-35) I will attempt to summarize my financial situation now, so I may pose my questions. I spent the first 5 years of adult life (18-23) working. I spent 24-28 in college, working part-time and gathering debts. I have spent 28-30 paying off those debts on my modest income. I am currently making $51,000 a year. I am $60,000 in debt to the federal government for my student loans. I am currently participating in the income-based payment plan, and pay $188.00 per month on said loans. I had a tremendous cloud of credit card debt and bad decisions floating over my head after college, but I have, as of this very moment, payed ALL debt (aside from my college loans) down to 0. I have a few collections on my credit history (Dish Network isn't my biggest fan) but I have 0'd them all as well. I checked my credit and I am sitting somewhere between a 660-680. Also worth noting: I am paying 5% of my checks into a 401k, my company does not match or do ANYTHING to add to that, and it is not accruing money very quickly, but I've got about $1,000 in it so far. I have no intention of touching this money, and I intend to keep putting 5% in until I don't get paychecks anymore. I am a single man. I have a reliable and fully payed off vehicle, I have no girlfriend, no plans for buying a house, and no plans for starting a family as of yet. Here's where my questions come in. I've never been in this situation before. I have been living paycheck to paycheck, spending all of my extra cash to reduce my debt cloud, for the last 3 years. Now I find myself in this place where I have no debt excluding federal college loans, no major needs, and no idea what to do with the surplus. In a basic budget analysis, I estimate that I will have approximately 400-500 extra dollars a month. ---------- Question 1: What is the most intelligent way to invest that money? It's not a lot, but I'd like to use it for growth. What options do I have, considering that I don't want to buy a house? ---------- Question 2: Is 5% with no matching enough to be putting into my 401k at this point? Should I be putting more into my 401k at this point in my life? I anticipate that I will be changing jobs fairly soon, so I'm a little leary to really start dumping into this fund since the process of transferring it to my next employer is a little hazy and intimidating to me. ---------- Question 3: Given my history, credit cards scare me. I haven't used one in over 5 years. That being said, I know 660 isn't a good credit score. What steps do I take to improve that, aside from what I've done already in closing collections and 0'ing out my debts. That was step one, now what's step 2? ---------- Question 4: Since I don't have any open credit cards and I have 0 savings, I live in vulnerability. If my truck breaks down, for example, I have no means to repair it. I have been lucky to not run into any disasters up to this point, but I am now considering throwing all this money into a savings account over time to amass a safety net type nest egg. How big should that nest egg be? Is that a bad idea? Are there better ways to protect myself in this manner? ---------- Question 5: I am on the income-based payment options for my student loans. From what I understood in the verbiage of the loans, this gives me a payment option that I can afford, but I'm still accruing interest on the total amount. The current rate of repayment, I would not come anywhere NEAR paying this off in 20 years, and as I understood it, as long as I make 20 years of payments, regardless of how much I have payed off, the loans will disappear. If I go to basic minimum payments, it will shoot my payment up to 660 dollars a month, eating the entirety of my surplus. Is this what I should be doing? Or should I remain on the income based plan? Am I naive to believe that after 20 years of paying less per month, they will eat the remaining debt? Thanks in advance, any kind soul who reads this and attempts to help me. I'll just be over here, trying to remove my tongue from the mixer."
31,vulnerability,personalfinance,"Being courted for a more senior position, need advice",0,4zfed0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4zfed0/being_courted_for_a_more_senior_position_need/,2016-08-25 09:06:38,"Hi PF, Throwaway because I don't want to risk being identified. And sorry for the wall of text :-| Some background, I work in a fairly specialized area of Computer Science that specializes in vulnerability research, reverse engineering, and malware analysis. I'm 28 and I've got about 5 years of full-time experience out of college, all in that field. I changed jobs about 8 months ago because I wasn't feeling challenged in my previous position, and my management was unwilling to move me somewhere I might be. It was a purely lateral move responsibility and workload wise, I got a $10k salary bump(to $125k) moving to a small competitor(we just passed 30 employees) in the same space, but the pay increase was just a cherry on top of the promise of a better company and more interesting work. Fast forward 8 months and the job has been working out really well, I like my new coworkers and management, the work isn't 100% what I expected it would be challenge-wise, but it is still miles ahead of my old position so I'm not complaining at all. Last week I get an email from a recruiter, as I often do being in a pretty in-demand field with a specialized skillset. His lead-in is basically that he found me on LinkedIn, he is in charge of expanding an existing small team, and just cuts right to the chase by saying the salary range is upper $100s to lower $200s, can we set up a time to chat. I'm pretty taken aback, normally I just reply to these people by saying I'm happy in my current position, blah blah blah, and go on with my day, but I can't really say no to something with a salary range that much over my current one right away, can I? So I email back and we set up a time to chat, which leads to me meeting with the technical lead on the project today over lunch, which went pretty well, and they want me to meet my potential management in the next week. During the meeting with the tech lead, it is emphasized a few times that this is a more senior position, that they're looking for someone to hit the ground running quickly and take on major responsibility as time goes on. Structure wise, the work is way more centered around reports and deliverables to clients compared to my current job, of which they are backed up to the tune of hundreds of these cases currently, hence the team expansion. The cases are generally handled on an individual basis, so it would be way less team-focused than what I'm currently doing. So, this is definitely a big change for me in terms of the way the work is being performed and a shift from a more team-based environment to individual contribution and reporting/analysis. Also, the company is much larger, ~1000 employees, so it would also be a shift from a small company to a much larger one. Basically my concerns are that if I take this job, not only am I shooting my company and coworkers/management in the back, many of whom I consider friends at this point, by changing so soon, but also permanently harming my career prospects to job hop/chase cash. However, I live in a pretty high CoL area, have a mortgage, a wife, and will probably be starting a family soon. $125k-&gt;~$200k is a pretty major increase in my mind, enough to let my wife quit the job she hates or downgrade to a less stressful position without jeopardizing our lifestyle, so I also feel like it would be stupid for me to not at least try to get it. Benefits and commute are comparable between the two companies, so that isn't really an issue. I've thought about trying to ask for a raise, but there is just such a huge disconnect in those two salaries that I can't see it happening. I know I didn't negotiate as hard as I should have initially when I took the job, but I didn't think I was leaving $75k on the table, more like $2-$8k based on what I know some of my friends with jobs in the same industry make. Finally, questions, in order of their importance to me: 1. If I take this job, am I an asshole? If it makes me an asshole, how much should I value my becoming an asshole in terms of salary when we negotiate? $25k? $30k? 2. If I take this job, am I being shortsighted in terms of my future career prospects? It's a small industry, but at the same time not really, I'm pretty sure I could walk in to any of 2-3 companies within commuting distance of me and get another similar job if it doesn't work out within a couple of months, but I just don't know longer term. 3. Because it is such a large pay bump, there is a bump in terms of responsibility/accountability. I'm 99% sure I won't be working more hours, but it will probably be a lot more stressful, at least at first. How should I be valuing stress/responsibility and the potential I will hate the new job, or is the bump already covering that? If there's a better subreddit(s) for this question let me know please."
32,vulnerability,personalfinance,I did my taxes for 100% free last year (the only year) trying to figure out how again,0,3z668g,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3z668g/i_did_my_taxes_for_100_free_last_year_the_only/,2016-01-03 05:45:08,"Hey guys. I usually do my taxes with TurboTax and I usually pay something like ~$30 for the service, Federal is free and state cost something like ~$20 or whatever. I'm usually fine doing that, but then last year I decided that I should be able to just do it all for free somehow. So I came here to this subreddit (I think) and asked about how one might do that.. someone gave me a link for my state's website that if you clicked the link though them, you get to do your taxes free. So I ended up going through H&amp;R Block's website to do my taxes, which turned out that it was 100% free to do for anyone, even the ""deluxe"" service. I thought it seemed weird that they would do it for free, but then I realized that is when TurboTax made the news that they had a vulnerability and may or may not have been hacked. So I assumed they were doing it to bring over customers. Then, later the same year, TurboTax offered refunds for 100% free as well - I assume to win back lost customers. Either way, taxes were 100% free to do last year (both service and e-filing), and I want that again this year if I can. So now basically this year I am trying to find out where/how I can go through and do my federal and state taxes for free again. I checked my state's website (Michigan) but there is nothing available yet, since it's too early in the year. But other than that, does anyone know anything about doing your taxes for free, both state and federal? By the way, I am a home owner so I'm assuming I don't want to use the standard packages that these places provide (which are free)."
33,vulnerability,personalfinance,Trying to decide between two job offers.,0,3onutq,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3onutq/trying_to_decide_between_two_job_offers/,2015-10-14 12:03:36,"Central Illinois, USA. I have 2.5 years of professional IT experience, having started on the help desk at one company and now as a junior sysadmin at a second company. I started looking around because I'm not being challenged or learning anything new at my current job. After a lengthy interview process I have two offers to choose from. **Company A - Associate Security Analyst** Seems like I'd be doing a whole lot of different things related to security, from incident response to vulnerability scanning to access control etc. Salary: $45,000 firm - have already tried negotiating and they won't budge. PTO: 12 vacation days earned over time and 5 sick days after 90 days. 5 more sick days every year thereafter, max 25. Insurance: $200/mo for self + spouse on a high-deductible plan ($2,500 single, $5,000 family). Covers 80% of costs after deductible. 401k: 50% match up to 6%, vested after 5 years. Large IT department with room to move upwards or sideways into other areas. The manager is willing (and wants to) invest in me when it comes to pursuing certifications and ongoing training. I'd double my commute at 50 minutes to work one-way, which would result in an additional $1,000/year in gas. Stress level: Probably 6 or 7 out of 10. Little on-call time, if any. My gut says that I'd probably enjoy the day-to-day tasks of this job more, all other things aside. **Company B - Desktop Support** Your typical desktop-level support job - receiving escalated tickets from the help desk and fixing problems in-person. Salary: $45,000 - have not tried negotiating, but they had a lot of applicants so I don't see them moving much. PTO: 24 days (vacation + sick combined into one pool) earned over time, plus more after a few years. Insurance: Same as above. 401k: If the company does well at the end of the year, it *may* contribute a 100% match up to 2% but it's not guaranteed, and this would be vested after 5 years. The only clear advancement path is into a system administrator position, or eventually a network architect. I'm sure I could get them to invest in certs/personal development but that would probably be less of a concern than other department needs. A 5-minute drive from home that would practically eliminate gas costs. I might even bike to work in good weather. Gas savings: $1,000/year. Stress level: 4-6 out of 10. Regular on-call rotation, taking one week every month and a half or so. Weird department issues - new IT director has taken the department in a completely different direction than it was before, and at least three people have left (which created the job openings). This could simply be people resisting change, or could point to an actual problem. I want to get started in Information Security as a career so job A definitely interests me, as I'll be getting a lot of experience in many different areas. The semi-higher stress would probably not be a huge deal. The biggest drawback is doubling my commute, and I honestly thought the salary would be higher. Job B being so close to home is very appealing, plus more vacation time. But it's not related to security at all and I don't think I'd have the opportunity to work much in that area, as it's reserved for the higher-level admins. Your thoughts? I think I've already made my decision but wanted to get feedback before making a move."
34,vulnerability,personalfinance,Advice for aunt (U.S.) regarding pension and long term care for relative in UK,10,3fa2ts,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3fa2ts/advice_for_aunt_us_regarding_pension_and_long/,2015-07-31 21:48:27,"Hi all. I'm British, looking for some advice as I try to deal with my aunt's situation. She is 73, a U.S. Citizen, lived in NYC for 40+ years in the same rent controlled apartment. She has a private pension worth approx 700,000 and other invested assets of approx 300,000. She is eligible for Medicare which pays 80% of most medical costs.mand she has a long term care plan with met life but I am not sure exactly what this covers. Around six weeks ago she had a stroke and was hospitalised. She is now back in her apartment but I a wheelchair and currently buying private 24hr live in care through an agency which is costing between 1500-2000 usd per week. She is currently using her savings to cover this, while her general living costs are covered by her pension. Because she lives in the U.S. With no dependents and no family in the country (we are all British, and live in the UK) her friends arranged for an independent money manager to take care of her affairs - making sure bills get paid, arranging care - while she was too sick to deal with anything herself. I am in the U.S. Right now trying to make sense of your healthcare system and her situation - one proposal floated by the money manager is that my aunt divests herself of her assets - either to a trust or family member - so that she is eligible for Medicaid to cover the costs of the live in care. We are trying to find out what her long term care policy covers because at the moment she is burning UK her savings - she probably has around 30months worth of money to pay for care privately as she is doing now. I guess I am seeking advice or red flags to look out for when I speak to her money manager, case workers etc. she is having therapy and rehab to try to get back in her feet but is vulnerable physically and emotionally - particularly as she doesn't have family around and can no longer walk (though she has a strong network of friends who have helped her get through the trauma of the recent stroke and subsequent return home). So...anyone got advice for protecting assets when an old lady hands over power of attorney to a money manager, advice on long term care and planning when an older relative lives alone in the U.S. And you live in the UK? Is Medicaid truly awful? My understanding is that it gives you no choice in provision of care. Other suggestions have been to look at getting private help which is cheaper and not through an agency - so the money lasts longer and the care is consistent. But this leaves a big risk in terms of safety and vulnerability when there is no regular check up from family. I am in the U.S. Meeting the money guy, the case worker and my aunts friends as well as assessing her current physical situation. She is smart and clearly made plans for her older years but she is also anxious and vulnerable and I want to make sure she is stable. Sorry if this is the wrong thread - I am not sure where to start and it seems in the U.S. Money and health are inextricably linked. TLDR - Seeking advice on care for an old relative living in the U.S. While all family are in the UK. How do we protect her and keep her stable without ending up destitute after paying for care.

Cross posting this from /r/relationships I love my Mom but she joined a group that convinced her to sell insurance and recruit others at every chance she gets. My cousin, who lives in another state and we no longer associate with, convinced her to join after talking to her on Facebook. Money has always been super tight for us and I'm afraid she can lose the house ""investing"" into this by going to all these conventions out of state. She's supposed to attend one in NJ and in Vegas later this year. My Mother was an Office Manager for 15 years but was let go in December after the company was bought out. It seemed like this was an opportunity for my cousin to call her and fly her out to California to a convention which unfortunately she bought into. When she initially told me about it, I've told her it was a terrible idea and any company that makes you pay for their services before hiring is a complete scam, I told her about all the money promises is a way to lure people in but she wasn't biting any of it. She's already spent hundreds on taking these tests and has flown out once, she told me she would be compensated but I highly doubt that. She told me ""It's this or nothing"" and I'm sure she is just convincing herself that this is her only option since she's desperate for money. I fucking hate my cousin and this ""company"" (Which is World Financial Group, name was changed a few times) for preying on her vulnerability. I asked her for the company's name and all my concerns were confirmed after some online research and checking with [Reddit](URL (TLDR MLM operating company) My Dad doesn't have an opinion on this since he retired early after his heart attack prevented him from going back. My family runs through my Mom so nobody really questions her. As for my siblings, I'm the youngest, My brother is a single dad with 3 kids who take up all his time and my sister has no opinion on this, she couldn't put up an argument if her life depended on it. So it's just me trying to prevent any damage that will eventually occur if this continues. I really want to help prevent her from losing money since she's close to the age of retirement. I know some people may think this is a loss cause but I really want to fight this and not let a fucking pyramid scheme ruin the rest of my mom's life financially. I've tried to sit down with her and talk about it but she just won't hear it from me. I feel like I need to present her numbers or something more compelling than my concerns for her actual money, which my Mom tends to fall for. **TLDR, Mother bought into a Pyramid Scheme and I need to convince her she'll be in financial ruin if it continues.**"

I'd have to file a police report to get footage of the guy and honestly I can't care enough. There were no overdraft fees, and I was able to close the account. I don't feel stupid anymore- I feel like an okay person who walked right in to a dumb scam. Three days ago I fell for a street scam. I was tired and emotionally vulnerable (my grandmother recently died and I was getting some letters I had written to her from her apartment, which entailed a good chunk of time bawling my eyes out) and it was late. I was walking to the subway station with my girlfriend, trying my best to get my emotional stability back. Then this fucking shitbag on the corner sold me on some dumb story about how his account was overdrawn, could I help him out, etc. tl;dr I told him I was overdrawn too, he played up the emotional angle, I fell for it. He deposited a bad check to my account and took the cash, so now I'm overdrawn $187. I managed to scrape together enough cash to bring my account back up to positive (using my entire last paycheck and borrowing from my family) and it turns out my account was closed and I have to see if I can reopen it tomorrow- I can't just deposit the cash at an ATM. I'm really upset about this whole situation. Mad at myself for falling for it, mad at Shitbag for being a manipulative sack of feces, mad at the world because I don't get paid for another two weeks. It could be much worse, I don't have to worry about rent or groceries, but I have a credit card payment to make soon. Hopefully I'll be able to rustle up some cash from babysitting/dog walking/something. Here's what I'm wondering: 1) is this going to impact my credit score? It's already not great. 2) is it worth going back to the Chase branch to see if they have any security footage of the guy? He used a debit card to get in to the lobby but I have no reason to believe the card was his. Would I be signing on for any kind of big legal thing by doing that? A lot of stuff in my life is kind of going to shit right now and the notion of dealing with police is really overwhelming. 3) if my account is closed are they going to pile on overdraft fees? If they do I don't know how I'll bring my account back to positive. 4) how can I get past feeling like the hugest idiot in the world? This guy preyed on my emotional vulnerability and the fact that I try very hard to be a helpful person. Intellectually I know I'm not the one who did wrong, but emotionally it's tearing me up. This is the one time in my life I gave money to someone who asked (I offer to buy people food/coffee if they ask and I can afford it, but not just cash) and I am definitely returning to that policy. At the same time I want to trust the world again, you know? I can clarify if anything I wrote is unclear, I'm still really worked up and I'm on mobile "

I am highly qualified and have had many enticing jobs in my past so am getting some bites from a few employers. One in particular would be great for me - exactly what I envision myself doing. However, next step is the credit check - and here's where I'm stumped with 3 options.. 1. I'm perfectly willing to slay my ego, humble myself and go in person with my paperwork to talk to the hiring manager. I had near perfect credit before last year - and this was an isolated incident. The one plus for a consumer proposal is I don't have any delinquent debts, so do not have the same potential for bribery as another in the ""bad credit"" category. 2. I could explain my story in a cover letter I submit with the credit check paperwork, but I fear this would raise flags immediately and they'd be looking for black marks - rather than seeing me as a candidate who has gone through some rough stuff. I fear the depersonalization could have a distancing effect on my application as its far easier to say ""no we can't help you"" to a piece of paper than a person laid bare in front of you. Obviously, this would be easier on my nerves though (currently not sleeping) - as person discussion is pure vulnerability which could elicit some empathy. 3. The other option I am considering is the ""don't ask - don't tell"" road, which could be great if a) they don't actually run a report b) they dont see a huge issue as I don't have any current debts and c) I can explain if and when they want to ask. At the end of it all, perhaps they have a black-and-white policy on this, and my story wouldn't add anything. If you were me - or the hiring manager- which option seems best? I obviously am attracted to the don't ask- don't tell one for the sake of my pride, but the in person explanation seems classy in this horrible situation - and could show my integrity and resolve. I'm just feeling absolutely SICK about this conundrum (especially as I have nothing to do but wait due to holiday weekend) - and would love any advice, personal experience, etc."

Both are extremely successful and share joint accounts for everything. Growing up, they openly talked about finances, budgeting and investing so I came unto adulthood ahead. I now hold a very steady job which I thrive at and make more than enough to make my lifestyle comfortable (relative for everyone- of course). After graduating college and settling down, I brought up a conversation with my vested partner about how he views splitting finances, home ownership, etc. throughout a progressing relationship and through marriage. Given my brief background, you may understand how I was slightly taken back when he talked about a finanial future that didn't include joint finances and splitting bills down the middle. Now, I've come to realize on a myriad of topics that life is much more complex than what it was 40 years ago so sharing finances creates extreme vulnerability but I understand many still do it. At first, I agreed to disagree on the idea but it has grown on me that separating finances may be the best route. I am not married yet but, I've come to the thought that ""hey this works for lots of people too."" I had my blinders on because that's the way I was raised so I assumed it was normal. I am here for advice though. If one purchases the home but both pay on it, that doesn't equally build equity for the one who's name isn't on it. How is that justifiable to the losing party? I also am interested as to how YOU split your finances. Is it broken down by how much you make in relation to each other? Thank you for the help as this is a whole new ball game for me."

My other concern, which is probably more appropriate for a career Reddit channel, is that I am 30 and I'm still entry level.

I am trying to sort out what the best course of action will be for me. Because of COVID19 I am changing careers, something I should have done awhile ago anyways. I am in my late 30's and starting school in fall. I will be going for IT/Cybersecurity and probably am going to transfer to a bachelors program so all together 4-5 years of schooling. My thought is that its more important for me to get school done fast at my age so I can begin getting experience in this field ASAP. Also my current salary is about 35k (was service industry), so even entry level positions in this field are going to pay 20-30k more per year than I am currently making. My rationale is that due to the higher paying nature of this field and my age, I will be going to school full time and working 2-3 days a week part time just to get a little supplemental income. The way I see it if I went part time and lost 2 years of work, thats 40-60k earning plus two years experience I will not have in my career, which considering I am halfway through my working career seems like a lot. That two years experience could easily mean the difference between landing a great job or not in the next decade. Thus, I am planning on living primarily off student loans. I have a few questions and concerns about this I am hoping people here can help me sort out. 1) I am single so have nobody else to support me but me, I am highly concerned that at some point Ill be denied student loans even though I've never had them before and never defaulted. If I get denied at some point it will be extremely difficult to continue school and basically will be a giant setback at my age. Do I need to worry about this, or will I keep getting federal aid so long as I do well and stay in school? 2) How often can I get federal aid? I currently have the federal $9500 loan that seems to go through spring of 2021, will I be eligible for another loan after that? 3) Should I consider private loans such as through my community credit union, or loans through services like Sallie Mae? And if so how much should I be taking out at a time? Should I try to take out enough for my needs for 4 years, or should I just take a bit at a time as I need it? 4) I want to focus on school and thus am working part time. My secondary reasoning aside from everything I mentioned such as my age and the increase in income I can expect is if I can do well on my AS degree and get some certifications, I may be able to begin some part time work in my field while I finish my bachelors AND hopefully even qualify for some scholarships. Thus, I dont want to bog myself down with work and want to just focus on school. 5) Lastly I am making payments on a vehicle I dont want to get rid of for a number of reasons. The cost of this is high though, like $500 a month between payments and insurance. I am considering my options here, but can I use student loans for car payments if I decide to keep this vehicle? Working part time might cover this, but thats going to be nearly all the money Ill be bringing in for a month with part time minimum wage work. Thats fine too as long as I can use my loans to pay for my housing/bills. Thanks for any direction or clarification anyone can give."

The cost of living where I am is fairly low for metro areas and I'm learning ~$120k/year. I have lots of recruiters reach out to me and I like to take an interview at least once every six months out of principle (it helps one understand where the job market is headed, how valuable the skills I'm accumulating are etc.). Usually the jobs aren't a fit and I don't put a ton of effort into getting too far into the interview process as I'm happy where I'm at. I am currently being recruited by a company that is almost a perfect fit for my skillset but it is a good clip larger and would have a little bit more responsibility. Careerwise it would be a good next step if I want to try to move up the corporate ladder. It is also going to pay almost $50-70k more and is remote so I won't have to move. It is easy to say ""chase the money"", and from what I've seen and been told the only way to climb up in pay is generally to hop between jobs. Given the current economic climate though, it seems like a risky proposition to give up something that is stable and is working out really well for me. Thoughts? EDIT: They have implemented pay freezes and stopped bonuses where I'm at as a precaution for less billings for COVID, though it is a stable company. I settle for nothing less than a cost of living raise annually (or else you are effectively getting a pay cut due to inflation)."

I am currently contributing 25% of my salary to retirement accounts (20% in a 401k that's invested entirely in a Vanguard Target Fund, and 5% in a basic roth also invested entirely in a Vanguard TF), and contributed $5k this year to a personal Roth IRA account. I make 85k/yr in a very stable industry (cybersecurity) living in Chicago and my monthly expenses (roughly) look like the following: * $950 rent * $25 utilities (only electric) * $85 phone plan * $250-300 groceries * \~$350-500 discretionary spending (some months I eat out a lot, buy expensive booze, clothes, etc. - but this is probably a fair range) * $52 car insurance * No health insurance cost yet, but that will change at the end of this year when I get off my parents' plan so I'm not sure what to anticipate in costs here. Currently, I've got about $47k in a checking account that I've been meaning to split into an emergency fund and another lump set aside for large, planned future expenses (primarily wedding ring/marriage and house).

Do you see any significant financial concerns in these (limited) details over the long term? Is staying the course a good financial plan or do I need to make some adjustments? 2. I have too much sitting in my checking account IMO, but savings accounts and CD interest rates seem laughably low at the moment - what are some good saving vessels for an EF and significant future purchases, such as a house? 3. What else should I be doing now to foster financial growth? HSA contributions, dabbling in the stock market (looking at buying SPY if there's another downturn), and creating savings accounts are all my list. 4.

I wanted to be concise but my situation is unique. I (American) just turned 24. Formerly homeless, no family support, GED. I've never worked. Last year I met my S.O. (Polish citizen) and took a fresh look at my life. We now live together in Poland. Old house + good diesel car. Our total expenses are ~$500/mo. We are frugal and financially literate. We share everything. Income: $1050/mo SSDI. Ends when I get married or sometime after I start working. After my next payment hits I will have ~$3000 in my bank accounts. S.O. has a degree in CS but is unemployed. She lacks motivation and has no in-demand skills. I have been coaxing her to learn a language or get a cybersecurity cert with some success. The plan we recently decided on is as follows: 1. Move to a big city (Warsaw/Krakow) and get a studio. Both of us get internships or jobs. Our expenses increase by $500-$700 due to rent, likely putting us slightly over my income. 2. I start online college at WGU &amp; S.O. applies for Georgia Tech OMSCS. At WGU, I am eligible for DEA benefits ($1200/mo stipend) plus Pell Grants and subsidized federal student loans. Technically, this can triple our cash flow without either of us working, which tempts me to simply draw out my studies and travel the world. 3. After getting some job experience, we come to the US w/ fiance visa. Maybe live in my van working in Seattle for a year, then get a studio in some other city for a couple years. I get Georgia Tech OMSCS myself after WGU. Ideal scenario: she gets her U.S. passport and we both have masters degrees plus six-figure savings. Then we can look at more research-oriented masters programs anywhere in the world, and pursue our dreams to become scientists.

For some background, I am currently a 20-year-old male that lives in Maryland. I graduate college this May with a degree in CyberSecurity and have a job lined up starting 2 weeks after graduating. I will be making $80,000 annually on a salary based pay. With that being said, here comes my problem statement. I would like to move out preferably later this year as I was a commuter all of college and really want my own independence. According to my calculations, I will be making approximately $4,500 a month after taxes. I plan on saving $20,000 before moving out meaning I won't be spending much of my check for much of this year which I don't mind as I don't have any student loans nor do I have any bills such as a car note or phone bills and such to pay. $10,000 of the $20,000 will be going to my savings and will be strictly off-limits as it will be emergency money if I was to ever lose my job after I have moved out. I have begun to look at apartments so I have a clear path to follow so I can put my mind to ease and have something to work towards. There are 2 apartment options, the first option is a $1,670 a month without utilities but it is rather small and tight. The other option is a $1,810 a month without utilities as well but it is more spacious and has a better floor layout/plan. I can afford both of these on one paycheck as I do not estimate utilities to be much higher than 250 at the maximum. The question is even though I can, should I? The latter is very very nice compared to the former. With over $2,250 still left over at the end of the month, I still have enough to save as I do not eat out that often and know how to cook. I also do not want a roommate under any circumstances. My goal was to not have my rent/utilities and car note(I wanted to get a new car before but that is currently on the back burner as I do not need one) and it does not but is almost 50% too much even though the other 50% is very livable.

Our current mortgage: $150,300 left on Principal. 3.875% interest rate. I have 26 years left as of this Month. $1090/mo for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and Lender Paid Mortgage Insurance (cannot be removed since it was financed/rolled into the Loan on my first Refi in April of 2016) Current debts: Vehicles - $850 month of our income in Car Loans tied up at the moment. $506 monthly (2.95 interest) vehicle #1 (26 months remaining, $12,650 principal) and $344 (3.85 interest) on vehicle #2 remain (51 months left, $16,500 principal). Home - See above Credit Cards - Roughly $4K left in credit card debt (intend to pay off this debt in a few months with our work income, not going to use the Cash out From Refi). Heres what we want to do, we Refinance our current Mortgage: 30 year terms, 3.25% interest, roughly 75% LTV, borrowing $188k (pulling out 32k to pay either both cars or at least the Vehicle #1 @ $506 Month and save the rest in a high yield savings account to use for Down Payment on the next home. Our Emergency Funds are good for 4-5 months with current expenses and will extend to be 8-9 months if we Refi (payments will be almost identical and we free up $506 a month immediately with one car paid off) Our DTI (debt to income) (Mortgage, Cars, Cards basically anything a credit pull would show is roughly 25%) My original thought was pay off both vehicles and free up $850 a month in debts.

Our current mortgage: $150,300 left on Principal. 3.875% interest rate. I have 26 years left as of this Month. $1090/mo for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and Lender Paid Mortgage Insurance (cannot be removed since it was financed/rolled into the Loan on my first Refi in April of 2016) Current debts: Vehicles - $850 month of our income in Car Loans tied up at the moment. $506 monthly (2.95 interest) vehicle #1 (26 months remaining, $12,650 principal) and $344 (3.85 interest) on vehicle #2 remain (51 months left, $16,500 principal). Home - See above Credit Cards - Roughly $4K left in credit card debt (intend to pay off this debt in a few months with our work income, not going to use the Cash out From Refi). My short term to mid term Goals: Purchase a Home when prices are lower and be ready with at least 15-20 percent down payment and some closing costs. Pay off 1 or 2 Vehicles (figures above) Rent out our current Home (we plan on keeping this until Retirement at the very least) That said, were in process of Refinancing our current Mortgage. The Refi will be 30 year term, 3.25% interest, roughly 75% LTV, borrowing $188k (pulling out 32k to pay either both cars or at least the Vehicle #1 @ $506 Month and save the rest in a high yield savings account to use for Down Payment on the next home and possibly splitting 50/50 to an IRA as well. Our Emergency Funds are good for 5 months with current expenses and will extend to be 8-9 months after we Refi (payments will be almost identical and we free up $506 a month immediately with one car paid off) Our DTI (debt to income) (Mortgage, Cars, Cards basically anything a credit pull would show is roughly 25%) My original thought was pay off both vehicles and free up $850 a month in debts. House payment will be within $20-$30 of our current mortgage since were removing Mortgage Insurance and lowering our rate 3.875 to 3.250 and going below 80% LTV.

My parents, due to my dad going into retirement soon and my mom unemployed, can't take out the Parent Loans provided, their credit is worse than mine and even if they could, my mother is dead set against co-signing a loan with her for me to pay. I don't know how those loans work anyway and I don't think my mom does either. I have an appointment with my college's financial aid office Monday to ask for more help but my main question here is... How can I take student loans out for myself? If my family can't do it, and I missed deadlines for my community colleges How is it possible for me to afford college by taking my own student loans out?

All of my credit cards were maxed and I was living month to month. It got to a point where I couldnt make the payments on my credit cards. In the end all of them got charged off, some went to collections and some never got sold and were written off as a bad debt. Over the past year Ive been rebuilding my financial health and have somewhat gotten back on track. Of the accounts that went to collections Ive settled them all with a pay for delete so they will be getting removed from my credit report. That leaves me with 5 accounts that were never sold to collections. All charged off around 5/2018 Wells Fargo $1400 Discover $1100 Citi Bank $800 Chase $800 Capital One $1000 Whats the best way to tackle these? The reasons Im trying to better my credit are: 1) I hope to buy a house in the near future within the next 2 years. 2) Im currently a Cybersecurity Analyst and for me to move up I will have to undergo a credit check. Over the past year Ive had a secured credit card through Navy Fed and kept the balance low and used it properly. As well as a car loan thats been paid on time. I even have a credit builder loan through money lion Ive been doing as well to build my credit history back up. So these charges offs are the last hurdle in rebuilding my credit."
60,cybersecurity,personalfinance,A Personal Finance Guide to Cybersecurity,1,f6krfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/f6krfg/a_personal_finance_guide_to_cybersecurity/,2020-02-20 11:56:24,"Cybersecurity is a critical component of financial security, but rarely discussed in personal finance circles. Note that cybersecurity practitioners disagree over best practices for personal cybersecurity. This is my perspective, as I have some expertise in the area. This guide was posted to r/fatFIRE as part of my ongoing Fat Guide series. As a member of r/personalfinance, you likely have a little bit more money and better credit than the average person, and so are a particularly juicy target for attackers. This guide is written with the intent of preventing attacks from strangers and people you know. Obviously, more skilled attackers who are targeting you specifically will get you eventually, so we wont cover that. Good cybersecurity protection consists of prevention, so you dont get owned, and monitoring, so you know when youre owned and can take action to remediate the damage. A common method for attacks is that a websites database gets compromised and your information is stolen, which could be passwords or credit card info. This information is then used to harm you. You can check haveibeenpwned.com to see if your email is known to be compromised. You should move forward with the assumption that your information is out there, as that mindset will help you the most. **Passwords** One of the reasons email/password credentials are so valuable to attackers is that most people reuse the same passwords for everything. Ideally, getting my Reddit email/password combo would only allow a malicious insurance broker to post about the benefits of whole life insurance on r/personalfinance, which would be a travesty but not disastrous. However, many people reuse passwords so stealing my reddit credentials would permit them to log into my bank account, email, etc. You should be using a unique, strong password for each site, but since thats hard to remember, you should use a password manager like Lastpass. Using a password manager guarantees a unique, strong password for each site. The only passwords you should keep outside of Lastpass are your lastpass password, your email(s) password, and your computer password. You may ask what happens if Lastpass or other password managers are hacked. I wont get into the technical details, but your information is generally safe even after breaches because the company doesnt hold the encryption key to your data, you do (as your password). Security experts agree that using a password manager, even one with potential vulnerabilities, is generally safer than not using one. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but it's true. Use a password manager. **2 Factor Authentication** Obviously, two factor authentication improves your situation by preventing someone from compromising your account if they only get your username/password. However, traditional 2FA methods like email or text can be phished. There are many scams where someone calls you, pretending to be your bank, and then tells you to read them the number texted to you to authenticate yourself. Meanwhile, they login or reset your password with the code and clean you out. Another method, SIM swapping, which was recently used to steal Jack Dorseys (twitter CEOs) twitter account, is where the hacker convinces your phone provider to switch your number to the attackers SIM card in their phone. You cant defend against this, so phone 2FA is never perfectly safe. The solution? Security keys, such as Yubicos Yubikeys or Googles Titan keys. These are physical devices that provide a code, and can be used for 2FA on Google, Facebook, Vanguard, Reddit, Lastpass, and many more. Unfortunately, few commercial banks support security keys including Ally (please message their customer support about this, they need to support it). Security keys cannot be compromised outside of stealing the key as they require you to have physical possession of the device. Of course, you need two of them in case you lose one or it breaks, or else youll get locked out of your accounts. With premium Lastpass, you can use security keys to protect your Lastpass passwords as well. This is a great tactic. **Protecting Root** Getting access to root means you have access to everything. In this case, root is your email because you are generally able to reset your password on other accounts from your email (I suppose your phone or pc may be as well, more on that below). My recommendation in this case is to use Gmail with the advanced protection program (requires security keys). This will make it virtually impossible for anyone to access your account but you. However, if you lose both your keys you will have to wait a few days for Google to confirm who you are so you can get back in. One of the other advantages to using security keys is that root doesnt really exist anymore on any account using them, as even if an attacker breaks into your email they cant bypass security key 2FA for other accounts. My other recommendation is to use two emails, one which you use publicly and the other privately. Use the public one for whatever: social media accounts, receiving forwarded articles from your crazy grandpa, applying to jobs, etc. The private one should be used only for your financial accounts, such as banks, brokerages, and credit cards. You can also use this email for Lastpass. You should never provide this email to anyone, ever. This will make it very hard for someone, even someone who knows you, to guess what email you use for your finances. Ideally, youd be using a separate computer, like a $200 chromebook, as the only computer/phone from which you access this email or financial accounts, but thats pretty paranoid and not necessary. Both of these Gmail accounts should use unique, strong passwords you have memorized, and not be stored in a password manager, just in case. **Protecting Other Accounts** Protecting all other accounts is straightforward: use your password manager for a password and use 2FA (preferably with a security key) wherever possible. You never know which account will give an attacker the info they need to own you, which could be your address, phone number, etc. Imagine if your spouse or mom got a Facebook message from you saying you forgot your SSN and need it right away. Many accounts, particularly financial accounts, may contain tax forms with your social security number. Most people dont realize their college account, which may have financial aid tax forms, may have this info. Protecting your SSN is really, really, hard, which leads us to **Financial Information** Frankly, protecting your SSN today is basically impossible. If you used credit before the Equifax breach, your info is probably in the wild and could be used today or 50 years from now. If you have no immediate plans to use your credit, freeze it with every major bureau. Also, set up credit monitoring so you know if anyone opens an account in your name. Unfortunately, there is not much you can do to prevent your SSN being compromised. Your SSN is everywhere, from banks, to colleges, to your employer, to your doctors/accountants/lawyers office. It is a literal disaster that will hopefully be corrected, but probably wont. Credit cards are equally challenging to protect (if not more so). You should use credit cards and not debit cards wherever possible, as it is unlikely you will successfully dispute debit card transactions. It is common for credit card info to be stolen via database hacks (do you really trust every vendor you use your card at?). Apps like Apple/Google Pay are actually even better as a result, as they use a one-time code for the transaction that cannot be used afterwards, so it doesnt matter if they are stolen. Here, I will also note that while RFID-readers reading your credit card while you walk by on the sidewalk is technically possible, there has never been a documented case of it occurring and the RFID-blocking wallet is totally unnecessary as a result. A critical component is, again, monitoring. You can typically configure text alerts for every credit card transaction. I receive a text every time any of my cards are used. This helps identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. Lastly, it is often possible with banks to set up a challenge/response for phone calls. They might have to provide you a code to authenticate themselves as your bank, or they may ask you a security question/ask for a code to authenticate you. This is very helpful at stopping social engineers from stealing your info, either by pretending to be your bank calling you or pretending to be you calling your bank. Keep in mind, though, that many security questions are awful and can be found on your facebook. So pick a weird one, like Who was your least favorite teacher in high school? **General Device Security** Device security is really fraught and challenging. From a phone perspective, you should of course use some sort of authentication (such as fingerprint, passcode, pattern), on your phone and also on each of your financial apps, so stealing your unlocked phone doesnt grant automatic access to financial accounts. Aim to only install apps from trusted sources, as multiple apps that have 10-100 million+ downloads have been demonstrated malicious. PCs are a little more challenging. Chromebooks are the safest PCs from a security perspective. If you ask me what the best antivirus is, its a chromebook. Seriously, if youre going to get a laptop for anything but gaming or video editing, get a chromebook. Despite what many laymen say, Macs arent technically more secure than Windows, but attackers are less likely to target them because they are less common. As you do sketchier things on the internet, you are more likely to get owned. For example, regular browsing on trusted sites is typically safe. Going on adult or illegal streaming websites may have malicious pop-ups or ads. Torrenting is more dangerous, and the dark web can be extremely thorny. As a result, I strongly recommend that if you want to engage in unsafe behavior (i.e. torrenting) on the internet, at least keep a separate $200 Chromebook only for all your finances, and dont access those accounts from any other device. No reason to lose tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars because you didnt want to spend $20 on a video game. As far as anti-virus goes (if you have to use something other than a Chromebook), Bitdefender is a pretty good bet, but theres a lot of good software out there. Personally, Id be wary of anything Russian or Chinese either as security software (Kaspersky) or as a device (Huawei). Chinese manufacturers are known to insert backdoors into their devices. In one particularly ironic instance, a chinese manufacturer perfectly copied an American device down to the typos in the manual, but their version had twice as many security vulnerabilities. This is one of the reasons letting Chinese manufacturers build 5G infrastructure in Europe is so worrisome. In a similar vein, public wifi is questionable. There are a lot of opportunities for attackers associated with public wifi networks. HTTPS stops many of these, but tools like sslstrip highlight some vulnerabilities. A VPN may be helpful, but most free VPNs are awful, so do as you will. **Summary** Someone before asked for a flowchart or something of the sort, so here is a concrete action plan: 1. Get at least two security keys (i.e. Yubico) 2. Set up a public and private gmail account. Your private email should not be linked in ANY way to your public email and should be given to no one. 3. Turn on advanced protection on both gmail accounts and link to security keys 4. Get a password manager like Lastpass. If you get Lastpass premium (recommended), add your security keys for authentication. 5. Generate new passwords using your password manager for all accounts but your emails, pc password, and your password manager itself. 6. Associate any financial accounts, such as credit cards, banks, brokerages with your private email 7. Turn on 2FA (with the security keys wherever possible) on all accounts, as well as login alerts. 8. Turn on text/email alerts for any credit card charges or bank transactions, as well as credit changes. 9. Make sure your phone is locked by some authorization measure, as well as your financial apps individually. Preferably a password. Added bonus: cops cant get a password but can force your fingerprint or face id, a current dispute in the courts. 10. Optionally freeze your credit. 11. Optionally get a cheap chromebook as the only computer on which you do financial transactions. 12. Optionally encrypt your phone and hard drives. This may seem overly paranoid for some of you, but using a password manager with security keys wherever possible, and 2FA where not, as well as Gmails advanced protection program is your best bet for protection on the web. You should configure monitoring for your accounts, SSN, and credit cards so you are aware of when they are used in real-time. There is obviously a lot more that could be covered, but the goal of this guide is not necessarily to make you impervious to attack, but rather to make you a very hard target so attackers give up and ignore you. Frankly, nothing will destroy your financial situation faster than a hacker who cleans your clock."

I realize Venmo has less cybersecurity than my bank account and decide to close my Venmo account. Is this still a security liability to my bank account? Because presumably Venmo retained information on my bank account on the off chance I want to come back. Or, as another example, suppose I have a mutual fund account linked to my bank account. If (again) I have a Venmo linked to my bank account, could a very clever hacker drain the mutual funds through my Venmo?

And between classic low growth but predictable companies like Target, Visa, Estee Lauder, Home Depot, Mcdonalds, McCormick etc. The growth of the newer cloud companies blows the other companies out the water; however, the software lifecycle worries me. Will any of these companies be around more than 3 yrs? A lot of them seem really niche too. The other companies have fewer downswings, but almost nonexistant revenue and slow stock price share growth compared to cloud companies. However, these are dominant companies that control a large market share or have monopolies in their industries. Whereas the other companies maybe control 3% of a niche market at the most. I'm younger so I need to focus more on growth, but I'm a long term investor and a lot of these cloud companies Buffett wouldn't touch.

I opened an Roth IRA earlier this year and will max out my cash contribution by the end 2019 season, so far I've been using Fidelity ETFs. After opening I called and I was advised by the Fidelity worker to put my money in aggressive positions like an SP500 index or an 85-90% (FAMRX) positions as they really don't even make a retirement fund for my age. About half my IRA funds are in FAMRX, and the other half I just started placing in other places like FTEC (Fidelity Tech Sector ETF) and FVAL (Aggressive Value ETF). I'm so far away from retirement (nor could I honestly ever really see myself retiring, but working part time doing something, I can't stand doing nothing somewhat meaningful) I don't see the harm in being this aggressive but I'd like to hear other's opinions (not aggressive enough, or too aggressive) and what would your suggestions be?"

In order to link an account, it looks like I have to literally give them my username and password for that account. They say they don't store it and it is stored with a company called Yodlee, but it's still stored somewhere (encrypted...hopefully). From my understanding, retirement accounts and investment accounts aren't insured by the FDIC like banks are and they don't have zero liability policies like credit cards do. Most are covered by SIPC insurance but that is protection against the brokerage firm failing, it is explicitly NOT protection from theft or fraud. Cybersecurity insurance policies generally only protect if the ""hack"" wasn't your fault (like leaving your username and password written on a piece of paper on your desk). You must keep your credentials private. I'd assume that giving your credentials to a 3rd party (like Personal Capital) is clearly NOT keeping your credentials private. So, in my (not really outlandish) nightmare scenario, a hacker gets access to a Personal Capital database (or Yodlee in this case I guess), finds they aren't encrypting correctly or some other storage vulnerability, gets all my credentials, steals all my money, and all of my investment account companies say ""you gave your credentials to a 3rd party so you didn't keep them private. This is your fault, we're covering nothing."" Does anyone see anything blatantly incorrect with what I'm saying? Is there some definitive info out there about this kind of scenario? I can find info about protection if an actual broker (like Fidelity or Vanguard) get hacked and I can find info about Personal Capital's security but I can't find anything specifically discussing a similar scenario to above and what happens in that case. Like I said, I'd really love to use Personal Capital so if anyone has come accross good info, please pass it along."

I'm a full time college student studying cybersecurity, I take 18 credits per semester and hope to graduate in 1.5 years at most. I have a 2014 truck that I bought and paid for in full. It is extremely reliable and have no concerns for the near future whatsoever. I work at lot. Idle hands are the devil's workshop lol. $9.25 x 15+ hours pays ever two weeks, 10% goes to 403B contribution  $100ish dollars after contribution and taxes $15.00 x 4-7 hours every two weeks, 10% goes to 403B contribution  $80 after contributions and taxes $13.00 x 15-30 hours per week,  150-300 per week I mow lawns and do landscaping for people around my neighborhood. I make about $400 per month doing this. I have a little hobby of doing some freelance writing, its very difficult for me to find clients, so I average like $40 a month doing this sometimes more. Throughout the year I pick up other little gigs working for other people I know doing manual labor work. Usually pay very reasonably and in cash. Honestly I get a little depressed when I'm not filling my time with work, so I figure, I might as well be happy and have money. So all in all, I put away basically a little over $1000 per month in income. &amp;#x200B; In terms of all my liquid cash, I have it in various savings/checking accounts. 13K in a CIT savings builder account 2.1% APY 10K in a CD 2.55% APY for 6 months, matures in November. 4K in a local banks savings account, 4% APY (this was a special rate, now only valid through the middle of this November) 3K in Robinhood, Honestly, I have no clue what I'm doing. I've broken even. I do it for fun. 3K in a fidelity IRA, I only own FAMRX. I do plan on transferring another 3K here from my other savings beore the end of the year. Then my hobby of doing Bank promotional bonus comes in here, 1.5K in a Chase Checking, earned $300 for a direct deposit, can close the account for like 2 more months, Various other less significant amounts in many other accounts in order to get bonuses. This year I expect about $1.2-1.5K in bank bonuses.  $120 in my Prudential 403B, all invest in a Vanguard 500 Admiral fund. I have about $150 in visa gift card I keep forgetting to spend. My schooling is all paid for, scholarships have covered about 80% of it, the rest my family has generously agreed to pay for as long as I put effort in. In terms of my spending, its basically minimal, pretty much 100-200 of my own personal stuff a month from going out with buddies. When ever we go out I pay the bills using my credit cards and get the cashback because my friends do not have credit cards. They then reimburse me with cash. Also I have not been in a relationship so, unlike many people my age, I'm not hemorrhaging money on dates and what not. I guess my goals are very general basically I want ""fuck you money"". I feel like I really not old enough to really have a grasp on a specific number, except as much as possible. An aspiration I have is to one day to buy rental properties. My home life is very stable, my family and I get along fantastically. I would like to peruse a career with the federal government as an agent, in literally any capacity. After that I would like to hopefully go through the gov/corporate revolving door and get a nice job at a defense firm or somewhere. I may even consider joining the armed forces after college if I do not get any positions I am happy with to get a security clearance."

I am 25, Cybersecurity Analyst, married, make around $50,000-$60,000 a year, $1,000 in savings currently (thanks to this awesome SubReddit we are working on Emergency Fund!) and I have zero student loan debt. I have a low interest credit card and I pay that bad boy off every month easy if I even use it. Never have carried a balance in my two years of having it. We live within our means and always are true to what we budget for. My wife however is in year 3 of Med School and we had to take full loans out for her first 3 semesters. VERY expensive, but obviously incredibly proud she is pursuing her dream as a Pediatric Surgeon. All in all, the interest rates will be 6%-8% and above when we start aggressively paying these off once she completes med school and goes into residency. I expect her income to be between $35,000-$50,000 and expect student loan debt between $150-$200k in the hole here (YIKES!). I have managed to cover ALL expenses outside of just accepting the loan amount for her tuition. We have given over $20k back each semester since her first 3. Do you guys have any tips for how I can be proactive now in order to aggressively go after our student loan debt when she graduates? We are eager to take this debt by the reigns and OWN it with a plan. Thanks so much for your support guys!"

Current situation: Savings/Emergency fund: 10k 401k: 22k Student Loan Debt: 32k Car loan: 15k My car is worth about as much as I owe, so it wouldnt be too difficult to get out of, but would like to keep it if possible (dont know about import fees). Not sure what I should do with my 401k, and if this is even a situation which would make better sense to cash out and pay down my student loans to avoid the 1.3% - at the current exchange Id be paying almost 10k additional over the course of the loan. Obviously, these are *not* questions I need immediate answers to. All of this will be a gradual process, but Im just thinking ahead and trying to do some forecasting. I'm sure there's even a lot I haven't even considered yet. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"

I work in a mid-level position but whenever I recommend anything that benefits the employees to upper management, the requests are ignored. Basically terrible management and unreachable deadlines. My main question is, is it okay to leave a job making this much money and go jobless without any income for any amount of time? I continuously hear that having gaps in your experience is a terrible idea and it's always important to have a job lined up but I don't think I can handle another week at this very shitty company. Do gaps make you less marketable to other companies? Here's some background: Emergency Savings - $15K I have a car with a monthly payment of $400 Rent is 800 per month. Other Misc expenses - 450 per month. I have money in both a 401K and Roth IRA that I do not want to touch. Could I live peacefully for a few weeks while I find a job? Or should I stick it out until I have another one lined up? Any advice is greatly appreciated as this is super stressful for me.

I've been using it liberally for qualified education expenses. I'm an IT major, and as I understand it, the IRS explicitly lists ""computer technology, related equipment, and/or related services"" as a qualified expense. So last year I bought myself a nice reasonable \~$600 laptop and reimbursed myself with the 529 funds tax-free. Since I'm an IT major, I think it would be nice to have a few separate systems--at least one Windows based, one Mac, and one Linux, as well as a home lab so I can get hands-on with Cisco switching, etc. This would all cost thousands of dollars, but it truly and genuinely would help me learn and understand my craft as I continue to study IT. This is all directly related to my coursework as I study networks, cybersecurity, operating systems, data management, etc. Is there anything I have to worry about by doing this, or any chance the IRS might frown upon such a large expenditure of computer equipment? Is there an upper limit on what the IRS would reasonably considered a qualified expense for computer equipment? Here is what the IRS says about computer equipment: &amp;#x200B; &gt;Q. Can I make withdrawals from my 529 plan for the costs of computer technology or equipment? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A. A qualified, nontaxable distribution from a 529 plan includes the cost of the purchase of any computer technology, related equipment and/or related services such as Internet access.

Long story short, I'm a 28 yo man who never really went to school or obtained any real marketable skills throughout my entire life besides some management experience, shipping and receiving, and a lot of other other non-professional skills that's don't really polish up a resume nicely. Well, I did a lot of growing up this past year after spending my 20s smoking marijuana and playing video games and realized that if I ever want to do anything with my life or retire then I need to buckle down and make myself relevant and marketable in the economy. This has been really stressful for me since I suddenly feel very responsible and realized that I burned away a lot of my early adulthood dicking around when I should have been manifesting skills and acquiring an education. It's especially disheartening to see a lot of my peers already in prestigious positions at their job on their way to retirement/making a lot of money when I'm working an inbounding job barely making 38k a year. So i bit the bullet and registered for some summer classes at a local community college and I'm going to get into some sort of CIT undergrad. Right now my declared major is cybersecurity, but I think I want to steer more towards software development. I'm not going to lie, I've been looking into other unconventional methods of becoming successful like entrepreneurship or ecommerce, dropshipping, etc.. And I've read alot of accounts on Reddit of people who never went to school and became very successful by just educating themselves on the internet on how to run a business or start dropshipping, etc.. So I don't know if I should spend my time pursuing this avenue instead of 4 to 5 years of schooling in the future. I don't know why I'm making this post. Looking for validation? Advice? I don't know. I'm at crossroad in my life and I feel so conflicted on what I should do. Plus, all this stress of working the 9-5 grind with no real end in sight has been really wearing me down. I just wish I had the free time to pursue an education without having to worry about paying the bills and taking care of financial obligations. Plus, I'm going to a father soon (which is also a driving factor behind my college decision). I know now why everyone says go to college after high school.

I could do this for (to be equal) 12-16 years, keep getting pay raises, invest in 401k, Roth IRA, etc. &amp;#x200B; So normally I would say cybersecurity has a lot more potential for work and higher pay, but honestly officer pay isn't bad at all (starting $80k/year as O1E) where my cybersecurity would start initially in the $60-maybe $70k/year range. I'm sure eventually cybrsecurity would pay more than the Air Force, but that's several years down the road. &amp;#x200B; The thing that's getting me is the Officer retirement. If, after 12-16 years I'm getting $40k/ year, this is the equivelant of having saved $650,000 dollars and getting 6% interest on it. That's a lot! I could invest for my 12-16 years into my Roth IRA and in the end get my $40k/year PLUS what my investments get me plus work a part time job if I want. On the civilian side, I would have to save $650,000 just to match the annual retirement of $40k/year, and that will fluctuate with the market. &amp;#x200B; Am I missing something here? I think quality of life would be better civilian side, and like I mentioned I think in the end there is more money in cybersecurity, but with that retirement the Air Force seems really hard to beat. &amp;#x200B; Can anyone please give their advice, and maybe point me to some calculators I may not be aware of or some other factor I'm not considering? &amp;#x200B; Thank you and sorry if this is all over the place!"

Realistically, I can't afford to go to college, my only hope are the scholarship's and grants that I have been applying for, and I haven't been accepted for any of them. My current job prospects are transferring to the Domino's in my college town. I was recently called back for a cybersecurity internship that I recently applied to and they said they want to move forward and I should expect an email next week, but it's 100 miles round trip everyday if I do decide to go through with it, but this will also make it impossible for me to secure a housing situation before or during the summer and obtaining a job near the university.

My employer is desperate for younger employees so they set up a corporate account to help pay for people to go back to school. I'm the first to actually make use of this, so my tuition is paid for by the company. I'm currently attending a local community college for an Associates in Cybersecurity, which I would like to turn into a 4 year degree. However, there are some issues with this. I'm a full-time employee and a full-time student. I have to be a full-time employee on the books in order to use the corporate account. My current schedule effectively locks out 3 days of the week for solely work, as I'm at the office from 8:00am to 6:30pm. This locks me into only attending night classes on the other two days, as there are no day classes offered which fit. This also poses problems with rescheduling tests or attending in-person exams, as the instructors often schedule things during my work days. My workload ranges from mundane to mentally exhausting, depending on how my boss and the clients feel that day. We are involved in healthcare auditing, and my duties consist of secretarial work, account management (medical coders at hospitals), travel accomadations for a sister company, along with other tasks which are randomly assigned. Some days I have time to touch my classwork, some days my brain is fried by 5pm. Suffice to say, it's not the best enviornment for a full-time student. I'm concerned that over a long period of time, the schedule may have an adverse effect on my health and relationships with others. Now onto the financial question. Right now my spouse and I make a little under 90k before taxes. If I stopped working to attend school full-time, it would be 65k before tax. Is that ""too much"" to qualify for financial aid? I'm an older student (26), and I would greatly prefer studying full-time, rather than pulling this double full-time gig *or* working full time while progressing toward my degree at a snail's part-time pace. My experience with FAFSA has been lackluster, as (back when I initially tried college) my parents were considered just middle class enough to get 0 help. I'm worried that I'll receive the same answer if I go that route again. I'll probably talk to my boss to see if they can accomodate some changes (doubtful), but I'm still curious to hear from anyone who might have experience with student loans and/or federal aid."

I know that surprise expenses can come up and I think $1.1k a month is enough but maybe I'm underestimating the other, non-obvious costs. With my car and mainly student loans I am currently about $33,000 in debt :x. I'm concerned that this will interfere with our budget once I graduate. My field will be in IT and I've already been getting some experience and last summer worked in a job where I was paid $15 an hour.

I am an eighteen-year-old who just graduated high school. In September I left to go to college for the first time and quickly realized the school I had to choose was not for me. Most of those around me agreed and it created a very negative environment and I spent most of my time smoking weed (which I regret). On top of that, I had a severe concussion causing me to not be able to attend classes for multiple weeks carrying through Thanksgiving break. The concussion greatly affected my already existing depression/anxiety, and I decided since there were only two weeks left in the semester that it would be best to withdraw from classes and head home to recover. The school offers a service where, due to my medical issues, I can come back next semester and just retake the classes again. The issue is that my family has severe financial struggles. The cost of going back next semester is roughly 9k and on top of that, we have to move so my dad will already be struggling for money (single parent). This combined with my previous discontent for the school has made me think it would be best to take next semester off to get a job and apply to the local state school for next fall where tuition is almost 2k per year (est with financial aid). This is where the need for advice comes in. To be honest, I, like most other 18-year-olds, have no clue if any of the decisions I'm making are correct, or are good for me in the long run. My area of interest is tech/cybersecurity and I already have two summers worth of experience as an IT intern, but looking for internships next semester all require current college enrollment or more qualifications than I have. Should I try to secure an internship in my field of interest or is it best to get any job I can find to help ease the financial burden on my parents? Or should I just take students loans and go back to the school I disliked for the rest of the year? Another idea I had if I was unable to get the internship was to try studying up on my own and earning an A+ certificate. I will give any additional information requested and am extremely open to advice. Thank you"

I am tied between leaving my 401k with my employer and rolling it over to my traditional IRA and converting to the Roth. I currently live in NY and am moving to Texas, thus my idea of rolling over in Texas to avoid NY income taxes. Once in the Roth I would throw it in VTI and a Vanguard Value etf.

I came home and got a new job that pays pretty well ($45k/year). I work five hour days, with plenty of free time to study and finish my degree at work. I have a great job and boss, but I absolutely HATE the place that I live (the state). I have about $10,000 in savings, and will finish my online degree soon in Cybersecurity. For the last six months I really want to move back to China or Vietnam to live, then return home and move somewhere else. I have no debts and a nice car. Obviously it's not a financially smart decision, but is it worth quitting a job to be happy for six months? I don't think I'll burn through more than $5,000 in China.

It's been two years since then, and so far I've purchased a relatively nice car (I was driving a ""totaled"" car beforehand that probably would have guaranteed my death in most potential accidents), done a little bit of traveling, and paid for the 2 years of classes that I took at a local college. Now I'm at a much larger and more respected 4-year institution where I'm working on a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, and I hope to graduate in 2020. While I do have a basic plan of what I'm doing with my money (graduate college debt free and enter the workforce), I feel like I could be more specific and/or aggressive in my financial approach. &amp;#x200B; I've ran the numbers and according to my conservative estimate I'll be spending around $20,000 (potentially up to $25,000) a year on a mixture of housing/tuition/living costs/miscellaneous expenses until I graduate. Assuming that I graduate on time in two years I will have $50,000 leftover, give or take. As of right now that $50,000 is in an idle savings account, and I think that I could be doing something better with the money. &amp;#x200B; I guess what I'm trying to say is that I need help figuring out what to do with this excess money that is currently acting as nothing more than a depreciating safety net. I've dabbled in cryptocurrency and stocks but since then I've reevaluated my stance on the type of lifestyle I'm trying to build and personally I don't trust myself with some of the extremely High Risk : High Reward investment types. Right now, I'd rather work towards something that I could slowly work build value from and continue contributing towards with the eventual goal being retirement, college for potential children, emergency medical expenses, purchasing a home, or even just financial peace of mind."

I lack confidence, and sort of awkward in the sense of being quiet around people, and keeping to myself. People at work tell me to loosen up, but it's just the way I am. I think not having a dad/parents that were really part of my life affected me. No one really gave me life advice or showed me how to be a man. So what I did was indulge myself with video games, playing 16+ hours from 5-19 years old. Sometimes almost all day, not eating much, etc. I'm 22 years old working a construction job (not something I want to do forever). Was on and off with school. Spent two years learning automotive and accounting, they turned out not being for me. Going to school this fall, taking IT classes for the first time and a math class. I have always been intrigued with computers, learning how to fix them, etc. So I feel like I'll give IT a shot this semester, then move into cybersecurity. Because at this point I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I just want to find something I enjoy and can be passionate about. It would be nice to have a good career and make a decent amount of money so I'm not stressed out like how I see my mom. She wanted me to co-sign on the mortgage. She doesn't even talk to me now, like really? Hopefully, I can do something about moving forward with my life so I can afford therapy or something. My sister is turning 30 this year. still lives at home. Doesn't pay rent.. and it feels like if I don't figure something out, I'll be like her. On top of that, I found out my father is homeless.. he was never really there in my life and it's hard to feel anything but it makes me wonder if I'll be homeless one day too. Would be nice to have my own place, learn how to be financially smart about owning a house, etc and actually be an independent adult. Should I see how IT classes go for me? Or Just join the military? I was thinking Air Force, but then I heard they give you a list of the jobs your qualify for, and they randomly pick want is available. Which sort of sucks, because I would like to do something IT/cyber security related. So I may look more into the Navy since my recuiter says he can gurantee me a job, he been calling me every week so far.

109,cybersecurity,personalfinance,Moving to the UK from the US this year. My situation is a little complex and I want to make sure I have considered everything before accepting the position.,7,8xrozs,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8xrozs/moving_to_the_uk_from_the_us_this_year_my/,2018-07-11 03:59:52,"There is a good possibility that I will be moving to the UK from the US with my family in the next 3 months. I've decided to use a throwaway account, since anyone that knows me well would be able to identify me from the following information. I live with my wife and my toddler daughter. I'll start by writing out the series of events that led me to current situation. I work for a US company that mainly deals with US defense contracts. I have worked for this company for about 6 years in a few different positions. The position I held before my current position led me to travel to many domestic and international sites, each usually for about a month at a time. During this travel, I worked in the UK for about a month. I developed a good working relationship with the site manager there, and had conversations with him about the possibility of me working abroad if the opportunity was ever presented. Last year (about a year after I had worked with him) he messaged me about a position opening up at his location (with the same company I currently work for). While the position (maintenance technician) is technically a ""lower"" position than I have now (cybersecurity), it would give me a different perspective of the same projects I currently work, and possibly open up higher paying employment opportunities within my company. In September of 2017, I applied for the position via our internal job posting site. Within a day or two of submitting my application I was called to HR to further discuss. With my current knowledge, experience, and skill-set, HR said that they and the hiring managers were thrilled that I applied and began asking about how early I would be able to transition from my current job to the new position. For a few weeks, there was continued communication about the job, including typical base pay rate, international relocation packages, etc. During one of our last meetings, they all but said that I was the target for the job and they needed to get some paperwork together for an offer. Following these conversations, HR essentially went radio silent on me. Every couple weeks I would check back in to see where we were in the process. Each time, they basically explained that while they had posted the position, the position was not technically open yet. They said they were working to get some paperwork filed to get the position opened, and as soon as they had those details, we could progress with the hiring process. I told them that while I could be patient if given an estimated time frame for the move, I could not wait indefinitely. We currently live in a town home that we own outright. We have outgrown our current home and were starting to look for homes in the area to purchase. After a month or two of no progressions, I essentially wrote the position off and my wife and I began the process of searching for homes. In late December of 2017, we purchased a new larger car (this will be brought up later on). Fast forward to May of this year, I was contacted by the hiring manager and his manager. They asked if I was still interested in the position. While I had all but forgotten about the job, I told them I would be interested in what they had to offer. After speaking with them and talking about it with my wife, we decided that if the offer was right, this would be a good opportunity for our family. The job would be a 2 year contract with the option to extend if we wanted to. During talks with both managers, they laid out to me what their ""standard"" benefits package would be. None of this was an official offer, so I am exercising caution until presented with a contract. Here is the breakdown of what they said they would basically offer. **Benefits package** * Hourly rate that would amount to about $35,000 more a year than I currently make, paid in USD. * They stated that the company will pay 100% of my British taxes owed, as well as cover all costs to prepare and file both my British and US taxes. * $5000/yr reimbursable vacation allowance. * 100% coverage of my health insurance, while partially subsidizing my wife and daughter's coverage. * Up to $10,000 for relocation to the UK, as well as $10,000 for relocation home. * One month of living arrangements, rental car, and per diem to allow us to find a home and car when we get there. There might be a few things I am leaving off of the benefits package, since it was a verbal explanation without anything in writing. I have been in constant communication with the hiring manager since talks resumed a little over a month ago. They have said they would like to have me in the UK by early September. Last week, the manager contacted my boss and asked how early I could transition from my current position to my new position, and yesterday the hiring manager emailed me that I should expect to receive an offer from HR within the next week. For anyone that has stuck with me this far, thank you. I know it was a lot of information, but I feel that most if not all of it was relevant to my questions and concerns. With an offer coming my way any day now, I want to make sure I have all my questions and possible counter-offer options ready to go. Here are the things I know of that I need to make sure are in my offer from HR **Offer Clarification items** * **Moving expenses:** I need to determine if the $10,000 for moving expenses are reimbursed to me, or if I am simply given a one time bonus to use as I wish. After talking with some people here at work who have had experience with this sort of thing, they all but guarantee that it will be given to me as a lump sum. If this is the case, we will probably sell our furniture and large items, and only travel with the bare essentials. I need to know if that amount will be grossed up so that I receive the full amount after taxes, or if it will be taxed, leaving me with less. * **Taxes:** I need to make sure that they do, in fact, pay all of my British taxes, and that this is in writing before signing anything. I have been doing some research, and from my own investigation, it looks like the amount I would owe for US taxes would be very little or possibly nothing using the Foreign Tax Credit. I am in no way well versed in international tax dealings, so I have thought about consulting with a tax lawyer about this. * **Healthcare:** This is one item I'm most unsure of. I know in the UK, they have the NHS, so I'm not sure if we would be using that, or if we would use private services. I don't go to the doctor often, but I don't want to overlook something, leaving us vulnerable if an expensive health event were to occur while we are there. * **Negotiation:** During some of these talks, the hiring manager and HR have mentioned how great it would be to have me there, as I would be able to do some of the computer/technical work out there without needing to send someone from the US. If this is the case, I think I should be compensated for the additional work. While their initial ""offer"" is more than enough to cover the cost of living increase while allowing us to save more, I plan on asking for more. I want to make sure I have my reasons for asking for more money ready to go so that it doesn't just seem like I'm blindly asking for more money. I also plan on asking for some sort of compensation for our car situation. If we chose to sell our car, we would definitely lose money as the car we purchased was new. If we chose to bring it with us, it looks like the cost to move and the import taxes would be more than the amount we would lose by selling it. We don't plan on selling it, but rather either storing it in a storage facility, or at our inlaws in the garage. While I know this isn't necessarily their ""problem"", we would have never purchased the car if we thought an international move was in our near future. Am I out of line to ask for compensation for my cost to store and insure it while we are away? **Other questions/concerns** * **Wife's employment options:** I don't know how the visa for my wife would work. Would she be able to be employed while she is over there? She is currently going back to school with hopes of being a nurse. After this summer semester, she will have all of her classes completed to start applying for nursing school. We have talked about this in depth and she is comfortable putting her schooling on hold while we are away. * **Home rental:** We plan on renting out our home while we are away. We live in a desirable downtown area and would not have trouble finding a renter almost immediately after posting the home. After paying the HOA fees, property management fees, and setting aside money to cover the property taxes, I estimate we can pull in an extra $1300 a month at least. How would this be taxed? Would those earnings be subject to the British taxes as well? * **Currency exchange:** I will be paid in USD, but will most likely have to pay for most of our expenses in GBP. What is the best way to regularly exchange money? Is this a variable that I can use to ask for a higher pay when negotiating? I know that was a lot of information, but I want to try to have all our bases covered when they make me my offer. Is there something I'm forgetting/overlooking? Any answers, suggestions, and overall advice would be greatly appreciated. "

Here's a little bit of background: We're both in our 20's and recently married. My wife and I were financially independent when we met. We each had our own home, good jobs, etc. I recently landed my dream job: a six-figure, work from home cybersecurity gig. The job is great, but the only requirement is that we will eventually have to be local for some occasional on site work/consulting. The job, which is in NC, has been letting me work from the west coast until we get all of our resources in place to move. I recently sold my house and am wondering if the wife should sell hers. She is pretty intent on keeping it as a rental property as her parents kept their first house and have pretty much paid it off by keeping it as a rental. The house payment with insurance/taxes is $875/month and we expect to pay water at ~$100/mo. We could reasonably expect $1250-1300 on the house. So, best case scenario is $325/mo profit. Worst case is $975/mo loss without considering rental upkeep/maintenance. She owes about $135k right now and could get around $165k, in my opinion. My main concerns are the cost of maintenance, especially from across the country. We will have to pay someone to do all of the maintenance. It's also more difficult to list and show the property if the time ever comes. My short term concern is that she's leaving a pretty decent job (~50k/year), which will be netting us at a 30k loss (I gained 20k with new role) in salaries for the short term. She's currently in property management and wants to go into real estate, so it will take a couple of months to get her license. Because of this, we will be a little cash strapped until she finds work. We're also not expecting 50k in her first year, but even at 30k, we would be pretty comfortable. I currently max my 401k and both her/my Roth IRA. We also have some savings in case of an emergency. We would net positive monthly without the house being considered, but barely (~$500/mo). So, if for some reason we couldn't rent the place our savings would take a hit or I'd have to pull back on 401k contributions temporarily. Selling the house, we could invest the ~17k-20k and use it for an eventual down payment. However, renting also has its benefits, I'm just unsure if they outweigh the risks. I appreciate the help"

Im 25 living in Florida, have been attending college on-and-off for 5 years due to personal struggles and helping out my parents who were in poor health. Their health improved greatly, and I just recently moved out, and now I really want to be able to focus on school and finish off my B.S. in Cybersecurity. Ive worked full time+ for the last 7 years and am trying to figure out a way to be able to cut my work hours dramatically in order to focus on school/certifications and take a heavier course load. I dont mind creating manageable debt, I believe that once I find employment in my field I will be able to pay off my debts with relative ease. My current financial situation: **Income/Savings:** * $13.50/hour income, very flexible hours * $3,000 in savings * $2,070 in Pell Grant per semester for upcoming Fall/Spring/Summer semesters, probably more for the 2020 school year * $0-x,xxx in scholarships/other grants if/when awarded **Expenses/Loans:** * $525 monthly rent + all utilities * $220 monthly car * $92 monthly insurance * $86 monthly phone * $37 other monthly subscriptions * $80 monthly gas * ~$400 monthly food/entertainment(this can be cut down a bit) * ~$9,000 in tuition/books left to complete my degree, should be finished Summer 2020 * $5,000 left to pay on auto loan(1.8% interest rate if I remember correctly) * $9,200 in deferred student loans, I know I am paying some % interest on these but I do not have the loan structure in front of me Ideally I would work 2 days/20 hours a week, but realistically I know Ill probably have to do 3/30. 30 hours a week puts me at ~$1,375 take home monthly, which puts me at around a $100/month deficit before college expenses are calculated. The next three semesters I plan on taking 15 classes which will cost ~$6,000, so the Pell Grant I received will cover that, and hopefully future grants cover future tuition. There is obviously risk involved in creating any kind of debt, but is it feasible for me to be able to do this? Im single and see no kids/large purchases any time in the foreseeable future, I just want to be able to finally focus on school, get in to my industry and get the hell out of food service. My credit scores are 706 via Transunion and 655 via Equifax, are there options available for me to be able to work fewer hours that arent incredibly expensive and risky? Am I just a baby who needs to suck it up and work harder? I feel like being able to succeed in school and get in to my career field quicker is worth taking out loans, but I do not know what my options are or if the risks involved outweigh the benefits.

Recently, Ive been putting a lot of thought into planning for my future, saving, and really understanding the fundamentals of having a secure foundation to build on for my adult life. I have already started budgeting and planning out my spending, but one thing I really need help with is my 401k, let me explain the situation. I currently work for Wawa, and for a 19 year old with no college degree, they pay very well. They are also extremely flexible with hours, and they reimburse me for the college courses I take. The good pay, college reimbursement, and extremely flexible hours are leading me to stay with this job probably for at least the next 2 years, if not a little bit longer. My question is, should I begin putting money into my 401k now while I still work here, or do I wait until I transition into a long term career after college. Im not familiar with how a 401k works in any way, other than the basics (I deposit a certain % of each check into it, Wawa matches up to 4.5% of that). How do 401ks work? If I start depositing into this one now, will I have to withdraw it all when I leave the company for my real career when I graduate, or does my 401k just get transitioned from job to job because its my account? Excuse me if I sound extremely uneducated, Im a Cybersecurity major, so Ive taken basically 1 finance class in my sophomore year of high school, and they did not cover anything like this. Any help explaining how 401ks work and what would be best to do now would be extremely helpful. Thanks for the help. TL;DR Should i start depositing in my 401k now, despite leaving this company in a few years, or should I wait until I actually start my career? Why?"
113,cybersecurity,personalfinance,Mo Money Mo Problems? I seriously don't know what to do with it - help,2,8dyat3,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8dyat3/mo_money_mo_problems_i_seriously_dont_know_what/,2018-04-22 06:16:53,"**Short backstory: 39 years old, and I'm concerned about not only righting my retirement ship, but also putting my money to work for me and settling down. Almost got completely wiped out between 2008 and 2017 between recession and a serious injury. As late as last July, I was down to $3,000 in savings and 1 401k with about 20 grand in it. But I used my injured time wisely, upped my knowledge game, and elevated myself from small town IT generalist to big city enterprise cybersecurity architect.** As above, last July I was in rural Oregon, just getting healthy enough to work again, had 3 grand left in the bank and was about to tap into my very last retirement fund, a 401k from my last job which had a salary of 60 grand. Then I picked up a job offer in Seattle that gave me a base salary of $175,000 with ""other"" comp (stock, bonuses, etc.) that brought the total comp up to about $250,000. There was a mid 5-figures signing bonus, too. Shortly thereafter, another company approached me and ultimately wooed me with a consultant's package of $165,000 per year that I could do on my own time after-hours so as to not interfere with my full time job. Fast forward to today, and I've got $120,000 sitting in the bank. Because I didn't need both incomes at the tail end of last year, I set my 401k to what I needed to hit the $18,000 yearly limit before end of year last year, and to keep contributing max until I hit my 18K max this year, at which point I 0'd out the contribution for the year. My company match isn't great. I'm concerned about my retirement (my Fidelity score is 21, which seems terrible), which is why I'm maxing out my 401k limits even though my company doesn't match nearly to that level. I make far too much to qualify for Roth IRAs, and I've grave concerns of us being near the top of the stock market - something I'm highly sensitive to as I basically got wiped out in the last recession when I had to tap into it low in order to pay medical bills - so I haven't put anything into a trading account. I know I'm lagging behind what I'm supposed to have for my age (plus, the robots are coming, so I don't know if I've got 25 years of being marketable left). I have no debt - I paid off my student loans with my first stock award, I pay my credit cards off in full every month, and my car is paid for and is only 5 years old, so it's got a lot of life left in it. I don't own a home, and that bothers me, but I don't want to buy in Seattle because, frankly, while I love my work, I don't particularly like this city (and another issue, coming up next). I'm in a long-term relationship of 7 years. She's an out of work project manager (non-technical). She hates Seattle with a passion. We're talking making a kid. She wants to move to LA both because of the area as well as job opportunities, and both my full time job and my consulting gig are OK with me moving if I want. We've also discussed Colorado. I'll have to give up one of the jobs when we have a child, however. I grew up in an absentee parenting household, and won't do that to my own kid. I don't have anybody to turn to for advice. I'm the only one in my family that makes much more than minimum wage, and my parents were low-skill workers who scraped by and worked till the day they died - penniless. I don't want that for my kid. Her family is Country with a capital C, so they are of no useful help with advice. I thought more money meant things would be simpler, but they all just seem way more complex because it's got me thinking about the future, whereas in my previous life stage, I was just concerned with keeping afloat in the present. I've thought about talking to Edward Jones or Fidelity or Schwab or something and hiring a financial consultant, but it doesn't really feel like I'm earning quite so much that that's well-served for me, just because I'm having to play catch up from basically having almost nothing less than a year ago and I'm already middle aged. It just seems like most people my age are further progressed, even if I appear to be rubber banding and catching up fast. Plus, I keep reading that I shouldn't ""need"" something like that both because there are resources I can leverage as well as the fact that I don't have a million dollars laying around. Anyone have any big picture roadmaps as to what I should do?"

I am an Army National Guard officer, I have been in the service for almost 15 years both active and reserve. I am currently on full-time orders (AGR) that expire early next year. So I need to start planning my transition back to the civilian job market. 2- I have an MBA and an MS in Info Sys/Cyber Security. I have my CCNA, Sec+, sitting for CISSP in July, and GSEC (SANS 401) in May. 3- I have been running a cybersecurity auditing program for the Army National Guard in my state for the last 2 years (I'll have 3 years total experience in the field when my orders end) Before this I was a security director (physical) for a very large retailer -don't want to do that again. And I owned a small retail chain of multiple stores. So.... lots of experience managing people, programs, and outcomes. Bottom line - I have no corporate IT experience but I want to leverage all my experience to land a good role in that domain. Preferably an IT security manager, VP, etc. Any IT folks wanna weigh in on this situation? Thanks so much "

Eventually he me asked to apply for an entry level position, I interviewed and got the position however a week later the supervisor let me know I won't really advance without a degree or may be stuck in the same position for atleast 2+ years before advancement due to the pure fact I have no degree/certificate.

All in all, The military is paying me **$84k** per year, after taxes. I also get occasional bonuses for food and hotels, when I need to travel, and free travel, which I won't include. According to a calculator I found online, to make **84k** after-tax I'd have to make **115k** per year, which is an insane amount of money that I doubt I'd be able to make, even if I get into cybersecurity which is my plan. My job is honestly not hard, I get lots of time to travel, and I'm at no risk of death so I could just use this opportunity to its fullest. I just want to make sure there's not something I'm missing about the outside world. The compensation I'm getting now seems too good to be true."

118,cybersecurity,personalfinance,Currently an Intern at a tech company making 10 dollars an hour. My manager is requiring me to train all the new Junior Engineers who are all salary paid.,27,7um1ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7um1ip/currently_an_intern_at_a_tech_company_making_10/,2018-02-02 08:09:37,"As the title says. I've been working at a tech company since May 2017 and a lot of the stuff we work on is somewhat complicated. I've been interning here for all that time, getting paid $10.50 an hour. I've been recently put on big projects from one of our bigger clients and I've been doing a hefty amount of work required to finish these projects. My name also has been published on some of the projects as a leader working on these projects. My problem is that the company went on a recent hiring spree and hired some new ""Junior"" level engineers. I asked my boss about moving up to an engineer position full time during thanksgiving week last year and he told me that I would have to be a ""full time intern"" for a couple months before moving into the engineering position. Sadly, this intern pay is not paying my bills. And now that I am required to train junior engineers, it has made me much more upset with life. I am working as a ""full time"" intern at the moment for a company that is located about an hour away from me. Here is a format of what my bills look like. Gas - 160 dollars a month. (This is because the commute from my house to work is through the DMV and about 2 hours round trip each day.) Car insurance + Payment - 250 a month. Rent - 200 a month (This is low because I'm living with parents and I'm required to contribute by paying one bill for the house) Credit card bill - 150 a month (Misc. Expenses like eating out, Netflix, entertainment etc.) Unfortunately, My paycheck every month does not cover this but I went to school for a job in this field and I feel like I am stuck doing this until my indefinite promotion. I have resorted to bartending on weekends as extra income but it is killer as I am also a full-time student as well. (All my classes are online). After calculating my bills, I could drop this internship and go to bartending part-time and earn more. (Tips tended to earn me much more a month, usually 25 an hour average) My question to you all is, should I stop this internship for my sanity and finish school? Should I talk to my manager again? Or just keep trucking along? It has gotten to the point where I dread waking up every morning to the point of being majorly depressed. I want to enjoy life and do some fun stuff while I'm young, but I don't want to disappoint the people around me by leaving a job that has the potential of helping me in the long run. Some details about myself: 21 and in college, and financial aid is paying for my college as well as a scholarship I obtained for good academic status. I still have 3 semesters remaining until completion. Edit: Just for context, I also have finished community college and obtained an associates degree in cybersecurity. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's at a local university. "

Sorry in advance for the novel but my wife and I have a bit of a predicament I could really use some help with. Situation  My wife and I (29M/29F) have been saving up the past few years for a home and recently purchased one 3 weeks ago. Were over the moon with the decision and have been enjoying nights at home painting and making small tweaks to the house. At the same time, a few months ago my wifes boss approached her about the idea of going to grad school. The company offered to pay for it 100%. She applied for her MA in Cybersecurity and was accepted into one of the top programs in the area. Everything is awesome! The purchase was well within our comfort zone (in terms of monthly payment), but between the down payment and closing costs, we spent majority of our cash. We have roughly 5k liquid as an emergency fund and wed like to keep that for any housing emergencies. Finally, the predicament - My wife was under the impression that her work was covering the cost of tuition up front. She had a meeting yesterday and learned that they would still cover the cost 100% - but they would need us to pay up front and they would reimburse us once she passed the class. This means (after starting a payment plan) we would need to make 3 payments of $4,500 each month (starting January 21) and we wouldnt be reimbursed until April. From a cash perspective, we could pay $2000 a month on this (based on our remaining income after all expenses) but we would need to find a solution for the additional $2,500 per month. This will continue for the next 16 months. Possible Solution: We have excellent credit (although Im sure it took a hit with the house purchase), so I was thinking we could apply for a credit card with 0% APR for 18 months. Put school on the credit card and pay it off in full each time she is reimbursed. This would build up some points and allow us to manage the costs without accruing interest. Thoughts? Is there something Im not considering with this? A potential downside? We plan to be in this house for 7 years or more so a hit to our credit isnt the worst thing in the world in the short term. P.S  Borrowing the money from a relative isnt a realistic option for us and she has tried to talk to her work to change the payment schedule but its not an option either. "

IT Systems Analyst. Salary: $71,000. 1 wife. 4 kids. Mortgage: $645 (I know that sounds sweet, but the house is on a busy street in a urban, median crime rate area, but we bought it cheap and its almost 2k sq ft and 4 bdrm. Got lucky with some employee stock options from an old job and was able to put 20% down on this house in 2012.) Our debt is credit cards and medical bills only at this point. Nearly $3k in credit cards and $600 in doctors bills. I am currently going to an online university to complete my bachelors in Cybersecurity. Our issue is that we just really dont like our neighborhood and its 30 minutes from my work, 20 minutes from my parents, 35 minutes from church and no one wants to ever come all the way down here. My pay is great and I have put my withdrawal amount on my W2 since forever the amount that will get us a good refund back. Well have enough to pay off all debt and then some. When we do that, we will have freed up our budget enough to buy a house that would be in a good neighborhood but not as big. So, Im wondering if we should just go for trying to sell this house this year or wait until I finish my degree in 18 months with the POTENTIAL that Ill be making 10k+ more a year. Has anybody been in a similar situation and have advice to offer? P.S. If we do it this year, I have a very stable job situation, although nothing is ever set in stone. But I want to be closer to my work, because it would definitely save on gas and just be more convenient overall. Also, we have very little in savings currently because weve been trying to pay down the credit card debt. As it currently stands, we could probably swing a minimum of $200 in savings a month. Thats what worries me most about trying to do it this year. P.S.S. I usually get a merit increase in February. Its usually not more than 5% though."

I have no other debts outside of this mortgage but do want to pay it off asap. I have near 0% interest student loans apprx 15k owing which are taken out of my pretaxable income and only if I'm earning. There isn't currently any incentive to pay these off as no discounts are awarded. I work in cybersecurity sector as a consultant and I currently earn 120k per year before tax with additional 9.5% ($11,400) going towards a superannuation retirement fund. The question I have is what would you recommend I do with the money I can save from my income (approx 2k per month after mortgage repayments, student loans and expenses). Should I invest this or put it towards paying off the mortgage? For those with knowledge of Australian tax system are there any tax breaks/benefits I could get from certain investment options?

To preface this I'm a currently unemployed 18 year old senior in high-school. I am saving up to start camming (planning on starting towards the end of this month/early-mid Jan). I am going to go to a community college in my city after high school. it's cheap, and they'll accept me with my shitty GPA. Not only this, but the typically difficult-to-get-into university that I would like to go to after (UF), accepts graduates from this community college. I would go for a cybersecurity 2 year degree if I can, or just a general science. I say ""if I can"" because I don't know if UF would accept me going for a major in Particle Physics with a cybersecurity associates degree. While in community college I plan on getting a part time job, and finally learning how to drive. I would still be camming when I can. I would like to put money into a savings account with compound interest, and a little bit into building a stock market portfolio. If I do need a car, I was planning to get one of the relatively cheap, electric, smart cars. They seem to be affordable, plus I wouldn't have to pay for gas. This is where I'm really unsure what comes next: I am a transgender MtF, and I plan on permanently moving to Seoul, South Korea as soon as I finish my transition. There's quite a few things I would want done as part of my transition (Sexual reassignment surgery, facial feminization surgery, laser hair removal, hormone replacement surgery, possibly breast implants, and vocal chord surgery.) I want to be legally considered female before I move as well. This means I get a signature that sexual reassignment surgery has been performed on me, and then I can change my birth certificate, and ID. I would also get a new SSN. I don't know how the best method to approach both moving, and transitioning. I think I would put the majority of my excess money into the transition until I feel ""complete"" and then after graduating, work for a year or two until I can move. But I also want to save for the future a little bit. I don't know what banks are available in both South Korea, and the US that offer a compound interest savings plan, and I was uncertain if a 401k would work for me, since I have the move in my plan. What would be the best way to go about doing this?"

130,cybersecurity,personalfinance,[Serious][Long] What is the Best way to get out of debt?,1,6udivs,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6udivs/seriouslong_what_is_the_best_way_to_get_out_of/,2017-08-18 08:19:29,"I am trying to get better toward my money. 2 different time this year alone, i have been unemployed for 1 month. The first month (Jan-Feb) I was unaware that my previous job was temp (amazon fullfillment) until my birthday when I attempted to walk in. Apparently an email was sent out, however alot of us did not receive it. A month later I was able to get a job at a call center. During that month, I dont remember much. I do remember i tried to collect unemployment but before I could, i got a job. The second month was more so of over confidenceand unplanning. I discovered a government funded program that would train me in the Cybersecurity field. Since I previously dropped out of college due to learning and money issues, I figured this would be a good investment. The whole program is about 3yrs. After the first class however, i will be assisted in finding a related job (IT Fundementals). Because the first 2 weeks of prerequisites (for a lack of better words) I had to leave my job (second since Feb). Since I was in training at the time, i wasnt allowed to miss but so many hours. With the classes, i couldnt miss but so many hours. So I had a decision to make. And I decided to stick with classes thinking I could easily find a job. It had always been easy for me. Before 2017 it would b 2 weeks before I could find a job. This wasnt a problem since I had money. I was proven wrong. Once reason, obviously is due to unplanning. The second is due to restricting myself. I refused to take a certain field, such as construction or fast food. I wanted a job I could be able to keep and possibly give me a career. Perhaps the fact Im a job hopper is another factor that played. Finally I took my fathers advice and applied to temp agencies. I tried at least 5 different agencies before I got a temp at a local college cleaning dorms. Wasnt the best job (another job zi would have refused appling to), but it was a job. During this month i missed 2 months of rent to my dad ($800 total), a car payment and insurance ($500) a hospital bill paid monthly ($200). As for credit cards, i paid the minimum $50 (later ilearned it was $58). My credit spending went up during this month. With BP I had a couple hundred balance and now it is $1000. Capital One was already high die to chrismas spending. It was $2000. I had been driving for Amazon and made a couple hundred. I used that to pay down the balance and now it is now $1600. A year ago I literally walked out on cookout during lunch since I had gotten a job at Walmart. I was lucky to get it back after the temp job. Seeing that this second month was worse than the first, I decided to see want I could do to make the most of my money and how I can save money in case I go through this again. My first start was to start saving again. During one of my bad month last year, i was forced to take money out of my savings to pay bills. That was around $400. I went to pnc my bank to deposit my first check from my temp job. I was in the negative by 400 and was told that i had to deposit it into my checking vs savings. After this I decided to look into another bank, after a hour of looking at interest rates, I decided Coastal Federal Union (CFU) would be my best bet. I also I saw that for me to make the most out of the account, I would need a checking account. I do admit I am still rather confused about credit unions and how its different from a standard bank. While I was at PNC today depositing a check, I decided to ask a simple question. So i went in a told them I thinking about switching over to CFU. and I wanted to know how I could go about this. I had no ill intentions toward PNC. I had them Since 2012 when I opened my savings account. Somehow I ended opening up a checkings account and thats the story i ended with the Virtual Account. I was confused about it then and I am still confused about it now. I shouldve known the advice or whoever was not gonna help me for when Im ready to close my account. She attempted to convince me to stay by giving me advice how how to spend less money and make a comeback (since I was in the negative) she was ables to refund me $182 in overdraft fees. She told me to take out 60 (thrifty spending) + $25 (gas) and lock away my card. This was not a problem as I cannot use my card to begin with. She said it would help with rationing my money. Before I go on let me explain virtual reality: I have 3 accounts. One for checking, a short term savings, and a long term savings. I learned that from a youtube video. It seems like a good idea and would be better if I understood it. However that is too many accounts to keep up with. She had me put $50 in my short term (i think). And I free money when she showed me how to make a deposit on my app ($1.01), how to deposit a check at an ATM ($1.01 shit free money for something I already know), and how to cash a check at the ATM ($1.01 this I didnt even know was possible). She told me I should look into consolidating my debt of $12,000 since I also have a car loan through them also. Since I have a credit score of 742, she said another credit card would not help. After spending about an hour in there, i left unresolved but yet helped. And of course on the way home I get hit with a speeding ticket. A problem but I have 2 months, so not that much of one. I decided to go by CFU and see if I could make since of how they work. She did not really help. Probably due to my lack of communication skills. With PNC, she did all the talking and asked questions. With CFU, i told them i was thinking about opening up a checking account and not ready (in case they decided to pressure me into doing so). Honestly it was a waste of gas as she only mimic what was online. So now I come to you all for the best advice possible. **Short Term Goals** *All by Jan 2018* * Get my checking back to a balance of $1000 at least. The more the merrier. * Save $1500 for a security deposit in Dec/Jan. **THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE** * Get rid of all debt excluding the car payments. It should be noted that I has a hospital bill from last year. It recently went to debt collection. I only have $500 left to pay. Might be paid off on my credit card. I also have a paypal of $200 but havent heard from them in awhile. Havent seen it effect my credit score so im not too worried about it. * Aside from saving the $1500, just save money in general to have money in my account. **Long Term Goals** * Save at least $5000 to move to Florida (in NC currently. 5 years) * Pay off my car and save enough for a down payment toward a Mustang or Camaro (used or new: unknown. Time: assuming everything goes right from now on: 4 years) **Optional as of now** * Opening a retirement account. Dont know much about this and the sound of money coming out of my paycheck doesnt sound appealing. **My debt** * BP: $1,034.29 *On hold for 1 week since I have $90 in cash from PNC. * Capital One: $1,919.36 * Hospital bill: $500 * Student Loans: $1,840.15 * Car: $9,090.61 * PNC: $200 Deposit made today **Normal Monthly Payments** * Rent: $400 * Car: $250 * Car Insurance: $150 * Gas: $25 to fill up estimate $75/month * Phone Service: $50 * BP: $30 (auto payments) *will be 100$ when im stable* * Capital One: $60 *will be 100$ when im stable* * Hair cuts: varies $5-$20 * Student Loan: $15 * Groceries: max of $100 With this information, please help me get stable again and lower my debt. And tell me the best savings option I have. I do not want to open another credit card. I am willing to switch banks. I am not trying to lose another month again. It was really depressing. Thanks in advance. *Update: I had been saving spare change for the longest. After that saving plus the $90 i took out, I not have $128.60 in cash.* "

I want to take advantage of the deferment period to pay down as much as I can before I get a 'real job' in IT. Lots of possible strats, not sure what is optimal. Greetings /pf! So I've started back at my local community college for a degree in IT, cybersecurity specifically, and I am absolutely loving it. But I would like to take advantage of my deferment period to pay down my existing loans as much as I can. They're all federal. I borrowed ~$80,000 over the course of a BA and 2 MAs. All humanities. Yeah, I know. Since then, $13,000 of interest has capitalized, because my IBR payments have not covered the interest. Here's what a month looks like right now: Monthly gross income: $3,000 BILLS Taxes: $600 mortgage: $485 health + dental: $120 utilities: $100 average but quite variable cell phone: $50 internet: $45 car insurance: $45 Adobe CC: $50 Netflix: $10 EXPENSES groceries: $175-$200 cats: $50 gasoline: $20 housewares, supplies, etc: $30 FRIVOLITIES eating out: $25 running: $20 for one event/month movies: $10 DEBTS Student loans: $93,000 :((((( Mortgage: $63,000 ASSETS Inherited IRA: $55,000 SEP IRA: $10,000 Checking + Savings: $6,000 Now here are some strategies I'm entertaining: Strat 1: Be as frugal as absolutely possible and send every $$ I can to Great Lakes. I'm thinking I can swing at least $600/month, maybe more? Also, find some ways to increase the income. Strat 2: Do strat 1, but also make a few pulls from my inherited IRA to take as much out of the unsubsidized portion ($30,000) as I possibly can. Strat 3: Take one BIG pull from the IRA to get rid of the unsubbed loans, then just save save save through school. Strat 4: something I haven't thought of yet, lol. Ultimately, I WANT to pay these back. I don't want to go the forgiveness road. I don't think I could forgive [i]myself[/i], lol. And I'm freaking embarrassed that I borrowed so much money for what has turned out to be not a great investment. So I guess what I'm asking is two-fold: 1. Are there ways I can save money that I'm not seeing? Or ways to increase my income that are do-able, given that I currently work about 30/hours a week and am in a pretty intensive IT program? I feel like I'm burning the candle at both ends already, honestly. 2. Is one of my ideas better than the others? Or, is there a better re-payment strat I've not thought of? "

I filed as an independent. First year and my tax return is about 1400. I havent had this amount of money in probably six months. I'm in school and paying for everything has been pretty taxing. I live pay check to pay check but who doesnt at this age. My parents picked up my tab for student loans when I had 2k outstanding and couldnt sign up for classes. they want me to pay them back obviously, and have given me until September to do so. Otherwise I am 27k in debt from Student Loans. I also had to move from my apartment and now my rent is $385 (up from $285). I pay for my car $150 (owe 3k on car still) a month for insurance and loan (3%). Phone and utilities ($80). and groceries about $30 a week with eating out once a week. I bring home just about $800 a month if I get every day to work. With all that said. I'll be able to work full time this summer @ $11.50 hourly, and I might pick up an odd job for the weekends. Enough to pay rent and pay my parents back. Some might suggest the emergency fund. If anything really bad happens my parents can help me out just as they did. Aside from that If I have money It will get spent somewhere useful like food or you know a table or something so I don't have to use my computer on the floor. It's just I am pretty used to this lifestyle of being broke and want to make the most of the cash Im getting. My gut says i should shove $1000 at the 2k I owe my parents, and use the other 400 as a buffer or pay off my first months rent (June). However I feel my judgement is clouded also.. I could easily spend any amount of money on projects that I am working on (trying to get grant funding for cybersecurity). I am also drawn to do that. TL;DR Im getiing 1400 on my return and don't know where to spend it. Rent(385) Car(owe 3k) Loan from Parents(2k) Student Loans (27k) Living normal person life "

I'll try to paraphrase and give this story the shortest version possible but a quick TL;DR is that... TL;DR : **Company wants to hire a sole IT guy to support their business of roughly 35 people. I am currently in school to obtain a Comp Sci degree specializing in Cyber Security. I have done small work for the company before, they want me to come on and complete multiple large scale solution projects for their company. How do I evaluate myself and approach them back with an offer they have asked for?** So here's the deal. I do a fair amount of side business providing tech support for local companies. I am not yet certified but I have a decent amount of self experience working on projects and providing solutions. Currently in my second year of college and working on a 3+1 program. The only official things I can cite are winning regional and state competitions in Cybersecurity as well as previous work for businesses. Last week I settup a meeting with the owners of the new clients business to sit down and discuss plans to overhaul their website. This meeting went from a 30 minute pow-wow to a 2 hour long term project discussion that ended in a job offer sort of. After outlining roughly 6-8 months worth of work, expectations and deadlines, they asked if I could complete it. I informed them I can but only with dedicated time. They responded with ""What you're saying is, if we pay you full time you will dedicate your time to here."" (On a side note, I have done side work for them before, they have informed me they are extremely happy with me and even pay me over what I request as a tip for work.) They said they need someone who can take the project and work on it without issue and doesn't need to be guided. They then asked me to send them an offer and to quote ""Whether we do this as an on retainer or coming on as a full time employee is up to you."" I've only ever done work for companies as proposals and short term projects. This feels like contracting but they've made it clear they need someone full time to manage their IT issues and take care of projects they come up with to help the company. I want to send my offer detailing a full time position and either Salary or Hourly, I have compared the national average for a tech support specialist and it is listed as 42k on Glassdoors, and roughly the same in the Chicago area (Where I am.) I do not understand how to put this in writing, nor how to estimate whether 42k as the average is a lowball figure or not. I know without the proper experience I shouldn't expect high pay, so I'm really abit lost here whether I have the leverage to approach with this kind of offer which will likely turn into negotiation. I am asking for guidance in terms of how I approach negotiating my pay, what this means for me and what I should watch out for. **Ninja Edit: I am currently employed full time at a retail job and do NOT need this job. I would be fully willing to leave my retail job for this as the experience is worth more than even the money to me. Anything over the 20k before taxes that I currently make is really just icing on the cake for myself at my second year of college. They are the ones who put forth the idea of me coming on as an employee, and they approached me with the work so I believe this gives me abit of leverage.**"
137,cybersecurity,personalfinance,How to make the most of my current situation?,1,5x9aeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5x9aeu/how_to_make_the_most_of_my_current_situation/,2017-03-03 19:34:09,"I'm 30, have been a college instructor in IT/Cybersecurity for the past five years, but I left my awesome job in 2015 (73k/yr) to do military grant-based Cybersecurity training for District (same organization as my college). Looks awesome on paper, but it was a HUGE mistake (soft-money job; even though I made comparable money, no guarantees). After a year, those grants ended, and my current position left me able to only teach adjunct (part-time) wherever available. I've tried and tried to get on somewhere full-time, but openings were scarce. So, over the last year, I've been teaching part-time (makes nothing) and scrapping with my own work, but my finances have taken a huge hit. I have solid credentials, great reviews and evals, a Master's from JHU, CISSP, CISA, SSCP, and others. I finally got some luck and I'm a finalist candidate at a college that's hiring now and starting in the summer. In late January, my fiance and I just moved in to a new condo with my grandmother, rent-free, to take care of her. Not 24h care or anything of the sort, just help. So no living expenses. My fiance is a law assistant, 26, BS in Criminal Justice, makes livable money (25k), no debt, paid off car (both our cars are paid), frugal spender, would rather work out at the gym with me than go out to a fancy dinner. My kinda girl :) At the moment, I'm teaching one class ($680 every two weeks), and I just started (PT, work from home) for a large Cybersecurity firm in a sales position selling managed security services (not EXACTLY what I want, but I'll throw myself at it and it's a good opportunity to make some money). That one's commission based, since they're service package, each monthly sales repeats towards my 15% commission, and no telling how much I can make. It's enough to survive on, easily. My problem is my debt. I have about $27k in unsecured credit card debt, with monthly payments of near $1200. That is obviously not workable with my current income. I was paying my cards all last year, not using them, but my resources were too slim and I stopped paying in January. So I was barely living paycheck to paycheck, and not paying my cards. This can only last so long. I have a child from a previous relationship, no official child support, the mother and my fiancee and I all collaborate and we do a great job switching off with him every other day or two. I was a very early adopter of Ethereum, and had a bit of Ether stashed away as a last resort. After Ethereum's wild rise of late, I sold it this week on a peak and came away with $14,500. I stuck $10,000 in savings, and that left my checking at $5200. I paid off my Discover IT, a rewards card with a $1400 credit limit, as well as a Capital One card with a $300 limit, and I plan to use them sparingly and pay the balances off each month to begin rebuilding my credit. I also bought a little Ethereum and Bitcoin when they dipped. Checking is now at $3500. I also have about $5,000 of things to sell. Tax return should be about $2,000. I am considering a third-party debt settlement plan on the remaining cards, and the best offer has me at a $425 monthly payment after settlement, for a 48 month term. I'd be paying about $20,400 in full after the law firm's 15% cut. All of those cards will be closed, thankfully, and I understand it will be some time before I can rebuild my credit. Any experience with debt settlement plans like these out there? Ideas, thoughts, suggestions, or advice is welcome. Thanks for taking the time to help."

I've always harboured an interest in IT, especially the more 'professional' sectors such as cybersecurity or server admin-ing. But getting into the field would require an education of some sort, and I've homed it down to the nearest and cheapest college, which is still costly to me. Do note that 1 USD = 4.5 Malaysian Ringgit, and I'll be listing all denominations in Ringgit. I currently have a job offer that is flexible enough for me to pursue this education, but I'll have to give an answer by Monday. I'll be having a discussion with the employer for the details this weekend, but I'd estimate the pay to be RM3,000 gross per month (you can see why I want to pursue a career in IT now, which offers 4-year seniors around RM8,000 here). A Degree in Computing costs RM53,000 over three years. I have RM23,000 in savings, with the rest of the fees hinging on my future job. The reason why I don't want to enrol in open-learning courses while working is because it takes at least 5 years for a degree, whereas this college takes 3 years. Also, in this college, while the first year is full-time, the second and third years can be done on a part-time basis (weekends). So what this means for me is that RM1,000 out of my pay (which is prolly RM2,600 nett after deductions) will need to go to my education for three years. Living off the rest would be pretty tight, (RM1,000 for expenses is the bare minimum to just exist) and I'd also like to set aside money to regrow my savings. The thing is, would this be too much of a risk? Would I be better off sitting on my nest-egg just in case? There's also the option of education loans, which allows me to delay and stretch the payments across 10 years, with interest of course (looking at 6%). Is this the best way to spend my money + future earnings? Am I way over my head when it comes to wanting to better my life? Do let me know, thanks!"

After 6-7 months of depression due to not being able to land a job that pays 50k+ with decent health benefits, I finally started looking through recruiters. By December, I finally got a contractor job. I'll be working as a fraud analyst for Bank of America through Aerotek, a recruiting agency. (Does anyone have any experience working with these guys? Please tell me if I can afford their health plan) I'll be paid 18-20/hr. Not enough to live on my own. I want to break into IT, because any other role within a bank requires too many years of experience that I don't have coming out of college as a health major, and it requires licenses and taking tests. IT is the only way to go. It's gonna be hard, but I'd rather get knocked down and learn than be stuck at a desk and suffer within this expensive country. It's the best field that offers flexibility, I don't know how this field holds up during a recession, but...Idk y'all tell me if I have options. I need help. ANYWAY So here is my question: How do I go from fraud analyst to IT? I was thinking of becoming a business analyst as an entry level IT role. Now I'm on a contract here, Bank of America might not take me on full-time or they might, who knows. However, how do I put myself out there and showcase my interest? Must I apply to other positions while I'm working since I would be considered an internal candidate? How? In the end, once I get on an IT role, I can look into other options for multiple streams of income, investments, etc. I wanna take this 1 step at a time and consider every possible worst case scenario that will screw me over in not giving me an opportunity.

My rent is around ~$1100/month (including utilities) and I have around $34k left in student loans at a 4.5% interest rate after I paid off a $2k loan in full that had a 5% interest rate. My only other expense really is eating, and I like to eat out often so I spend around $400-$500/month on food. This leaves me with around $1500/month to work with. My monthly payments for student loans is around $300, but I am planning on paying $500 to pay it off faster. Is this recommended? Or should I keep paying the minimum and use that extra $200 elsewhere? Where should I put the rest of my savings? I was thinking maybe $500 into my savings account and $500 to invest elsewhere, not sure where. What would you guys recommend? Edit: I should add, my goal of course is to save up for a house which seems impossible to me at the moment in San Diego. I am open to moving, and as a Software Engineer at a Defense Contractor with a clearance, I think it would be fairly easy to find opportunities in cheaper areas, but I really enjoy the food in Socal :). I also have another possible opportunity in Irvine,CA with a cybersecurity startup that would pay slightly more and be better career move if I ever want to work outside Defense, but have less job security. Unfortunately they won't offer equity to entry level engineers :( "

Long before that, she worked in insurance as a manager (she quit when I was born). She has a degree from the University of Texas in advertising. &amp;nbsp; The bureaucracy of teaching and rude kids have been wearing her down for years (she works in a low income neighborhood), and she is frustrated and looking to change careers. She was recently accepted into a Master's degree program for Information Systems and Security (recommended to her by a friend). This degree will cost her approx. $30K, plus an additional $12K for her own health insurance. She hopes to work for a consulting firm, or start a business as a broker for Cybersecurity insurance (I am skeptical of her ability to do this). &amp;nbsp; She is an excellent writer and has been working on several novels, however, she is not great at math. I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a fair bit of coding experience and am skeptical of the value in this degree. I am concerned whether she will be able to find a job, given her lack of technical background and her age. &amp;nbsp; Her finances are not great. She has only about $130k saved for retirement and no cash saved in the bank. Her house is paid for as she lives with my grandma. &amp;nbsp; Realistically, what are her options? Does anyone recommend this as a future career, or have thoughts for a career for someone in her position? "

A year ago I was working at Dominos Pizza. Towards the end of the year I desperately looked for a entry level IT job. Through the help of a friend I landed a junior network engineer job in March of 2016 and have picked up a variety of skills in that area. Currently I have gained two certifications Security+ and Linux+. I will also complete my degree (BS in Computer Networks and Cybersecurity) in Spring of 2017. I feel I low balled myself in terms of salary when I was hired. I currently make 13.5/hr or around 28k a year. My area is above average for my job type and I feel I am worth more. How can I ask for a significant increase without coming off as greedy? I am very grateful to my company and coworkers for building me up these last few months. I know I also have to look out for myself as well though.

I am the head engineer and run about $70 million in projects. I am a critical person in the organization. Company revenue is over 10 billion and we are consistently very profitable. The last few years we have been in a contraction phase as it relates to new hiring. I am a key resource in the organization and basically no new system goes forward without my input and blessing. I.E. they rely on my expertise and leadership A LOT. I have been requesting additional personnel to my team for quite some time but have basically been told that it isn't coming anytime soon. The finance geeks and lawyers are running the show in a very engineering oriented company. Lots of new reviews and frustrations getting anything done but I enjoy the work. I am not the kind of person that let's work bother me, but I feel like my agility and ability to adopt innovation is stifled. There is another large company that is actively recruiting me. They are offering me a step up from my current position. Essentially it would be a junior VP job, 8 staff, my own office, and a nondiscretionary budget way larger than what I would need to get the job done. I am happy with the current job and I enjoy the work. I can't stand upper management but I truly love the people I work with. When management gets out of the way we kick ass. As I said, I am critical to their leadership. Not that I can't eventually be replaced, but if I left I know it would hurt them bad and I have had nothing but stellar reviews. There is no one who could effectively backfill me and given their new processes it would take a year to hire someone if they found them in the next three months which is unlikely because cybersec is very hot right now with essentially a negative unemployment rate. It takes a lot to create a new position at this place so I am not as concerned about them trying to replace me behind my back. Numbers. Current job has a 250k total compensation package. New job has 300k compensation package with huge 40-70% additional bonus potential 3 years out, but I have a lot of money saved up so that is really tasty icing on the cake. I knwo the new job would have a worse work-life balance.I currently put in 55-60 a week and the new job could be more given the nature of what they need. I am thinking about telling my current employer that I am being made this offer to see if they want to counter but I have never done it before and I know it goes against common wisdom. I feel like if they matched the compensation package I would stay but I think it may taint me or be a bad move. Looking for feedback or advice. Thanks!"

Then he started exploring the idea of grad school. We are operating on the assumption that we can't afford to do both at the same time. Do we put him through grad school, save less toward a down payment, and put off buying a home for several years? Or do we put off grad school, save all the money, buy the house, then do grad school? Here are the numbers: Combined yearly income: $130,000 (split evenly, expected to go up slightly next year) Down payment money currently saved: $20,000 Projected additional DP money saved in next 18 months: $30,000 Condo purchase price in desired area: $400,000* Grad school tuition: $30,000 Potential income increase with MS: $20,000 (to $85,000) Notes: - as we live in a very high COL area, we would like to take advantage of the sub-20% DP, no PMI mortgage options (I understand that this sub is not incredibly supportive of these mortgages. If saving up a full 20% is realistically better, please let me know.) - is the assumption that we can't do both concurrently correct? - he will be getting his Masters in Cybersecurity and is currently working in the field. - he has no student loan debt, I have $25,000 in loans - our current rent is very cheap for the area, but a) we are not thrilled with aspects of complex/unit, b) our landlord could raise the rent at any time, c) it's highly unlikely that we would be able to find a comparable rental at a comparable rent Happy to provide any additional info you might need.

I went to log onto my phone company's website this morning, and blanked on my username. For some sites I use my first initial + last name (jknudsen, for example), so I tried that. Worked! It offered a security question that sounded plausible (I didn't specifically remember setting it up, but I did go to college so I do have a first college roommate's name to supply), so I answered the question. No dice. I tried a few variations on my old roommate's last name, until the account was locked. Then they offered to send a reset code to my mobile number. Here's the really weird thing. I noticed the number was almost a perfect match for my number, but not exactly. The site displayed (for instance): XXX-XXX-4502. My actual mobile number is XXX-XXX-4802. Weirded out, I went back, checked my billing statements and realized I'd set up my phone account with a totally different username. Logged on, everything looks fine in my actual account. But I'm worried about that other account, the one that uses my exact first initial+last name construct AND has a weirdly similar last four digits on the mobile device. My last name isn't Knudsen, but it's almost as uncommon. Am I freaking out for no reason? Is this just a coincidence? Or is this potentially a problem?

Like many, I didn't realize how bad it was until after I received my degree. Thankfully, I graduated from a fairly elite private school with a degree that would help lead to a job in my dream field--cybersecurity, which is fairly in-demand and high-paying. I currently work in tech consulting, not exactly doing cyber work yet but still in the IT field and bring home around $40k a year after taxes. I live at home with my parents for free which has helped me to cut out what would otherwise be a huge expense. My current plan is to pay around $50k of my debt in the next two years, which comes out to about $2k per month. Since I don't have to pay rent, this is reasonable and still gives me enough cash for other expenses. I will likely have to buy a car in the near future since my current arrangement (having my mom drop me off at my office) doesn't work very well (not to mention is a bit embarrassing) but I plan to buy used for $4-5k. Paying off a majority of my loans is my priority until I've gotten my debt down to a manageable level and am paying less in interest. I intend to continue studies in my field on my own and get some industry-recognized certifications in the next few months (paid for by my company), which will make me a more attractive candidate for higher-paying jobs. I plan to continue applying to other jobs since I think my earning potential is much higher than my current salary given the field I am in and my educational background. I think that a ~$70k salary could be realistic within a year or two if I keep improving myself professionally. Once my debt is down to $30k or so I will reassess how I want to pay off the rest, if I want to move out on my own, etc given the circumstances at that time. How does my plan sound? I am curious to hear more viewpoints or other suggestions. Thanks!"

What Happened Federal law enforcement officials recently informed us that theyve been investigating cybersecurity crimes involving the theft of information from Scottrade and other financial services companies. We immediately initiated a comprehensive response. Based upon our subsequent internal investigation coupled with information provided by the authorities, we believe a list of client names and street addresses was taken from our system. Importantly, we have no reason to believe that Scottrades trading platforms or any client funds were compromised. All client passwords remained encrypted at all times and we have not seen any indication of fraudulent activity as a result of this incident. Although Social Security numbers, email addresses and other sensitive data were contained in the system accessed, it appears that contact information was the focus of the incident. The unauthorized access appears to have occurred over a period of several months between late 2013 and early 2014. We have secured the known intrusion point and conducted an internal data forensics investigation on this incident with assistance from a leading computer security firm. We have taken appropriate steps to further strengthen our network defenses. What Happens Now Federal authorities had requested that they be allowed to complete much of their investigation before we notified clients. In coordination with them, we are now able to alert you of this incident. We are fully cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation and prosecution of the criminals involved. Notices like this one are being sent to all individuals and entities whose information was contained in the affected database, and we have included here information about steps you can take to protect yourself. Information about this incident is available online at URL and we will update that web page if new data becomes available. What You Can Do As always, we encourage you to regularly review your Scottrade and other financial accounts and report any suspicious or unrecognized activity immediately. As recommended by federal regulatory agencies, you should remember to be vigilant for the next 12 to 24 months and report any suspected incidents of fraud to us or the relevant financial institution. Please also read the important information included on ways to protect yourself from identity theft. We encourage clients to be particularly vigilant against email or direct mail schemes seeking to trick you into revealing personal information. Never confirm or provide personal information such as passwords or account information to anyone contacting you. Please know that Scottrade will never send you any unsolicited correspondence asking you for your account number, password or other private information. If you receive any letter or email requesting this information, it is fraudulent and we ask that you report it to us at phishing@scottrade.com. Be cautious about opening attachments or links from emails, regardless of who appears to have sent them. Identity Theft Protection As a precaution, Scottrade has arranged with AllClear ID to help you protect your identity at no cost to you for a period of one year.

I have been interested in cyber security and within the past year I had a job shadow of a Security Analyst at a 600+ person company. Since then, I have been offered an internship, and recently a full time job making $40,000 per year. I graduated high school with a 3.989 GPA and will be attending Penn State Online to further my education in Cyber Security. Now to the finance part. I ended high school, got this job, and had to select an online college all within the past 2 weeks. As you can imagine, this is a fairly crazy part of my life right now. I live with my mother and sister as previously said and we live in a good neighborhood close to my grandparents. My mother is recently divorced and we don't talk to my father as he is an alcoholic that needs to get his life together. Anyways, my mother makes roughly $35,000 a year. I am currently at a loss on what to do. The company I work for is offering me $40,000 and will reimburse my college at $1,000 per semester. The will also pay for a bootcamp and certification every year. Those run anywhere between $1,500 and $5,000. They offer full benefits which I assume is a good thing. I want to plan for the future so I can live comfortably later on in life. I don't mind saving if it will help me later on. I drive a 2011 Nissan Altima that costs ~$175 a month. We also borrow money from my grandparents to help pay for the house we live in. They don't mind at all since we are so close and we help them out physically in any way they need. I have a debit card and use it for basically everything. Now that you know the backstory here are the questions I have, 1. Should I get a credit card? How to build up credit? 2. I will be paying my mom roughly ~$500 a month to cover my living expenses at our current house. Would it be more beneficial for me to move into an apartment by myself? We have discussed that as an option. 3. Saving, here is where I want the most help. What can I do to ensure that by the time I'm 30-40 I will be living comfortably? What are some options that I can do now to save and have my money work for me? 4. If I do stay at home, would it be okay to upgrade to another car? 5. What are the ""rules"" as to how much to spend on certain things? Like 20% on your car, 40% on living, etc. 6. Any other advice that you can throw at me!

Now I'll admit I don't know a lot about hacking or cybersecurity, but I know cyberhacking has been a pretty hot topic lately. I imagine that if its possible for the US gov't to be hacked and so many other institutions, these companies are just as vulnerable. I'd love to use these apps but I just don't feel right giving them my information, knowing that it could leave me vulnerable. Can someone put my mind at ease?"

I'm staying with a friend and his wife, but don't want to overstay my welcome. I have an AS and a BS in networking and cybersecurity. I'm a veteran and because I have a small income I'm unable to get assistance. I've been looking for work and applying all over the place with no responses. I have no work experience that matches my college education. I have a lot of credit card debt that I've been paying with the money I sold my truck with. I want to keep good credit as long as I'm able to to help me with getting a job and housing if I ever get hired. What do I do?"

My family has been living at our current address for over 15 years and about a month or two ago we started to receive a ton of mail addressed to two people. I thought nothing of it at first thinking it was a mistake, nobody in the house knows these people, I even went so far as to Google their old address and found a number which I called a few times and even once left a voice mail (not smart) but never got a call back. I ended up bundling the mail together and stuck a post it saying ""don't live here stop sending"" a couple times and left them for the mailman. However upon giving them to the mail man one time in person he informed me that the yellow sticker which displayed the destination address meant that they recently added my address as their forwarding address and because among the mail was bank statements and other important information he told me to tell my parents to check their credit and banking info as it could be possible identity theft, they did and nothing appears to be wrong. Fast forward to now and we aren't getting anymore of their mail except for the occasional ad leaflet but something urged me to look into it.. I googled my address followed by name. Address search yielded nothing but the second result on my name search is a white pages link which simply had the people's last name followed by ""in my state"" I clicked and it listed their family and under the ""people they know"" tab is my name along with one of my parents under the names of the two whose mail we had been getting, my address was also listed as theirs on that site. I snooped a bit and found out that they had both recently lived in a couple places within an hour of my location and both apparently work in the cybersecurity field. Should I be worried? Who should I tell about this? If anyone has any insight on this type of situation I would greatly appreciate it."
162,cybersecurity,personalfinance,Unsure where to take my career from here,1,2zm2i3,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2zm2i3/unsure_where_to_take_my_career_from_here/,2015-03-20 05:41:37,"Hey everyone, this is gonna be a long one so if you stick it out I thank you for the advice. I'm currently employed as a civilian mechanic at a large naval institution on the west coast. I'm currently in my first year of an apprenticeship that pays for my education and the hours I spend in school, with the stipulation that if I drop before the apprenticeship is finished (June 2018) I must pay back the tuition that has already been spent on me. Since I'm in my first year this would amount to no more than $5000 I imagine (total cost of the program is around $17,000). When I finish the program I'll earn a journeyman rate making around $29 an hour (somewhere around $55k a year which is decent for the area I'm in). Now this job has great benefits, time off, opportunity for travel, time and a half for anything over 40 hours, matching TSP benefits, the works. The problem is, I'm not sure this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I dislike the corporate culture and the work is so far unfulfilling. I'm currently 20 years old with no debt. I use YNAB to budget, I have my emergency fund set up, and I'm no longer living paycheck to paycheck. Life's good. But I've been feeling like I want to go back to school (a real university) instead of the apprenticeship I'm in to pursue a different direction. Robotics, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence are the paths I'm currently looking into as paths to take. My workplace offers tuition assistance programs that will pay for online classes at any college in the US up to $4000 per year, or a local community college up to 30 credits per year. I already have an associate's degree covering all the general education requirements to transfer to University of Washington. My question is, what would you do in this situation? I feel like I have a couple different options: 1. Finish out the apprenticeship through 2018 while saving as much money as possible, utilize the tuition assistance in the meantime to explore those career paths and take some prerequisites. This has the benefit of me being able to easily return to my current workplace if I leave, I don't end up paying back the tuition, I have time to save up some money over the next 3-4 years. 2. Either enlist into the Air Force or go get my Bachelor's and enter the Air Force as an officer, to pursue a career path I like there, get some experience, travel a bit, and get my GI bill. I don't see myself as the type to stay in for 20 years to get the retirement, my plan with this would be more toward joining for the minimum time (4-5 years) and then leaving. I *believe* this option would also remove me from the apprenticeship without having to pay back the tuition due to the USERRA. 3. Quit my apprenticeship now, suck it up and pay back the few grand in tuition they've spent on me, grab as many scholarships as I can and a few loans, and head to college next year to pursue artificial intelligence or cybersecurity. Expensive, but I feel it would get me going on my preferred path a lot quicker than the previous two. I don't like feeling like I'm ""falling behind"" or wasting time. 4. Do another year of the apprenticeship to see if I do end up enjoying the work, save enough money to be prepared to quit if I decide to. Look into the Air Force Reserves to see if they have any opportunities in my desired careers. I would get a year or so to search out grants and scholarships and set myself up financially for what I plan to do, but the cost of dropping out would be significantly higher. That being said, the reason I want to pursue a career in robotics, artificial intelligence, or cybersecurity is because I want to have job security in the next 30-40 years and I want to feel like I'm making a difference. I want to make Star Trek happen. I love technology and smartphones and prosthetics and self driving cars and green energy and 3D printing and I want to be a part of an emerging field where we're stepping out on the bleeding edge of things. Sorry this is so long, thanks for any advice. "
