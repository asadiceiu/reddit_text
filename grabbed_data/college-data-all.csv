Yeah, sure, legally you might be, but the law is a social construct. It was literally decided by a bunch of men in suits and can just as easily and quickly be changed by those same men in suits. Sounds real biological, doesn't it? /s Just because the law says you're an adult and prescribes certain arbitrary, bullshit roles for you now doesn't mean you have to follow them past the extent of being able to survive. Of course, unfortunately, there comes a point where we all have to work and do something with our lives in order to keep afloat in our money-driven, capitalistic society. But doing those things doesn't necessarily make you a grown-up. You are a grown-up because you *feel* like one on an emotional level and want to be treated as one. Please don't feel like you have to stop being a kid just because some document says you're now an ""adult."" All of us, whether we're 2 or 102, are continually growing and developing. We're learning new things all the time, and I don't think any of us can say we're exactly the same today as we were a year ago. Maturity exists on an infinite spectrum; there is no magical line at which someone crosses from being a ""child"" to an ""adult."" I mean, really. If I were to show you a color spectrum ranging from deep red on one end to deep blue on the other, could you really, truly, accurately draw a line down the point at which red changes to blue? Don't buy into the BS narrative shoved down your throat by society. Things are not so black and white. In fact, I'm hesitant to say that concepts such as ""childhood"" and ""adulthood"" really exist outside of a purely biological structure (the dividing point being the onset of puberty). But if you do insist on continuing to use labels such as ""adult"" and ""kid,"" just remember that these terms do NOT have a fixed definition when you put aside biology. According to biology, we all became adults around 12-13. But clearly, society doesn't consider 12-year-olds adults, which just goes to show that it's all a bullshit social construct decided for convenience purposes by the powers that be, So, if you're a college student, 18, 25, anything in between or beyond, and you, like me, are hella uncomfortable with people calling you and treating you as an adult, PLEASE stand up for your rights. You have the right to identify how you wish, and if the people around you don't respect that, you need to find a new group of friends/acquaintances. The same goes for those of you that are treated as a child, but know deep down you are actually an adult. The point is this: be yourself. Just because you're not in high school anymore, just because you've entered the ""real world"" (social construct) doesn't mean you need to stop desiring to be protected. It doesn't mean you need to stop loving stuffed animals and being given piggyback rides. It does NOT mean you can't experience vulnerability or that your vulnerability is somehow significantly less so just because you've crossed the arbitrary threshold of 18. You are still special. Those of you that still feel you're a child inside ARE. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And shame on society for shoving us into boxes and mocking us when we dare to step out of them."
3,vulnerability,college,"Arguments for deleting social media, and hopefully improving your life.",65,cxl0gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cxl0gc/arguments_for_deleting_social_media_and_hopefully/,2019-08-31 04:38:53,"Hey friends. Today (or maybe it was yesterday?) there was a post on the front of reddit about the heightened mental health challenges that college students face, and some people were stipulating that social media played an important role in the development of mental health issues. &amp;#x200B; I'm not going to pretend like I know what causes mental health issues, but it seems obvious to me that social media use should be regulated in some capacity. You should always be monitoring the effect that social media has on your perceptions of your own life. &amp;#x200B; This morning, I woke up from what feels like a long, deep sleep, and I deleted most of my social media pages. I didn't just delete the apps, I went straight for the throat and cut my accounts off the face of the Earth. No deactivation. Deletion. &amp;#x200B; Let me tell you why. For anyone who feels as if social media is harming them, and they need that push, here's what allowed me to quit. For those who aren't currently regulating their social media use, please read, too: &amp;#x200B; 1) I realized that social media connects me with two types of people. I am connected with those who I want to be connected with, and those who I do not care about being connected with. For those who I want to be connected with, there are better methods of connection (a phone call.. where I can hear their genuine voice lol), and for those I do not care to be connected with... why am I connected with them? Social media makes no sense as a tool of connection either way. 2) I realized that it was occupying time that I could spend working on myself. Writing, learning a language, reading the classics, or studying and finding a job. Look at how much time you spend on the apps per day. It's crazy. I could have finished so many books.. I could have read more Dostoevsky. But instead, I spent 30 minutes on Instagram per day. Crazy. 3) It was depriving me of genuine conversation with the people I care about. I can't say: ""What have you been up to this summer?"" because I ALREADY KNOW lol. There's not much to talk about anymore. I feel like social media has led me to lose touch with a lot of my real friends. It has made conversation stale. And it has turned me anti-social on some days; I don't feel the need to see people, because social media fills that connection void (ARTIFICIALLY so, I might add). 4) It tainted my genuine social interactions. I would pick up the phone during class or during lunch with pals. And then, again, the picture-taking process was disgusting. Go see something cool, spend 15 minutes looking for the angles, leave. 5) It fucked with my sex drive and my emotional availability. I have kept in touch with almost every love interest on social media. It's hard to go out and meet new, beautiful women when you \*feel\* as if others are still in your lives. Believe me, I don't want people who aren't really in my life to control my life. It made getting over my first college relationship harder than it had to be. But I want genuine sexual connection with a real woman, not pictures of people I once knew lmfao. 6) It obviously hurts you when you compare yourself to others. You always know where others are interning, what schools others are at, what opportunities they are given, and you feel the need to compete. Well, I want to achieve for myself! I don't want to achieve to be competitive on some sort of online social market. Sadly, the best part of a fair amount of my achievements was sharing them on social media. It's disgusting, and I hate that I used to think that way. It's all bullshit. 7) All of this has culminated, I think, in more anxiety in my own life. Anxiety about love interests, about availability, about success, about achievement, about receiving attention... and none of this is worth it. Friends, if you feel like me, do what you can. Delete your shit. Nobody will care. Nobody does care that you're on Instagram or whatever. Those who 8) I want to live a private life. People are attracted to those who are more secretive and who have more to talk about. And I don't want to be a set of data for some research company. I am not a product. I do not want to be. I do not want Instagram to know as much about me as it does. 9) It tells an incoherent, constructed story. My page doesn't tell the story of a real human being with trials, tribulations, failures, attempts, successes, etc. It tells whatever I want, and I know that almost everyone lies to themselves about their lives and uses social media as the medium through which to do so. You won't fix your life until you feel as if it is truly yours. And social media allows you to dissociate from your own life to live a constructed one. &amp;#x200B; You might be asking, well... why reddit, then? I dunno. I think reddit is a bit more genuine. People are passionate here. People are real. r/college alone receives so many posts about anxiety and mental health, and, in that way, it seems opposite to social media, wherein I see people pretending as if they are okay and living through their best moments. The anonymity has more vulnerability to it. And I like that. And none of my reasons for quitting social media are relevant to reddit."

I really like bioinformatics, machine learning, AI, I've done some cybersecurity which is kind of interesting and I think I'm okay at coding in general. I also like circuitry and hands-on engineering. I have experience in all these things and biomedical robotics also interests me a LOT (I would need ECE or CE program probably for this since I don't want to apply to a major like BME or EE because they have very limited career opportunities) however that's the only thing I don't have experience in. In CS I'm not really interested in how programming languages work and the computational math behind it but in CE I'm not interested in building computers either. I'm scared that if I do CS I'll just be stuck coding which I can do but I don't think I would enjoy only that. In CE I'm scared I will get stuck in too much of the building hardware side and not get to explore my Machine Learning and AI interests. I have some schools I want to apply to rn like UMD, Georgia Tech, Cornell, some other ivies but I'm still looking for schools which is hard because I'm not fully sure about the major. If someone could help me decide if CS or CE seems like a better fit (maybe even recommend some schools :D) that would be so helpful."

(do I really need English 101 and basic math just to learn cybersecurity) For directly those who want to get direct into the field without the overall costs of college, there are certification routes that almost guarantee the same starting knowledge(if not more) in a fraction of the time/money. The college I was going to had a firm limit on the number of classes you could test out of, IIRC it was 3 classes per 4-year degree. Which equates to graduating 6 months earlier out of a 4-year program. Sure they had an option of a higher course load, but that just meant more time spent doing homework for subjects that were completely lacking in usefulness/engagement."

I've been giving much thought as to what I want to pursue in college and what career path I want to go down upon. I've thought that IT would be the sector for me these last few years as I've been involved in it for a very long time and I am in a specialized cybersecurity program at my school. However when I look at the people on my team, I am the least qualified by far. Though I am better off that most others in my pathway at my school, I don't see myself creating side projects, working on coding away from school, etc etc. To start such things seems like such a chore. I have learned coding and done my own stuff outside of school, but I haven't done anything too major and I don't find myself waking up in the morning and saying ""Let's code today"". I simply don't see myself coding the rest of my life. I do enjoy it and computers, and cybersecurity and such but I want my work to be play. Since March I decided to take up the stock market and see if I can make any money there (I've made money in various entrepreneurial efforts and wanted to try something new). I've found the markets fascinating and economics just APPEAL to me. I've literally binged economics videos and am engrossed in the markets and business on a daily basis. Business has always been my thing since the beginning, and I guess that is why finance, markets, economics appeals to me so much. I began to delve into career paths in Finance and what a Finance degree can land you. I was disheartened to see many people actually say it's very very hard to get a nice high paying financial job, and some people with financial degrees end up car salesmen, or grocery store managers. My goal is to land a pretty good entry job and end up making six figures easily several years after college. The good jobs like Investment Banking required 60-90 hours a week all throughout your 20s, for the same salary a software engineer could get for half the hours. I want to get married in my 20s and live life to the fullest with financial freedom instead of slaving long hours. Investment Banking is also very very hard to get into, most people get in because they go to an Ivy or they have a good network. It's a pretty replaceable job as long as you put in hours. I'm sure with my entrepreneurial spirit I will start a business somewhere down the line, but obviously that easily could fail and I need a job in the first place for some sort of capital or experience. I began to wonder if I should go into software engineering/cybersecurity and start trading on the markets on the side, and maybe somewhere down the line I could start a financial consulting company or something of the likes. What are your guy's opinions, and could anyone with a finance degree let me know how the sector is like? (Good high paying jobs with good work/life, etc etc). TLDR: I need ideas as to whether to pursue a career in finance/business or IT, and what careers I could potentially look at. Very interested in finance, but jobs aren't looking as promising due to competition, short hours, and lower pay as what the future of IT offers."

When I graduate, I don't plan on living near or in the state of the ""better"" school, rather I prefer to live in this current state. Would you recommend staying where I'm at or going to a better school far away cause of connections with the wealthy and more opportunities, or staying to be safe and stable? I know connections help, but if they're far away and having their own load of busy work, wouldn't they be more inclined to help themselves out and their local connections first? Like, if I attend local school, I still have everyone close by. But attending fancy school means we all disperse and go our own directions after graduation.

I have no experience and maybe Ive been romanticizing the whole hacker aspect. I still want to major in the subject as the pros do outweigh the cons. But some aspects of the major are not interesting to me. The school I committed to doesnt require me to take physics (unlike the other schools I was admitted to, where i wouldve had at least a years worth of it). I took 2 years of physics in HS and Ive fairly confident that I never want to take another class in the subject (unless it was absolutely necessary). I also dont know how to feel about the electrical engineering class that is a requirement at my new school (if I could, I would not take the class but then again Ive never been able to explore engineering since my HS didnt offer any classes in it). I used to think I wanted to do civil engineering until I realized it wasnt for me. On the other hand, Im considering CogSci too. Only thing is that its core classes have to do with neuroscience, which I havent been able to explore in HS (closest thing to it was probably anatomy, which I didnt find that interesting). I think knowing how people think seems cool and its a reasonable major for UIUX design (a career I might even be starting to prefer over ethical hacking). I usually dont know when enough is enough, so Im kinda worried that I might overwhelm myself by continuing to take CS courses even if I lose interest in it. But Im also hesitant to even go to college knowing that UIUX fields seem to not require degrees (I see videos of people doing boot camps after a career change, but CogSci seems to be the most straightforward degree for that field (besides something like Graphic Design))"

I am curious if I should go down the graduate school route or a second bachelors. With the bachelors I would be exempt from a majority of gen ed. reqs. and would have to take mostly core and supporting class and I feel this would give me a better foundation of knowledge in the field. However, in graduate school it is topic focused but I am concerned that I would not be able to excel due to my undergrad being completely unrelated. I don't want to be a loss and basically waste my time and money in graduate school if i'm going to be in over my head.

There's options out there to help save money on degrees and minimize the the amount of time you have to spend in the classroom. I did my undergraduate degree while working full time in the United States Air Force and completed a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Technology in about 2.5 years. I was able to cut years off my degree and save 10's of thousands of dollars by getting almost 60 credits through credit by examination (CLEP Exam, Dantes Exam, and Excelsior Exam).

Here are my pros of both **Pros of IST:** I'm basically almost done. If all goes as planned my last semester will be the Fall of 2021. Whereas for Computer Science I won't graduate until 2024-2025. It's also easier and focuses on the stuff that I like. I like learning about Cybersecurity, Routers, and learning the in and outs of programs and computers etc. I like using computers and programs more than I do making them. From what I have heard IST majors still go on to get very good jobs in programming also. Math is also not my strong suit and IST is easier when it comes to that. I also hear that most tech jobs are starting to rule out even having a degree so I feel like suffering through 3-4 extra years of school just wouldn't be worth it. **Pros of CS:** It's a much more challenging major and I view it as bringing better job opportunities. It's a more well known major and I will be learning much more things that may help me with my job later on. There aren't many pros for the CS major in my personal opinion except for it being a safer degree that brings more jobs. &amp;#x200B; My end goal is to be a developer for a few years and maybe switch careers to something more business-oriented.

I am not sure which school is best for me to attend to for my future career. Financially, an IIT admission counselor informed me last week I was chosen for the Collen's scholarship (last I checked it covers full tuition and 2 years of housing) so all I would have to pay for is books and things like that. For Purdue, all I have to pay is the federal sub loan $1,961 per year plus work in federal work study which is up to $3,000. Overall, only paying $4,961 per year (Miscellaneous, travel, books, and housing has been included already). I know it's a no brainer financially to go to IIT since for Purdue I would have to pay 5k a year in addition to making a purchase for new insurance. My parents are Hispanic so they want to pay for my education and are worried about my health so that's why I'm kind of factoring in expenses, but I know with my career as a cybersecurity analyst I can pay back my debt easily. I just want to know (you can compare it to computer science or engineering since I know my major is a bit new) which school is better for my career and my life. I am focused on my studies so that I can help my family, but I want to have fun too. I am planning on doing an overnight visit for IIT and will go with friends to visit Purdue. If you guys believe I should also attend IIT for financial reasons you can let me know that too. I'm just stuck on what to decide because I really like both schools, especially Purdue (dumb reason but no one in my school has ever decided to go there). I'm open to a big school as long as I can get a professor's help or academic assistance since I am very doubtful about myself. I come from a small school and never really been away from home.

Most students are familiar with AP testing but are unfamiliar with CLEPs and DSSTs. I highly recommend taking these your junior/senior year of high school or freshman year of college. Essentially, a CLEP/DSST test is similar to that of an AP course but you do not need to take the course offered by your school (and tbh, from what I remember from the only AP course I took, they are easier). The cost of these exams is $99 and it could potentially save you thousands. Check to see if your school accepts CLEPS/DSSTs here [URL . A lot of students thrive in a test-taking environment and this is a great way to challenge yourself and get rewarded. If you are a high school student, take a CLEP upon completing a course. If you take a biology class, take the biology CLEP. Take a psychology class, take the CLEP... you get the idea. I would assume that many parents would be willing to fund or at least help out if they are asked. If you speak a second language, it can be worth up to 12 credits (usually towards electives) costing less than 10$ a credit hour. I would also recommend taking the following CLEPs unless you know the college you are going to does not accept them. They all have very high pass rates and require little studying. You are taking a gamble either way but I believe the 99$ risk is worth the reward. CLEP College Composition (not modular) 81% pass rate  worth up to 6 hours CLEP College Math 76% pass rate  worth up to 6 hours CLEP Analyzing and Interpreting Lit  75% pass rate  worth 3hrs CLEP Principles of Management  67% Pass rate  3hrs DSST Principles of Supervision  95% Pass rate  3hrs Also, it is possible to study for multiple tests at the same time that counts towards different hours. (Once again, depends on your school) For example, if you are into computers I would take DSST Computing &amp; Information Technology  85% Pass rate CLEP Info Systems and Computer Appl  71% Pass rate DSST Management Information Systems  91% Pass rate &amp;#x200B; Here is an example of how much you could save at PennState.

PM me and I can help point you in the right direction or if enough people are interested I can make another post.

I decided to attend my state uni since it was known to be the most prestigious in the state and it was very much affordable. I managed to get a very very generous financial aid package that covers almost all of my yearly tuition, and since I have a part time work study job, my parents have decided to not worry about paying for my college tuition (except for dorm things). So thankfully, they've not had to worry about it which I'd prefer for it to stay that way. Thing is, when I looked at my financial statement in the campus bursa, I saw that there was a charge of ~$711 for tuition which remained after financial aid applied, which I was unaware of the cost till now. I looked it over and realize this might be how it is for the next four years, not even my work study and spending habits could cover the cost each year. The reason I didn't get a loan was because my parents did not allow for it since it builds up interest rates over time according to them, so we decided it would be handled by us (or me in this case). And just recently, I've had to drop a course I was inevitably going to fail for the semester which meant I had to pay back ~$800 for dropping it since I'm under a scholarship in-state. And I can't even afford to pay that back right now which means I might be temporarily barred from the scholarship next semester until I pay it back. Even worse, my parents don't know that I had to drop a course and was charged a lot for it. I've looked into Boro but they require a 3.0 GPA and I'm only in my first semester so I haven't gotten back my final GPA for fall, and I'm not sure I could even pull a 3.0 since I'm struggling in CS right now. And I'm not sure if University loans would be a good idea due to excess charges and interest. Is this a good idea? My parents would not be happy with this but I'm sure I could pay it off quick given the field I'm looking to go into (cybersecurity). I'd like to be able to do this without letting them know and dealing with this on my own if that's possible since I wouldn't want to burden them. If so, I'd estimate about $6000 which I think shouldn't be too bad. Thank you. Edit: Without a Co-signer in this case"

I have always enjoyed business and thought that was the option for me whether it be an entrepreneurship major or marketing or anything in that field. I mainly focused on business courses in high school and did not give much attention to STEM-related classes. I did take advanced courses in science and math but this year replaced those with business courses. I was in calculus but switched out for an upper-level accounting course and for science I took computer science one and am learning visual basic and C++. However, I have begun to realize that business is not the only option out there and I am very interested in electrical engineering but am worried because I am a good math student but I feel that not having taken calculus in high school I will struggle and math is already not my best subject (Mid B's on average). I am also interested in cybersecurity management and management information systems and was told to dual major in those. I am not 100% on what either of those entails so if anyone could tell me what those are like I would love to know. Business is definitely still an option for me and I enjoy it but I feel that I worked hard in other classes before my senior year and can achieve a degree that earns more so I can invest while I am young and have a greater ROI. A business major just seems to me like something that just takes common sense and is not where I should spend my money if I go to college. So to sum it up I basically want to know if I am wrong about business majors, what cybersecurity management and management information systems include and the success of anyone who didn't take calculus in high school but took it in college."

Can I get a tech job with a physics degree, or a physics-y engineering-y job with a math degree? ***** I only have a vague idea of what I want to do with my life, and I'm interested in a ton of different fields, including space exploration, alternative/renewable energy, quantum computing, academic math/science (mostly physics/astronomy), cybersecurity, intelligence, public policy, and possibly even high finance or tech, among other things. Because of that, I've been stressing out about the major combinations that give me the most flexibility regarding career choices. Like I've been considering combinations like [computational and applied mathematics + physics] or [mathematics with specialization in economics + physics] or [physics + math with specialization in economics + CS minor]. Several of these major combinations are possible, but they leave little room for electives outside of those majors. So I was wondering, how much does the name of your degree really matter? Can I just take a few classes in the subjects I'm interested in, and still be competitive for the relevant positions? One thing that I know will help me at least a little is that I am going to a relatively big-name school (UChicago, hence the username), but I also know that my school's name can only do so much. As a more concrete example of the kinds of things I'm considering, I'm interested in working for NASA on things like climate change and atmospheric science. I'm afraid that if one of my majors is not physics or geophysical science, then it will be difficult to get a job there, even if I've taken a few classes in atmospheric science. How true is that? Or, say, if I want to work for Google, but I have a degree in, say, physics instead of computer science, would that make things harder, even if I've taken relevant CS courses?"

I'm looking for guidance on how to be successful as I continue my education, as well as guidance on that particular major change.** &amp;#x200B; I've just finished my first year of college. I fell right into the stereotype of ""GT kid who did really well in high school and struggled a lot adjusting to college."" I also already had some pre-existing mental health issues which got bad during my senior year of high school, and I let my depression and anxiety get really out of hand during this past year. I will be honest - a lot of that struggle was at least partially my fault. I had a hard time reaching out to mental health services on campus, I did not stay on top of my coursework, and I had poor self-discipline in terms of my habits. However, I didn't party heavily, I ate fairly well when I could, and when I had a close brush with suicide I did reach out for help. This summer, I'm going to make a serious effort to save as much money as possible to support myself and my schooling, as well as receiving more serious help for my mental health. I'm also already working on a generalized scheduling plan for next semester so that I can get back on track. My declared major as of right now is Cybersecurity, and I've been doing basics for that during these past 2 semesters. Since early in the fall semester of 2018, I've been considering changing my major to Philosophy. I'm considering it for a few reasons. One, although I do love the world of cybersecurity and find it to be a fascinating field, I have found myself less and less engaged with the idea of pursuing that as an actual career. In addition, I have some personal ethical concerns about the most common places that cybersecurity majors are employed (various government agencies, and many major companies with questionable practices to that regard). Finally, cybersecurity does not incorporate many of the things that I find the most important and engaging in my own life - writing at a high level, reading, thinking about/discussing abstract ideas, etc. Philosophy is much more in line with those things, and covers a broad range of subjects that I find extremely engaging, important, and relevant. However, there are other things I have to consider: With the cyber track, I will be employable during and after my BBA, and likely not have to pursue additional schooling (besides industry cert programs). In terms of philosophy, I would likely be adding another year at least to my degree plan, and would also have to pursue a master and probably a doctorate. While I love the idea of being an academic and continuing my education to such a high degree, I do not know if I have demonstrated to myself that I will be able to be successful. In addition, I will likely make more money overall, and begin making money more quickly with the cyber track, whereas employment in philosophy will be sparser, and I will spend more time in academia. I do *want* to pursue something more in the lines of philosophy, but I am unsure if it is a practical option for myself and my future. So, my question is this: Does anyone with more experience in any regard have any guidance on what I should do moving forward, both in terms of my major, and in terms of general success in college?"

IT is already a good career and I enjoy it, but I feel like I'm not passionate about it. I'm passionate about the idea of using engineering to solve problems that help the planet and people though. I also think it might be a bad idea. I'd have to take the degree slower, part-time most likely. Most of my classes in IT would be useless towards the degree. It could take me years to get a Engineering B.S. when I could be focusing on a IT career. I think it would hurt me in the long run If I ended up wanting to pursue a tech career. If I could start over maybe I could dual major, but Im 26 know and need a steady livable wage so I can be independent. I feel like I'll need to be positive I want it, or it would be a waste of time, but I am very passionate about protecting the environment and I find engineering fascinating. Thoughts? anyone else go through something similar? If I pursued a career in Engineering but went back to IT, could that hurt my career outlook?"

Studying Cybersecurity. Currently at my very last semester until I graduate, already have a great job lined up. However, I've reached a truly terrible online class with a just as bad teacher. It's a introduction to reverse engineering class in Assembly. Why the class is insane: 1) The first two assignments were worth 43% of the class (first few weeks of 16 week class). Every assignment after is worth about 5 to 10% and way more difficult. I underestimated how the teacher grades so I received a terrible grade on the first assignment. Then the second assignment the teacher significantly docked me for things he did not specify were required. Thus failing both these assignments. 2) The teacher does not say how he grades assignments, so I'll spend 20-30 hours on an assignment which spans to about a 15-20 page report (screenshots included) and I'll get a 50%. Only for this assignment to be worth 5% of my grade. Not worth the effort but I'm doing everything possible to gain some points. 3) Lectures are very poorly done. Often nothing has to do with assignments. 4) Teacher is condescending when you email him ""You need to try harder"" and will blatantly ignore emails asking for help. Never seen others teachers do this. &amp;#x200B; So honestly panicking. Currently have a 45% in the class and it's my last class before I graduate in May.

I've been doing research on which country to study in and I still have a couple of questions as well as unable to make a decisive decision regarding this situation. So far, all I've completed is a high school GED as I've been busy with work and my life didn't provide me with the option to enroll in University until now. The major that I would like to specialize in is Cybersecurity, as it is my hobby, and I enjoy partaking in ethical hacking. Currently i'm leaning more towards studying in the most prestigious university that accepts me for a Bachelor's or Master's programme, regardless of the country that accepts. Although I have preference for Canada due to their post-graduation work permit (PGWP) which should make it easier for me to acquire a job in there post-graduation, as well as immigrate to Canada. In the other hand, the U.S degrees appear to be more prestigious and the most recognized, although affordable for me, they are still extremely expensive for an international student which I am, and it would be nice to save the extra money, if it weren't for the price and the difficulty of immigrating there, as well as lack of options for immediate post-graduates, It would be my main option as I've always felt like I'd easily fit in there and enjoy my time, not to mention I had a long distance relationship with a woman I loved very dearly there, that unfortunately ended due to the distance. Europe in the other hand, I have my eyes on Germany, Denmark, Switzerland due to their tuition costs and degree value, if I proceed with this I shall attempt to acquire a job in Canada/US Post-graduation as Cybersecurity jobs are far more prevalent and I have a biased preference of immigrating to Canada/America somepoint down the line, however I do love Europe and if there is a path to immigration post-graduation in the country that I study in, which I've listed above for european countries, then I may simply stabilize there and apply for jobs internationally (US, Canada, Europe) and take the best offer/approach.. Overall, with the points I've stated, I'm still indecisive regarding which path to take, and I need your opinions as well as any additional pros and cons of each country/continent that I may have missed. Any further insight would be appreciated, ranging from personal experience to research.

What can I do in my future college career to get back on track? A little back story: I graduated from undergrad in 2016 with a biotech degree. My gpa was almost a 3.0 (2.97- Fantastic, I know). After a few years of working, I decided I wanted to do a career pivot, and learning to do a bit of programming seemed like a doable task. I taught myself a few basic things off w3schools and felt confident enough to seek out a cybersecurity degree with my Alma mater. Well, turns out the introductory level course I signed up to take online was more advanced than I was lead to believe. The class progressively lead to me pouring all my free time into these classes (a lecture and a lab) - more so than was necessary. Dont get me wrong, Im not one to shy away from hard work, especially if its going to lead me where I want to be in my professional career. However, about halfway through the course another student who had helped me a few times stated that they were/had been helping me with knowledge they had gained through a lower level course prior to the one we were in. This weekend, I was struggling harder than ever and I felt completely lost, even more so than before. While I know programming is often troubleshooting and working hard on building something that actually works, I had had enough. I decided to take the WF and quit stressing so much about these courses, which honestly, werent really teaching me much about programming aside from the fact that Im a novice... which is why I signed up to begin with. I figured it would tank my GPA for anything post graduate related but I already had my biotech degree so I accepted my fate. Keep in mind this class was taken at the same school on a new degree track and I dont plan on going back to that school ever again. My question now is this: if I decide to go back to get an MS/ post grad studies in biotech field at another school (not my alma mater) or start at a new school for the same undergrad degree(cybersecurity/Infosec/NetSec), what can I do to mitigate the WF? Will my most recent decision ultimately be used to exclude me from future studies in both fields? I know that if I start in a different state that I can basically have a blank slate, but aside from that, do I really have a future concerning my educational outlook? Ultimately, Im less stressed due to my decision but, Im kinda feeling defeated right now. Im not sure what to do when I consider trying to further my professional biotech career/considering future educational experience."

I started out in financial management, switched to management in the 2nd half of that year, then I switched to graphic design because nothing actually interested me in business majors. The graphic design choice was because I was told that I was good at art and I love technology, so why not combine them i thought. This was all fine and dandy until i realized, after my 2nd yesr of college, that transferring from a community college to a university meant that I would have more than just 3 years of work ahead of me. They said it would be 5 years.... So I did the only sensible thing, (well, I thought so atleast) I switched to computer engineering (CE). Which, you guessed it, would also take me 5 years to complete even with the gen eds I had completed already. By this point I am nearly 50 credit hours in and on my 4 major. Not bad. So I continue and after 1 year of CE I hear about a new cybersecurity major at the university. I swap majors as I am not happy with the math requirements of the CE degree. This leads me to the present time. I am on my 5th degree choice, I now have approximately 100 or so credit hours and still have 3 years of school left before I get my bachelors degree. My main question here is: Why am I still not sure about my degree choice? Is it because I haven't had the chance to take any classes that are directly related to my degree field? Up to now, I have only taken freshman related engineering courses and one programming course (c++, which went horribly) and the rest were either gen eds or business/art classes. Needing some help with figuring out if what I am feeling about my degree choice is caused by not taking the degree fields classes yet or if I'm in the wrong degree. PS: Sorry for the long book."

I want to create software or even physical processes in business that make workflow smoother, meet corporate/local goals, improve value of services/goods offered. Honestly, I'd be fulfilled if I did these things without any relation to IT and/or programming. However, I'd like to take advantage of the benefits of my military experience and education. There is great demand in this area and many other hubs across the US for cyber experts. I'm exhausting my brain trying not to leave anything out of this pool of information. So... posted. &amp;#x200B; **TLDR**; What major (see bulleted list) should I choose based off of my interest in business and process improvement, and current certification and education experience.

I'm approaching the time in my academic career where if I want to switch majors I have to do it sooner rather than later. My school's major curriculum consists of 5 core classes for each major. &amp;#x200B; Originally I wanted to major in Finance and go on to do wealth management/financial advising or investment banking/equity research. But after getting real world experiences in those fields I'm pretty sure it is not for me. I am quite introverted and am terrible at sales which would be a huge disadvantage for wealth management/financial advising. Being an online student from a non-target school who should've been done with academics awhile ago, my background isn't prime choice for the equity research/investment banking field. Also I really don't want to live in NY and OMG the hours for the first few years. Though I am really good at finance and investment concepts. &amp;#x200B; Throughout the years, my interest in technology grew and I decided this is the field I wanted to be in. I decided to pursue a second bachelor degree in computer science at Auburn University. Eventually I want to get into cybersecurity or software development. If I wasn't so close to finishing my degree at the University of Massachusetts I would've simply walked away but I only have a year left so might as well finish. But since I probably won't be pursuing a career in finance, should I just switch over to Operations &amp; Information Management since it somewhat extends into Computer Science? &amp;#x200B; The Operations &amp; Information Management program would teach me basic SAP concepts and would make becoming a consultant in the tech industry a little viable. Also, a lot of the alumni that majored in this are management consultants. &amp;#x200B; Any advice? I just want to make the most of my degree.

I am looking to have a career in Cybersecurity. Both universities have a masters program in Cybersecurity; USF has a major/bachelor's program of business analytics with a concentration on cybersecurity. FIU, however, has a major/bachelor's program of general Information Technology with, what I researched, no courses relating to cybersecurity. I am not sure whether I should stay in my hometown, in my house, going to FIU, most likely paying way less than I would in Tampa, and getting a bachelors degree in general IT with little to no knowledge of cybersecurity and then going into their Masters program there, or go to USF in Tampa and do their concentration program and already have a good amount of knowledge to succeed in the Masters program of the subject. If I were to go to USF, my parents would not move in with me; I would have to live in a dorm and such, and therefore becoming more costly, and also not something my parents recommend doing given all I have at home and how privileged I am at the moment. Is it worth going to Tampa away from my home to do a bachelors program preparing me for the Masters coursework (costing way more because of living expenses) or better worth staying at my hometown and going to FIU, getting a general Information Technology bachelor and not being as prepared for the Masters coursework? If I were to go to FIU, would I fall flat on my face during the Masters coursework knowing not as much as I could know about cybersecurity if I were to go to USF? Thanks "

In my senior year, I dropped out twice; once to work a full time job and once to move my life across the state. I now have a GED. --- First Field: I have a longstanding interest in psychology, as Aspergers caused me to develop social skills by reading technical articles. I also have a fascination with psychoactive drugs and the effects they can have on minds, bodies, and groups. This makes my first interest in the field psychopharmacology/psychiatry, with the goal of being able to run or participate in research on legal and illegal substances to create recreational safe use guides and search for more medical uses of the drugs. This would take 6-10 years of schooling and a lot of in-field establishment before being able to work on projects of my choice/design. My second interest in the field is addiction therapy, as it fits the interests above, and Ive both been around and gone through addiction myself. This would take 2-6 years of schooling, and likely end up being a stepping stone into the above career. --- Second field: I have some training and freelance experience in computer science, an easier field in terms of schooling/starting/progressing by far, but not exactly my ""passion"" anymore. I have about even experience in web design/development, game design/development, cybersecurity (penetration testing), app development, and home automation. All of these take 2-4 years of schooling, though certificates are available for some. --- I'd be happy in any of these careers, but am concerned about my ability to go through the amount of schooling needed for the psychology based careers or find reliable work in the computer science ones.

My life is a fucking soap opera. So I will be transferring to a university in the fall and I have it narrowed down to two colleges. There is, however, a dilemma. As far as my academic goals go, I feel like I really want to study Cybersecurity. I attended vocational school while I was in high school and did a computer trade. I love computers and am really wanting a career in something like penetration testing or ethical hacking (though, even with studies under my belt, I am not a confident girl and I do not know if I could ever be good enough) because I find them absolutely fascinating. But is studying Cybersecurity worth it? There are only two colleges in my state that offer it (I believe) and the college I have chosen is around five hours from home (my mom died two years ago when I was eighteen and I have a hard time being away from my family for long periods of time, as I have deep fear of something happening to my dad when I leave. My mom died the day after I left for a two week vacation and it fucked me up for leaving home for any period of time). Not to mention the fact that I would, without a doubt, need to take out student loans to attend. By the time I have my bachelor's degree, I would be anywhere between 33k and 45k in the hole. I'm totally aware that it is nearly impossible to escape college without some kind of loan. But I have commitment issues and I have a feeling I might buckle under that weight. Also, living on campus stresses the fuck outta me. I would be an upperclassman, so I would get priority and could have a private room. Which is great when you have an anxiety disorder, extreme (diagnosed) OCD, depression, and anxiety induced insomnia. I have a shit cocktail of dumb as fuck mental health issues and it pisses me off. And, no matter what, it's really going to put a strain on me. Between my scholarship and financial aid, I have about 10k to 12k in fees each year, and that's not including any extra shit that might come up. Plus books. And the additional fee for living in a private room. But they offer up to a master's in Cybersecurity. And the second college does not offer it at all. They only offer a bachelor's to master's in Computer Science. Comp/sci is universal. But would I be at an advantage if I did Cyber over Comp/sci? This second college is about 90 minutes from my house. My sister lives 15 to 20 minutes from the college, so I could live with her (though I can almost guarantee this will put a strain on our relationship). Not to mention my dad visits the town twice a week to see his girlfriend, so I would be close to him and I could come home whenever I want. I would have to take out a maximum of maybe 10k in loans, and that's just really high balling it. There's a possibility I could graduate with little to no debt, which is incredibly awesome. Doubtful, but slight. It's not exactly what I want to study, but it's the smarter decision, that's for sure. I could also bring my cat. Who is my best friend. But might get eaten by my sister's dumb as fuck dogs. I don't know what the fuck to do. Do I do the fiscally smart thing and get a generalized computer degree? Do I follow my heart and go specialized? Stay close to home? Go far away? What are the advantages of Computer Science? What are the advantages of Cybersecurity? How employable is a computer science degree and what type of jobs can I get? There's a difference between googling it (I do it frequently because I obsess over this shit) and actually talking to real people about it."

My dilemma is whether I should do something that I am naturally good at or if I should do something that I am not as good at but that could lead to a more intellectually stimulating career. The trade off, of course, is that a degree in international business/studies will not net me as many jobs as a degree in Mathematics and statistics will. I also feel like international studies is taking the easy way out. What path do you think I should consider? "

I want to pursue a degree in information security or cybersecurity, whatever you would like to call it. I want to get A degree in computer science then specialize in information security. Right now I'm in the University of Delaware's seed program and it is holding me back. My real problem is that I am a first generation college student and I can't figure out which school I want to transfer to. My scores and GPA are good enough to give me good chances of admission into pretty much any state institution and I am willing to reach out to the nicer colleges."

I took up our EMT program because I wanted to do that for the longest time, however I withdrew due to almost failing out.. I am now deciding on pursuing psychology (as i've always wanted a job to help someone, and I have felt interested in psychology, as well as the fact I share some anxiety issues in the past as a younger child). However, a friend of mine is suggesting I try our new Cybersecurity course. Its a new course of a series of three classes that offers a certificate upon completion. I do sometimes find computer security intriguing, but not sure as I never wanted to do IT stuff in the past, but it may offer a better job, and I am typically good at computers. I might enjoy it more than I think.. Side note: I applied for a local University for the BA in psychology, but I don't have enough transfer credits, so I had to turn in my transcrips from high school, which means I probably wont be admitted as my past wasn't full of A's.... however, any psychology or support courses I take will definitely transfer to their degree program... I am just afraid that I won't be able to land a good paying job in this field... But part of me wants to find out why I have/had some anxiety and want to be able to assist others in this sometimes invisible issue that many suffer from but few actually express.. "

I have a lot of extra time to do the course work so i figure that ill double major but i'm not sure what to choose that would be best for a career in the tech field (specifically cybersecurity). Any ideas? I have also thought about going to law school after i graduate so maybe something that would help with that too.

After coming across a link on my new University's site about a new major, I am now somewhat interested in an IT-Cybersecurity degree. I am torn between this degree and the degree I had in mind for years before, Finance. One of the only things that is holding me back from going all-out IT is that I do not know the specific jobs I could eventually have with this degree. I certainly do not want to have an IT support desk job after acquiring a Bachelor's degree in IT, but is that where I might likely end up with a degree in Cybersecurity?"
