0,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Conq and his recovery time after dodging in a direction or after missing a light has too big of a window for GB vulnerability. Would shortening the time help and be fair?,1,i4e6ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/i4e6ck/conq_and_his_recovery_time_after_dodging_in_a/,2020-08-06 07:22:56,"Ive been noticing more and more lately how vulnerable conq is when it comes to dodging or even back stepping. Theres been plenty of times where youd think you cant get GB after so long but I find myself unable to counter it simply because its still in the vulnerability state. Personally I feel the recovery time for him needs to be adjusted not only for dodging but even for his lights. If you whiff one and miss, the GB window is insane, its like missing a heavy and getting GB because of it. Another thing I hope they adjust is the time adjusted so you can actually fake a Shield bash just to GB. I see often where they dodge and you think oh nice I can get a GB but they are able to counter it. I think these tweaks would polish conq and seems rather reasonable. Opinions on this?"
1,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha cannot be released in his current state.,1,i4r7ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/i4r7ur/aramusha_cannot_be_released_in_his_current_state/,2020-08-06 22:49:36,"Honestly I would say Aramusha was the most heavily annihilated by a lack of fine-tuning in this patch. Other heroes like Orochi feel deliberately and surgically destroyed to appeal to lower skill players, but Aramusha simply was not tested, at all. The damage of his blade bloclade attacks are nonsensically low, and are way too low reward for the vulnerability of the move. The damage of his neutral heavies seem acceptable at first glance, but the new speed of them is disgusting. Not only did they destroy any reason to use neutral heavies, but they have trampled over any sense of nuance. Aramusha has to have high damage because he has no unblockable, the moves need to be threatening even on block because he has no opener, but now his heavies are not dangerous in the slightest. His damage in the original Testing Grounds was slightly too low, and many people criticised this. So instead of just finding numbers in between the TG and live version that felt the most balanced, they decided to just make them slow enough to be in line with every other heavy in the game so they could slap him with the same damage as everyone else. These adjustments also gutted his ability to feint heavy attacks into blade blockade, which was incredibly useful. Overall most of the changes are fairly questionable but Aramusha is now objectively worse after the update and the devs should take a look at what they've done to the character. I really don't believe that they went through and looked at every character individually."
2,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Changing bash mechanic,1,i58xqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/i58xqx/changing_bash_mechanic/,2020-08-07 16:39:31,"What I'm suggesting is that all bash would be like centurion bash. All bash will have GB vulnerability, but if you missed the bash, you could throw a heavy, and continue your chain. This way, heroes that don't have a dodge attack are able punish the bash by prediction."
3,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Orochi Suggestions,1,i782rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/i782rz/orochi_suggestions/,2020-08-11 02:28:09,"Potential Orochi Buffs Now that I think no one can seriously claim that Orochi has lightspam anymore, we can now look at potential buffs for him without REEEEEE from casuals. ## General Buffs * Deflect Specialist * Smol Deflect: 30dmg * Beeg Deflect: 45dmg (as it's not guaranteed in 99% of cases) * Zone Deflect: 25dmg, can now zone after deflect to do an unblockable, armored zone to push opponents off him * Dodge on Deflect/Deflect Attacks: Orochi can dodge immediately after a deflect OR deflect attack, allowing more maneuverability and allowing him to respond to Hyperarmor moves. * For instance, if Orochi deflects a Raider opener heavy now, he will then eat a Raider heavy should he do a light deflect. Now, he will be able to do a light deflect, then *respond* to the Raider heavy by attempting a dodge, deflect, etc. This does not mean he will necessarily beat Raider outright, though, as Raider can then feint into a GB or such. Thus, a more interactive battle but not a simple ""Raider/Orochi wins."" * Side Heavy Buffs * Opener Side Heavies are 633ms * Finisher Side Heavies are 700ms and Undodgeable * Backdodge Attack * Increase damage of Backdodge Heavy attacks. They take time to come out and have numerous counters as well as being fairly risky. * Decrease GB vulnerability on Backdodge Light attack to 100-200ms. * Dodge Attacks are Enhanced. Side Dodge Attacks require Heavy input, and only give a heavy parry punish. --- NOTE that **I'm NOT saying give him ALL of these**, and some of these would be a lot less fun than others, but I wanted to look at several ideas to buff him and let people think about them. Additionally, I'll be assuming no new animations or moves can be added to him. ## Backdodge Stance Buffs An offensive buff that focuses on his backdodge heavy stance. This also increases his defensive ability slightly, but due to the slowness of the stance and its many counters it is unlikely to be significant. * Allow the stance to be usable from forward dodges. * Dodge Specialist: Orochi can now cancel any of his *landed* recoveries (blocked or hit) into a dodge (similar to his finisher recovery, albeit that can be done on whiff). * Right Side Heavy: now unblockable, 20dmg. * Left Side Heavy: has iframes 100ms-300ms (when he's ""spinning"") * Top Heavy: deals 30dmg, possibly feintable * Can dodge out of the Rush Attack at any point. ## Fast Lights Buffs If we want to return him to what he was before, as there are more counters to ""lightspam"" now and lights are wholly less effective. * Chain Lights are 400ms Omnidirectional. * Finisher Lights are 400ms Omnidirectional. ## Unblockable Light Buffs Another potential option is buffing Orochi's chain and finisher lights to unblockable. This would be akin to Black Prior's chain bash mixup, except 100ms more reactable, parryable, does not beat hyperarmor, does not drain stamina, can be beaten by fullblock/deflect/superior blocks/option selects, and does less damage. Alternatively, could do a mix of this and fast lights, making his chain lights 400ms Enhanced and his Finisher Lights unblockable. Even if you went to the extreme and made 400ms Unblockable lights, they would still be a wholly weaker version of BP's bash with the same reactability. But 500ms unparryable unblockable stam draining omni lights gud if they called bashes, look like a punch withyour offhand and you press GB to use them, JUST unblockable lights bad cuz they lights and lightspam ## Deflect in Chain Buffs Another idea is to utilize Orochi's current bashes: his impale strikes from his deflect. * Deflects attacks are usable from finisher recoveries if they landed (hit or blocked). * Finisher lights are enhanced. * Deflect Option Mixups: none of the deflect attacks are guaranteed, but can be used alongside his undodgeable dodge attack cancel from finisher recovery to cover enemy dodges. ## Top Attack Buffs Make his top heavy pseudo-unblockable. I don't know the new damage values for Orochi's attacks, unfortunately... * Orochi's Guaranteed Second-Light slash is now 10dmg. Opener Light reduced in damage to compensate. * Top Opener Heavy reduced in damage by 10. * Both Top Heavy Opener and Finishers can chain to double slash, regardless of hit or block (thus making his opener heavy pseudo-unblockable). Doing so with his finisher heavy acts as a chain as normal, thus can chain back to itself."

6,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,What are the known peculiarities of Bots?,1,if91k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/if91k5/what_are_the_known_peculiarities_of_bots/,2020-08-24 05:04:04,"I know that max punish testing shouldn't be done against Bots for various reasons, but I'm not sure what all of those reason are. Additionally, through some testing in the Training mode, I've discovered some other unusual things about Bots. I'll list them here, but I do want to know if there are other unusual points about them: * Bots can't buffer Guard Switch while ""Unbalanced"" (thrown down), which is one of the reasons why max punishes can't be tested against them * Bots always seem to parry on the earliest possible timing (parry window is 200ms long) * Bots always seem to parry about 100ms later if they must switch guard positions (Guardswitch), but Players aren't restricted by this as Players don't need to Guardswitch to parry * Bots set to ""Parry"" will never parry backstep heavies (that always whiff), but if you feint said backstep heavy into a GB, the Bot **will** try to parry it, **even if the backstep heavy would have whiffed had you let it fly**; this means that Backstep Opener Heavy -&gt; Hard Feint -&gt; GB against the Bot will always get you hit by an enemy heavy * Bots never change Guard Positions if their opponent does nothing. For example, their Guard would remain in Top until you throw out any sort of attack that requires a Guardswitch. Because of points #2 and #3, if you set a Bot to ""Parry"" in Training mode, you're Opener Heavy -&gt; Hard Feint -&gt; GB will always get stuffed by an enemy heavy if your Opener Heavy was in the same direction as their Guard. At least, that was the case when I tested with Tiandi (900ms Opener Top Heavy, 800ms Opener Side Heavies, same GB vulnerability on all) against Warden/Orochi Bots. But if you force the Bot to Guardswitch, suddenly Opener Heavy -&gt; Hard Feint -&gt; GB will catch their parry attempt. This issue is the same for chain heavies. If I did Right Side Backstep Opener Light -&gt; Right Side Finisher Heavy -&gt; Hard Feint -&gt; GB, I was always hit by the Bots parry attempt. But if I did Left Side Backstep Opener Light -&gt; Right Side Finisher Heavy -&gt; Hard Feint -&gt; GB, I would always catch the Bot's parry attempt. The reason I was interested in this is because Opener Heavy feint into GB had always seemed inconsistent against Bots, and now I think I know why. Tiandi's (any side) Dragon Dodge -&gt; Hard Feint -&gt; GB also follows the exact same rules against Bots. Are there any other known peculiarities of Bots? I know this isn't strictly Competitive, but knowing about Bot behaviour can be important if you intend to practice certain combos and possibilities in the Training mode, as well as knowing which types of punishes would work against Bots and which wouldn't."
7,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A Modest 6-piece Zhanhu meal with a free side,1,ig06s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ig06s1/a_modest_6piece_zhanhu_meal_with_a_free_side/,2020-08-25 09:08:34,"Having played For Honor for 1000+ hours and going through 10 reps of Zhanhu, I think it's fair to admit Zhanhu is a little lacking. Fortunately I think Zhanhu needs only a 6 small tweaks and 1 little addition to properly compete on par with the better heroes. 1. Zhanhu's Anti-Dodge Zone Attack currently: 600ms, 14 damage, 50 stamina Desired: 600 ms, 14 damage, 15 stamina It's usable mid chain, but takes more stamina than 4 heavies for half the damage of a single heavy, and Zhanhu has 120 stamina. 1 Zone is crippling, on top of that it's 600ms with an easily identifiable animation. Dropping the stamina cost to 20 still has it using 8 more stamina than a heavy, but lets it be more useful lol. 2. Zhanhu's side dodge lights currently: 400ms, 9 damage, 12 stamina, 333ms guard break vulnerability? Desired: 400ms, 9 damage, 12 stamina, 233ms guardbreak vulnerability I can't find the hard values on the guardbreak vulnerability window of Zhanhu's side dodge lights, but the consistency with which they can be guard broken in comparison to most other dodge attacks of its speed is too high for such low damage. If the Guardbreak vulnerability is actually 233ms rn, god help me send it down to 133 so Zhanhu isn't guard broken mid sword-swing. 3. Enhanced Lights I think every hero should have enhanced lights at this point, but the Enhanced Lights for Zhanhu would be necessary for the next point. 4. Infinite Alternating Side Guard ""Neutrals"" Desired: Left, Right, Left or Right, Left, Right with dodge recovery cancels; 500ms, 12 damage, 12 stamina Lights; 800ms, 29 damage, 12 stamina Heavies The purpose of this is to cut down on the predictability of Zhanhu's unblockable attacks and grant their kit more room to simply do more things for pressure. Nothing too drastic here either, simply reusing Zhanhu's neutral heavy and light attacks in an alternating chain, capable of linking off dodge attacks as well but following the alternating guard rule, as well zone attacks come from the right so alternate left, because of the next point. Non-obvious example: Left Light, Left Dodge ""Light""(attacks from right guard due to Zhanhuery), Left Heavy, Right Light OR Left Light, Zone, Left Heavy, Top UB Light 5. Zhanhu's Unblockable Light and Heavy currently: 2nd attack from neutral or dodge attack, 600ms 17 damage UB light, 900ms 35 damage UB Heavy Desired: 2nd attack from the same direction or top guard chain, 600ms 17 damage UB Light, 900ms 35 damage UB Heavy Playing off Zhanhu's new infinite alternating side guard chains, attacking the second time in the same direction, or with a top guard chain at any point, sends out the unblockable light or heavy working with dodge attacks and zone as well. Examples: Left Light, Left UB light OR Left Light, Right Light, Left Heavy, Left UB Light OR Forward Dodge Light, Right Heavy OR Left Light, Right Light, Top UB Light 6. Subduing Counterblow currently: Deflect Stun Bash that can ledge but confirms nothing Desired: Changed from deflect to parry counter, gains ability to wall splat, is not considered a chain starter I can use the deflect, but my reflexes will not ever deflect for subduing counterblow. It's simply not good enough for it when Zhanhu's dodge attacks have superior block and do confirmed damage. Changing it to a parry counter however would give Zhanhu more to use and do, with the ability to wall splat giving Zhanhu a heavy to start their chain with. No confirmed light. That Free Side. Zhanhu's Forward Dodge heavy currently: 700ms, 23 damage, 12 stamina Desired: 700ms, 23 damage, 12 stamina, initiable on forward or backwards dodge A version of Zhanhu's forward dodge heavy that trades its forward distance and tracking to dodge and counter an attack, retaining the ability to feint and chain. Zhanhu is, after all, a dodge attack specialist *and* a counter attacker. It only seems fitting they have a backwards dodge attack. Off topic: I don't really know what I'm hoping to accomplish by sharing my thoughts here. Somehow 1000+ hours isn't going to be enough, rep 10 is going to be too low, or I'll just be retarded, and even if none of that just straight up being ignored by Ubi. Or Zhanhu getting a nerf. I just want to have fun fighting Zhanhu instead of waiting for them to do something I'll punish and have more options other than feinting my unblockable heavy into a guard break as Zhanhu - with the crazy hope and dream this is something everybody can agree with, somehow.

Heavy Light combo= 24+4 = 28 Light Light combo= 12+4 = 16 Light Riposte= 6+12 bleed = 18 Light Deflect= 10+4 bleed = 14 Heavy deflect= 20+ 4 bleed = 24 Zone= 10+6= 16 (For some reason changed from 12+4??? an almost completely arbitrary change). Sickle Rain= 24+3+12 bleed= 39 At this point, they should just remove confirmed follow up attacks if they aren't allowed to have an advantage. I mean seriously, you're sacrificing your entire attack chain for an extra 4 damage on confirmed lights? You get more block damage chaining into a heavy, it's better just to mix-up for 5 block damage with more damage potential either way. Shinobi doesn't really have any significant edge in damage anymore other than range GB, which is a very impractical move now that just feeds revenge. Recoveries are too good, 100m GB vulnerability in chain, and frame advantage after heavy finishers leave hardly any windows to be range GB'd, even if you were Ranged GB'd, it would take a few to kill you. The deflect damage is absolutely pathetic. It got NERFED somehow. His deflect went from 29 to 24 after they ""buffed"" deflects.... And his light deflect went from 12 to 14.... His riposte also nerfed from 24 to 18. Anyone can achieve shinobi's double light numbers with a zone attack now. They are getting just as much damage off light parries as his heavy light combo. He gets 4 extra damage on a GB. His OOS punish has always been lower than average, probably one of the worst in the game, and has been overlooked because of his damage deflects.... well, what's the excuse now? Shinobi's damage numbers aren't special. They are average to below average for a character with a low health pool that's supposed to be a damage dealer. And his recoveries are still bad. Always gives up frame advantage on confirmed lights or sickle rain since it's a special heavy. He's just fuckin bad and gets worse with every update. He's not strong just because of double dodge and range attacks, those are his biggest weaknesses that somehow justify him being even weaker all the time. I get it, he's not allowed to be strong. Nobody in the comp community is supporting positive changes for the character. They only point out any strength and completely overlook weaknesses."

Shugo's Charged Heavy being GB-able but not Warden's charged SBs, while the GB vulnerability may benefit characters without a reliable ubBash those who has it definitely doesn't deserve it. SOLUTION: make the GB vulnerability only available to attack based-characters ex. Orochi, Berserker etc. Kensei has a variable heavy deflect per character. We know you guys are capable of such coding. 2. Shugoki's tradable lights was never as good as Crushing Counter lights and is made worse. SOLUTION: Bring the old back and/or make it a ubBash and increase dmg if traded. Just make its quality almost equal to a crushing counter. Every faction except samurai has a crushing counter hero. Which would make him like Black Prior and Warlord but still not as good. Delusional suggestions. 2b. If you can't give back Shugo's trading lights then give him a sumo hug/de or a headbutt from side dodge (functions like toe stab or like his punch or both) so he can do something against unpunishable bashes. JUSTIFY: people can't really complain about the hug because of its recovery. 3. If you don't want to give 2b. Sumo/judo stance! Like bulwark flip. He takes reduced damage and throw/flip them for dmg. Stances were the one of the best things ever added in the game. Why not make more?"
12,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,My take on how the Samurai should be balanced/buffed.,1,hsbxf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/hsbxf6/my_take_on_how_the_samurai_should_be/,2020-07-17 01:45:06,"Hello r/CompetitiveForHonor. I would like to share my take on how the Samurai need to be fixed. I had been running a series on r/ForHonor, and every suggestion I changed the next post with the added suggestion. I have now taken what I believe to have been the best ideas, cut the poor ones, added some of my own and described precisely how each one would work to the best of my ability. If any of these are unclear or I did a poor job explaining the changes that would be made to the hero, I would love to hear you tell me so i can adjust the post accordingly. I hope you enjoy my take on how each Samurai should be balanced: * Kensei: Enhance tracking on forward dodge heavy, to more effectively catch roll. Allow zone to soft feint to top heavy, would be undodgeable. Allow side/forward dodge after chained attacks, allowing a dodge forward to gb. * Shugoki: Decrease back breaker recovery to 1000ms Make headbutt softfeintable to Demons Embrace. If not feinted, the headbutt will deal 10 damage. Allow headbutt to chain to Demons Embrace, guaranteed if opponent is walled. * Nobushi: Kick will be given a new animation. Instead of leaning against her staff, Nobushi will perform a kick far more reminiscent of Tiandis kick, to allow her kick to feel more natural. Nobushis Sidewinder Form may now be soft feinted to kick. Kick is now 500ms Kick may be softfeinted into a backstep sweep by using heavy during kick startup. This will be 400ms and gbable during the first 300ms. Dodgeable, but not interruptible as she will have I-Frames while performing it. Upon connection, Nobushi may use light attack to link to a light impale which would deal 7 base damage and trade in a stack of bleed for 4 flat damage per bleed stack and perform a special kill animation. Zone may be soft feinted into HS. Allow for Nobushi to exit from HS from any guard direction. * Orochi: Allow end of chain heavy to be soft feinted into deflect punish, end of chain light may chain to deflect punish upon landing. Add a dodging heavy attack, at 700ms Allow chain to link to dodging light or heavy Allow a kick from Storm Rush which, if dodged, leaves Orochi vulnerable for 600ms. This kick would use Tozens animation, would be 500ms, and guarantee a light attack. Any attack following this kick would also be considered end of chain, which allow linking to the deflect punish mentioned earlier. Left heavy attack from Storm Rush now has I-Frames. * Shinobi: Increase distance of backflip, will be half the distance of Pre-Nerf backflip. Sickle Rain heavy (chain heavy) is undodgeable. On front roll, the deflect light punish will be added here, with the exception of it being blockable/parriable. This light attack being 450ms. Allow heavy to chain to zone leading to Sickle Rain (ie. once Shinobis zone is cancelled, he may perform a heavy attack that would lead to sickle rain in connection). After a parry, Shinobi may dodge which will act as the double dodge, along with all the benefits that brings. Additionally, Shinobi may dodge forward to perform a mock deflect. The animation of passing through his opponent will not deal damage. He will have access to both the kick and light attack, both of which will be punishable upon heavy parry, unpunishable on light parry. The light will be a 450ms light, the kick will act identically to his double dash kick, with the same amount of vulnerability if missed. Finally, the mock deflect will allow for chain heavy, which would lead to Sickle Rain upon connection and not be guaranteed on heavy or light parry. Make ranged gb reversal and ranged heavy parry no longer knock Shinobi to the ground. He will now be reeled in, and be considered guard broken or heavy parried depending upon the initial action by Shinobi. * Aramusha: Soft feint top heavies to head bop; side heavies to top heavy (which will allow for soft feint to head bop, also reducing the amount of time for top heavy to go through to 650ms). After soft feinting to light attacks Aramusha may now kick as a chain finisher. This can wall which guarantees a heavy from Ara. Allow Aras zone to be soft feinted to head bop. * Hitokiri: Revert to Pre 2.19.1 - 2.19.3 Hito, with minor improvements. Zone now has super armour which activates at 200ms. Hitokiris uncharged heavy deals 32 damage, Endless Myriad deal heavies deal 25 damage."

I honestly don't know who is dumber anymore the devs or the community ""we don't want conq shield spam"" ""ok lets remove his other options, so shield bash is his only viable option anymore"" like honestly were is the logic behind this ""we don't want people to be able to parry and not be gb-ed for falling for a feint"" ok so a mechanic that was made so the game forced you to play different against a character was stupid? is Nuxias traps stupid then? No because you can light her out of them. Conquerors heavies added something new to the game, he can't hardfeint, but you can't gb him either, so you would have to parry instead of gb-ing. Isn't that the same rule for unblockables in a different perspective, you can't block so you have to parry, and conq was, you can't gb so you had to parry or block.

15,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Few Orochi key improvements,1,gxpcwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/gxpcwf/few_orochi_key_improvements/,2020-06-06 21:32:44,"**This improvements are after TG changes are implemented.** ***^(Which means every attack will have 100ms hidden indicator.)*** 1. Lighting strike, Zephyr slash and Riptide strike are 533ms, enhanced and has medium hitsun. 2. Lighting strike has more forward moment. 3. Finisher lights are enhanced.

Storm Rush animation is sped up. * Total stamina cost will be 30. **^((From entering and landing))** * Top, Right and left are 500ms. * Increasing the feint window. **^((Can feint even when the indicator shows).)** * Increase the block stun so the opponent cant dodge out of the following light or heavy chain. *What make Storm rush bad is the animation of the running from your stand point to enemy is slow. Sped it up as fast as shamans leap attacks. Storm rush will be viable.* 13. Changing the Riptide strike input to Backwalk **^((L analog))** \+ R1. *Since back dodge has high GB vulnerability, it makes Riptide strike move useless in close range. This will give Riptide strike 100ms GB vulnerability, how it should be.* 14. Pommel strike / Palm strike / Tozen kick / Kick * 600ms, create distance between yourself and opponent. **^((2.5 meters))** * Bash itself will do 10 dmg, no stamina dmg. * Can be cancelled by dodge * 600ms recovery. **^((Can't be punished or GB'ed))** *Input is GB after heavy. Since many people find light bash light or bash from neutral boring or find them same as play style. I will give it different play style like Tiandis kick. It will create distance for Orochi so he can get into storm rush without being interrupted by an attack or GB.*"
16,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Not Fully Serious, Just a Thought to make the game diverse/cool while still being balanced",1,gxujpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/gxujpz/not_fully_serious_just_a_thought_to_make_the_game/,2020-06-07 02:55:18,"I was reading through the sub, and had sort of an epiphany with how gameplay could possibly be made a little more balanced, and also more fun for the player. In my opinion, there are three main viable offenses, and they kind of counter each-other in almost a Rock Paper Scissors way. Bashes - Countered by dodge attacks, counters hyper armor Hyper armor - countered by bashes, counters dodge attacks (sort of but let me do this its the only way to support the narrative) Dodge attacks - countered by hyper armor, counters bashes I feel at this point that lots of people agree that these tools should be normalized among the cast, but I feel like that would make this a game where everyone played the same move set with different looks. I feel theres a way to diversify these things while still keeping it balanced. I think that every character should get 1 of these, and the thing that should be normalized throughout the cast is an unblockable heavy or light finisher. Instead of Assassin, vanguard, heavy, hybrid, there should be 3 classes to match the 3 types of offense. Something simple to match the 3 main offenses without straight up calling someone a bash character like: Characters with bashes: offensive (these are a balance between offense and defense) Characters with dodge attacks: defensive (because these are the most defensive types of offense) Characters with hyper armor: Aggressive (pure offense) But LaNerdJR, what about option select? If unblockable heavies are the only thing normalized, then what will happen when everyone with a bash just wins? Well, this idea goes in play with the testing ground changes, with light speed ups and other such things, this way everyone has a tangible opener while also being balanced. And the only way for this to really work is if *DUN DUN DUN* O p t i o n s e l e c t i s r e m o v e d I know, insane, but hear me our. Option select is kind of a shit show anyway, and makes unblockable attacks almost completely discarded, especially with bash options selects like black prior or glad, or the insanity that is conq. This would allow true 50/50 reads that would implement the same ideas that testing grounds is putting it, that is to make the game less of a turtle defensive staring contest. Some specifics: Bashes, as to not be a bash and a dodge attack at the same time, can only be used when dodging forwards. This is a heavy nerf, but I think taking out guard break vulnerability on all bashes should balance it nicely, as not only small damage dodge attacks the only usable counters, which leads to another question. Wouldnt a bash attacker just destroy a hyper armor attacker since it counters? No, this kind of turns the idea of these tools on its head. With these implementations, bashes, hyper armor, and dodge attacks would be more of a use on the side, with normal attacks and unblockable attacks being the focus with the removal of option select and addition of testing grounds. This way, people can still win against their counters, while still having this fun, balanced Rock Paper Scissors gimmick. I know this idea probably has a lot of holes, but Ive been playing for almost 3 years and I think this would make the game a lot more fun and balanced. Please leave any criticism, critique, or anything like that in the comments, and maybe help build and expand the idea, or just say hi. I hope you enjoyed my idea!"

18,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,My reaction to June 9th Warrior's Den and it's hero balancing changes and Cent rework,16,gzs1dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/gzs1dq/my_reaction_to_june_9th_warriors_den_and_its_hero/,2020-06-10 03:45:07,"So the changes are finally out in the open, meaning that many players will be ranting on about how they think the changes are bad for the game and how they should be like this and blah blah blah... So before they get there, I'll be doing exactly that. *Also, I'm doing this from memory, so forgive me if I get something off.* # Centurion Rework I'm going to be skipping over most of the non-italic changes, since they're basically the same as how it was in the testing grounds. **Zone is now target-swappable.** This is very... new. This is not something that I ever expected from the devs, since it's never been done once to a zone IIRC. But this should certainly make it a better tool in anti-ganks, which is neat. **Quick throw is replaced with jab after light...** really? I mean, I'm not crying over the removal of quick throw(it wasn't useful... period), but considering all of Cent's other changes, you wanna make him more like Hitokiri? It seems unnecessary, especially since Cent's heavies are variably-timed and cost half the usual stamina(6 instead of 12) AND he's got the largest stamina pool in the game. All I'm saying is that this is unnecessary, and would only make him very easy to spam with. **Chain to jab after parry counter...** okay this is actually an incredibly good change. It's not something I was expecting, but it changes a lot. It would allow Cent to access his pounce attack from a parry counter into a wallsplat. It could also be more usable than the kick after a parry counter, which didn't contribute to much other than draining stamina further. It's far better, just saying. **Centurion's forward strafe speed and forward dodge distance is increased.** Quite simply, I can understand this entirely. He's a close-range melee-oriented type character, so this does make sense. Now I could have gone without the heavy opener and light opener range buffs(they reasoned that Cent was a close-range character when they buffed his forward strafe speed, but then they did this?) It's simply counterproductive, but I'm not exactly opposed to the range buffs to the attacks. **Range buff and speed buff to dodge heavy.** Speaking of range buffs... finally! This dodge heavy actually has range. It's also faster. Personally, I would've gone with more damage instead of speed, but this is also good. Now I'm hoping that they also fixed the guaranteed jab after a landing dodge heavy, but they didn't exactly cover that, so what you gonna do? **Legion Kick is now 500ms**... goddamn it. The devs wanna make all heroes unique to each other, but then they do this? Legion kick HAD to be sped up, that much is true. But does it have to conform to the other bashes? Could they not do something a bit special, like make it 566 or 533ms but give it a lot more range, or hide the bash indicator a bit(like Raider's stunning tap). But, what's done is done, and the kick is now more viable. Now I'm going to have to wonder if they got rid of the chaining into a finisher heavy after a whiff if they're going to make it 500ms. EDIT: Oh, and they didn't seem to widen the dodge input window for his legion kick, so it's still worse than the other 500ms neutral bashes. &amp;#x200B; # Other Heroes **Jormungandr's opener heavy hyper armor nerfed down to Warlord levels...** Are you serious? His heavies had one thing going for them, and that was the HA. You go ahead and take that away and you've got shit. Why. Would. You. Do. That? And no compensation, because of course. **Jormungandr's punches now have less stamina drain/stamina regen pause...** Now they didn't give out that many numbers(they gave out none, actually), so I can't tell you if the nerfs are too little or too much. But considering that, once again, the only things the punches had going for them were the stamina drain, this thing with no compensation is kinda disappointing. But then again, **Jorm's also having his heavy-feint-into-GB range buffed,** so I guess that's the compensation, so it's fine. **Jormungandr's dodge heavy hyper armor is SEVERELY nerfed down(now starting 700ms into animation instead of 100ms).** This is EVEN WORSE THAN THE OPENER HEAVY NERFS. Are you kidding me? If the opener heavies relied on the HA to be okay, then the dodge heavy was entirely dependent on its HA. You take away that HA, the dodge heavy is weak, slow AF, and doesn't even have that much range or tracking considering the other things I listed. This is bad. Simply said. I never saw anyone complaining about Jorm's dodge heavy HA. And unsurprisingly, they are blind to the fact that Hamaar Slam deals way too much fucking damage. &amp;#x200B; **Hitokiri's HA on his opener heavies is removed...** wait, what? Are you serious? Wasn't that Hito's whole fucking niche? That she had HA on her openers? Then it turned out very overtuned at release, so they nerfed it? And now they straight up removed it. Way to make her more boring. **Hitokiri's finisher light chain speed is reduced to allow people to dodge it and the finisher lights are no longer enhanced.** It just gets worse. The whole special thing about Hito's finisher lights were how fast you could chain into it, and its enhanced properties were to make anti-ganks more tolerable(that's my idea, I guess). So what they do is completely neuter the chain speed because people couldn't block, and they got rid of the enhanced property because... I don't know, there's no rhyme or reason behind either of these changes. **Senbonsakura is now parriable...** Okay, is this an april fools joke two months late? Senbonsakura is very strong and annoying, that much is true; it needed a nerf, that much is also true. But this... is the wrong way to go. I said that the above change w/ Hito's finisher light was neutering it, but this is a straight-up euthanization. It's now a near-worthless tier-4 feat that can only be used in ganks, and even then barely. If they wanted to nerf Senbonsakura, maybe they should've touched the 200 damage and nerfed it down to 150... just enough to nuke any hero without perks or shields, or nerf the cooldown. BUT NOT THIS. And of course, they don't touch the kick-into-heavy and the sweep still being weak af... oh wait, they nerfed the sweep's HA as well. So a crappy offensive option is made even crappier. &amp;#x200B; **Shugoki's HA on his opener lights is reduced by 100ms and his HA on his opener heavies are reduced by 33ms.** You know what... this is fine. I always thought that, at the release of Shugo's rework, that the HA on his opener lights was always a tad too much, so this isn't that bad. The HA change on his heavies is... weird... but I guess it works with his variable-timing, so not bad. **Shugoki's hug recovery is now reduced to 800ms from 2000-- HAHAHAHAHHAHA** of course they didn't touch that. Out of all the things that Shugo needed, they left his 2000ms recovery which allows players to roll, then attack him all while Shugo's still recovering! They didn't touch that!? &amp;#x200B; **Jiang Jun's HP is reduced to 140(from 145) and Lawbringer's HP is reduced to 140(from 150).** . .. ... ...This isn't a joke? I can't believe that. They take a look at JJ's and LB's viability, see that they're doing pretty good(and that LB was doing way too good for all the wrong reasons), and what do they do? NERF THEIR HEALTH POOLS. Now I'm one for standardizing some mechanics for the sake of overall game health, but that was mechanics: side dodges, back dodges, opener GB vulnerability: I was fine with that. But this is unacceptable. When you're faced with the problem of ""Oh, heroes are having trouble with damaging these tanky heroes because they can't get through their defensive option-selects"", you should obviously see the problem here. Now JJ isn't much of a culprit here, but LB? Well, I'll cover that now. JJ's health was fine, I've never heard anyone say that he's too tanky. Now this isn't going to focus on JJ, but I'm just going to say that this was unnecessary and it fixes nothing for JJ. LB however... everyone hates him because of his parry options AND his shove, and I can't blame them. But the devs saw that, and said ""Oh, his health(the highest in the game) needs to be nerfed down to the same level as a raider."" What? It doesn't solve the strength of his parry options and his shove. Maybe, just maybe, instead of standardizing LB's HP down to a raider's, they should've... I dunno, fix the actual problem? Like, for example: * Make the parry impale 10 damage again, but cut its carry range in half * Blind Justice no longer chains into that guaranteed light, but Blind Justice now deals 38 damage and can now chain into his chain heavies and lights to finally make use of his bash mix-up(and throw in some HA on the Blind Justice, because why not) * Speaking of shoves, lower the recovery of his shoves so that LB can actually be punished by dodge attacks and GBs(just reduce it by a bit to 600ms from 400ms, so that it's always punishable by dodge attacks, but it takes better timing to deal with the shove); that way it can still be used to interrupt and charge through attacks, but they can no longer be only punished by other bash-type heroes) They should've done that as opposed to nerfing his health pool! &amp;#x200B; ...Okay, so that's all I can cover now, I can't remember anything else from the stream. If you can tell, I was getting a bit heated by how many mistakes these changes make(the hero balancing especially... the Cent rework is actually incredibly good) Anyways, that's that, hopefully they release some patch notes that give us a good look and some of the smaller balancing changes that they made."
19,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Centurion Rework First Impressions of Strengths and Weaknesses,8,gztj4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/gztj4o/centurion_rework_first_impressions_of_strengths/,2020-06-10 04:59:20,"This is being posted before the rework is actually live and will not be 100% accurate, this is merely an analysis of strengths vs weaknesses that are currently foreseeable or assumed to be true. Strengths * 50/50 with decent damage range (15-25-35 damage for lv1 jab, GB, and lv3 jab respectively, excluding haymaker) * Kick is now fast enough to be useful and pauses stam regen * UB chain pressure * 500ms standardized chain lights * GB immune recoveries due to Jab as a recovery cancel * Zone can now properly option select without trading Weaknesses * 50/50 may be avoidable, unpunishably, with some bask step lights (requires testing to confirm) * Even with the hyperarmor on Eagle's Talons, the other punishes will be easily interrupted so he'll be like a Warden in team fights just feeding revenge with the bash then being interrupted out of damage overall harming his team in a competitive scenario * Charged Jab no longer goes through Revenge armor (at least they said that it shouldn't on the stream) * OOS punishes are significantly decreased (he'll probably get 2 heavies for 50-55 damage + the 50/50 pressure after) * Kick has poor recovery and is highly punishable * Kick has high stamina cost relative to similar bashes (25 base cost, relative to 15, and 44 stam on whiff) * Kick has one of the most obvious animation of the 500ms bashes and will be easier to reaction dodge than similar bashes * Kick has an input window of 300-500ms into the forward dodge meaning that a late dodge on the early kick timing can also dodge the delayed kick timing * No dodge attack, and therefore no defense against bashes with good recoveries * Poor range * Poor hitboxes on anything but his zone, which has poor range * Roll catcher is too slow to reaction roll catch, and requires a ""soft-read"" (I'm taking Zer0\_craic's, AKA Brogla's, word for that from his stream today because I'm not very familiar with roll catch timing) &amp;#x200B; **The 50/50** The 50/50 will probably be GB punishable 100% of the time like Hito's and Warden's bashes so the damage of the mixup is 15-35 and is punishable by 15-40 damage with an average GB punish of 30ish damage, so in terms of damage it favors the defender in most matchups. The 50/50 might still be backstep-lightable as a way to avoid damage by a portion of the cast like Hitokiri's bash but this needs to be confirmed. In team fights the punishes will be easily interrupted by an enemy teammate making the fully charged jab the prefered option in team fight due to Eagle's Talons hyperarmor so the opponent can just decide to dodge on that timing every time and let their ally cover. Similarly his gank potential is worsened because, from a risk to reward perspective, the fully charged jab is an instant death sentence and it will be safer to always dodge the fully charged jab and risk getting GB'd because it won't be a one shot. **The Legion Kick** The kick has a poor recovery and is GB able on a reaction dodge (Cent can throw a heavy to beat this out), which people are likely to do because it has one of the more obvious animations relative to Warlord, BP, and Conq's bashes. The kick also only has a delay window from 300-500ms meaning that a late dodge on the early kick timing can early dodge a delayed kick. Better than it was but is, imo, the worst of the 500ms bashes. I've seen it posted recently so I'll clarify this too: The kick has 400ms of GB vulnerability and can NOT be used to reliably beat out feint GB as a dodge parry option select (the kick itself only has 100ms of gb vulnerability but is input 300ms into the forward dodge and therefore totals to 400ms). &amp;#x200B; Again this is a ""first impressions"" sort of thing not a matter of fact, some of these may turn out to be untrue. That said he will probably be mid-tier, around where Hito is, and not be a competitive pick in Duels, Brawls, or Dominion, but he has been significantly improved over his state for the past few years and will probably continue to be meme picked at all levels of play."

His offense, (or lack thereof) is stemming from all of his attacks being easily reactable, and by speeding them up TG changes do, he'll flow a bit better I hope. Of course, it's still gonna be risky and he'll lack an opener, but his dodge forwards top light will be sped up immensely which should help. Maybe. And his dodge attacks. . . they're just shit. Whilst Tiandi's Tiger dodges are extremely good dodge attacks defensively in comparison, what with being able to bait guardbreaks and punish them, punishing low recovery bashes and having alright i-frames if delayed, Zhanhu's are just sad. They feel like they have more guardbreak vulnerability than they have i-frames, and the fact that they have a set timing of 400ms into the dodge feels very clunky. Though, the TG changes will make them less punishing on your stamina and a bit harder to react. His dodge recovery cancels are also just sad, he doesn't flow at all. Why can't they be as good as Tiandi's? I know this is beating a dead horse at this point, and I got a tad off track, but even though his kit is as faulty as it is I think the speeding up of his attacks the TG changes will effectively do is going to help his mix-up become a bit more viable as the devs hopefully intended, but I'm still left mourning over him."

27,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"""Justifying"" ranged attacks by rebranding them as chase-down. Shinobi rework: improve fundamentals, make ""ranged"" attacks inline with chase-down instead of hypocritically removing all of it when he has no chase-down.",2,ge0wms,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ge0wms/justifying_ranged_attacks_by_rebranding_them_as/,2020-05-06 02:26:27,"I shouldn't even have to ""justify"" ranged attacks, because shinobi isn't even the best ranged character in the game, it's shaman, who's supposed to be a short range character, but undermines Shinobi's entire ranged kit and is better in every way. Other characters, like Shaman, also have off-screen attacks, and she gets far less risk and much more utility out of her ranged attacks that serves as chase-down, where as Shinobi's ranged kit is completely shut down by being aware of him and acknowledging his presence. There's an argument to put a GB indicator on ranged GB, but then it would completely remove the element of surprise from his kit and he would just have to punish recoveries, which is becoming increasingly harder with 100mg GB vulnerable chains, dodge recoveries and faster finisher recoveries, which would give range GB a very tight niche window that you can't base a character's viability on. And those options also complete remove Shinobi's identity as well. Ranged attacks don't actually work in Shinobi's favor in the net risk/reward of his kit. I think being put on the ground for a max punish for a heavy parry is enough evidence to support that claim. I want to get into some basics on improving Shinobi's fundamentals with a rework, but before I do, we have to talk about balancing his ranged attacks. Instead of putting a GB indicator on range GB, or removing it, how about just removing sickle rain and replacing it with a regular heavy? The attack value's don't make sense, it gives Shinobi bad recoveries on the heavies that do hit. It's a cool move, but maybe he shouldn't chain into it on a range GB and should instead chain into his heavy opener. This also gives less time for the opponent to be ganked. But when it comes to ranged heavies and countering a ranged GB. Shinobi needs far less risk, but to be punished consistently. So here's the options I see. * Range counters reel him in to point blank for a normal heavy parry punish, which may need animation changes (preferred). Note, you could also have more potential to ledge Shinobi with this option. And this make's his ""range"" redundant when countered as it would be punished the same as Shaman's leaping heavy. * Damage tax on ranged counters takes maybe 10-15 damage, but a lot faster recovery and maybe can get an extra light in on closer counters netting a max of around 30 damage with wake-up trade risk. Either way he needs a lot faster recovery, Shinobi has too much risk in his kit, that's why he's forced into a corner of having to play like a bitch staying out of GB and punish range on ranged attacks or dodge attacks. So what if we actually balanced the character so that he could reliably dodge attack in GB range without interruption and throw ranged attacks without a crazy amount of risk. Which brings me to my next point of balancing his kit. The single biggest change Shinobi needs is to be able to access his dodge attack chains from a single dodge and being able to mix up the timings with a double dodge. For example, you could single dodge kick for 100ms GB vulnerability on a dodge attack and go forward 500ms bash opener or 600ms from neutral, and this could be mixed up with a double dodge timing of his current kick being 1200ms from neutral. This would essentially be the same thing as a double/quad dodge mix-up, but streamlined into a single/double dodge mix-up. And, it seems fucking crazy to me, but Shinobi has no chase-down and can't reliably catch rolls or running opponents, which is completely overlooked because he's usually the one forced to run away because of how bad he is. His heavy attacks from his dodge chains should be undodgable. I also think that deflects should get iframes for all assassins, not just Shinobi, it only makes sense. And I just want to point out a few bugs while I'm at it. There's a collision issue with his kick that was covered up by super armor, he is staggered out of his kick when the enemy has forward movement on attack startups. After his chained roll, there's a bug that causes him to unlock and he can eat a heavy in this window. He can GB'd in the MIDDLE of his slide tackle, and that move is almost useless now because of how slow it is. Doesn't make any sense why WL got 500ms and a ton of range to be unpunished and higher net damage and ledging utility, but Shinobi's got nerfed into the ground. Also want to point out that deflects and Slide tackle have a 5 second stamina regen pause which should be removed, and slide takes half his stamina... And his dodge attacks are half as useful as tiandi's and cost twice the stamina. And Yama Uba useless now and needs a buff because it's the worst heal feat in the game objectively. Dealing 120 damage heals 24 hp, averages around 2-5 hp per hit. Bounty hunter is a better feat as well as every other heal feat."

I know the ins and outs this hero. Seeing the game is starting to go more offense based i would like to see Aramusha a complet overhaul. Now that Aramusha lost his 100 ms heavy gb vulnerability he cant really turtle anymore. He has a lot of tools but it is hidden in the blade blockade (bb). I would like to bring out those unblockables and bashes to be able to use from neutral and from chains as well. First off remove bb completly, it has very little to no use right now, since the meta is bashes and unblockables. Reduce neutral side heavy dmg to 33 800 ms.No longer guaranteed top heavy after heavy parry. Top heavy is 800 ms 30dmg, gb guarantees top heavy. Reduce side deadly feints to 12 dmg. The two side unblockables from bb are now top unblockable heavy chain finisher without the hyper armor dealing 30 dmg 900 ms, no longer feint into deadly feint.The top heavy from bb is removed it is very incosistent. Kick is avaible from forward dodge gb. 500 ms No longer wallsplat,drain stam and stun, instead gaurantees a light. Can not be punished with gb, can be punished with a dodge attack on read. Ring the bell is avaible from parry( input is gb after any parry) ,also from gb(light input). Reduce zone stamina cost,zone can be feinted into deadly feints.Forward dodge side heavy attack has more side step and i frames to avoid certain bashes and attacks on read. Oh and replace rock steady with something else. I know that takeing away certain mooves breaks the hero concept, but when something is useless it is much healthier to remove it. Compare to other full blocks Aramushas is on negative level."

Having fought a lot of bash spamming BPs and Wardens, turteling conqs or being brutally ganked while playing an assassin because of buggy (?)

Everthing is treated like a Heavy Parry; &amp;#x200B; Reflex Guard: Reflex Guard stays up 1400ms and gets refreshed on Block; &amp;#x200B; Blocking: Blocked Light Attacks have 3 points of Chip Damage; Bocked Heavy Attacks have 8 points of Chip Damage; &amp;#x200B; Guard Breaks: Decrease the time window to react on a GB (by counter GB) by 66ms, also decrease the stun time by 100ms; &amp;#x200B; Bashes: Every Bash gets 700ms GB vulnerability; Stamina Damage: Reduce all Damage to Stamina by 30%; &amp;#x200B; The changes should weaken turteling and make offense a little stronger without harming any Class identity. More vulnerable Bashes should even out the power disparities between bashless chars and chars that can spam Bashes. As does the enhanced Chip Damage. The change to GBs aims to make them more of an offensive tool while weakening their impact in terms of damage a little. What are your thoughts?"

Unsurprisingly, I'm going to propose two buffs and a nerf to every single hero, including the ones that are top-tier and shit-tier, in the hopes that they would become healthier for the game; at the same time, I'll give a short sentence to explain why I chose this change(hopefully it's short). These buffs/nerfs will be: 1. Changes to an entire mechanic, stance, or special attack 2. A not-so-simple expansion to the hero's moveset 3. Or a simple speed or damage change Whether or not you agree with these changes is up to you, and you can comment your protests or suggestions to make them better. Let's begin with the Knights. *DISCLAIMER: This is also done under the idea of the Testing Ground changes, most importantly where the attacks have some of their indicators hidden and the parry changes.* &amp;#x200B; # Warden **Buff** * Make his side chain lights 500ms *Considering that Warden has only three attack chains, giving him 600ms chain side lights with no special properties only serves to make him bash-focused.* * Add a HLH chain to Warden *Speaking of a lack of attack chains... he's already so basic that a monkey could play as him, so another attack chain would be a step in the right direction.* **Nerf** * Get rid of his shoulder bash from a back dodge *An extremely defensive move that only gives Warden an easy tool for turtling.* &amp;#x200B; # Conqueror **Buff** * Allow Conqueror to side/forward dodge and block lights while in his charging stance without losing his charge *One of Conq's three stances, his charging stance, should not be so easily negated by dodging away or by throwing lights.* * Make Conq's chain bash 600ms(from 800), and give it a bigger delay window *Another relic of the old game, much like Nobushi's kick before it was 600ms, that needs to be updated to actually resemble a threat.* **Nerf** * Reduce the stamina regen pause of his neutral bash down to 800ms from 2000ms *If Conq can bash and attack faster than people can regen their stamina, that's a problem... especially when OOS.* &amp;#x200B; # Peacekeeper **Buff** * Allow PK to dodge or flow into a heavy finisher after a dagger cancel, dodge heavy, or Deep Gouge; A Deep Gouge or Dagger cancel done from a heavy finisher will not flow into another heavy finisher *C'mon Ubi, just give PK that flow that she much deserves.* * Make the second hit of her zone 800ms, and give it the GB and dodge soft-feint *Considering that they bothered to give the second hit a dagger cancel, why not go the full mile and make it like her regular heavies?* **Nerf** * PK's Deep Gouge now does 1d + 8 bleed damage, down from 1d + 10 bleed *PK's damage potential from a landed dodge heavy is pretty high for something so fast, and considering the other buffs listed above, a decrease in Deep Gouge's damage seems appropriate.* &amp;#x200B; # Lawbringer **Buff** * Give LB's chain and finisher heavies a wider delay window to match the delay of his chain bashes *It's not all that hard to avoid LB's chain bashes if they're the only option in his offense with such a high delay; at least here, he has a mix-up.* * Lawbringer's Long Arm is now changed into a 700ms soft-feinted bash from his top heavies that can catch side and back dodgers *A neutral 1000ms bash is completely worthless for offense, and is only usable in ganks; at least now, it can be used offensively(also, it gives the top UB heavy finsher some use).* **Nerf** * Both his dodge and chain bashes have their block and CGB recoveries increased to 800ms to match his dodge recovery(to note, LB's block recovery on the bashes used to be 500ms, and his CGB recovery used to be 400ms) *Either the bashes have their HA or low recoveries, not both; and considering that these recoveries now make punishing the bashes possible for everyone, it seems better than to strip the bashes of their only unique feature.* &amp;#x200B; # Centurion *DISCLAIMER: Just as I am making all of these changes with the idea that the Testing Ground changes will come to pass, I am also making these Cent changes with the idea that the Cent Rework will come to pass; I will use the prototype version that they showed us in those TGs for inspiration.* **Buff** * Make the dodge input window on his Legion Kick 100-500ms(from 300-500ms), double its tracking, and speed it up to 566ms(from 600ms) *Despite the impressive changes they made to Cent in that rework, his Legion Kick(and his dodge heavy on that note) went untouched; this is what I believe would make it better without turning it into another generic 500ms neutral bash.* * Make his neutral uncharged heavies 600ms again *Give Cent back his 25 damage heavy parry punish; it's not like it'll be terrible, they nerfed its GB vulnerability before the game-wide patch was released.* **Nerf** * Get rid of the jab option from a light *This change made Cent's jab mix-up basically the worst parts of Hito's kick and Warden's shoulder bash mix-ups: too accessible, and too much of a vortex; he has a LH chain, he could just use his variable-timed heavy finisher to get back into the mix-up.* &amp;#x200B; # Gladiator DISCLAIMER: Again, keep in mind the Testing Ground changes where parries don't take an insane amount of stamina; this is for anyone who freaks out when they see that I didn't reduce the stamina cost of Skewer. **Buff** * Make his Skewer deal 25 direct damage and three ticks of 5 bleed(instead of 1 direct damage and 35 bleed); * The bleed is accessed by pressing the heavy input after landing the skewer; the dodge and throw options cannot be used after the bleed, only once after the skewer lands * Block stun is reduced so that a dodge light can be blocked after the Skewer * The skewer can now execute * These changes also carry onto the deflect Skewer *I said it was a buff, I didn't say it had to be a single and simple buff.* *I have proposed this before for Gladiator a while ago, and it got some mixed comments, some saying that they like the way the bleed is applied and how the inputs can be used. Well I say this: on a character that doesn't benefit from so much bleed damage like PK or Shaman, the large amount of bleed is not a benefit. And unlike the current iteration, this one deals instant direct damage, making the skewer actually worthwhile while deflecting instead of just getting off some damage values in the single digits.* * Make it so that Gladiator can access his chain lights and toe stab after a successful dodge bash; if it whiffs, he can access only the chain lights and heavies *At least now, the dodge bashes have a much better use and mix-up.* **Nerf** * Make the second hit of his zone unfeintable *Considering that Glad can feint the second part of his zone, it's a pretty safe move, so making it so that all heroes(not just some of them) can punish it in some sort of way would make it a lot less annoying.* *Besides, considering that it's unfeintable, this would widen its hitbox, meaning that Glad actually has a move that can hit more than one minion.* &amp;#x200B; # Black Prior **Buff** * BP can chain into a light or heavy after whiffing the bash soft-feint from the opener heavy *Considering it's high stamina costs and slow speeds, it might as well be allowed to chain into finishers to add a little mix-up.* * Add Hawk's Charge(the bash soft-feint from the heavy) to BP's running heavy *Everyone complains about BP's running heavy(since everything else is so good on him that there's not much that's weak about him), and they're right to. At least with this, it gives his chase game the most basic form of a mix-up.* **Nerf** * Make it so that Black Prior can only heal from Healing Ward if BP successfully bulwark counters, instead of him simply being able to do it from sitting around doing nothing *Out of all the things that I believe where BP is overturned in, his feats are where most of his power is at.* *BP's healing ward is the greatest healing feat for several reasons, most importantly is that its a much better version of regeneration. And while I can write a whole essay about how this feat is very much overpowered and shouldn't be like this, I will just summarize it as so: the fact that it's an even stronger version of Regenerate, and can be used actively as well as passively, does not take away from its nonsensical amount of power. If a tier 2 feat is stronger than a tier 4 feat, then it's too strong.* &amp;#x200B; Anyways that's it for the Knights. Anyone has something to say, then comment."

Part 1: [URL Part 2: [URL Part 3: [URL This finale focuses on the other faction that happens to come from the east: the Wu-Lin. A faction that's rather hated by the community, and serves as the faction with the weakest heroes outright. The only one that is rather strong is Jiang Jun, and even so that's just in Brawls/Dominion. So in all honesty, the Wu-lin might be doing worse than even the Samurai(That's saying something). Rules are the same as before: &gt;Unsurprisingly, I'm going to propose two buffs and a nerf to every single hero, including the ones that are top-tier and shit-tier, in the hopes that they would become healthier for the game; at the same time, I'll give a short sentence to explain why I chose this change(hopefully it's short). These buffs/nerfs will be: Changes to an entire mechanic, stance, or special attack A not-so-simple expansion to the hero's moveset Or a simple speed or damage change Whether or not you agree with these changes is up to you, and you can comment your protests or suggestions to make them better. *DISCLAIMER: This is also done under the idea of the Testing Ground changes, most importantly where the attacks have some of their indicators hidden and the parry changes.* &amp;#x200B; # Tiandi **Buff** * All Dragon Dodge damage is increased to 28(from 25 on the sides and 20 on the top) * Side Dragon Dodge is sped up to 1000ms from 1100ms * Side Dragon Dodge I-frames are increased to 600ms(from 500ms) * Side Dragon Dodge dodge input window is extended to 200-400ms(from 200ms) * Side Tiger Dodge now has same amount of forward tracking as Forward Tiger Dodge to catch back-dodgers in his kick mix-up *For a Dodge Specialist, Tiandi has terrible dodge attacks, especially his Dragon Dodges. High GB-vulnerability, I-frames that didn't cover the attack before the feint time, and also rather low damage. At least with these, he can earn his sub-title.* * Dragon Kick now deals 22 direct damage(from 0) * Dragon Kick's knockdown time is cut in half * Dragon Kick's whiff recovery is extended to allow for a GB * Dragon Kick can now be used after a finisher heavy *Dragon Kick serves as the most useless mix-up with it guaranteeing no damage unless near a wall, therefore relegating it to being a ganking tool. With this simple direct damage addition, it's immediately a lot more useful.* *Also, adding it after a finisher heavy gives him an actual reason to use his finisher heavies.* **Nerf** * Palm Strike after a superior block with Tiger Dodge is no longer guaranteed *Just like how Nobushi lost her free kick after a blocked hidden stance heavy, so must Tiandi lose his guaranteed Palm Strike after a superior block.* &amp;#x200B; # Jiang Jun **Buff** * Forward Dodge heavy is sped up to 900ms from 1000ms * Shin Kick has slightly buffed tracking to close the window where it can be dodged safely * Forward Dodge heavy dodge input window is increased to 100-400ms from 200ms * Jiang Jun can now forward dodge GB *Jiang Jun's opener, his forward dodge heavy and shin kick, are not even remotely as fine-tuned as other openers like Kensei's Pommel Strike. Shin Kick's also much slower(overall) due to the same 1000ms lengthy heavy locked behind a 200ms dodge input, making it 1200ms overall to react. At least the speed-ups to the dodge heavy and dodge window serves to strengthen the mix-up, and the dodge GB serves to kill off any chance of backdodging the Shin Kick.* * New option from Sifu's Poise, Sifu's Backhand, is a 500ms bash backslap that stuns for 1500ms; guarantees nothing, but it does flow into his finishers * ""New"" option from Sifu's Poise where Jiang Jun can simply immediately do his side or forward dodge heavies by just heavying in the direction(sides for side dodge heavies, top for forward dodge heavies) *Sifu's Poise has only one offensive option. One. Ridiculous. At least with these changes, it feels more fleshed out like Nobushi's Hidden Stance. Sifu's Backhand and his dodge heavy fastflows aren't supposed to be outright powerful, as they are simply other offensive options to allow him to flow into combat.* **Nerf** * Nerf the Dodge and Block recovery of all moves by a general 300-400ms; Also nerf the CGB recovery of all moves by 100-200ms max *This is one of the more difficult nerfs to give. Jiang Jun, despite having Sifu's Poise which is meant to recovery cancel, has incredibly low recoveries on most, if not all, of his moves. But I can't find the frame data to specifically nerf each move, so I'll just have to give a general rule.* &amp;#x200B; # Nuxia *DISCLAIMER: Since these changes are being made under the idea that the Testing Ground changes will be made, the trap indicators are already hidden, if not a bit.* **Buff** * Trap is sped up to 366ms from 400ms * Trap damage is being reduced to 20 from 30 * Zone trap damage is reduced to 30 from 45 * Traps now work against anyone that doesn't have their guard up(including people out-of-lock, when their reflex guard is down, or when they're emoting) * If the Trap lands, Nuxia now has three input options: \- Light, which does the typical Glass Waltz(trap punish) for 20 damage \- Dodge \- Throw * When a zone trap lands, they have all the regular input option, including a heavy input, which is just the ""Jade Ballet"" zone trap punish * A new trap option, ""Crystal Tango"", is possible through a successful deflect; the input is GB after a deflect; this Crystal Tango has the Glass Waltz Trap input(light), the Jade Ballet trap input(heavy), a throw input, and a dodge input *Nuxia's traps... good idea, poor execution. Reactable and can be avoided by emoting... really? Along with that, the traps can't really be used in anti-ganks, as the lengthy punish is prone to interruptions and damage.* *Now, with these new inputs after a trap, and the speed-ups/ the addition of traps working against downed guards, the traps should be a far more valid mix-up in both 1v1s and 1vXs.* *Also, side note, to all the people wanting a proper deflect option, here's a guaranteed way to punish from a deflect. Still less damage than the light option, but it's guaranteed.* * Zone damage is increased to 33 from 25 * Zone knockback is doubled * Zone stamina cost is lowered to 25 from 42 *Nuxia's zone sucks as is. Seriously, 1000ms and yet it has these stats? Now unlike other players, I don't want to make it a generic option-select that starts with a 500ms attack to satisfy the people who are afraid of parrying, and I will instead simply make the move strong on its own.* **Nerf** * All heavies now deal 33 damage(from 30, 35, and 40 respectively) *With all the buffs to the trap, these high-damage chain and finisher heavies are rather overtuned.* &amp;#x200B; # Shaolin **Buff** * Neutral heavy, chain heavy, and deflect heavy damage is buffed to 27 from 25 * Finisher heavy damage is reduced to 32 from 35 * Side light combo damage rebalanced to 12 + 4 + 6(from 7 + 7 + 7) *Damage on Shaolin is rather pathetic. I know he's wielding a staff, but the damage is still too low. Also, his side light combo has a terrible balance of damage(7+7+7, devs? Really?). Both of these issues are fixed.* * Allow for Qi Stance Lights and Qi Stance side heavies to chain back into his infinite chain * Both top and side Qi Stance Lights miss recovery is lowered to 600ms for blocking and CGBing; for dodging, it is lowered to 800ms * Side Qi Stance heavy miss recovery is lowered to 600ms for blocking and CGBing; for dodging, it is lowered to 800ms * Sun Kick is sped up to 466ms from 500ms * Sun Kick Smash now deals 32 damage(from 35) * Sun Kick Smash has better side-tracking * Sun Kick Sweep is now 500ms(but still dodgeable); death point strike can be accessed earlier after it hits to get the full 22 damage *Qi Stance is pretty good, but it's flawed in some ways. No chaining from his Qi stance attacks doesn't help him, and his Sun Kick Sweep is worthless. The addition of chaining is an immediate improvement, and the Sweep buffs not only make it a viable offensive tool, but it also works well with the Sun Kick heavy.* **Nerf** * Top light is nerfed to 500ms(from 400ms) and is enhanced *While it might not seem like a nerf, it's more of a fix to a rather unhealthy aspect to Shaolin: the 400ms top light served as too good an interruption tool. This version is a lot more healthy.* &amp;#x200B; # Zhanhu **Buff** * Make his dodge/zone cancels happen at 300ms, instead of 300/500/600ms * Zhanhu can now dodge after finisher attacks * All side dodge light attacks cost the same 6 stamina(from 12 for side dodge ""heavies"") *Another dodge-specialist that has rather bad dodge aspects. Inconsistent dodge cancels and stamina costs. Also, the addition of dodging after finisher attacks can help him a lot, especially in anti-ganks.* * Finisher lights are sped up to 533ms from 600ms * Right Finisher heavy hitbox standardized to be the same as the left finisher heavy hitbox *Zhanhu's finishers are supposed to be a mix-up, right? So this speed-up should actually make it a mix-up, especially with the Testing Ground changes.* **Nerf** * Replace Bow feat with Flaming Bow feat *...Okay, I know this isn't really a nerf since it works with Zhanhu's whole fire aspect, but there's nothing on Zhanhu that needs nerfing. He's that kid with brittle bones and asthma. You could say my reasoning for this change is that fire damage can be healed quickly compared to direct damage, so there's that.* &amp;#x200B; And there's the finale to ""2 Buffs and a Nerf"". Anything you want to say, you can comment down below."

34,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Close Shadow and Distant Ninja: A Shinobi rework,1,gqwhjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/gqwhjt/close_shadow_and_distant_ninja_a_shinobi_rework/,2020-05-26 22:54:08,"^^I ^^know, ^^Im ^^terrible ^^with ^^naming. *Assume that the lower damage from the latest version of the long awaited testing grounds is applied here.* Similar to the idea presented in my Zhanhu rework post, Shinobi can press back once the right stick (input for full block for other characters) and he switches between the two modes suggested in this post. This can be done manually (takes 200ms) whenever the player feels like it and Shinobi always starts the match in close range mode. #Distant ninja (long range mode) This mode is focused on maneuvering and peeling (covering) for teammates in team fights. Also at keeping opponents at range.  Instead of outright removing his range heavies, these now have **much** shorter range. I propose to make them the same, or slightly less, range as Kenseis heavies but with less forward movement for Shinobi. The animations, speed stay the same as his current ranged heavies and he can hard feint them.  Same attack chains (L-L, H-H, H-L) plus a new one (L-H) but all heavies are replaced with these new lower range ones and he can no longer hold them indefinitely. Shinobi **does not** have access to sickle rain heavies in **these chains**. *Comments: One of Shinobis unhealthiest aspects right now is that he can just sit back off screen and wait for the right moment to pummel opponents with annoying, high damaging range heavies. Now, with the lower damage, range and the absence of holding range heavies down, Shinobi is less unhealthy for the game while providing peel if he positions himself adequately during fights.*  Can soft feint the startup of the new ranged heavies to a quick, 466ms slash light that applies bleed. Animation is the same as the light riposte he does from getting parries. Acts as a chain starter. *Comments: During team fights opponents will be looking to interrupt Shinobis range attacks. Assuming theres no hyper armor involve, if Shinobi sees or reads an opponent closing in to interrupt, he can opt to slash and stop them. If not, then hard feint to dodge will be a counter to incoming hyper armor attacks.*  If a range heavy connects, Shinobi can press the gb input to do his current roll into the opponent move. He still has access to his backflip kick with the same speed and effect it has; but the top heavy he throws after the roll is now a range undodgeable heavy (with the aforementioned range and damage reduction); while sides heavies are normal sickle rain heavies.  The backflip in this mode has the same distance as his current backflip but also has a more consistent 400ms gb vulnerability and hyper armor. Speed is increased *just* a little to not make it easy to punish. *Comments: This is one of the ideas Im not completely sure of. Because, like I said, Shinobis heavies now have reduced range along the lines of Kenseis heavies. If he gets the distance from pre nerf backflip, then the heavies wont connect since there would be too much separation (I think). And keeping the nerfed range would be too easy to interrupt, so I added hyper armor and a small speed buff. In short, look at this suggestion with a grain of salt.*  Ranged gb is completely removed. Instead, its replaced with an **unparriable** move that does between 10-15 damage and acts as a chain starter. You can also press gb input to roll into the opponent after this move. Animation and speed are the same, just without the actual gb part. You need to dodge, full block, forward superior block or ad profundis to avoid this attack. *Comments: The animation of Shinobis ranged gb makes him throw his sickle dead center at the opponents body. So I think there might be some animation budget issues to change it so it can attack from any direction (Ubisoft has been reluctant to add new animations). So instead I chose to keep the animation and add a new property that will [hopefully] help Shinobis moveset. Despite being unparriable, this move can be externally blocked. Its main use is to interrupt forward attacks from enemies that try to catch Shinobis backflip. Also, range gb is cancer.*  When his ranged heavies are parried, Shinobi no longer falls down to the ground. Instead, he gets pulled close to the opponent and they get their heavy parry punish as normal.  Still has his deflect with its respective options, but at reduced, sensible damage. #Close Shadow (Short range mode) This mode prioritizes speed and 1v1 fights.  New chain (L-L-L-L). A heavy can be done after any light but it ends the chain (so technically also new chains). He can backflip as a recovery cancel on any part of the chain.  The first light is the standard 500ms light but does not guarantee the second. The second light is 466ms and guarantees the third one on successful hit (same animation as his current double light). The third light is 466ms and enhanced (all sides) **if** shinobi whiffs his second light or an oos opponent blocks the second light. Otherwise, its guaranteed. Finally, the fourth light is 433ms on all sides, but the top is enhanced while sides deal normal -plus small bleed- damage. The animation for these side lights are the same as his light parry riposte.  The heavies after the first and third lights are his sickle rain heavies. The heavy after the second and fourth light is unblockable (top only), undodgeable for sides. They do not pin the opponent. For the latter, the animation and speed are the same as Shinobis sickle rain heavies, just without the pin part.  The dodge kick is now 500ms, knockback is reduced and guarantees a chain starter light.  Shinobis deflect in this mode does not have the long range heavy option. Instead, after pressing gb input on successful deflect, the heavy input makes shinobi do a kick in the direction of the buffered guard switch that does 20 flat damage and can wall splat or ledge. Animation is the same as the side throw animation where he kicks an opponent to the head. Naturally, Shinobi teleports much closer to the back of his opponent to accomplish this.  Can soft feint the second part zone into a sickle rain heavy.  Shinobi does not have access to his new range heavies in this mode. . . . *As Ive said before in my other rework post, Im no expert in game balance. So I left out precise numbers for the majority of these ideas and would prefer that the people who do have proper balance knowledge should discuss it in the comment section. Also since Shinobi is a chaotic mess and I have not played him that much, there may be things Ive left out due to not remembering.*"

His zone, like all others, costs a lot of stamina, but other than that and the input it has almost nothing in common with other ones. It's slow, can be feinted, and has too much GB vulnerability to be an option select. Other than the input, it's basically a special heavy attack. The closest thing in the game to Raider's zone is Black Prior's bulwark slash. They can be used from neutral or in a chain, only BP's costs far less stamina, and he also has an extremely strong option select zone. Considering Raider's zone can only be used for mix ups and punishes, and that it's such a crutch for Raider in particular, he should be able to use it more often. Or, y'know, they could just bring back stun tap without refresh or stamina drain."

Having this said let me introduce the Legionary, a roman soldier equipped with a Gladius and a Scutum. His gimmick? The Testudo stance. I wont discuss a moveset but the gimmick i came up, that can be fairly interesting: by holding heavy, the Legionary enters the Testudo stance. While in this stance (100ms startup) every bash and guardbreak attempt simply bounce and whiff. On the other side you are vulnerable to lights and heavies. To balance it, you cannot dodge out of the Testudo stance nor you can attack. But if you get hit by a bash/gb attempt, the opponent whiffs and you could followup with a guaranteed light. I think gimmicks like these would benefit players that cant react to bashes, but on the other hand high level players could simply bait out the Testudo and punish for big damage"

It allows them to punish bashes and won't be op option select, due to 500 ms gb vulnerability.

If you dodge it on the first 300 ms, including dodge animation (meaning on prediction), every character with 500 ms light opener can punish it.

As for black prior's unblockable, from personnal testings i would say it still has 400ms gb vulnerability, because in training mode I cannot react to gb with it, but I can do it with light attacks (300ms single choice reaction). from this short clip it seems he can get guardbroken at least 166ms into it URL but i'm not a professional framechecker so if someone has a better thing feel free to share it"
40,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Tiandi Rework - Analysis,4,fw3l57,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fw3l57/tiandi_rework_analysis/,2020-04-07 04:02:10,"# Introduction Tiandi, the Wu Lin Vanguard, is a character not actually that bad, compared to some of his brethen. The lack of efficacity of his Kick Mix-up and of his Finisher Heavies greatly impede his functionality. Side Dragon Dodge also has some functionality issues. I will try to integrate actual mix-up into his kit. It is rather short, so let's get to it. Usual Disclaimer : I will only concern myself with **design**, **not balance**, thus there will be **no damage change**. Also, this rework will be made with the **TG changes in mind**. There is a TL;DR at the end. # Dodge Attack Tiandi has every 2-Hit combos, and can weave between them his Dodge attacks. He has the standard Neutral Tools of most character, with a Neutral Bash, Palm Strike, which is only punishable on read. He also has 4 Dodge Attacks : 1. The Tiger Dodges : Forward/Side Dodge + Light, a Variable Input Timing with Superior Block Dodge Attack. Quite a flexible, even maybe overloaded move. 2. The Forward Dragon Dodge : Forward Dodge + Heavy. Your standard Hyper Armour Forward Dodge Attack. Can be feinted. 3. The Side Dragon Dodge : Side Dodge + Heavy. The slowest Dodge Attack in the game and the one with the most I-frames. Can be feinted. The Tiger Dodge is a fine move as it is. The Forward Dragon Dodge could use a little tweaking on the Hyper Armour to standardize it based on the more recent attack of that type, but that is it. Side Dragon Dodge need a bit of clean-up, and a lot of explanation. Side Dragon Dodge is input wise a Dodge Attack, but mechanically wise, I believe it is wrong to consider it as such. It is slow, it can be softfeinted, it can be accessed even in chains, though restrictively. Mechanically speaking, it is a lot closer to Bulwark Stance or Hidden Stance, for example. It is a strong defensive move, with offensive potential. As it is now though, every possible output is reactable and it is detrimental to the attack, even more so since it is the default. A viable and good solution would be to make the attack Unblockable. A neutral Unblockable behind a 800 ms GB vulnerability move (according to the Information Hub), even with its I-frame, should be fair and not make Tiandi only relies on it. So : * Forward Dragon Dodge : * Hyper Armour : 500 ms =&gt; 200 ms. * Side Dragon Dodge : * NEW : Now Unblockable * I-frames : Unknown Exact Value =&gt; From 0 to 700 ms. # Palm Strike Palm Strike is a good Neutral Bash. It is only punishable on read and it requires a commitment from the opponent to properly counter. Great Design overall. The Hyper Armour buff to Forward Dragon Dodge also help here. As a Chain tool, however, it is severely lacking, even with his features. Specifically, the intended mix-up of Light =&gt; Palm Strike / Tiger Dodge as an Unblockable + Undodgeable mix-up can not work because of the weakness of Palm Strike. The best solution is to improve the speed of Palm Strike, but only in Chains. * Palm Strike : * Speed (in Chains) : 600 ms =&gt; 533 ms. 533 ms makes for a 233 ms reaction test under the TG changes. Fast enough for a true mix-up. # Heavy Finisher It is not necessary for Opener to have special property at all. For a Finisher though, it is a Cardinal sin. With the improvements made to Palm Strike, we can modify the Heavy Finisher to have the Undodgeable Property, to create another Undodgeable + Unblockable mix-up, that would available after Tiger Dodge and Opener. * Heavy Finisher * NEW : Now Undodgeable. # TL;DR * Forward Dragon Dodge : * Hyper Armour : 500 ms =&gt; 200 ms. * Side Dragon Dodge : * NEW : Now Unblockable * I-frames : Unknown Exact Value =&gt; From 0 to 700 ms. * Palm Strike : * Speed (in Chains) : 600 ms =&gt; 533 ms. * Heavy Finisher * NEW : Now Undodgeable. # Conclusion As you can see, Tiandi did not need much to actually becomes really strong. These few modifications would be enough to make him actually threatening. So, what are your thoughts ? # Off Topic I generally would not allow myself this, but my last rework post actually got very little feedback, and one of the reason I am doing those is to actually improve my game designing ability.

41,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Whats the point of standardizing heavy attack guardbreak vulnerability when guardbreak range is incredibly inconsistent?,1,fwcxjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fwcxjy/whats_the_point_of_standardizing_heavy_attack/,2020-04-07 13:12:28,"Title says it all. The change to GB vulnerability was an amazing change. While long overdue, its nice that this game has finally let feint to guardbreak be a genuine mixup. This change has certainly helped make the game more 50/50 friendly. Cool. Except for some reason, feint to GB STILL doesnt work on certain characters. The reverse way around this time; instead of the heavy being gb invulnerable, your guardbreak will just whiff and youll eat the parry heavy. Picture this. Youre playing JJ ,you land a light on your opponent, you feint the followup unblockable heavy, try to guardbreak, your guardbreak whiffs completely and eat a highlander top heavy. Half your health for attempting to do one basic mixup. What if they didnt parry? Well they saw the GB symbol, counterguardbroke to avoid it, and their guardbreak catches you in the recovery of yours. Free heavy. How are these situations even possible? Have you ever tried to roll away from lawbringers mixups? He sucks you in with his hand mid roll after teleporting to you like a ninja. And thats even after target switching you mid-chain, but JJ whiffs guardbreaks on the regular, even if you landed the light right beforehand. Its hard enough to play JJ as it is I dont need feint to GB to be a 50/50 between actually working or working against me. Not just JJ too, Ive seen this happen with Shaolins Qi stance unblockable. But JJ has it terribly. I can see this being due to him being long range but cmon now. His GB should reach even longer in that case. His GB range needs to be on par with his weapon hitbox, GB attempts should NOT whiff if youre already hitting the mf before you feint to GB."
42,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Has Warden in 4s Gone Up in viability?,1,fxa6bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fxa6bw/has_warden_in_4s_gone_up_in_viability/,2020-04-09 02:58:52,"When the viability list most recently came out, with comp teams in mind, warden was placed at ""okay"" due to a few glaring issues. He could not safely deal damage in xvx, his ""safest"" options being top light and zone which are 500ms attacks with reactable animations, while stalling. His zone was unsafe as it had very high recoveries basically netting a free GB for the opponent if used. However, there have been some changes in the game, as well as buffs to warden himself that I think can create an argument for moving him up in viability in the comp scene. Firstly I want to say what hasn't changed about warden, and what he still has. His feats are fairly strong feats in a comp setting with multiple viable options for his T1 and T4 feats. He only lacks a really good T3. For his T1 you can either choose Come at me, which can help the player gain renown at quicker paces than other heroes. Feats are some of the most important things to gain in a 4v4 almost always dictating who wins at the end of the game. Assuming both teams are competent in rotations actually getting kills is hard. This means, especially assassins, have a tough time getting feats. Usually, the most viable way to gain points is in mid while minion farming. Come at me boosts both minion kill renown, (3 points per), as well as boosting renown from boosting. His next T1 body count allows him to farm mid more consistently, allowing for him to take over if rotations are needed, granted he is given a very lackluster mid clear. His T2 is one of the better feats in a comp 4v4 setting as they completely negate shaman ganks. Shaman ganks are one of the easiest to set up and do a lot of damage, so being able to negate this almost entirely makes him really good for stalling against these ganks. His T3 will most likely be his bomb feat, which is a decent mid clear while being combined with body count can heal him a decent amount. Warden gets two strong T4s, (morale boost has been unbanned due to nerfs). Morale boost and Friendship banner. Both are good picks and deciding what to pick here usually goes up to your team feat comp. Stalwart can completely negate things like fire flask while morale boost makes damage go big. Both have merits and are good picks. All things combined make him a subpar pick as other heroes have the same/similar feats (aside from thick blood which is really good), and probably the main reason he's been ranked at low by a lot of comp players. Next, with recent changes to the game, warden's ability to stall an outnumbered fight has been greatly improved now that chain heavy attacks have 100ms GB vulnerability. Most notably is the 100ms GB vulnerability changes. This means his zone is now a lot safer to use in a stalling situation which can help fend off bash ganks and zerk zone ganks. It's much harder to GB him after a zone if he chains a heavy and then feints it. It also gives him safer UB pressure. With the ability to crowd control safer it allows him to stall even better than before. In a comp scene with competent players, you shouldn't be winning 1v2 and should be focusing on stalling in those situations as they dictate who wins. Warden, while not the best, still has a decent gank with his most notable being heavy hit stun into full charged bash for at least 2 heavies. Warden gets 40 damage from this, plus safe UB pressure, allowing for a fairly quick kill. Assuming you have no buffs, and the opponent has no debuffs and has around 120 health, warden will do 80 damage while, if his teammate has bad heavy damage at around 30, warden will kill in 2 bashes at worst. While not being the best gank, it still is fairly strong and shouldn't be overlooked as he also has flicker pressure in team fights. Lastly, shortly after TG warden got buffed. His bash now takes less stamina and his top UB heavy has been sped up to 1000ms making it a true mixup now. This means his pressure isn't only through bash anymore. Warden also has a really good chase being only beaten by heroes like shaman. Since he also has decent rotations I think he should be looked at again as I feel he has more than likely become more viable in 4s."

Their purpose is to be thrown out unexpectedly to control the fight and catch attempts to guard break Nobushi on her way into hidden stance. * Middle attack is now removed from poke the nest, all light openers that land now guarantee a second light attack that inflicts bleed. Landing a 500ms light is difficult and should be rewarded as such. Nobushi may still option select a kick after the opening light to catch unaware opponents. * All light chain finisher recoveries can be cancelled into a viper's retreat . Heavy Chain Changes: * Nobushi may now soft cancel any heavy attack into hidden stance. * Base heavy attack damage reduced to 20-ish but gain a new property where they ""cash in"" all bleed damage at once, executing if the combined damage of the bleed and heavy bring the enemy to zero. Hidden Stance Changes * Hidden stance entry animation can be canceled into a HS Heavy attack as quickly as Black Prior can cancel bulwark into his unblockable. This move is going to form a big part of Nobushi's offense and since both the hidden stance entry and heavy attack have guard break vulnerability windows, its a good idea to make sure prediction is rewarded instead of reaction. Honestly not sure if this is already the case. * Hidden Stance Heavy attacks are now unblockable and are Nobushi's main tool for opening an enemy up. They also have the bleed ""cash in"" property. * Hidden Stance Light attacks are 400ms and continue to be chain openers, but their indicator is no longer partially hidden. Their purpose is to have a better chance of interrupting a light chain if you HS dodge a light opener instead of something with enough recovery to land a kick. Kick Changes * Kicks now guarantee either buffed Cobra Strike, a 20-ish damage heavy attack opener, or a viper's retreat. Same damage potential as a guard break, without the controlled throw, obviously. * Kicks are specifically meant to punish over-extensions caught by hidden stance Dodge Attack Changes * Cobra Strike now inflicts 20 bleed damage instead of 12 (close to a doubling if my damage values are off) and continue to be guaranteed after a kick so punishing those over-extensions matter more and properly set up heavy attacks to take massive chunks out of the opponent's life bar. * Sidewinder Form damage remains at 25 without the property to give the Nobushi options when defending if going for that extra damage might kill. &amp;#x200B; Thoughts?"

This means Orochi gets an Unblockable Mixup any time a Top Heavy is simultaneously available. Riptide Strike still resets the Chain with each use allowing Orochi to Chain Light indefinitely at the cost of delaying Chain Finishers access. Hurricane Blast is now a Armored Soft Feint Bash Mixup following Top Light Finisher. Due to the restricted access Orochi has to first pass up on Damage within an Mixup to then throw *another* Mixup. In other words in order to land Hurricane Blast Orochi has to properly land two back to back Mixups. The plentiful access to varied Mixups is balanced around the risk in throwing consecutive Top Lights. Riptide Strike's Damage is quite high narrowing the disparity between Light Parry Punish Damage and Mixup Damage thus smoothing out the risk reward. Due to the nature of Light Parries most of Orochi's Offense revolves around Punishing Light Parry attempts which can be quite difficult depending on the Parry Option Selects available. In this aspect Orochi's remaining Defensive Tools will prove invaluable in countering Dodge OS, Bash, and Zone OS."

This change, I do not deny, was needed to prevent wrong reads from remaining unpunished but it has also cost his main offense. With this change, feint into GB can now catch a conq if he goes for the parry whereas before he was protected (thank God, this was a pain to deal with). However now, he can no longer use heavy attacks as a productive means of damage when baiting out neutral GB with FB. This was a reliable chain starter that was strictly guess work for both parties, a combat method that to my understanding has been preferred by the general cast. Now, he can only use light attack and zone when performing this baiting mix up. This IMO does not provide enough incentive to use this baiting mix up because SB nets the same damage with less risk associated with it, thus nearly completely negating this playstyle as a whole (at least from a competitive stand point). I was reading a post earlier on the main sub where someone presented a potential solution so I thought I would make a post about it to see how we can refine it with your guys opinions. They proposed that Conq side heavy attacks maintain their 100ms GB vulnerability but only when thrown from fullblock. This way, a neutral stance heavy thrown on a wrong read will still be punished if the opponent goes for a feint into GB, and he can still be punished easily in fullblock with a neutral GB if he turtles. But also give him the ability to use FB as a bait as he did previously. Since in order to counter the GB with a heavy you would have to predict when the GB will come, if the opponent does not throw any GB, they can easily parry a thrown heavy from FB. Personally I thought that play style was balanced since it was 100% reading only with relatively equal risk/reward (a heavy for heavy). I am pretty sure the Devs were not set out to nerf that aspect of his kit but it was a side effect of the overall change. I think this is could be a solution to let him keep this offensive tool without giving him back the defensive option that he had before. Conq is unique in the fact that he can only feint with FB. I believe it would make sense if he could at least use this as a reliable mix up."

Thing but I just want to draw out some drawbacks to conquerors kit and how bad of a state I personally feel conq is in right now His chain, I'm sure everyone remembers this being extremely annoying to deal with but once you know about it conq probaly has one of the easier chains to parry and is honestly a pointless feature to conq, I dont remember I single time I've used his chain as much as it can be used, and I know it makes sense for the flail but not being able to light from the same side makes this chain easier to parry compared to others and just the fact if you do throw a light from the same side results in such a big punishment. To me conqs lights in general have always felt high risk low reward (and god damn I almost put down the character when I saw they wanted to give him pk level damage) His Neutral bash, conq has a punishable, easily predictable, but fairly quick bash. The bash itself only leads into a light, personally I've never understood bash conqs, even dodge bashing is risky. Yes there's buffering and delaying and all those things to make the bash easier to get all and all it is a versatile bash that I cannot complain but even then you arent only going to be using his bash, if you did itll become easier to predict and you would be sitting there all day wearing away at your opponents life bar with lights, and in ganking situations you just dont use the bash unless you feel like getting hit with 3 heavies or the opponents are stuck in some recovery. But what about his follow up bash? Well it's way better in terms of risk and reward, it's pretty good with the ability to wall splat meaning it CAN confirm a heavy; however it's slow speed means that it's easily dodged but unlike his neutral bash this one is safer, you can follow it up with a top light however this can be predicted and parried if the opponent waited though this can be avoided by not throwing the light you'll still run the risk of being guard broken, now some of you might remember previously you could actually throw a heavy after the bash Well that is no more. His option select, conq can limit your options with his allguard. But this has been rendered nearly useless. The only two options from your all guard you have now is the ability to light from it or zone, the light fine for preventing GBs but that's about it, the zone takes way more stamina and would probaly put you out of stamina due to you using the allguard before hand (depends on how long you sit in it). The reason I say this is now useless though is because previously you could throw a heavy, this heavy would almost always catch opponents who attempted to gb you but ever since the change to gb vulnerability was made this is no more and its tooken me a good minute to adjust to that change. How do I think ubi can fix conqueror though? 1.Give him a 3 light chain with lights that can be thrown from the same side 2.Allow his neutral bash to be able to lead into his follow up bash (I think this should be fair because of the stamina cost) 3.Make throwing heavies from all guard safe by giving them the old gb vulnerability while keeping it on his neutral heavies These are just my thoughts and opinions, it just pains me to see everyone's favorite meme man get shafted I'd like to hear everyone else's thoughts on this."
51,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Guard-breaks need a massive rework and have been the cause most of the problems in this game regarding mobility and offense. GB's have been the limiting factor that has been completely overlooked.,1,gclbrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/gclbrw/guardbreaks_need_a_massive_rework_and_have_been/,2020-05-03 15:32:59,"The results of guard breaks being completely overlooked are too much damage stacking in ganks, fundamental flaws in defense that go overlooked, wrongful over nerfs to mobility to compensate for GB's flaws, and a waste of potential opening offense. You have too much time to queue up a heavy on a GB and the added hit stagger length makes it easy to melt someone in a gank if you get a GB. Why not speed up GB punishes to 600ms? If we want faster game-play, this is only adds to it. Why not speed up GB's to 300ms with less time to counter to potentially make it an opener? Decrease GB recovery. Why not be able to move while GBing so you don't lose ground on a person back-walking or back dodging? We could of avoided removing diagonal dodges and adding a shit ton of vulnerable frames to rolls and unlocks if we had fixed GB instead of nerfing the symptom (mobility). At it's core it's still a problem with catching back dodges and we've made it impossible to escape ganks or deal with a bash and GB at the same time unless you're a privileged hero with the right mechanics like a dodge heavy or dodge bash, and dodge lights are still too risky. Why not give counter guard break a full block property so that bleed, shaman, and LB ganks don't fundamentally bypass the core defense? Or reduce the amount of time blocking keeps you from dodging so those ganks aren't easily confirmed? Why don't throws give you damage reduction instead of just your opponent so that you can use them as a shield? There could be so much more functional use for GB's in this game. It's hardly good for anything on it's own other than setting up a gank that shouldn't happen in the first place. It's not that great for punishing recoveries anymore now that you can be safe from GB on recovery as long as you feint your finisher because of 100ms GB vulnerability on chains. Like it or not the game is based on defensive mechanics and the game isn't fun if you can't defend yourself with the right reactions and reads. Why not setup offense and damage on a mix-up and making the opponent make a mistake instead of setting up a one shot kill when they are making the correct defensive play? It was just one extreme meta to the next. Defense to ganking. And it's not just an individual ganking problem, so nerfing shaman or raider etc isn't going to fix it. In fact fixing the fundamental mechanics could open the door to buffing them in other ways."
52,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Some Shinobi ideas - especially for teamfights.,1,fenecc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fenecc/some_shinobi_ideas_especially_for_teamfights/,2020-03-07 11:48:21,"So, Shinobi doesn't really have an identity in teamfights beyond sniping for range GBs. I was thinking about what changes to make to the character, to make them healthy in all situations but especially give them a more active, mobile role. To begin with: **What is Shinobi's teamfight playstyle meant to be?** To me, the design of his kit suggests a hero meant to constantly be on the move, going in and out of melee and never staying in place for long. As we know, the kit does not achieve this, but I think this can be remedied. This won't be a long post, but let's get down to business. **Note on damage:** I will use TG values in this. Furthermore, while Shinobi's damage values have always been high, I think the reason for that is the total lack of chains and kit flow, so the damage is there to compensate. With this in mind, I will decrease in damage but make chain adjustments to match. This isn't quite a rework - no new moves or animations - but rather just a rebalancing of the kit and adding some new properties. **New Chains** L,L,H H,L,H H,L,L L,H,L L,H,H **Light attacks** Light opener from 12 to 11. Parry Counter from 13+15bleed to 1+16bleed, now a chain starter. All confirmed double-light hits (after heavy or light) from 6 to 4. Non-confirmed chain lights from 500 to 400ms, damage from 14 to 13. This creates a more realistic tradeoff between a small confirmed bonus hit or a much larger but not gauranteed chain light. 400ms makes the tradeoff more realistic, as I do not think the chain light would be competitive at all levels of play without it. **Heavy Attacks** Heavy openers and mid chain heavies from 28 to 24. Heavy finisher from 30 to 24, Sickle Rain lights from 8,5,5 to 5,3,3. This reduces the power of ranged guardbreaks while still making the heavy finisher valuable - and something to keep in mind before prediction parrying lights. **Ranged Attacks** Ranged heavy attacks from 25 to 18 damage. Now enhanced. When parried, now pulls the shinobi very close to the opponent, but reduces standup time slightly - confirming a zone for almost all heroes, and a dodge attack for the rest. No longer has any SA during pulldown and standup animation, allowing for dodge bashes to fully land. Parry changes also apply to countering ranged GB. **Front Roll** Has up to 200ms of iframes, ending early if opponent is reached. Front Roll Kick now confirms a light attack and can wallsplat for a confirmed ranged heavy regardless of guard, stamina damage removed. Directly flows into light opener, zone attack or heavy finisher. **Backflip** Backflip distance increased. Has 300ms of iframes, matching Sifu's Poise, and guardbreak vulnerability matching standard backdodges. Now serves as a longer-distance backdodge to complement in-and-out playstyle; can no longer cancel chain starter recovery with a backflip to prevent abuse. **Double Dodge Kick** Can now also be used after a single forward dodge. Can no longer backflip out of missed kick. **Deflect** Deflect counter now requires the manual input of a Heavy Attack to begin, with an input window of up to 300ms after an attack is deflected, preventing undesired teleports. Shinobi now has iframes for 200ms while teleporting and can block, parry or dodge from 100ms after the iframes end. Deflect Kick is no longer gauranteed but can be target switched to hit other opponents, and can be backflipped even on miss."
53,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Why is Jormanger getting nerfed (AGAIN),1,fepgu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fepgu0/why_is_jormanger_getting_nerfed_again/,2020-03-07 14:34:38,"Please explain to me why, I don't want the typical I HATE HIS EXISTENCE meme responses. I want some actual argument as to why an already TERRIBLE character needs to be further nerfed. _____________________________________________________ Jorm has a total of 7 moves, they can use from neutral, Neutral bash, Zone, Light, Heavy, Hammer slam, Sprinting heavy and Forward dodge heavy. All of them range from garbage to mildly useable, actually, let's look at these moves. _____________________________________________________ First off is his lights, they're 500 ms, have a very fluid animation and deal 16 damage. This is BOG standard at this point and the very fluid animations make them ESPECIALLY easy to parry. This last bit about a fluid animation cripples their ability to act as an opener. _____________________________________________________ Next is his heavies, they are 900 ms top and 800 ms side and deal 30 and 25 damage respectively. In addition, they have hyper armor that starts 400 ms into the attack. Why are these bad? _____________________________________________________ Because the hyper armor doesn't start up early enough to reliable use them to trade, they lack any ability to soft-feint either into a gb or his bash and as a result, they can safely be blocked or option select parried. _____________________________________________________ Next is his Zone , it is 500 ms, deals 18 damage. Why is this bad? Well, it's bad because of its absurd recovery and small hit-box. From what I can tell the zone comes from the right and has a 130-degree hit-box in front of Jorm. _____________________________________________________ This small hit-box and the recovery on it force jorm to follow it up or leave him exposed sitting there like a retard waiting to get punished. So what can he follow it up with? A light attack which, is extremely easy to parry/deflect or a chain bash which is extremely easy to dodge and punish. _____________________________________________________ The worst part of this is even if your opponents are bad enough for one of these options to land they ALSO have terrible recoveries leaving you open to be punished by any other external attackers. _____________________________________________________ Next is his Forward dodge heavy, it is 1000 ms, can be used 100-300 ms into a forward dodge, in addition, it gets hyper armor 100 ms into the move and has a 100 ms GB vulnerability window. It deals a total of 25 damage if it lands and can be hard/soft-feinted. _____________________________________________________ So why is this move unhealthy and ALSO bad at the same time? Because of its absurdly long start-up time as well as needing a dodge attack to initiate, in addition, it poses no threat. People can safely block or option select parry the move. So its viability as an opener is effectively NONE. _____________________________________________________ That said it is unhealthy because it effectively allows you to have a 200 ms hyper armor heavy gb immune heavy option select. _____________________________________________________ Next is his Hammer slam, it is 1000 ms, deals 50 damage, has hyper armor 100 ms into the move , takes 20 stam to use and it resets both players back to full stam upon successful connection. _____________________________________________________ This is probably Jorms ONLY good move but its locked behind a condition, that being an enemy knockdown. However, it also has absurd recovery times leaving jorm completely vulnerable even after a successful hammer slam for a considerable amount of time. In addition, any damage to the knocked down opponent either from an enemy or alley will IMMEDIATELY get them up and allow them to parry Jorm's hammer slam. Additionally any enemy or friendly with a bash based attack can ALSO interrupt jorm during the absurd 1000 ms wind-up time. _____________________________________________________ Finally, we have his bash its 600 ms, deals 0 direct damage and 35 stamina damage, take 15 to use. In addition, it's recoveries are absolutely absurd being 600 for blocking and 1000 for both cbg and dodging. _____________________________________________________ So why is this move bad? Its 600 ms , a snail in its sleep could dodge easily dodge this move. In addition, its absolutely abysmal recoveries allow for anyone to easily get a guard-break for dodging it. That is unless jorm follows it up with his super easy to parry or deflect 500 ms light which grants a light parry punish. _____________________________________________________ On a final note in order to actually get someone oos with this bash, it takes landing this attack 4-5 times depending on the character. If you want actually capitalize on the oos state, it an additional landing. This move takes 15 stamina to use each time, jorm himself has 140 stamina. 5x15 +20 from hs = 95 , if he has to use it an additional time because of the character its 110. _____________________________________________________ Look at this character objectively, he has NO openers at all, absurdly long recovery times on all of his attacks, low damage excluding hammer slam, basically, no chain pressure that can't be safely option selected or backdodged. _____________________________________________________ He DOES NOT NEED ANY NERFS if anything the poor man needs buffs to his recoveries and attack speeds. I just don't get the jorm hate train, why is someone so bad hated so much, why is jorm an issue but warden with his completely safe unreactable offense fine?"

They will never acknowledge shinobis weaknesses, and I hope you guys reconsider his nerf/low tier direction. Range - Shinobi has no chase tools! Heroes like Shaman can do the same thing as shinobi. They can use their stealth feat and throw homing missile chase heavies. This midget leaps 50+ Feet like its nothing, and if theyre out of range, it auto follows until they are!  straight comedy! Stop being so afraid of the range part of shinobis kit. Theres plenty heroes that have ridiculous range, or better yet CC moves that carry the victim for 50+ feet til theyre ledged. LB, Warlord, Raider. Maneuverability - no quad dashing because its BrOkEn! However JJ can infinite dodge, cancel dodges into as many as they like! Try to gb.....get hit with a wiff unless your a Viking (beside Valk and HL really) or knight because theyre GBs will track a good 7+ feet. Not to mention HL OS dodges, Tiandis FLoW lIkE wAtER, theyre all more agile and safer than a ninja. Read that again please, these heroes are 6ft warriors more agile and as fast/faster then a ninja. Tech - no real tech anymore besides a zone option select. No recovery cancels, huge gb vulnerability, shinobi gets gbd so deep into their heavy animation its pitiful. The entire cast is safer than what should be an agile and deadly warrior in the game, cmon. Bezerker is deadly, Pks deadly now that they have enhanced lights on bleed, Shamans deadly and can heal without feats plus basically do a sickle rain mixup with her bite. My point is, it is clear people want shinobi to be the bottom of the barrel or deleted. Its complete hypocrisy and any problem people have with his kit...someone else does better. Better CC, better enhanced defense, better enhanced offense, recovery cancels, legit tech. Its a shame and people need to grow up. Ninjas were real get over it! Weeb this, weeb that. Goes to show that a large part of the FH community has some bias, and the ignorance to deny the double standards. PS thank you for this game, the concept is beautiful and has easily been my favorite game to ever be released."
55,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"With the new changes of making every opener heavy have 433ms of GB vulnerability in patch 2.18, the devs might as well speed up Hitokiri's opener heavies back to 700ms",1,fhpbpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fhpbpe/with_the_new_changes_of_making_every_opener_heavy/,2020-03-13 09:51:07,"Title. Anyone remember the absolutely retarded ""HeBy On ReD"" quality that Hitokiri had with his opener heavies that had HA after 300ms? Well, I hated that too, but I also hated the part where his opener heavies were 700ms as well. That pissed me off more, safe to say. But since then, his heavies have been nerfed, speed and HA and damage alike. And while I agree a lot with all of them at the time, that was due to the rules of GB vulnerability being tied to attack speed. But with that being thrown out, maybe it's time to rethink on some aspects of some characters. Namely, Hitokiri. Now, a 700ms chargeable heavy w/ HA on the last 400ms was outright insane. But with the nerf to HA and to GB vulnerability, would the 700ms heavies be outrageous now?"

58,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,The GB vulnerability changes should have came with rework or compensation.,1,fijmfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fijmfe/the_gb_vulnerability_changes_should_have_came/,2020-03-15 01:59:34,"I think these changes to guardbreak vulnerability on heavies was a mistake. These changes came into effect because people wanted to be on auto-pilot and be able to feint -&gt; guardbreak against every character match up. People should at least take some kind of responsibility in being familiar with the match. For example, we all should know from experience that Orochi's top heavy only has 100ms gb vulnerability. So instead of doing top heavy and feinting into groundbreak, **you should instead do top heavy and feint into a light attack.** There are already other parry option selects like zone attacks, bash option selects, etc that we have to be wary about. And dealing with those **is more unintuitive than a fast heavy with 100ms guardbreak vulnerability.** I mean come on, lets be for real. If you KNOW that a specific character has 100ms guard vulnerabilities, why do you continue to try to heavy -&gt; guardbreak? Some of these changes are going to feel a little busted and it's going to mess up the balance of the game a little bit. Centurion was already struggling in duels. One of his biggest strengths was that he can initiate with heavies more safely and not worry about being randomly guardbroken. But with these changes he will struggle more in 1v1 now. Aramusha doesn't have an unreactable opener. One way he can initiate his offense is to land a blocked heavy and start his deadly feint mix ups. It is much more risky to do that now and he will have to worry about getting guardbroken in the mid animation of his heavy. **Even though the intent might be just trying to open up the opponent, and not to parry.** Heavies are not just for parrying, they are meant to deal good damage and to start offense for some characters. They are nerfed with intent to make heavy feint -&gt; guardbreak more viable but as consequence they will make offense feel less safe for characters like Aramusha, Centurion, Orochi, Gladiator. If the heavies were meant to be nerf and all have a larger guardbreak vulnerability window, these characters should have been compensated with a little rework or buff in other attacks."
59,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Every Character Should Have A Zone Parry Option Select That Beats Out Feint GB,1,fjznja,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fjznja/every_character_should_have_a_zone_parry_option/,2020-03-17 16:14:51,"This is mainly to address the few characters in the game who can't use their Zone to option select and beat out a feint GB, this includes Raider (his Zone is 900ms and therefore has 400ms GB vulnerability), Valkyrie (despite being 700ms her Zone has 400ms of GB vulnerability and is basically the same as using a heavy to parry), and Nuxia (her Zone is 1000ms and has 400ms of GB vulnerability). Do let me know if there are any others without a Zone option select parry than can beat out a feint GB. Considering that 24 out of 27 characters can use this option selects I think all characters should be able to use it as a standard piece of a character's moveset. There are two changes that could be reasonably argued in my eyes: One: All zone attacks having 100ms of GB vulnerability, this would mean that despite the 900ms and 1000ms duration of Raider's and Nuxia's respective zone attacks, they would still beat out a feint GB (Valkyrie's is just a bug, at 700ms it should have 100ms of GB vulnerability in the current game). The only issue I see with this is that it means that Raider and Nuxia could both feint their option select parry attempts and be safe from a parry, but some heroes like Glad and BP have zone attacks that can't be parried at all because their bashes (I'm not including the second hit of Glad's zone). The other issue that I don't think is a big deal but I'll mention is that Raider will get 28 damage off an option select, the reason I don't think that this is a big deal is because 11 of the current option selects deal 20 damage and the next most common number is actually 25 damage with 4 heroes getting that amount, 28 damage is only a small amount ahead of the next most damaging option selects and damage values are being changed soon so it's not a big deal imo. Two: The characters who don't have a zone parry option select that beats out feint GB are given new Zone attacks that do. Personally I would prefer that of the three characters that this applies to at least one gets really good zone for 1v1s, I mean why do only the knights get the super strong zones, with PK, Conq, BP, and Gladiator? The other thing that would have to be updated for this is that Raider would need to have Kensei's ability, where a GB allows him to go into the 2nd attack chain so he can get a side heavy off of GB and isn't stuck with a Light like poor HL because he wouldn't have a high damage Zone to use as a punish. Considering those options the first is easier to do while the second would be better for overall balance and gameplay. If you have a better idea or any thoughts on zone option selects leave a comment. =)"

I know that this change was needed to help the game, but damn... In my opinion, he doesn't have any offensive pressure at all, besides SB and unblockable-heavy. For example, if he wants to parry a heavy attack and the opponent tries to hard-feint and do a GB the Conq don't have any other safer choice than: 1.soft- feinting into full block stance *(which gives the enemy a lot of time to GB him out of it)* 2. soft-feinting into *""reactable""* bash *(nearly every hero has a dodge-attack/dodge-bash to counter it)* 3. committing to it and get parried *(which drains a* **HALF** *of Conq's whole stamina)* What is your opinion about that?

64,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Neutral pressure from characters that dont have neutral/dodge bashes. Enhanced neutral lights.,1,fqmmr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fqmmr0/neutral_pressure_from_characters_that_dont_have/,2020-03-29 02:49:48,"In the live version and in the TG version of the game, characters who dont have neutral bashes have their lights easily blocked and their only mix ups come from their heavies, against an enemy who is turtling and wont be interrupted. With the GB vuln on heavy openers increased, characters like that have even less reasons to try to throw their heavies against enemies (I'm not saying the GB vuln was a bad change, it was a great one). So currently, lights are more interruption tools than offensive tools. Currently bashes are much stronger when compared to other forms of neutral offense (No need to nerf bashes, just buff neutral offense). Here are some of their advantages: \-Can ledge (except for jorm's when the enemy has stamina) \-Can force an entry to a zone \-Can interrupt GB throws of enemies who have revenge \-Can interrupt hiper armor \-Can be used safely if the enemy is OOS \-Can be used to gank \-Cant be option selected \-Can be used externally to apply pressure \-Can be used on enemies who are holding revenge without the risk of getting auto parried on activation &amp;#x200B; The problem lies in the fact that neutral lights get interrupted on block, and it completely stops the hero's momentum and any attempt at getting on their chain offense. Characters with neutral bashes or dodge bashes dont have to worry about that, since their offense cant be ""ignored"" by blocking. Having neutral bashes already makes it more difficult for the enemy to react to light attacks, if they are focusing on reacting to the bash. Also, bashes arent always punishable on reaction and requires risky reads to punish. Neutral lights can be easily blocked on reaction to stop the offense. If they were enhanced, they would be more of a threat, since blocking it would mean having to deal with ""unreactable"" chain offense, therefore forcing the enemy to parry lights instead of just blocking it and actually taking risks. It would make heavy mix ups more viable and interrupted less frequently, since lights would be more usable. Having enhanced lights OPENERS also helps a lot to attack in outnumbered situations, as you dont get staggered for getting blocked and you could combo with chain heavies now that they have 100ms vulnerability. Not all characters need that, but i believe the ones without quick neutral pressure need it, in my opinion. If you want to go a step further you can make all 500ms lights openers, chain and finishers enchanced. They are so easy to block, even in TG, that you can just ignore them when your enemy uses them. When you have decent offense you can choose to not parry anything, so your enemy cannot actually hit you with a heavy because you wont attempt a light parry and so on. There would not be a problem with hitstun on LLL chains since with the TG changes all attacks would be max delayed, meaning you would always be able to dodge 500ms chain lights. This way, turtles would still take some chip damage and still have to deal with chain offense, against those who have it."

Both Uncharged and Partial Charged Shoulder Bash Charge timings share a Soft Feint into Chained Lights while the Fully Charged Shoulder Bash Charge can be Soft Feinted into Heavy Finishers or a Unblockable Zone. The Soft Feint into Heavy Finishers and Zone is only accessible during the 100ms Window before the Fully Charged Shoulder Bash beings but after the 900ms Shoulder Bash Charge Window ends. The Chain Side Light access can be used or catch Dodge OS which Warden previously could not punish. Heavy Finishers can be used as an alternative Unblockable Mixup or Dodge Punish and Zone can be Target Swapped for a wide Unblockable Hitbox. Shoulder Bash now has access to Undodgeables, Unblockables, Wide Hit Boxes, and all while still being Feintable variable timed Bash. Soft Feint into Zone especially adds a damaging although slow and vulnerable tool for Off Target attacks in teamfights while the faster Unblockable Mixup in chain gives Warden way to quickly pressure externally guarding opponents or assist in ganks with big quick Damage."
66,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Nobushi Changes,1,ftetpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ftetpr/nobushi_changes/,2020-04-02 14:12:16,"I'm sure most people can agree right now that Nobushi is hot garbage and definitely needs some changes. As a Nobushi main myself, I want to just throw out some ideas that Ubi could use to rework my girl because she needs it badly. Now I don't consider myself a pro or anything, but I do know enough to know what makes a good character. Here's some ideas I thought of, feel free to criticize them if they're too much: # Hidden Stance * GB vulnerability is lost at I-Frame end (Can counter GB after the first 500ms of HS) * Hidden Stance now uses 20 stamina to enter (was 24) * Now hides 66ms of the indicator for ALL attacks (including kick, heavies, zone and dodge attacks) * Can soft-feint ALL heavies into HS in a 200ms-400ms variable window (was 200ms only) &gt;*These changes will make Hidden Stance more useful than just a second dodge and will allow her to use it more aggressively, allowing her to access offensive options from it (explained later). Reducing the stamina cost will also allow it to see more use, and reducing the GB vulnerability will let her stay in Hidden Stance without getting punished. Hiding 66ms of all attacks out of HS will give her an unreactable bash out of HS and better offense overall.* # Lights * Top Light Opener is now 466ms * Side Lights in chain (except for guaranteed light finisher) are 400ms * Chained Top Light is 466ms and is undodgeable * Light attack block recovery reduced to 600ms (from 700ms) &gt;*400ms chain lights will give her chain pressure and make her less parryable and risky to play (really it's a change that a lot of the cast needs and will benefit from). Giving her the undodgeable top light will allow her to catch dodges mid chain and will allow for a mix-up if the opponent tries to dodge the kick on prediction, they would get hit by the top light. Additionally, since the lights out of HS are chain lights, Nobushi will have 367ms side lights and a 400ms undodgeable top light out of HS, giving her an unreactable offense out of HS.* # Heavies * Heavy Finishers are undodgeable * Heavy recovery can be cancelled with dodge * Out of lock heavies come out from the sides (Rather than side -&gt; top) &gt;*Undodgeable heavy finishers will allow for a mix-up with Kick, along with giving HS another undodgeable option, further increasing her offense and giving her more chain pressure outside of Kick. She will also have a L + L + H chain so she wont be as predictable. Changing her Out of Lock heavy hitboxes will help with clearing minions and hitting external targets.* # Kick * Kick is now 500ms (down from 566ms) * Kick recovery reduced to 700ms (down from 900ms) * Kick range is increased * Nobushi can no longer Kick after Light Finisher &gt;*Nobushi's current Kick is slow and easily punished by a reaction based dodge and Guardbreak. By increasing the speed of the Kick and lowering recovery, opponents will now have to do a read to avoid the kick and punish it. Not being able to Kick after a light finisher will make Nobushi only be able to kick after non-bleed attacks and make it to where the 2nd light is not always followed up by the guaranteed light finisher, thus strengthening her mix up. Also makes her less spammy.* # Zone Attack * First strike sped up to 500ms (from 600ms) * Second strike is removed * Zone is undodgeable * Zone recovery can be canceled into HS, Kick, Viper's Retreat, or dodge &gt;*The 2nd part of the Zone attack is completely useless. Removing it will cause the zone attack to cost less stamina to use, and with the recovery cancels, Nobushi will have better flow as she won't always have to feint that second hit, plus she will be able to follow up after her zone. Making the zone undodgeable and speeding it up will give it more utility. Being able to use Zone out of HS will give her 3 different undodgeable options to ensure that people can't just back dodge away when she goes into HS.* # Dodge Attacks * Sidewinder recovery now branches to HS, dodge, Viper's Retreat, and Kick starting at 400ms (from 500ms) * Dodge now branches to Cobra Strike and Sidewinder from 100ms to 400ms (from 200ms to 400ms) * Cobra Strike is sped up to 500ms (from 600ms) * Cobra Strike recovery now chains to heavies * Cobra Strike is undodgeable * Viper's Retreat damage reduced to 5 + 10 bleed (from 6 + 12 bleed) * Viper's Retreat is 400ms when used as a recovery cancel &gt;*These changes will bring back Nobushi's old flow and make her feel less clunky. Cobra Strike chaining to heavy opener will provide more pressure after using and being undogdeable is a nice cherry on top. Speeding up the attack will make it a little more safe to use from neutral. Viper's retreat is a nice follow-up tool to use after a heavy or light chain, but unfortunately it gets blocked a lot and sometimes parried. Speeding it up as a recovery will allow it to see more use and reducing the damage is a fair trade off for a faster attack. If Viper's Retreat was sped up from neutral, rather than just as recovery, it would become a Peacekeeper Zone Attack level option select, which is not healthy for the game.* # New Attack: Boa Plunge *Nobushi winds up and plunges her blade into the enemy's chest, pinning them and dealing huge bleed damage.* * Input: Back -&gt; Heavy * Only accessible after any non-bleed attack or from HS * Unblockable, omnidirectional heavy stab attack * Deals 15 + 20 bleed * Consumes 15 stamina on use * 900ms attack * Can be hard feinted or soft-feinted into Viper's retreat, dodge or HS * Nobushi yells ""Kurae!"" when performing this move *This move behaves like Gladiator's skewer, in that it has no recovery (so it can be followed up with unconfirmed light openers or heavies) or can be followed up with a special kick (different from the one she currently has, so no confirmed follow-up) that deals can create distance or wallsplat.* &gt;*At this point, Nobushi is back in the game and her main problems are already fixed. this was just a really cool move i thought of and decided to throw it in here. This move would give Nobushi a nice unblockable attack that can be used as a mixup and once again, another HS option. Heavy inspiration from Glad's Skewer because i honestly think it's one of the coolest moves in the game and would like to see Nobushi get something similar. The heavy bleed damage will help her deal more damage with Way of the Shark and giving her another voiceline will be a huge buff (seriously give the older heroes more voicelines, I need to drown out Tiandi's screaming). Of course this addition is not necessary in order for her to be viable again,but would be very cool to see.* # Swift Recoil * Swift Recoil is reimplimented * No longer uses stamina * Bound to feint button rather than dodge * Has 200ms of I-frames * SR recovery can be cancelled into HS or dodge * Decrease distance traveled by 40% &gt;*Swift Recoil was a good idea for a move, but was executed very poorly, and did more harm than good. Countless of times Nobushi was put out of stamina, or hit by another attack because of accidental use of this move. However, it is a move that made Nobushi really unique and would like to see it reimplimented once again, but better this time. Giving it I-Frames, getting rid of the stamina cost, and bounding the button to feint is a great way of making sure that you don't die because you accidentally used this move. also being able to chain into more I-Frames will allow more safety when used.* # Other Changes * Increase Nobushi's Guardbreak range * New chain: L + L + H * Give her [Off-Target Enhanced Attacks](URL &gt;*A few more changes that will definitely help. Increased GB range so GBs won't miss when you think they would've connected. LLH chain so she is less predictable and has more flexibility in her chains with more options for mixups. Off-Target Emhanced Attacks is something that all characters should have and most characters do have (Except for 9, Nobushi being one of them).* That's about it of what I think Ubisoft could do to make Nobushi great again. For reference, I am 110 reps overall with 20 reps on Nobushi and admittedly, not all of these changes are my original idea, so [here's](URL a link to another post made by people who are ~~better than me at the game~~ more credible than I am that I ~~stole~~ borrowed some ideas from. They also had more people working on it, whereas, I just wrote this, looked at it again a month later and said, ""What, was I high?"" to some of the changes and edited accordingly. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # &amp;#x200B; #"
67,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Since dodge bashes can be used as option selects: what if dodge bashes had 333ms of GB vulnerability instead of only 100ms?,1,ftzfmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ftzfmr/since_dodge_bashes_can_be_used_as_option_selects/,2020-04-03 12:57:38,"This would make these moves have the same GB vuln as heavy attacks from neutral, a total of 433ms. Currently you can input the dodge bash along with a heavy on parry timing and it will serve as an option select, as it has been shown here a while ago. This made heavy attack based characters weakers, since a random GB has higher chances of interrupting them. This would also be the case with dodge bashes, but since they are great defensive and interruption tools they would be less stronger defensively. They would still work the same offensively. Having such option selects can make a character much stronger, since it is an extra read for the enemy, who is already wrong for attacking with something that isnt a bash. Most if not all characters who have these 500ms dodge bashes have usable zone option selects, which make reads for parry baits much more difficult. If the enemy keeps mixing you up whenever you throw an attack, it's better to just not attack, since your attack will never land and you will have to keep guessing which option selects will be used everytime."
68,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha Rework (More Changes To My Previous One),1,eyslcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/eyslcr/aramusha_rework_more_changes_to_my_previous_one/,2020-02-05 03:28:49,"I did a few months back a post like this one and since I recently ""reposted"" my Orochi Rework (URL I thought I'd do the same for my other reworks/changes posts. I added new things and tried to make everything a bit more clear! Thanks for reading and have a nice one! I think Aramusha is and has been in a pretty weird place. He's both *strong and weak*. Overall he is a fun hero to play, but still lacks a bit of *sauce*! So, after some thought and some new ideas, I've come up with a few quality of life changes for Aramusha, that I think are needed. *Without going any further, I want to thank you all for reading and ""any"" feedback is welcome* My goal here is to: - Make Aramusha more versatile; - Give him more options; - Balance speed and damage; - Other. - **NEW** Oh, and have a Female Aramusha (that would be nice not gonna lie); I don't want to change his chains, meaning that the whole **top/side/top/side** *Tempest* thing will stay as it is. Although: - Neutral Side Heavies can be soft feinted to a Light Attack either to Top or the opposite Side (just like his ""Deadly Feint""); - (Mid Chain) Top Light is Enhanced (meaning they don't bounce off if blocked); - **NEW** Top Chain Finisher Heavy can be soft feinted into GB (or the Deadly Feint with Light Attacks to the sides); - **NEW** Side Chain Finishers can be soft feinted into the Blade Blockade Kick by pressing the GB button (or the Deadly Feints with Light Attacks to top or the opposite side) (details about the kick are below); Another change would be to his **Rushing Wind** *(Alternate)* (Dodge Forward Side Heavy): - Has Undodgeable properties (to better catch rolls and more pressure); - Can be soft feinted to a Light Attack from the opposite side; - Can be soft feinted to the Blade Blockade Kick (details about the Kick are below); **Blade Blockade And Soft Feint To Kick Changes** - (on hit) you will not be in Light Attack range; - (on hit) you can chain automatically to an Heavy Attack to the Top or Sides; - Top Heavy (after the Kick) is guaranteed and counts as a chain starter; - Side Heavies (after the Kick) are not guaranteed and count as a chain finisher; - the kick will push your enemy away from you just like it does now. Once you press Heavy Attack you'll be teleported to the enemy (like the Sprint Attack Teleport); Details: - (after the kick hits) Top Heavy animation is just like the *Rushing Wind* (Dodge Forward Top Heavy) but Aramusha disappears and appears near the enemy (use of the teleport, like the Sprint Attack); - (after the kick hits) Side Heavies animations are just like the Side Heavy finishers but (again) Aramusha disappears and appears near the enemy (use of the teleport, like the Sprint Attack); - (after the kick) Side Heavies are guaranteed on a wallsplat; **Guard Break:** - Top Light Attack will be changed to the **Ring the Bell**; You can still throw the enemy after doing that (damage and stun are only applied on hit, thus making it possible to be hit/stopped from outside attacks); **Blade Blockade:** - Kick, will now have the mix up/properties I described above; - Ring the Bell, will also make you able to throw the enemy just like in the guard break (damage and stun are only applied on hit, thus making it possible to be hit/stopped from outside attacks); **Damage/Speed Changes:** - Top Neutral Light - 15dmg; - Top Chain Light - 17dmg; - Top Neutral Heavy - 25dmg; - Top Chain Heavy - 28dmg; - Side Neutral Light - 15dmg; - Side Chain Light - 15dmg; - Side Neutral Heavy - 35 - Side Chain Heavy - 30 - All Heavy Chain Finishers will do 40dmg; - Deadly Feint Speed nerf - 400ms to 433ms or 466ms (only reason being that now you can soft feint to the kick at ""any"" point, so imo there's no reason to make the mix up 400ms when you have more options to hit your enemy and play a with all the soft feints) (a direction delay could even be added, to prevent flickers and to so the speed nerf is not too noticed); - Deadly Feint Damage: Side - 20dmg to 17dmg; Top - 15dmg to 17dmg; - Ring the Bell - 15dmg to 10dmg (plus the stun); **Standard Changes:** - Heavy Attacks have the same Guard Break vulnerability like ""all"" heroes; - Top Heavy no longer guaranteed after a Heavy Parry. And that's about it, let me know what you all think! Have a nice one!"

70,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Couple things I picked up from the patch notes and a bit of playtime.,1,ezyba2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ezyba2/couple_things_i_picked_up_from_the_patch_notes/,2020-02-07 07:18:58,"First of all, brief opinion on the new patch. Was kinda hoping for some bigger changes and possibly a rework, seeing as we didn't get a new hero, but considering the team had their efforts placed into other things (battle pass and stuff like that) I can kinda see why. Now onto what I picked up. And please note that any things that I've marked I've not tested and am just thinking off of the top of my head. - First of all, Shinobi's quad dash was removed due to the ranged heavy changes. Probably not intended, but at this point Ubi are just beating a dead horse. - (NOT TESTED YET) HL's new GB vulnerability sounds like it's gonna really affect certain OS moves, namely his kick. from what I can think of anyways, sounds like if you have a fast enough reaction, you can possibly get a GB off of a whiffed kick? Needs testing and I don't have anyone to test with unfortunately. - Raider got his tap animations fixed, which seemed to be the main complaint with the old stunning tap (on top of the stun stacking, of course). If the stun stacking was removed too, stun tap could easily make a return and not be quite as busted as it used to be. - (NOT TESTED, only for second bit) Bear Trap is definetely the biggest trap hurt by the new changes, as you can only hide it behind certain corners due to its larger size and smaller AoE. Not yet tested if traps can still be hidden inside minions and stuff however, and if they are still able to they might still be strong on very map specific locations (main one I can think of is Harbour Point C). If you want to share any of your own stuff, then please chip in."
71,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Should 1v1, 2v2 and 4v4 have different balancing?",1,f04qsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/f04qsr/should_1v1_2v2_and_4v4_have_different_balancing/,2020-02-07 14:47:27,"Before anything I want to specify that it would only be scaled differences for ALL heroes in that mode, not different values for each character because that would basically make them a new hero. I'm talking about general aspects of gameplay that are balanced in one game mode, but not in the other. There are already things in the game that are different, like the stamina drain for running away in duels, and not having revenge. However, I think 4v4 balance causes some other problems with duels that could be pretty easily fixed. I think two good changes for duels would be to increase chip damage, and increase either stamina pools or stamina regain. In 4v4, you can put more pressure on people with the help of teammates and feats, but in 1v1 it's just you and your moveset. A lot of heroes suffer with their offense because most of their attacks can be blocked, and the 20% chip damage is really insignificant, like aramusha. He's usable because of deadly feints, high parry punishes and his 100 ms GB vulnerability heavies, but his offense is lacking. If everybody effectively had punch through (40% chip damage), heroes like aramusha, warlord, peacekeeper and more would become a lot more threatening, and it would force you to try and dodge/parry more normal heavies. For stamina, it makes sense that two jorms shouldn't be able to endlessly abuse you in a gank, and you can pretty easily retreat to regain your stamina in team fights. In duels, there's a huge difference in stamina cost to get the same amount of damage. Think about shaolin and hitokiri. Shaolin needs to first get into qi, and often do a lot of feinting and mixups to get in some good damage, whereas hitokiri can get twice as much damage with half the stamina cost from the kick mixup. Considering bash offense is so strong right now, and bashes pause or drain stamina, a hero like shaolin can be very easily put OOS by someone like lawbringer after one parry, and can also be kept there. Having a bigger stamina pool would allow everyone to sustain their offense for longer, and faster stamina regain would make stamina drain less punishing, **TD;DR**, I think everyone should have punch through in duels to encourage offense and discourage blocking, and more stamina. What do you think?"
72,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Improvements to Nobushi and her current state (Rework),1,f0sjxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/f0sjxv/improvements_to_nobushi_and_her_current_state/,2020-02-09 01:52:51,"Hey all, this is Nutella and I've refined my hero adjustments for Nobushi - I'm looking forward to reading your feedback and discussing on my current take. Let's get right into it then, shall we? ####Hidden Stance - Hidden stance will now affect the indicator of all attacks. - Hidden stance now only hides 33ms (was 100ms) of all attack indicators. - Hidden stance loses GB vulnerability a bit after all I-frames end. (633ms into HS) (as in, once you lose iframes you can CGB) - Can soft feint all heavies (changed from just neutral heavies) into HS in a 200-400ms variable window (from 200ms) - Stamina usage reduced from 24 to 15. &gt; Author Notes: Hidden stance now has an extra use besides being a dodge - itll provide a temple of options for Nobushi - she has her high range undodgeable heavies that allow her to stop opponents from dodging her HS, her top lights to get damage in if they backdodge without guard on top, and to stop one from dodging her lights with ease. Her heavies having a variable window of soft feint into HS will make this feature actually useful - as you could bait someone with a delayed soft feint into HS into a parry. HS losing GB vulnerability allows her to stay in stance without being punished for it - so you are able to hold it in a teamfight and not get immediately punished. &gt; &gt; The indicator shroud of 33ms will now affect all attacks from HS, including those started from a dodge - meaning its much easier and rewarding for the Nobu to actually attack out of this stance, rather than to use it as nothing but a double dodge. ####Light Attacks - Side lights in chain are 400ms (from 500ms) - Top light chain is now 466ms (from 500ms) and is now undodgeable. - Light finisher window extended to 300ms (from 200ms). - Second side light attack damage nerfed to 6 (was 10). - Third side (confirmed) light attack damage nerfed to 10 bleed (was 2+12b). - Light attack damage standardised. (Her HS light attack damage was different than from neutral.) &gt; Author Notes: These changes to her lights are intended to further her chain pressure - and even more so in HS. Undodgeable top light means you cannot freely backdodge the stance, though static guard heroes 'can' guard top and backdodge. Also stops the dilemma of a hero like JJ who has his lights parried as they do not share the consistent UB property his heavies do. Her side light damage has been nerfed due to the speed of them, allowing for more fair gameplay and more chances to read the Nobushi. ####Heavy Attacks - Chain heavies are undodgeable (seeing as theyve made it pseudo-undodgeable with the range changes, this will cement that.) &gt; Author Notes: Hidden stance will now have a multitude of undodgeable options, meaning you can easily mixup and trick an opponent into parrying your light attack undodgeables. Her chain heavies aren't easily pointed out by this change, as vipers retreat and her chain top light are undodgeable too. ####New Chains - L  H  H chain added - L  LL(confirmed double lights)  H chain added - H  H  H chain added. - Third heavy is the exact same in terms of damage and properties to the second heavy. (35 damage, undodgeable.) &gt; Author Notes: The third indicator (counting her double lights as a single move) is always a light, so adding x x H chains is direly needed, which allows for Nobushi to actually throw more attacks once her 'main' chain is over. This also provides additional flow - Nobu is able to sneak back into HS if she has the stamina at this point, and 'restart' her combo. ####Dodge Attacks - Sidewinder has actual I-frames, rather than being a dodge cancel, giving them an easier timing for usage on dodges. - Vipers retreat is now undodgeable. - Cobra Strike is an actual chain starter. (Didnt chain into heavies before.) - Cobra Strike is now 500ms. (from 600ms). &gt; Author Notes: This will give Nobushi flow - retaining both her dodge cancelling nature with her dodge lights (cobra strike), whilst speeding these up - allowing for them to land easily from neutral. The ability to chain out of them will add further flow to Nobushis kit, so shell be able to attack without going back into neutral. Sidewinder having I-frames will make them into a tool thats actually worth using a teamfight as itd have relative safety, comparative to Kensei, or Shamans dodge attack in one. This will allow for Nobushi to be much more user friendly at the lower levels too. Vipers retreat as an undodgeable causes Nobushi to have the tools to punish people spacing her on a read from neutral, whilst also being able to be used quickly from HS, so one cannot truly backdodge her stance. ####Kick Changes - Kick is now 500ms (from 566ms). (Or 533ms, I really want opinions on a 466ms indicator bash from HS.) - Kick GB recovery lowered to 600ms. (from 900ms). - Kick Dodge recovery lowered to 700ms (from 900ms). - Up the chain link of kick by 33 ms. (Not sure about the exact number, but this is to stop guard swap delay stopping a dodge on wall splat kicks.) &gt; Author Notes: Theres no reason to keep bashes above 500ms when new characters exist and show us how good this choice of offense is. Thisll cause her kick to be a tool that one must dodge moreso on prediction, rather than reaction - especially from HS, where the indicator will be 466ms (or 500, depending on the prior number). Combined with her undodgeables, this will increase her pressure from HS and in chains dramatically, but not so much in chain as to allow for her to only rely upon kick. GB recovery has been lowered to cause GB punishes to come from prediction dodges - which can be combated on read from a Nobushi with delaying her kick. ####Zone Attack - Zone attack second strike is unblockable. - Zone attack second strike can be soft feinted into a dodge/HS. - Zone attack second strike is sped up to 700ms (from 900ms) - Zone attack second strike bleed stacks. - Zone attack second strike damage increased to 5+20b. (From 1+20b). - Zone attack second strike recovery can be dodge cancelled. - Zone attack second strike recovery can be cancelled with HS. &gt; Author Notes: Half of Nobushis zone has always been good, but the second half has consistently dragged it down. With these changes - itll now apply decent pressure, with Nobushi being able to move into her kit, or dodge cancel into an attack, providing some much needed pressure in 1s. Itll also remedy a bug that the developers either overlooked - or intentionally made (the 20 bleed that currently cannot stack). The zone will now function like it belongs in Nobushis kit, allowing her to flow into other parts. ####Recoveries - Starter light miss recovery (for blocking) adjusted to 600ms (from 700ms) - Starter light miss recovery (for dodging) adjusted to 600ms (from 900ms) - Zone attack second strike recovery can be cancelled with a dodge cancel. - Dodge now branches to Sidewinder from 100ms to 400ms (from 200ms to 400ms - this brings back her old flow, which is direly needed) - Dodge now branches to Cobra Strike from 100ms to 400ms (from 200ms to 400ms) - Sidewinder recovery now branches to Dodge, Retreating Viper, and Kick starting at 400ms (from 500ms) &gt; Author Notes: The much needed revert to her flow changes - this should fix and even improve what it was, compared to previously (due to the increase in windows, from 200ms variable, to a 300ms variable). Constant chaining will leave you GB vulnerable to enemies that you arent hitting. Nobushi previously had the issue of her lights leaving her incredibly vulnerable - so much so that you could feint a buffered heavy after, and have a shorter recovery. ####Quality of Life changes - Make her external heavies horizontal, allowing for easier unlocked attacks on minions/pikemen for the general playerbase. (currently right then top, make it right then right or right then left) - Give her [Off-Target Enhanced Attacks](URL (This will help with a few fringe cases - but this should be enabled on every character (currently isnt for 9 of them, and Nobu is among one of them.) &gt; Author Notes: This is a change thatll help her slightly in breach and in the dominion mid lane at lower levels - there is no reason to keep chained attacks while unlocked on a top guard, as they have the smallest hitboxes in terms of width, and all of hers now deal the same damage. ####Swift Recoil - Swift Recoil is reimplemented. - Swift Recoil is now used after hitting an enemy's guard. - Swift Recoil now gives 300ms of iframes from usage. - Swift Recoil is used via the feint key, rather than the dodge key. - Swift Recoil's recovery can be cancelled with her dodges or cancelled into HS. - Removed the stamina pause of Swift Recoil, stamina now recharges as you gain space. &gt; Author notes: Swift recoil used to be a completely dead move - even shown by Ubi with their inability to rework it into an actual move, as they instead opted to completely remove it. The move will now function as something Nobu can use to space in fours - giving her a healthy amount of I-frames rather than just distance (previously youd get hit whilst using this move). The ability to dash cancel and HS cancel allows for chaining more i-frames, in exchange for GB vulnerability. Again, allowing her to quickly space against her opponent(s), allowing the zoner character to actually maintain a healthy distance - dictating where she wants to be in the fight. Changing the usage key to the feint key means that it will never be used on accident - unlike the previous version. Additionally, despite the similarities to Shinobis old backflip, one must remember Nobushis slow lock on movement speed, meaning she cannot space by backwalking. This would force an opponent to go for a parry if they didnt want Nobushi to space, which gives her some more mixup potential."

His entire defensive kit was slow and completely reactable. At least with his OS you could spam parry attempts as they continue to invade your personal space trying to give you a kiss. I say he got Nobushi'd as they've both had their defence castrated whilst having their ability fight neglected/nerfed. If they GB you then you can backdodge after the counter GB but that isn't always enough distance to use a light to get into offensive stance let alone getting into it neutrally. Other than that you can enter the fight in offensive form and try and stay in it from then on. Defensive form is useless if they know to not give you any distance. You can't do anything without getting parried as his entire defensive kit is far too slow to be bait of any kind. Highlander has had his balls removed with this patch. At first I was like ""Offensive cancels mean he can fight pretty much every class even those considered his counters"" but now with this nerf I don't think that's enough. I think I'm gonna start vouching for a Highlander Rework with the rest of them now. I was hoping he would be buffed with the removal of his option select but apparently not."

Jotunn Surge can now be used as a Opener into Chain Finishers however remains vulnerable to interrupts, Dodge GB, and Dodge Attacks. For 4v4 Forward Dodge Unblockable Heavy for 36 damage is both easy to confirm and involves a Confirmed Bash into Confirmed Light. The significant amount of hitstun can confirm additional attacks while feeding a ton of revenge. Outside of a 1v1 or Xv1 ganks Jormungandr contributes very little to a team. Outside of Serpent Smite Jormungandr has minimal defensive damage with a 25 GB Punish, 16 Heavy Parry Punish, and 30 Light Parry Punish. Serpent Smite Parry Option Select is a ""*little""* over tuned as it is completely GB immune and rewards 36 damage for catching *all* Feint GB attempts. Luckily due to the abysmal Feint timing and removal of armor Serpent Smite is now vulnerable to all manner of Interrupts or even certain Mixups because of the incredibly long 1000ms + 100ms windup. Jotunn Farewell now grants 23 Damage while being a 500ms Chain Bash. Roughly 6-7 Chain Bashes to deplete a health bar. For comparison a uncharged Warden Shoulder Bash takes 7-9 while Black Prior Chain Tenebris Rising takes 8-9. Unlike those two however Jormungandr does 17-25 damage for catching Dodge attempts compared to Warden's 18-40 or Black Prior's 17-35. Hitokiri more comparatively has a 28 damage Chain Bash with 18-28 damage for catching Dodge attempts. More balanced damage distribution within Mixups avoids huge health swings for a single correct or incorrect read for both the defender and attacker."
75,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Buffing into viability: Samurai edition.,1,f3lb2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/f3lb2u/buffing_into_viability_samurai_edition/,2020-02-14 13:23:08,"Now that is confirmed that this year will be focused on balance, i find reasonable to start proposing realistic buffs that would improve the viability of different heroes, now we need to propose realistic buffs that need to follow certain rules in order to promote the pressing of buttons but that also would not be to difficult for the devs to implement. Rules that should be followed among the cast: * When talking about the dmg deals by heavies is simple, 25 dmg is low, 30 dmg is normal and 35 dmg is high, 40 dmg or higher should be considered extreme dmg and only done under special circumstances but ***not from a light parry.*** * Enhanced lights should be common among the cast but not thrown around into every light, in my opinion they should be implemented in such a way that would improve the flow and maintain the offensive momentum of a character. * Chip dmg should be buffed to something like 40%, this would improve mix ups without making them unblockables that unless the enemy performs an action to counter it they will eat dmg close to a light. * Unblockables should be buffed, a lot of heroes are put OOS just for daring being offensive, the way they should be buffed is that they no longer cost extra stam when parried but they should have a higher stam cost to balance that improvement. * An ""opener"", read as your main way to deal dmg should deal between 15-18 dmg, this is acceptable among cast as normal dmg to initiate a fight. * Every hero should have improved hitboxes, the hability to hit enemies with target swapped attacks is so vital for teamfights that i am amazed how some heroes have non existant hitboxes. With that said this are my changes. # Kensei: Kensei has a problem when initiating offense in 1v1, this is that he is easily interrupted from his pommel strike mix up, so i'm eliminating this issue. * Neutral heavy (all directions) deals 38 dmg. * Neutral top heavy is speed up to 900 ms, soft feints still occur 400 ms before impact. Neutral side heavies dealing only 38 dmg would eliminate the fact that he kills 120 hp heroes with 3 light parries but kensei desing is one of a hard hitter with only 120 hp, so he needs to deal extreme dmg specially taking into account how common tankier heroes are present in the meta, the rule should be simple low hp higher dmg. A buff to his neutral top heavy would allow him to not get as easily interrupted as he is right now, allowing to actually use his pommel strike/gb mix up. * Foward dash light (helm splitter) is now enhanced. * Foward dash heavy (nature wrath) is 700 ms, feintable and deals 30 dmg. Kensei needs some other ways to access reliably into his unblockable mix up, adding a foward dash mix up to reach it would add another option to that purpose, nature wrath being 700 ms would serve its actual purpose of being a roll catcher and with it being 30 dmg would be on par with his side chained heavy. * Chained and light finishers are enhanced. Chained enhanced lights would improve his hability to reach his unblockable finisher safely, right now unless your enemy is an old man he will block those chained lights ending the offense right there, if we want to promote the pressing of buttons enhanced lights should be more common among the cast. * Side heavy finisher deals 40 dmg. Kensei has only 120 hp, so when he trades he is badly hurt, buffing the dmg of his hyper armoured heavies buffed would skew the trade into his favor. * Chained top heavy can be soft feinted into another pommel strike, said pommel strike leads into light finisher. Chained pressure for a hero that lacks this kind of option is always welcomed. * Top unblockable heavy cost 25 stam but doesnt cost extra stam when parried. This simple buff promotes letting that attack rip, worth noting that a high stam cost prevent it from being overly ""spammable"" as it cant be performed over and over without risking becoming OOS. # Orochi: Orochi is suppossed to be a duel specialist and in 4v4 he should perform similar role as pk, he should punish people that press buttons, provides cover for teammates and chips enemies down safely, but unlucky for him he can't perform any of these roles well. He can't deal dmg reliably, his moves cost too much stam and deals low dmg for a low hp hero and is easily outclassed as a teamfighter, lets change this. * Storm rush has a fixated stam cost of 28 (doesn't cost more when parried nor blocked), both sides of storm rush has the same speed (400 ms?, the faster option) while top has a speed of 500 ms, top is still undodgeable, 17 dmg all sides. This ""fixes"" his problem of the lack of opener, giving him 2 unreactable options and 1 that punishes dodges. The high stam cost is to prevent being overly spammable, given that orochi can use this move to shorten his back dodge recovery or use to maintain distance, if it has a low stam cost he can use it recklessly without worring about going OOS. * Chained lights deals 15 dmg from 12, confirmed light from neutral top light not affected by this. Low dmg on a 120 hp is a no no, lack of dmg is one of the reasons orochi is not viable. * Heavy finishers deals 40 dmg and are undodgeable. This change is for 3 things, first at 40 dmg would improve the risk/reward ratio for when a light parry attempt is baited, punishing said attempt very heavily, the undodgeable part is to negate the hability to back dodge his chained lights safely every time. The third reason is teamfights, at 40 dmg with 40% chip he can chip down enemies with his heavy finisher allowing him to actually press buttons and be useful. * Dash lights (every form) are enhanced. This guys is risking a light parry every time he performs one of those, if the enemy doesn't parry the roach should not have his momentum stopped. * Light finishers are enhanced. Allows the roach to keep his momentum going, more pressing of buttons the better. # Shugoki: Shugoki is not viable because of 2 simple things, you can roll away safely from him on indicator and he can't punish bashes reliably, fixing this 2 issues would improve him massively. * New move, foward dash top heavy, deals 25 dmg, 600 ms with HA, excellent tracking, acts as a chain starter, uses running attack animation. This would allow him to catch rolls on reaction, a tool to deal agaisnt his most prominent weakness, with HA should help him getting into teamfights and into his finisher heavies realiably without using half his stam for a zone attack. * Neutral lights deals 18 dmg but no longer has HA. HA on neutral lights is aids, doesn't promote enemy offense at all unless you have a bash, you're encouraged to wait his light but you're not encouraged to attack him, buffing the dmg to 18 from 15 dmg is a fair trade off in my opinion. * Hug general recovery (dodge, block and gb) lowered to 800 ms. You can no longer have a guaranteed attacks after dodge roll away from this mix up, if you want to punish it you stand your ground and make a read for the hug. # Nobushi: I dont know her neither i understand much her desing to propose ideas, one thing is certain, give her old recovery cancels back, adding confirmed kick on hidden stance heavy could be nice too. # Shinobi: Complete rework, he needs a total rework not some buff. # Aramusha: Ara is weird, a pain in the ass to deal with if you dont have bash based offense, doesnt have a good way to enter his in chain preassure but also is very good defensively and against ganks, in 4v4 he is very good as he punish heavily ganks that need a GB, farms minions very fast, can teamfight and punish people that press buttons very heavily and while he doesn't have a good gank he as a gank partner deals an stupid amount of dmg. What ara needs is a reliably mix up besides deadly feints and an easier way to enter his offense * Side neutral and chained lights are enhanced. * Side neutral heavies deal 35 dmg. * Side neutral heavies have 400 ms gb vulnerability. Improving his neutral lights would allow him to enter his chains easily, trying to parry his neutral lights is exposing oneself to be punished for those heavies, also neutral heavy attacks that deal 40 dmg and are 700ms is stupid, at 35 dmg is still reasonable high but not stupid high. Neutral heavy attacks that are invulnerable to feints is aids, it makes non bash based offense against musha totally useless, with the existence of zone option selects and his foward dash option select he should still be a strong defensive hero. * Deadly feints deal 17 dmg, all directions. A 400 ms light that comes from a soft feint that deals 20 dmg is too much, while the top deadly feints deals only 15 dmg, because this act as his main way to deal dmg nerfing the side version to a reasonable 17 dmg is fair, specially since it requires a set up to access it. * His guard doesn't drop when he foward dashes. * Side heavy from foward dash removed, that attacks are changed to a side dodge heavy input, can be inputed 300 ms into the dodge, unfeintables. Now he can dodge foward safely without eating attacks and also has a dodge attack that would allow him to punish bashes this is as a form of compensation for the removal of gb inmune heavies. * Can dodge recovery cancel his heavy recoveries. He used to have a dodge recovery of 500 ms, now that elusiveness is gone so a way to give some of it back, he can dodge cancel his neutral and chained heavy recoveries * Heavy finisher recoveries down to 700 ms. This would make safer his finishers to not be gb vulnerable on dodge but only be vulnerable to dodge attacks. * Heavy finisher heavies deal 40 dmg, all directions. Buffing his recoveries has to come at the expense of 5 dmg for his side heavy finishers, now his top and side heavy finisher deal 40 dmg * Can perform a zone mid chain to perform a heavy unblockable finisher, deals 45 dmg, it can be soft feinted into his deadly feint, cost 25 stam and doesnt get a stam penalty upon being parried, dodge, block and gb recovery on miss is 700 ms. Extra pressure in exchange for half his stam, it was a little dumb how he has 2 unblockables, one only accessable from a blades blockade and the other from his zone, now he has another attack to open up enemies. * Unblockable part of his zone can be soft feinted into a deadly feint. allows for extra preassure at the expense of half your stam. * Ring the bell acts as a chain starter, no dmg reduction for the enemy for the total animation. This would maximize the use of the stun. * Twin vipers (unblockable after a blades blockade) has the animation of the second part of the zone allowing him to dodge incoming attacks, 800 ms, feintable, huge hitbox like a zone attack, still has HA, still is 45 dmg and can still be soft feinted into a deadly feint. This would allow him to blades blockade during teamfights/ganks and retaliate with a huge dmg heavy, while dodging and threatening every enemy near him. # Hitokiri: After hito received her nerfs (deserved ones), she has fallen upon viability because she lacks proper hitboxes and can't trade as good in teamfigths as she was able to do in the past, lets improve her. * After every feint her next heavy gains HA at 300 ms. A great problem of her during teamfights is that numerous heroes can shut down her kick mix up thanks to a target swapped dodge attack and she can't do anything about it, with this buff she could punish said action at the expense of her hp. * Chained heavies gain HA at 300 ms. This would allow her to go ham during teamfights trading while getting the best of her infinite chain. * Fully charged heavies deal 45 dmg, improved hitboxes, throws recovery can be cancelled with a heavy. Fully charged heavies dealing only 40 dmg was not worth for how much it takes to charge, being at 45 dmg would improve the risk reward, the recovery cancel on throws would allow her to land fully charged heavies on wallsplat consistently. * Zone attack recovery changed to 600 ms. Her zone is one of the few moves that have a decent hitbox, having such an atrocious recovery on this move prevent her from antiganking more consistently as a failed zone would guaranteed a gb for the enemy."
76,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Is Shinobi unredeemable? (can he be fixed only through number changes ?),1,f4gi67,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/f4gi67/is_shinobi_unredeemable_can_he_be_fixed_only/,2020-02-16 08:59:43,"Well, let's find out. The short answer is... really not. So let's look at his kit and see what can be saved, what can be fixed and what is unredeemable. So before you read this wall of text. The TLDR version is: ""Shinobi cannot be fixed, his fundamentally flawed and needs a total redesign, not a rework but a redesign"" **Shadow Danced** * Besides being over-tuned as frick, 24 damage on two lights this is acceptable. His lights could be speed up to 466 to make them more viable but besides that there's nothing wrong with them, besides the obvious damage nerf. I'd say make his initial attack deal 15 damage and his second, guaranteed attack deal 4. The first hit would cost 6 stamina and the second would cost only 2. * His different guard chained light could do between 16-18 damage to give him more of an incentive to use his chains rather than his guaranteed attack. I would also make his chained lights 433 to make them less dangerous to use since most of the times they just get parried. **Ghoul's Rage** * This move is beyond over-tuned as it stands. It deals 30 damage plus 10 guaranteed more damage making it 40 damage. This time I would make the initial heavy deal 31 damage and the second guaranteed light would deal only 4 more damage. This would make his light parry punish or GB punish 35 which is high but not that ridiculous. 31 damage instead of 30 is neglectable at the moment. IF damage is going to be nerfed all around then even these numbers are kind of high. * His second non guaranteed light should be 16-18 and all that jazz. **Heavy into Sickle Rain** * How could this chain not be both useless and viable at the same time? The initial heavy is not the problem but the second heavy? If it lands it deals 41 direct and 12 bleed damage. This is insane considering it pins the opponent as well as dealing 33 stamina damage. To make it more bearable I'd say we should do one of the following: 1. Make the top heavy unblockable, deal 5 direct damage and 1+8 bleed damage for three hits. It would deal 37 damage, it would pin the opponent allowing one of you allies get a heavy and it would make you choose between throwing the top for CC or throwing the side for more damage. The side heavy would deal 35 direct damage. 2. Make the sides unblockable and deal 35 damage while the top keeps dealing only 5 direct and (1+8)\*3 damage but is blockable. This would make his heavies more threatening and it would require more set-up to get his sickle rain. For example, you could whiff a heavy into sickle rain while shaman does her bite or Raider knees an opponent but that would make those ganks even more ridiculous, although he can already do that with a little bit of coordination and it deals 53 damage at the moment. **Tackle** * Keep it the way it is, not much to say about it. Since it's nerfs it it bearable. **Super Sprint-** Denied * Make his running speed the same as PK or Shaman and remove Super Sprint. You could say it is useful to rotate but those other characters do just as good without Naruto running. **Spider Silk** * Do range attacks have a place in the game? No. How would one even balance these? In a 1v1 these are useless, in a 4v4 you can just externally block them. If we make them more viable in a 1v1 what would stop shinobi from running away and hitting from a distance? Every time he uses them he falls on the ground. This is a huge mess. So, for the good of the republic, I'd say we remove them, the charged heavies and ranged GBs. It is his ""identity"" but so is killing people cancer's identity. It just has no place. It requires something to balance out his lost in ganking potential but as they are now they are either useless or oppressive as hell. Possible changes but I don't know how balance these would be. 1. Make his ranged heavies undodgeable to punish dodges in ganks. Have them deal 15 damage and not unbalance the shinobi but drag him right in front of the opponent for a light punish. If someone hits the shinobi while he's dragged towards his target he breaks out of the animation. Make the first heavy to be 500ms, and the second 500ms as well? I don't even know how one would balance all of this, the attacks are either useless or too strong. 2. Make his ranged GB a bash that guarantees the ranged heavy finisher. 18 damage perhaps? 3. Yeah, I'm aware this would make his whole ranged attacks a 50/50 between a bash and an undodgeable. This would make him strong but I'm also afraid this would be way too strong for a ranged mix-up. Perhaps his range should be chopped to 1/4 to make up for the 50/50? **Double Dodge-** Denied * Yet again an ability that is unique to shinobi, just as a second head is unique to a dog from Chernobyl. On one hand this ability makes him very hard to catch allowing him to dart all around the battlefield, on the other hand, all dodge attacks, bashes and simple dodges are twice as vulnerable to guard break and twice as telegraphed. I have two ideas on how to change this move to make it a little bit more bearable. 1. Remove it. It is a pointless addition that just makes Shinobi's kit crowded and overbearing while at the same time uniquely risky and safe. If he stands twenty kilometers away he will always be safe, if he is right in front of you he gets GB. Removing it and making all his dodge options like every other hero in the game makes a lot of sense. 2. The second option, which is a little bit more complex is the following. Whenever Shinobi does a dodge heavy, he can soft-feint the heavy into a dodge. The soft feinted dodge instead of moving the shinobi in a direction creates the mist cloud he normally has when he double dodges. This cloud has deflect properties and he can dodge out of it, something like nobushi feinting a heavy into Hidden stance then into a second dodge. This second option would work pretty much like PK's heavy into dodge soft feint only that it has omnidirectional deflect frames. The deflect frames would be the same as with a standard dodge, by that I mean they will be overwritten by the dodge frames. My reasoning behind all this is that Shinobi will use his side dodge into heavy to try to punish an attack, or something along those lines, the opponent will try to parry it and he will soft feint dodge into a second dodge. Since the deflect cloud is overwritten by the dodge frames all three directional attacks would have only 33ms to be deflected making it harder to deflect than the standard double dodge. By all means, this option is here just because this is Shinobi's ""identity"" so I wanted to give him something more unique but by all means, the standard dodge heavy into another dodge would be just as good. Before you tell me this is too much or too strong defensively, well I prefer option nr. 1 too. **Kick-** * Just make the side ones work like Conq's. Hell, to make it even better, make the dodge heavy deal 20 damage and become undodgeable and you'll have one hell of a 50/50. I should say a 33/33/33 since there's also the dodge light but that's pretty much useless. Right, how wouldn't that be OP as heck. If we tune his kit to actually be good he would have a working bash attack as well as a useful dodge heavy. That would be a 50/50 out of a side dodge, in my opinion that would be a little too strong. That's his problem. All characters in the game either have a dodge bash or a dodge attack, he has both on the side dodges. ( I know someone like Warlord has a forward dodge and a headbutt, or warden with his Valiant breakthrough and shoulder etc.) If we buff or correct one part of his kit the other one becomes useless, if we buff both, well good luck, you've just got a 50/50 out of a dodge. * With the forward dodge. I might sound really stupid, but I don't think we need shinobi to become the new Conqueror. We already have a whole lot of characters with forward and side dodge bashes, but no character with only dodge bashes. Entertain my idea and let's not give him a forward bash as well, although it would help him. Hell, we could make his forward bash the one that's similar to Conq's and keep his side bashes as an utility tool like Glad's. Again, buff one part we make the other useless, buff both and we have Conq on steroids. * All bashes guarantee only a light, making them actually usable and giving them 25 damage would be over-tuned as heck. * Third option, his forward dodge goes into his chain finishers, as in a multidirectional 433 ms light, the Top unblockable or the side heavies. I like this option a lot, his front dodge would be the one used for chase or a quick way to access his unblockable, the sides would be used to bash. Again, why would you ever not go for the bash is beyond me. **Roll-** usable??? * If we make the forward roll accessible after any whiffed or landed heavy attack... Well, we would have BP's 50/50 now. Every heavy attack would either be a 433 light, a heavy, and unblockable heavy or a bash. If, and only If we just consider this rework he would have 3 50/50. Would it be strong? hell yes, would it be oppressive? as much as a communist dictator after he is democratically elected. How do we even correct this character without over tuning him or keeping him useless? Anyhow, for the sake of the argument, after every heavy he gets a 50/50, and I'll include his dodge heavies as well just to overkill it. He does a dodge? Get 50/50-ed. You fail the 50/50? Get 50/50-ed again. He is broken on a fundamental level. **Backflip-** ehhh... * Give it dodge frames, proper ones and make it vulnerable to GB. The animation would be weird as frick. Easy fix, add a smoke in front of Shinobi when he does the flip so that the GB vulnerability frames do not catch him mid air to require new animations. Yes, this would be useless in front of the enemy but that's the idea. Siffu is dangerous, Hidden stance is dangerous, every dodge recovery is dangerous so this one should be as well. If he dodges without getting GBed he can go directly into a proper dodge, not a back dodge, just side or front, or into any forward dodge mix-up with added forward movement. Otherwise this is either useless or completely busted. **Deflects** * The initial part of the deflect deals 10 damage but it remains automatic. (You could change it but whatever) 1. The light deflect does 24 damage, 10 direct and 14 bleed (2+2)+(2+3)+(2+3) over three seconds. (Standard deflect damage, slightly lower because it is hyper armour safe) 2. The kick after a deflect now wallspalts leading into guaranteed top heavy finisher. ( Deals 42 damage, above average but only with a wall behind you, or it ledges) **Shadow Strike** * Deals 25 damage, 10 direct and 15 bleed, 5 ticks every second for three seconds. He had a 29 damage heavy parry punish, I nerfed it. Can be recovery canceled with a dodge. &amp;#x200B; **What did we learnt from this useless wall of text? Shinobi is broken on a fundamental level and unless the devs decide to give him a whole, from the very base rework we could get a 50/50 monster with 3 or 4 different 50/50 or an even weaker shinobi where all his kit is as useful as his current Kick.**"
77,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A Rework for Everyone's Favorite Cocky Chinese Bastard,1,f4z8x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/f4z8x2/a_rework_for_everyones_favorite_cocky_chinese/,2020-02-17 10:26:15,"**Tiandi** is not doing so hot right now. His recent changes, while appreciated, don't affect the character too much. He still lacks proper mixups and an opener, in addition to the problems listed below. This rework serves to make Tiandi a viable character for all levels of play while keeping his identity of a dodge specialist. This rework also assumes that the following change will be applied to **all characters**: -When dodging to the side or back, all characters lose their guard (characters that have superior block on side dodges still have it for 100ms-200ms into the dodge, but after that they don't retain their guard). When dodging forward, all characters have their guard shifted to the top. In addition, reflex guard is removed. **Problems:** -Poor Stamina -Garbage Dodge attacks -No pressure besides 400ms lights -Real bad hitboxes **Overall:** -Stamina increased to 140 (from 120) -Can dodge cancel all non-kick recoveries (could only cancel opener recoveries) **Heavies:** -Side heavy hitboxes have a larger arc, making it easier for Tiandi to hit opponents the side of him/her **Lights:** -Side light hitboxes have a larger arc, making it easier for Tiandi to hit opponents the side of him/her **Zone:** -Second strike is undodgable, can execute, and deals 30 damage (from 25) **Tiger Dodge** -Damage increased to 15 (from 12) -Can be inputted from all sides between 66ms-400ms (from 100-300 sides and 100-400 top) -Crushing counter frames are between 33ms-133ms (from 100-200) -Side tiger dodges have increased forward momentum -When tiger dodges are inputted from a recovery's cancel dodge, or soft feinted via dodge from another attack, they become enhanced tiger dodges -Enhanced tiger dodges are enhanced. Who would've guessed **Dragon Dodge:** -side are 1000ms (from 1100) -Side have iframes up to 266ms before the strike (from 500ms) -Side damage increased to 30 (from 25) -Side now has 400ms gb vulnerability (from 600) -Top damage increased to 28 (from 20) -Top gains HA at 300ms (from 500ms) -When dragon dodges are inputted from a recovery cancel dodge, or are soft feinted from another attack, they become enhanced dragon dodges. -Enhanced Side dragon dodges are 900ms and have zone attack properties (aren't affected by superior block, and no stamina multipliers are applied when the attack is blocked, parried, wiffed, etc.) -Enhanced top dragon Dodge is 600ms, gains HA at 100ms, and is undodgable. **Palm Strike:** -500ms when chained or inputted 100ms-200ms after a feint -Wiffed recovery reduced to 700ms (from idk its not on the info hub but it could be gbd if you didn't chain) **Dragon Kick:** -Costs 15 stamina (from 20) -Costs 10 stamina when soft feinted from Zone -Guarantees a forward dodge heavy for 25 damage -Costs no stamina to soft feint with a Dodge -Can be inputted after any heavy (from only opener heavies). Additionally, can be inputted after a heavy wiffs -When the opponent is knocked down, they have damage reduction -has 700ms recovery when wiffed (from whatever it was before it's not in the info hub) **Sprint Attack:** -700ms (from 800) **Ok that's it.** These changes will turn Tiandi from a mediocre character to a competitively viable one. I will try to answer all questions, so feel free to leave one (remember: no question is a stupid question). If I was wrong about something, or you disagree, make sure to downvote me, leave a hate comment, and downvote/report raid my account to make sure my small mistake doesn't go unpunished. **TL;DR:** -Kick mixup works -Better hitboxes, as well as better dodge attacks -Can cancel all recoveries with dodges -Has an opener, and much better stamina"
78,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Can we please all agree that heavies with 100ms guardbreak vulnerability have no place in this game?,1,f5by4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/f5by4u/can_we_please_all_agree_that_heavies_with_100ms/,2020-02-18 04:14:17,"They literally break one of the major rules of for honor's fighting system: feint into gb. They are way too safe, especially when put on a hero with 140hp. It's just a turtle tool, nothing that the game needs. We need defense to be risky in this game, otherwise what's the point of attacking at all?"
79,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,What would be so wrong with letting musha deadly feint opener heavies ?,1,f5gyof,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/f5gyof/what_would_be_so_wrong_with_letting_musha_deadly/,2020-02-18 09:27:13,"Every time I have seen a musha rework this is never suggested I have yet to see how this would make him anymore busted than Zerk for example So to finish Ill say he only needs 5 things to become a good Hero 1. Deadly feint on neutral heavies 2. Heavy damage reduction . THO: 25, THF: 30, SHO: 30, SHF: 35 3. Side Heavies no longer have 100ms GB vulnerability 4. Side finishers are UB, top is UD 5. Rushing wind has I frames similar to nobushi , so the attack cancels I frames early.however since it can be feinted its more safe Do tell me whats wrong with these suggestions"
80,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"The Samurai Really Need Some Love, So Here Are Some Rework For Them",2,f8f9y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/f8f9y5/the_samurai_really_need_some_love_so_here_are/,2020-02-24 07:26:37,"The Samurai in For Honor are really struggling. And I do mean *struggling.* If you don't catch what I'm putting out, then let me just throw out some numbers(from the info hub about duels): The Knights: Four characters are considered strong, two characters are considered OK, and one is considered weak The Vikings: Three characters are considered strong, two characters are considered OK, and two are considered weak The Samurai: One character is considered strong, three are considered OK, and *three* are considered weak *Skipping over Wu-lin, btw, since they've got less characters and aren't part of the base game.* So... yeah. Clearly one faction is a helluva lot weaker than the others. Hitokiri's the only one considered viable, despite being somewhat flawed in a few areas(lack of chainability, strange bash punishes). Meanwhile, two others would be considered viable, Kensei and Shugoki, but a few qualities make them easily bypassable(Kensei's opener is locked behind a slow heavy, and Shugo's heavy/hug mix-up can be backwalked to avoid chargeable heavies and dodge the high-recovery roll). Meanwhile, four heroes are so inherently poor in design that they would require a lot of changes to become offensively viable(especially Shinobi... just... what the hell?). So here I am, ready to offer several changes, rebalancings and reworks for all of these characters. Starting from left to right, top to bottom, we get to... # Kensei **Top heavy** * The soft-feint windows(for the sf lights and heavies) for the opener top heavy are adjusted to 300-600ms from 600ms * The soft-feint windows(for the sf lights and heavies) for the chain top heavy are adjusted to 300-600ms from 600ms * The soft-feint windows(for the sf lights and heavies) for the finisher top heavy are adjusted to 300-800ms from 800ms *The Raider treatment. Many people would prefer to speed up the heavies, but I know there's a different way... and also I want actual variety for characters.* *Anyways, these changes solve the problems where Kensei's main strength, his top heavies and all their soft-feints, are bypassed by lighting them out of them. This, of course, only applies to the soft-feint lights and heavies, for obvious reasons.* &amp;#x200B; **Nature's Wrath** * Damage is increased to 30 from 20 * Range is buffed by .5 meters *The second thing is Kensei's forward dodge heavy is underwhelming. Most other people would want to speed it up and/or make it feintable, but I'd just say give it the Warlord treatment and buff the damage, making it more worth it(since a 800ms dodge heavy that deals 20 damage is pathetic), and making it more punishing when someone dodge rolls.* &amp;#x200B; # Orochi [URL **Light Combo** * Top light combo from neutral is reverted to being 500ms and dealing 15 + 7 damage(from 466ms and 12 + 6) *The change to Orochi's light combo were more detrimental than helpful. Sure, the zone plus the neutral top light created a slight mix-up, but it's pathetic compared to other heroes and their mix-ups. The changes are reverted, especially the damage.* &amp;#x200B; **Chains** * Chain light damage is buffed to 13 from 12 * Finisher light speeds are flipped, with the top light being 466ms(used to be 400ms) and the side lights being 400ms(used to be 466ms) * Finisher light damage values are also flipped, with the top light dealing 17 damage(used to deal 15) and the side lights dealing 15(used to deal 17) * After a finisher attack, Orochi can initiate his ""Path of the Typhoon"" Mix-up *Out of all the miscellaneous changes in this list, Orochi should benefit. His finisher lights will have some actual mix-up potential.* *The ""Path of the Typhoon"" Mix-up will be explained down below.* &amp;#x200B; **Storm Rush** * Left Storm Rush is sped up to 300ms from 400ms(now same as right SR) * Storm Rush entrance stamina cost lowered to 12 from 17 * Storm Rush feint cost lowered to 15 from 20 * Storm Rush release cost is now 15, and it will cost 15 on block, whiff, or parry(like how a zone works) * Top Storm Rush damage is increased to 22 from 17 * Storm Rush hit stun is increased to medium hitstun from light hitstun *There are several issues with Storm Rush, including its ease of blocking, its unbelievably high stamina cost, and it's hitstun. Now it acts as a proper opener with reasonable stamina costs, and the hitstun no longer allows enemies to easily dodge Orochi's follow-ups after Storm Rush.* &amp;#x200B; **Riptide Strike** * Dodge input increased to 200-400ms from 300ms * GB vulnerability is lowered to 100ms from 400ms *Riptide Strike has always had an issue of being oddly easy to GB. Now, with the dodge input changes and vulnerability changes, it should work properly.* &amp;#x200B; **Zone** * Zone stamina cost lowered to 50 from 60 * Zone recovery can be dodge-canceled * After a Zone, Orochi can initiate his ""Path of the Typhoon"" Mix-up *General buffs to Orochi's zone, making it more usable in anti-ganks.* *""Path of the Typhoon"" mix-up will now be explained.* &amp;#x200B; **\[NEW MECHANIC\] Path of the Typhoon** *After a finisher light, finisher heavy, or zone, Orochi uses his momentum to charge his dodge attacks with more power, allowing him to use them more in battle.* * If used from a finisher attack or zone, forward dodge light is sped up to 466ms from 566ms, and is enhanced * If used from a finisher attack or zone, the side dodge lights are sped up to 500ms from 600ms, and are enhanced * If used from a finisher attack or zone, forward dodge light is sped up to 500ms from 600ms, and is enhanced * \[IDEA\] Orochi can access the Path of the Typhoon by simply feinting his heavies *This alone would make his dodge cancels a lot more useful, but this is only a complement to his real power.* &amp;#x200B; **\[NEW MOVE\] Maelstrom Knee** *After throwing out an attack, Orochi sends his knee into the enemy's gut, stunning them long enough for a light combo.* Speed: 466ms Type: Bash Input: GB after a finisher light, finisher heavy, or a zone Damage: Stuns enough to guarantee a PotT dodge light(enhanced and 500ms) for 17 damage Properties: low tracking, capable of ledging ***AND...*** &amp;#x200B; **\[NEW MOVE\] Hurricane Blast Alt.** *After throwing out an attack, Orochi turns around and charges his blade to stab at the enemy behind him, just like with regular Hurricane Blast.* Speed: 900ms Type: Non-directional Unblockable, like Warlord's fullblock stab Input: Heavy after a finisher light, finisher heavy, or a zone Damage: 38 direct damage Properties: Incredible side and backward tracking(meant to catch dodgers that dodge Maelstrom Knee), Hard-feintable 400ms before landing, Soft-feintable into a GB or dodge 400ms before landing *These three new moves/mechanics give Orochi everything that he needs, from chain/finisher pressure to dodge capabilities for anti-ganks. Unsurprisingly, this also gives Orochi a mix-up that is actually worth it.* &amp;#x200B; **Hurricane Blast(Deflect)** * The GB and dodge soft-feint window is increased to 300-500ms from 500ms * Hurricane Blast can now break through hyper armor * Hit recovery of Hurricane Blast is lowered to allow the enemy to block the oncoming zone * On a miss, Orochi can still chain into his chain lights and heavies *This deflect move rarely sees use since it's not guaranteed damage, but it's also because it's easier to avoid. Along with that, despite this deflect being slow and high-damaging, it's still beaten by lowly Hyper armor. Both of these issues should be solved.* &amp;#x200B; **Maelstrom Knee(Deflect)** * This version of Maelstrom Knee is instant and guaranteed against a deflected enemy, and still guarantees 22 damage(from the top light combo) *A quick solution for HA, most deserving for a hero that supposedly specializes in deflects.* &amp;#x200B; # Shinobi [URL **Heavies &amp; Lights** * The damage of the guaranteed light from an opener light or heavy is reduced to 8 damage(from 10) * Shinobi now has an LH chain * The chain heavy now deals 25 damage and is undodgeable(from 35 damage) * The Sickle Rain damage is reduced to 15 damage, with each strike dealing 1 + 4 bleed damage(from 18 overall, 2 + 4 bleed each strike) * Shadow Strike(parry light) damage is lowered to 14 + 8 bleed(14 + 15 bleed) * Side chain lights are now 400ms(from 500ms) * Top chain light is now enhanced and deals 17 damage(from 14 damage) *The damage nerfs are obvious: high punishes promotes turtling. This is fixed.* *And the chain buffs should prove to at least help Shinobi when it comes to his mid-chains.* &amp;#x200B; **Dodges** * Shinobi can now triple dodge * The ""Double Dodge"" stamina cost is lowered to 14 from 24 *This is a change that works extremely well with the other additions and changes later in the post, but it will make Shinobi a far more mobile and dodge focused character without having to rely on quad-dodges(which will be worked out in the later changes).* &amp;#x200B; **Ranged Heavies** * \[MOST IMPORTANT\] Ranged heavies can no longer be charged; instead, they are now accessed after a side or forward dodge, replacing the ""soft-feint"" into a slightly faster heavy * The input window is 200-500ms for side dodges, and 100-500ms for forward dodges; the ranged heavy direction depends on the dodge direction * **All ranged heavies are now** **enhanced** * **Ranged heavies, once parried, no longer knock down Shinobi**; instead, the enemy drags Shinobi to them and then get a heavy parry punish * Side opener ranged heavies now deal 20 damage and are 600ms(from 25 damage and 600-800ms depending on range) * Top opener ranged heavy now deals 25 damage and is 700ms(from 600-800ms depending on range) * Top opener ranged heavy is feintable * All opener ranged heavies have the lowest range(the range when Shinobi starts charging) * Chain ranged heavies can now be chained infinitely * Chain ranged heavies are all 700ms and deal 25 damage(from 800ms); these are feintable * Chain ranged heavies all have the maximum range(when Shinobi fully charges their ranged heavies) *Obviously, a chargeable and safe way to enter into a stance that accesses ranged attacks that can be sent off-screen are pretty nonsensical. Even the supposed ""downside"" to these ranged heavies(the interruptible on block and the knockdown on parry) did nothing to lower their ganking potential, and only served to kill their offensive potential. Now both of these problems should be solved, and Shinobi can even use these to possibly anti-gank.* *Also... yes, I stole the ""infinite chain of ranged heavies"" idea from* [u/PrinceofWrath](URL It's a good idea, after all.\* &amp;#x200B; **Dodge Kicks** * On the second and third dodges, the input window is 200-500ms(from 400ms) *Edit: Used to be 300-500ms, but was adjusted thanks to the worries of* [u/S13200SX](URL * Side dodge kicks on the second dodge is sped up to 500ms(from 600ms) * Dodge Kicks(forward and side) on the third dodge are all 400ms * All dodge kicks deal 28 stamina damage and guarantee a side opener ranged heavy for 20 damage(from 47 stamina damage and 25 damage) * All ***side*** dodge kicks now have I-frames(like Kensei's and Orochi's side dodge attacks); * If a dodge direction is not specified for a double or triple dodge, then the Shinobi will dodge in the direction of the last dodge(basically, no more smokeless kick) *Edit: Nearly forgot about the smokeless kick, props to* [u/S13200SX](URL *Better input windows, faster speeds, multiple options with double and triple dodges, better I-frames: Shinobi's dodge kicks now give him a significant amount of offensive potential without making it too safe.* &amp;#x200B; **Back Flip** * Backflip distance is increased to the minimum range of a ranged heavy * Backflip now has 300ms of GB vulnerability * Backflip now has more sufficient I-frames *Backflip failed to really dodge much of anything due to the lack of distance and the underwhelming I-frames.* *Now(in the sense of an evasion tool) it can be used as a dodge tool. In the sense of a mix-up tool(after dodge kicks and flip kicks) it can be used to beat out dodgeable attacks but not a GB, while the ranged heavy beats out the GB option.* &amp;#x200B; **Ranged GB** * Ranged GB can now only be accessed after a backflip(no longer from neutral or after a dodge kick/flip kick) * Ranged GB is now sped up to 500ms(from 600ms) * \[NEW\]Ranged GB is always set to the lowest range(about as far as uncharged ranged heavies) *A ranged GB from neutral that can guarantee so much damage is a clear problem. Just like the ranged heavies, it has no offensive capabilities, and is only useful as a ganking tool. Now, especially with the backflip changes, this should see some use as a non-cancerous tool.* &amp;#x200B; **Deflect** * The teleport now requires either a light or GB input to be initiated; the light leads to the teleport then the bleed stab, and the GB leads to the teleport then the kick * The teleport of the deflect now only costs 10 stamina and has I-frames throughout the whole animation * The kick no longer guarantees a ranged heavy where someone wasn't blocking; the stamina damage of the kick is increased to 50 from 30; the kick can now wall splat *Finally, Shinobi's deflect now comes in-line with all the other deflects, requiring an input instead of being automatic. The teleport of the deflect now actually evades stuff(instead of acting like a magnet), and the kick doesn't guarantee such outrageous damage... at least not in every case.* &amp;#x200B; **Zone** * The stamina cost of the zone strikes is now set to 30 + 15 + 15(from 17 + 17 + 21) * The damage of the first two strikes is now set at 14 + 8(from 10 + 5) * The third strike is now replaced with the Shadow Strike(now it deals 14 + 8 bleed) *Surprisingly, Shinobi's zone is very underwhelming when it comes to damage, especially when compared to other characters' zones like Shaman's and Berzerker's. It's now more in-line, along with a more powerful yet more familiar change to the third strike.* &amp;#x200B; **Front Flip** * Front Flip now has 300ms of GB vulnerability * Front Flip Kick is now 400ms(from 300ms) * Front Flip Kick now guarantees a side opener ranged heavy * Front Flip Kick can now wallsplat, guaranteeing a top opener ranged heavy *The kick of the front flip really served no purpose other than to drain stamina. Now it operates as a strong mix-up, especially with the undodgeable chain heavies and 400ms finisher side lights.* &amp;#x200B; **Yama Uba** * Yama Uba now heals for 30% of the damage that Shinobi deals(from 20%) *Shinobi's Yama Uba used to be excessively strong, but after the nerfs it was dangerously underwhelming. After all of these damage and defensive nerfs, Yama Uba should be reasonably balanced if made a little stronger.* &amp;#x200B; # Hitokiri [URL **Heavies** * Hyper armor on neutral heavies is buffed to activate after 400ms from 500ms * Chain heavies now have HA after 400ms *Hito's neutral heavies were far stronger than her chain heavies in speed and HA, and they still are. This is clearly a bad design choice, especially in a fighting game. With these changes, there will be a better incentive to use the chain heavies.* &amp;#x200B; **Charged Heavies** * Fully charged neutral heavies are sped up to 1400ms from 1500ms * Fully charged chain heavies are sped up to 1300ms from 1400ms * All charged heavies have their damage reduced to 38 from 40 * All charged heavies, if whiffed, can be chained into a finisher light as a recovery cancel *Hitokiri's charged heavies, if you compare them to Shugoki's charged heavies, are a lot weaker when comparing damage and hitboxes. So, in an attempt to make them different, but still comparably powerful, they will be slightly faster, weaker in damage, but are capable of recovery cancels.* &amp;#x200B; **New Move: Executioner's Arc** *While side dodging, Hito swings her ax in a wide yet short arc.* Speed: 600ms Damage: 25 Input: side dodge + heavy Input window: 100-400ms Properties: Can chain *Hitokiri, like all the other Y3 heroes, doesn't have a side dodge attack. But unlike Black Prior(who has a full-block that can counter almost everything) or Jorg(who has a neutral bash that can act as the poor man's dodge bash), Hitokiri really has no way to punish bashes. With this, Hito will have a way to punish from a side dodge and, with the Mugen-Ryu changes, they will be given an offensive purpose.* &amp;#x200B; **Chains** * Hitokiri can chain after a zone, a running attack, and any dodge heavy *This design choice is what makes Hitokiri feel like a prototype: half of her moves don't chain. This golden standard of chain ability was lost on Hito. This fixes that.* &amp;#x200B; **Forward Dodge Heavy** * Hito's forward dodge heavy now has HA starting 300ms into the attack *Considering that Hito's HA was switched around for her feintable heavies, and her dodge heavy is slow and unfeintable, it is only fair that it must be capable of trading.* &amp;#x200B; **Mugen-Ryu** * When entering Mugen-Ryu, Hito can dodge in-between heavies to access his dodge attacks * When using the forward dodge heavy in between attacks, it has significantly increased range * When using the side dodge heavy in between attacks, it has a much wider hitbox * When using the zone in between attacks, it has a hitbox that hits in a 360-degree radius and a lower stamina cost of 25 *With all of these new options during her chains, Hito has many more options to use against enemies. She can deal with ganks thanks to her side dodge heavies(for a move with less coverage but more damage) or her zone(more coverage, less damage), and she can use her forward dodge heavy for faster HA and for catching rollers. It would also count as more mix-ups for the ""mix-up specialist"".* &amp;#x200B; **Kick &amp; Sweep** * Kick still guarantees a heavy, but it chains into a neutral heavy for 28 damage * Sweep now guarantees a heavy as well(for 28 damage), or it can lead into a fully charged heavy for 38 damage(more damage, but no chainability) * Sweep recovery adjusted to make the guaranteed punish safe from GB *With this, Hitokiri can find use in using her Sweep, and the kick is less rewarding(now requiring five hits as opposed to four on 120 HP heroes).* &amp;#x200B; # Shugoki [URL **Neutral Heavies** * Forward movement for charging neutral heavies is increased by a 2.5-4 meters(like w/ Ara's finisher heavies) * Neutral heavies can now target-switch while charging, just like with Shugo's chain heavies *The first one is obvious: with the range buff, it would be impossible to simply walk backwards to avoid some of the timings of the heavies, and some of the mix-ups in the process.* *The third change is a simple QoL change: if Hito can do it with his neutral heavies, why can't Shugo?* &amp;#x200B; **Headbutt** * Sped up to 500ms from 600ms * Stun is increased to 1500ms from 500ms *Now headbutt can land easier, and the stun actually makes Shugo's charged follow-ups more dangerous.* &amp;#x200B; **Zone** * Zone stamina cost is lowered to 55 from 60 *Why not?* &amp;#x200B; **Demon's Embrace** * Whiff recovery is lowered to 900ms from 2000ms *Being able to roll and still have enough time to get in a punish is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.* &amp;#x200B; **""Throw Farther"" now Replaced with ""Death's Hug""** * Death's Hug allows for Demon's Embrace to heal Shugoki for all his health(plus a 25 health shield) if Demon's Embrace kills an opponent *For those that miss the extra health that came from a critical HP demon's embrace from before the rework, here's something for you.* &amp;#x200B; **Charge of the Oni** * Base stamina cost of Charge of the Oni is increased to 20 from 6 * The max charge time is increased to 4000ms from 2000ms * Stamina cost is reworked so that each 800ms of the charge costs 20 stamina(this means that the max stamina cost from Charge of the Oni is 100, from 71) * Since max charge time is doubled, so is the max distance doubled * Charge of the Oni can be soft-feinted into a running heavy *Charge of the Oni is effectively the only way Shugoki can catch up to other people. While his slow speed makes it an issue to catch up to runners, it is true to his character and adds variety. So instead of speeding up Shugoki, I changed his catch-up tool to make catching up and entering fights far easier, especially with the running heavy soft-feint.* &amp;#x200B; # Nobushi *DISCLAIMER: Okay, so I'll be honest, I don't know what to do much when it comes to Nobushi. She's such a complex and strange character that it's hard to fix her issues. But that doesn't mean that I won't try.* **Heavies** * Opener top heavy damage is buffed to 35 from 32 * Chained top heavy damage is buffed to 38 from 35 * Hidden Stance soft-feint window for opener heavies is increased to 200-400ms from 200ms * Chain heavies can now be soft-feinted into Hidden Stance; top chain heavy soft-feint window is 200-400ms, while the side chain heavy soft-feint window is 200-300ms *The Hidden Stance soft-feint on the heavies in the chains are basically useless: it's on one timing and it doesn't capitalize on the dodging capabilities. Along with that, the damage was nerfed by a large margin, making the ""Way of the Shark"" buff a tad less effective; so it was my thought that a buff to the top heavy damage would allow for better capitalization on the bleed aspect of Nobushi.* &amp;#x200B; **New Chain Added: HLL(chain light still functions as a double-hit if it lands)** *More chain and chain possibilities can only help Nobushi.* &amp;#x200B; **Dodge Lights** * All dodge lights are sped up to 500ms from 600ms * Forward dodge window is buffed to 0-600ms from 0-300ms * Side dodge lights now have 100-200ms of I-frames, instead of just being a dodge cancel * Dodge lights can now chain into the finisher heavies *All of these changes should achieve two things: giving the dodge lights a slightly different parry window, giving them more flexibility, and making the dodge lights actual dodge attacks.* &amp;#x200B; **Viper's Retreat** * Viper's Retreat now has I-frames 200ms into the animation * Viper's Retreat is now restricted to only a top light * First 100ms of the indicator are hidden *This was effectively stolen... borrowed... from* u/raiedite*'s post* [right here](URL but it's a rather good idea. And it does complement the general idea of Nobushi being a dodgy character.* &amp;#x200B; **Chian Lights** * If a light is used from the same side as a previous attack, then it becomes 400ms and deals 12 bleed damage plus 4 direct damage *Again, this was ""borrowed"" from* u/raiedite*'s post above, as it is a good idea to catch dodgers who attempt to dodge the kick.* &amp;#x200B; **Hidden Stance** * Hidden Stance stamina cost is lowered to 16 from 24 * All lights are buffed to 10 damage from 8 * Side heavies from HS are 800ms, deal 35 damage, and are undodgeable * Top heavy from HS is 800ms and deals 38 damage * Heavies from HS can chain into the finisher heavies(meaning that HS heavies are considered different versions of the heavies from the chains) * \[MOST IMPORTANT\] Hidden Stance can be used mid-chain to chain further *Hidden Stance used to be Nobushi's bread and butter, giving her most of her power with its defensive capabilities. It was too strong and was nerfed, but without much of an attempt to make it more offensively viable. So with the stamina cost changes and the attack chaining gives the Hidden stance more offensive capabilities and allows for more complex chaining.* &amp;#x200B; **Kick** * Kick(from chain or Hidden Stance) now has the first 100ms of the indicator hidden *This should make the kick more difficult to react to, allowing for slightly better mix-ups.* &amp;#x200B; **Zone** * The second hit of the zone has its damage values changed to 6 direct + 12 bleed from 1 direct + 20 bleed *Surprisingly enough(or unsurprising to some people, if they know the devs), the zone of Nobushi wasn't updated in the context of her ""rework"". This should update the zone to be consistent with the rest of her moveset.* # Aramusha [URL **Zone** * Stamina costs are split to 40 + 20 from 60 + 0 * Feinting the second hit costs an extra 10 stamina(the zone is now like PK's, meaning that the feint cost takes over the second hit cost, making the overall cost 50 stamina on a feint) * The first hit has an increased horizontal hitbox * The second hit is sped up to 900ms from 1000ms * The second hit can be soft-feinted into Deadly Feint lights *Aramusha's zone is his only current ""opener"" and it hardly even opens people up. Not to mention it's costly and has very few options which are usually dealt with by backdodging. This should fix that.The backdodging will be fixed in the next change.* &amp;#x200B; **Dodge Attacks** * Aramusha can now forward dodge into a GB * Aramusha's GB range is buffed slightly * Aramusha's Rushing Wind Top is buffed to 25 damage from 20 * Aramusha's Rushing Wind Side is buffed to 30 damage from 20 * Aramusha's Rushing Wind Side tracking is buffed significantly * Aramusha's Rushing Wind Top tracking is nerfed slightly *This changes three things: one, now Aramusha has a way to catch back dodgers. Two, his top Rushing Wind is now locked as his trading/interrupting dodge heavy. Three, his side Rushing Wind is now his roll catcher and distance-closing tool.* &amp;#x200B; **Aramusha can soft-feint his Twin Vipers, his heavy finishers, and his UB zone attack into a dodge.** *This compliments Aramusha's new dodge GB, and will make it easier for him to catch backdodgers.* &amp;#x200B; **Chains** * Aramusha's side heavies are slown down 800ms from 700ms * Aramusha's side heavies are nerfed to 30 damage from 40 * Aramusha's side heavies now have an extended horizontal hitbox * Aramusha's side heavy stamina costs are lowered to 8 from 12 *Aramusha's side heavies are extremely defensive and deal an insane amount of damage for their speed, and yet they fail to really hit anything but what's in front of the Ara, despite him having two katanas. This fixes that.* * Aramusha's opener top heavy stamina cost is lowered to 8 from 12 *A lower stamina cost for the opener top heavy makes it easier to enter into chains whether being blocked or if you feint a lot.* * Aramusha's top chain light is sped up to 400ms from 500ms * Aramusha's top chain light is nerfed to 12 damage from 16 * Aramusha's top chain light is now enhanced * Aramusha's side chain lights are sped up to 466ms from 500ms *Aramusha's mid-chain issues were well apparent: his chain lights were worthless. His attack pattern caused opponents to simply block top to interrupt the light, which ruined Ara's chain pressure. Now, with faster chain lights and an enhanced top chain light, Ara can have a much easier time keeping up his chain pressure.* &amp;#x200B; **Chain Finishers** * The top chain finisher damage is buffed to 45 from 40 * The side chain finisher damage is nerfed to 40 from 45 * The side chain finisher horizontal hitboxes are buffed significantly *Why the side heavy finishers dealt more damage than the top chain finisher, an attack that can only hit one target, is beyond me. Also the hitbox buff should help Ara in team fights.* * Aramusha now has access to light finishers, which are all 400ms, deal 14 damage, and enhanced; they follow the same rules as the chain finishers, meaning a side light finisher is accessible after a side attack, and a top on is accessible after a top attack. *More mix-up potential while still keeping the same unique attack pattern.* &amp;#x200B; **Deadly Feints** * Top Deadly Feint is nerfed to 14 damage from 15 * Side Deadly Feint is nerfed to 14 damage from 20 * All Deadly Feints now cost 8 stamina instead of 10 *Why was a 400ms soft-feint light dealing 20 damage? I don't know and I don't care. Change that immediately.* &amp;#x200B; **Blade Blockade** * Exit recovery is decreased to 300ms from 500ms *Still makes it punishable, but significantly less so. I will explain why I did not make the exit recovery 100ms later.* * During ~~the active frames or~~ the exit recovery of BB, Aramusha can access watered-down BB attacks * (Non-blocked) Twin Vipers is 900ms, deals 28 damage, and has HA on last 300ms * (Non-blocked) Ring the Bell is 500ms, stuns, deals 15 damage, and deals 20 stamina damage(has 1000ms miss recovery, meaning guaranteed GB on dodge) * (Non-blocked) Fury Unleashed is 700ms, deals 25 damage, and has HA after 200ms(also feintable) * (Non-blocked) Push Back Kick is also 500ms, deals 30 stamina damage, and has slightly less knockback than the blocked version(has 1000ms miss recovery, meaning guaranteed GB on dodge) * After a chain finisher or a UB zone, Aramusha can enter Blade Blockade *Now Aramusha has access to Unblockables and openers which were once locked behind a superior block. He has two bashes(one for immediate damage, and another for if there is a wall nearby), a HA heavy for trading, and an Unblockable to re-enter his chains.* &amp;#x200B; **(Blocked) BB Moves** * Ring the Bell is buffed to 20 damage from 15 * Ring the Bell is buffed to 35 stamina damage from 20 * Push Back Kick stamina cost is lowered to 8 from 25 * Push Back Kick is buffed to 45 stamina damage from 40 * Fury Unleashed is sped up to 300ms from 500ms * Twin Vipers is sped up to 900ms from 1000ms * Twin Vipers horizontal hitbox widened *The moves after Blade Blockade were rather disappointing for moves that are only accessible from a superior block that is hard to land, so they should be buffed to be worth the risk.* *Ring the bell has been rather weak, even with its stamina damage and stun. Now it is more worth the option from a BB. Push Back Kick had an insane stamina cost, which is fixed. Fury Unleashed is hardly guaranteed on anything, so this speed-up should allow it to be guaranteed on everything(or mostly everything). Twin Vipers had a lot of HA and damage, but not enough to justify giving up free damage, so making it faster and giving it a wider hitbox.* &amp;#x200B; ***TL;DR(This is going to take a while):*** **Kensei** * Top heavies now have a variable soft-feint window to counter players trying to light him out of his heavies * Nature's wrath deals more damage and has better range to make the roll-punisher more worth it **Orochi** * Finisher light damage and speed values are switched so that the side lights are 400ms * If used from a dodge cancel, Orochi's dodge lights are 500ms and enhanced(Path of the Typhoon) * Zone has a lower stamina cost and can have its recovery dodge-canceled * Storm Rush has a much lower stamina cost, has both the left and right sides as the same speed, and higher hitstun to make it a more effective opener * Riptide Strike has less GB vulnerability and a bigger dodge input window * Orochi's Maelstrom Knee acts as Orochi's main pressure and bash, with the Hurricane Blast Alt. acting as a different option that gives Orochi a strong Mix-up of unblockables and bashes * Hurricane Blast from deflect breaks through HA and has a wider soft-feint input window for dodges and GBs * Orochi's Maelstrom Knee can also be used from a deflect as a quick option to break through HA **Shinobi** * All guaranteed damage is lowered * LH chain added * Side chain lights are 400ms * Shinobi can now triple dodge * All dodge kicks are 500ms in the second dodge, and are 400ms in the third dodge * Ranged Stance replaced so that ranged heavies are accessible from dodges * Ranged GB is only accessible from a back flip * Ranged heavies are enhanced and can chain into an infinite chain of ranged heavies * Frontflip kick is 400ms, can wallsplat and guarantees a side ranged heavy * Shinobi's deflect does not automatically activate and requires maual input * Zone stamina costs and damage values are adjusted * Yama Uba healing factor is increased to 30% from 20% **Hitokiri** * Both the opener and chained heavies now have HA 400ms into the animation * Hitokiri now has a new side dodge heavy that acts as a dodge cancel, is 600ms, and deals 25 damage * Hitokiri can now chain after her dodge heavies, zone, or running attack * Mugen-ryu allows Hitokiri access to powered versions of some of his neutral attacks, giving him more potential to anti-gank * Her forward dodge attack now has HA after 300ms * Hitokiri's fully charged heavy is now 38 damage, are 100ms faster, and have a finisher light recovery cancel if the charged heavy whiffs * Hitokiri's kick and sweep both confirm a 28 damage heavy, but the Sweep allows a fully charged heavy for 38 damage, but with no chaining afterwards **Shugoki** * Neutral charged heavies have much more range and can target-switch * Headbutt is now 500ms and stuns for 1500ms * Zone stamina cost is slightly lowered to 55 * Demon's Embrace miss recovery is lowered to 900ms from 2000ms * ""Throw Farther"" feat is replaced with a feat that allows for Shugoki to heal more health if Demon's Embrace kills someone * Charge of the Oni can cover more distance, costs more stamina, and can be soft-feinted into a running heavy **Nobushi** * All top heavies deal slightly more damage from their side heavy counterparts * HLL chain added in * Dodge lights are 500ms, have I-frames, and can chain into heavies * Viper's Retreat are restricted to the top guard, but have I-frames 200ms into the animation and have the first 100ms of the animation hidden * If a light is used in the same direction as a previous attack, it's sped up to 400ms to catch dodgers that try to dodge the kick * Hidden Stance costs less stamina, and have different versions of the heavies that make the side heavies from HS undodgeable * First 100ms of the kick's indicator is hidden * The second hit of the zone has its damage values changed to be updated to the rest of the moveset **Aramusha** * Zone stamina cost is adjusted, the second hit is sped up and can be soft-feinted to deadly feints * Aramusha has a forward dodge GB * The forward dodge heavy now deals 25 damage and has slightly more range * The side dodge heavy now deals 30 damage and has much more range * Side opener heavies now deal 30 damage, are 800ms, and have a lower stamina cost * Top opener heavies have a lower stamina cost * Top chain light is 400ms, deals 12 damage and is enhanced * Side chain lights are 466ms * Deadly feints all deal 14 damage and have a slightly lower stamina cost * Blade Blockade exit recovery is lowered to 300ms from 500ms * Blade Blockade can now access the BB attacks without having to block anything, but they are watered down versions * If used from a block of Blade Blockade, Ring the Bell deals more damage and stamina damage * Twin Vipers, if used from a block of Blade Blockade, is sped up to 900ms from 1000ms"
81,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Personal Thoughts On Assassins In Testing Grounds,1,fcfkp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/fcfkp4/personal_thoughts_on_assassins_in_testing_grounds/,2020-03-03 04:31:17,"I say assassins simply because Testing Grounds seemed to universally buff every assassin in the game. Here are my thoughts on them from the experience I have gone through so far. **Peacekeeper** Terrifying to fight against. Quick and believable feints along with decent damage on her attacks putting her just below what her original state was; extremely good. Thankfully, since she is just below that, I see no change other than perhaps making her zone in line with the other changes to 400ms neutral attacks as that seemed to be the only unbearable part about fighting one. Especially when she didn't need to rely on it from my experience of fighting her in the Testing Grounds. **Gladiator** Also terrifying but for every other reason. Good pressure with toe stab and quick lights making him very strong. Not to mention his low GB vulnerability makes him tough to perform feints on and gain an advantage. I am not against his zone having increased damage as well as his skewer, as I believe this heavily makes up for the fact this does not ignore HA much to the community's dismay. This makes gladiator more 4v4 focused that can greatly hold his own in a 1v1 while pk is 1v1 focused that could hold her own in 4v4. A nice little balance between the two. **Berserker** Probably the one I least saw changes from, and that's not a bad thing. Because berserker was so fast in the live game and the indicators were so discrete, I grew to try and see the animations more than anything and so the very few times I was able to react were due to prediction and predictable animation. That's not to say he wasn't strong though. He still maintained a strong sense of offense which can allow him to hold his ground in a variety of situations. **Shaman** Much like pk, unfortunately, shaman was also brought back close to her original state by having her indicators faster as well as her high damage on her soft feint. While I do not necessarily have an issue with this, I do have an issue with it being 30 instead of say 25 since she already gets an extremely large amount of pressure off of the bleed alone. However, I am happy to say this is the only issue I have with shaman, but this still puts her in a strong spot. **Orochi** Not impossible to fight as, or against. His unreactable lights mid chain allow him to very easily get damage but the damage itself didn't feel very high as well as it became difficult to start up his chains once they were stopped. This boils down to two reasons; he is designed to counter attack, and his heavies have little to no pressure. Since he is designed to counter attack and more people are being more offensive in this version, this made counter attackers also have a form of a buff by getting more chances to initiate, but accept a risk should they attempt to do so. While he is a counter attacker, other characters with the same trait often have more than one way of keeping pressure mid chain aside from fast attacks (example being lawbringer shove). I'm happy Orochi can actually fight more, but he still needs something for his heavies to apply any form of pressure for a parry bait. **Shinobi** Ah yes, Shinobi. In my time playing Shinobi, it quickly became apparent that his offense was absolute garbage. For a while, me and some others often fondled the idea of 100ms removal of indicator off of kick would give him a viable offense, as for many people that would push them over the edge of reacting to something that has a full second buildup. Given this, you should imagine my surprise by the testing grounds changes. However, Shinobi, much like Orochi, is a counter attacker. Most of the time, if Shinobi doesn't want to eat a light mid dodge, he must aquire distance between his opponent, or predict that they will go on the offensive that doesn't include a quick feint to GB. Given a change designed to encourage offensive meta, this doesn't sound ideal for Shinobi. However, Ubisoft decided to make up for this by giving him even more damage. It sounds bad on paper, but from my experience, it made things ALMOST even due to the low maneuverability after his quad dash nerf and his previous backflip nerf. I did say almost. If Shinobi is to receive one nerf out of these testing grounds, it would be to remove range GB allowing a buffer to counter GB which Shinobi can use to avoid being punished rightfully so, especially when most other characters have lower damage. If this change were to occur, Shinobi would have a nice spot in mid/high tier which I would love to see. (assuming the testing grounds go live) **Nuxia** OMG SHE LIGHT SPAMS SO MUCH....is what I would say if I thought that was what actually made her strong. She still has fairly obvious animation for when she does lights making it not impossible to parry or deflect but still more difficult than previously. Her real damage comes from traps which now have a 300ms indicator which I have yet to see anyone but a bot react to. Honestly the scariest thing about her are her traps. However, like other characters, her damage was nerfed quite a bit, so her traps do significantly less damage. I'd honestly be fine with this if it wasn't for her deflect also being nerfed, despite it being blockable. If anything, I think it should have been left alone, damage wise, then guaranteed to hit, thus encouraging dodging and fluid combat and also encourage her to fall for feints to GB more like Shinobi and Orochi currently do. This concludes my thoughts over the assassins in the testing grounds. I did my best to provide what I could gather from my experiences with all the assassins. Hope you all enjoyed another wall of text from me. "

If the kick becomes unreactable similar to other bashes, it would force a prediction from the defending enemy, which would help her problem of dealing with turtles.) **Kick now able to be chained from a throw** (currently, you can throw someone into a wall to land a heavy or into the open and confirm a cobra strike, though if you could chain her throw into a kick, it would give her the option to apply a bit of stamina damage before the confirmed punish and potentially wallsplat an enemy that was slightly too far from a wall. This could also work similarly with centurion and use it as a tool to get a ledge.)"

I have also noticed that it is considerably more difficult to land guard breaks after feinting his heavies, most of the time it ends up with me whiffing them and eating a heavy instead. BP right now, is honestly in a very bad state right now. His utter lack of hyper armor, slow attack and extremely conditional kit is not going to make up for a decent shield bash which has already been nerfed, both damage and difficulty to land-wise. He is extremely vulnerable to guard breaking and has no decent mix-ups options, with his zone using preposterous amount of stamina for little gain and his only soft feint being extremely slow and inflexible, as it can not be used from a combo. He needs a rework."
85,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Guard breaking heavy attacks and Fighting out of stamina opponents questions,1,ekh1lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ekh1lp/guard_breaking_heavy_attacks_and_fighting_out_of/,2020-01-06 05:42:02,"Okay, can someone answers these questions I have. First off, am i do something wrong when I feint my heavy attack into a guard break? I end up eating so many heavies cause I tried to bait someone into doing a heavy. Mind u they do the heavy, but as soon as I activate guardbreak, I eat shit. I figure my guard break would take effect but it doesnt. Aint the vulnerability at the start up of heavies? So i figure that means they should be able to be guard broken but it doesnt happen. I even eat heavies from slow start up heavy attacks like for example raider's fury. My next question is how do u fight someone who is out of stamina but they have amazing defense. I just fought a Zhanhu who I couldnt find an opening on when he ran out of stamina. I throw heavies then feint them but he was unfazed. I let them fly and he would parry me. He wouldnt even do anything that would allow me to guard break him either. The only way I could hurt him was when I was just using lights and bashing him. (I was using black prior btw which im still learning with.) I hated the fact that I had to use the bash and lights to do damage while he out of stamina because then people can call me a no skilled noob. I know peoples consider u bad when u keep using light attacks to do damage since it means ur not good enough to do anything else. So if anyone can answer, these questions, I would appreciate it."

Overtuned damage, easily accessible ranged attacks, no offense, option-selects out the ass, and teleports that barely dodge anything. This ninja has no offensive bone in its body, and yet he's one of the greatest turtles known to man. In this rework, I aim to make him a properly balanced glass cannon character by: * Significantly lower his turtling capabilities * Lower the viability of his ranged attacks as ganking tools, but make them easier to use on the offense * Give his dodge kicks and his front flip kick proper mix-ups * Lower the overall damage of the character but still keeping a high damage potential * Standardize some of its moves to follow the rules of the game &amp;#x200B; **Heavies &amp; Lights** * The damage of the guaranteed light from an opener light or heavy is reduced to 8 damage(from 10) * Shinobi now has an LH chain * The chain heavy now deals 25 damage and is undodgeable(from 35 damage) * The Sickle Rain damage is reduced to 15 damage, with each strike dealing 1 + 4 bleed damage(from 18 overall, 2 + 4 bleed each strike) * Shadow Strike(parry light) damage is lowered to 14 + 8 bleed(14 + 15 bleed) * Side chain lights are now 400ms(from 500ms) * Top chain light is now enhanced and deals 17 damage(from 14 damage) *The damage nerfs are obvious: high punishes promotes turtling. This is fixed.* *And the chain buffs should prove to at least help Shinobi when it comes to his mid-chains.* &amp;#x200B; **Dodges** * Shinobi can now triple dodge * The ""Double Dodge"" stamina cost is lowered to 14 from 24 *This is a change that works extremely well with the other additions and changes later in the post, but it will make Shinobi a far more mobile and dodge focused character without having to rely on quad-dodges(which will be worked out in the later changes).* &amp;#x200B; **Ranged Heavies** * \[MOST IMPORTANT\] Ranged heavies can no longer be charged; instead, they are now accessed after a side or forward dodge, replacing the ""soft-feint"" into a slightly faster heavy * The input window is 300-500ms for side dodges, and 100-500ms for forward dodges; the ranged heavy direction depends on the dodge direction * All ranged heavies are now enhanced * Ranged heavies, once parried, no longer knock down Shinobi; instead, the enemy drags Shinobi to them and then get a heavy parry punish * Side opener ranged heavies now deal 20 damage and are 600ms(from 25 damage and 600-800ms depending on range) * Top opener ranged heavy now deals 25 damage and is 700ms(from 600-800ms depending on range) * Top opener ranged heavy is feintable * All opener ranged heavies have the lowest range(the range when Shinobi starts charging) * Chain ranged heavies can now be chained infinitely * Chain ranged heavies are all 700ms and deal 25 damage(from 800ms); these are feintable * Chain ranged heavies all have the maximum range(when Shinobi fully charges their ranged heavies) *Obviously, a chargeable and safe way to enter into a stance that accesses ranged attacks that can be sent off-screen are pretty nonsensical. Even the supposed ""downside"" to these ranged heavies(the interruptible on block and the knockdown on parry) did nothing to lower their ganking potential, and only served to kill their offensive potential. Now both of these problems should be solved, and Shinobi can even use these to possibly anti-gank.* &amp;#x200B; **Dodge Kicks** * On the second and third dodges, the input window is 300-500ms(from 400ms) * Side dodge kicks on the second dodge is sped up to 500ms(from 600ms) * Dodge Kicks on the third dodge are all 400ms * All dodge kicks deal 28 stamina damage and guarantee a side opener ranged heavy for 20 damage(from 47 stamina damage and 25 damage) * All dodge kicks now have I-frames(like Kensei's and Orochi's side dodge attacks) *Better input windows, faster speeds, multiple options with double and triple dodges, better I-frames: Shinobi's dodge kicks now give him a significant amount of offensive potential without making it too safe.* &amp;#x200B; **Back Flip** * Backflip distance is increased to the minimum range of a ranged heavy * Backflip now has 300ms of GB vulnerability * Backflip now has more sufficient I-frames *Backflip failed to really dodge much of anything due to the lack of distance and the underwhelming I-frames.* *Now(in the sense of an evasion tool) it can be used as a dodge tool. In the sense of a mix-up tool(after dodge kicks and flip kicks) it can be used to beat out dodgeable attacks but not a GB, while the ranged heavy beats out the GB option.* &amp;#x200B; **Ranged GB** * Ranged GB can now only be accessed after a backflip(no longer from neutral or after a dodge kick/flip kick) * Ranged GB is now sped up to 500ms(from 600ms) *A ranged GB from neutral that can guarantee so much damage is a clear problem. Just like the ranged heavies, it has no offensive capabilities, and is only useful as a ganking tool. Now, especially with the backflip changes, this should see some use as a non-cancerous tool.* &amp;#x200B; **Deflect** * The teleport now requires either a light or GB input to be initiated; the light leads to the teleport then the bleed stab, and the GB leads to the teleport then the kick * The teleport of the deflect now only costs 10 stamina and has I-frames throughout the whole animation * The kick no longer guarantees a ranged heavy where someone wasn't blocking; the stamina damage of the kick is increased to 50 from 30; the kick can now wall splat *Finally, Shinobi's deflect now comes in-line with all the other deflects, requiring an input instead of being automatic. The teleport of the deflect now actually evades stuff(instead of acting like a magnet), and the kick doesn't guarantee such outrageous damage... at least not in every case.* &amp;#x200B; **Zone** * The stamina cost of the zone strikes is now set to 30 + 15 + 15(from 17 + 17 + 21) * The damage of the first two strikes is now set at 14 + 8(from 10 + 5) * The third strike is now replaced with the Shadow Strike(now it deals 14 + 8 bleed) *Surprisingly, Shinobi's zone is very underwhelming when it comes to damage, especially when compared to other characters' zones like Shaman's and Berzerker's. It's now more in-line, along with a more powerful yet more familiar change to the third strike.* &amp;#x200B; **Front Flip** * Front Flip now has 300ms of GB vulnerability * Front Flip Kick is now 400ms(from 300ms) * Front Flip Kick now guarantees a side opener ranged heavy * Front Flip Kick can now wallsplat, guaranteeing a top opener ranged heavy *The kick of the front flip really served no purpose other than to drain stamina. Now it operates as a strong mix-up, especially with the undodgeable chain heavies and 400ms finisher side lights.* &amp;#x200B; **Yama Uba** * Yama Uba now heals for 30% of the damage that Shinobi deals(from 20%) *Shinobi's Yama Uba used to be excessively strong, but after the nerfs it was dangerously underwhelming. After all of these damage and defensive nerfs, Yama Uba should be reasonably balanced if made a little stronger.* &amp;#x200B; **Tl;dr:** * Shinobi can now triple dodge * Dodge kicks are all 500ms on the second dodge, and 400ms on the third dodge; all dodge kicks guarantee a 20 damage side ranged heavy * Shinobi can no longer charge heavies or access them from neutral * All ranged heavies are enhanced and only guarantee a heavy parry punish if parried * Opener ranged heavies deal 20 damage on the sides and 25 on sides; all chain heavies are 700ms, feintable, and deal 25 damage * Ranged heavies can now chain infinitely * Shinobi can only access ranged GBs after a backflip * Back Flip now dodges a greater distance and has more I-frames * Shinobi now has a LH chain * The guaranteed second light now deals 8 damage instead of 10 * Top chain light is enhanced, while the side chain lights are sped up to 400ms * All chain heavies deal 25 damage and are undodgeable * Front kick flip is 400ms and guarantees a side ranged heavy * Shadow Strike(parry light) now deals 22 damage overall instead of 29 * Shinobi's deflect is no longer automatic * Shinobi's deflect kick guarantees no ranged heavy, but can now wallsplat to guarantee a top ranged heavy * The first two strikes of the zone cost more stamina and deal more damage; the third strike now deals the same type of damage as the parry light * Yama Uba now heals for 30% of the damage that Shinobi deals"

Highlander is very difficult to play in higher level lobbies because he's very easy to counter, and everyone knows how to do it. As a rep 50 HL I think I'm qualified to make the world's 480174701th HL rework. This rework serves to make him more viable for the style of play Ubi is trying to push, make him more healthy, while still keeping his identity and keeping him enjoyable to play. Highlander's Problems: -Offense can be nullified by dodge rolls -Kick/grab mixup can be safely option-selected by a dodge attack -High damage -Defensive Form is useless -Has very poor stamina (he's oos after two soft feints) -Broken Option select (hold heavy) -Very matchup dependant ###Defensive Form **New Chain:** HLH **Heavies** -Neutral side heavies are 900ms (from 1000) -Neutral top heavies deal 38 damage (from 45) -Neutral heavies gain HA at 500ms (from 700ms) and chain heavies gain HA at 100ms (from 300) -Top heavy finisher deals 35 damage (from 45) **Lights** -Lights are 500ms (from 600 neutral and 700 chained) -Chain light deals 16 damage (from 22), can no longer ledge -Lights are enhanced -Backstep lights do not have a crushing counter property **Zone** -Zone is now 633ms/700ms/800ms (from 800/900/900) -Damage is 25/30/30 -The last strike is unblockable -Each strike can fast flow into OF -Hit stun on the first two strikes reduced so that feint -&gt; gb will land (the enemy was in hitstun and the gb would bounce off) **Celtic Curse** -Celtic Curse and Celtic Curse Cancel are undodgable -Celtic Curse Cancel is 566ms (from 600 right and 700 left) -Celtic Curse cancel occurs at 200ms-500ms (right was 200-400) -Celtic Curse can be feinted to neutral **New Move: Celtic Curse Alternate (for lack of a better name)** -Imput: Side dodge -&gt; Heavy -Animation: Literally just Celtic Curse Cancel -Speed: 700ms, 200ms of iframes, gains HA at 400ms -Deals 20 Damage, can start chains, can fast flow into OF, 100ms gb vulnerability, and cannot be feinted, can execute **New Move: Be Careful Around Cats** Input: Light attack off of a gb Animation: His current chain light Speed: 700ms, Gains HA at 200ms Deals 20 damage, can start chains, can fast flow into OF, 100ms gb vulnerability, and cannot be feinted, can execute **Entering and exiting OF** -When entering OF via Hold Heavy input, HL cannot cancel it until he has fully entered it. In addition, He cannot cancel OF and cgb if he is gbd while in OF -Exiting OF costs no stamina (from 15) -Finishers can fast flow into OF ###Offensive Form **Balor's Might (BM)** -Damage reduced to 32 (from 40) -Stamina cost reduced to 20 (from 24) -Can be soft feinted into a DF dodge via dodge input, and OF dodge via dodge imput while holding heavy -Side BM hitboxes have a larger arc, making it easier to hit opponents the side of HL **OF Light** -Top light is 400ms -Costs 10 stamina when soft feinted from BM -The direction can be changed when soft feinted from BM, but the light becomes 466ms and the damage becomes 12 (From 400ms, 10 dmg.

I'll try to reply to all the questions so don't hold back. No question is a stupid question. I got all my information for HLs current stats from the info hub, or from 50 reps of experience. ###TLDR: -Defensive Form got speed increases and damage nerfs, as well as changing/adding moves to make it more usable -Hold Heavy Option Select removed, as well as backstep crushing counter option select. -OF kick is feintable to allow HL to punish dodge attacks on read -OF soft feints use less stamina, but OF heavy does less damage to compensate for all the OF buffs"

92,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Idea for (Most) heroes with no side dodge attacks: Command Grabs,1,eqmhql,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/eqmhql/idea_for_most_heroes_with_no_side_dodge_attacks/,2020-01-19 08:17:16,"Title. Okay, so remember the time when Raider could branch into a GB from his side dodges? I do, as do most people, since it just triggered a PTSD flashback. Well what I'm proposing is like that, except not cancer. This is for all of the heroes that don't have side dodge attacks: Centurion, Aramusha, Jormungandr, Highlander, Hitokiri, Shugoki, ect... well, except for Black Prior and Warlord, since BP already has Bulwark stance, and Warlord having this would be nightmarish. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, onto the actual details of this move. A Command Grab is a side dodge bash/GB that grabs someone in their recovery. Just like a GB, it grabs them for a GB punish. The speed would be 400ms, and it could be initiated 400-500ms into the side dodge. But here's where the best part is: When Raider had his side dodge GB, it made him effectively immune to being punished w/ a GB for dodging, making his dodges incredibly safe. This was because his GB's allowed for him to CGB during the entire animation of the dodge GB. But with Command Grabs, that wouldn't be the case. A command Grab, as I said, is a bash/GB. The grab does grab people like a GB(meaning that people can also CGB it), but it's treated as a bash for most of its other properties. For example: * During the Command Grab animation, a hero cannot CGB with it * It has a GB vulnerability of about 100ms, making it not immune to GBs itself * It's input window is too far into the dodge to allow for it to punish most recovery moves, just the ones with medium-to-long recoveries &amp;#x200B; This move would help significantly for the heroes that I just listed, since they suffer from being unable to punish melee attacks. And unlike with how Raider's dodge GB acted, it would actually be impossible to turtle with. &amp;#x200B; If anyone has any thoughts, list them below."
93,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Tiandi improvements: Making his offense flow (like water!),1,erd7bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/erd7bq/tiandi_improvements_making_his_offense_flow_like/,2020-01-21 00:29:01,"**TL;DR at the bottom** Tiandi ranges from decent to bad across all game modes. His kit is pretty underwhelming for a number of reasons: * Not much neutral pressure as palm strike is reactable, so he has poor initiation, relying on feint mindgames to access his 400ms light finishers for a whopping 14dmg. Alternatively he can backstep light, but this fails if the opponent backwalks. * His offense stops immediately after said 400ms light, giving him terrible flow (*un*like water!) * His heavy finishers are pretty useless. So is his kick, unless there's a pit or some spikes behind your opponent * Despite being a dodge specialist, his dodge attacks aren't actually that great. Dragon dodge is slow, easy to interrupt, and it is often caught by random GB's. Tiger Dodge's input window is so narrow that you can't really dodge anything with it. In addition both moves are unlikely to ever be useful offensively * While he has good feats overall, his unique feats can be underwhelming To try to fix this I'll suggest ways to give Zhanhu's lil bro more offensive options and flow, make more of his moveset viable, and cement him as a proper ~~figure skater~~ dodge specialist by concentrating his power in his dodge attacks. Let's start with his in-chain pressure: * Non-neutral Palm Strike is now 466ms (from 600ms). * Top light finisher is now 500ms 17dmg+enhanced (from 400ms 14dmg). By extension, this is a damage buff to Palm Strike. * Palm strike hitstun increased by 100ms to ensure the followup still lands * Finisher side lights sped up to 366ms (from 400ms), as a small minority of players have sub 233ms reaction times. (Note that if you DON'T have sub 233ms reaction times this literally won't affect you) * Kick now guarantees forward Dragon Dodge. Forward Dragon Dodge is now 25dmg (from 20dmg) * OR: Kick now does 25 damage innately. This change is easier (and cooler!) but doesn't allow you to chain * Dodge cancel from kick costs 0 stamina These changes are built around giving him chain pressure with more options and flow. The Palm Strike change makes it a viable mixup, as predictive dodges can be caught by Tiger Dodge, and the added damage gives you a reason to use it instead of the finisher lights; to compensate for this new option and to make him want to actually use it, de-emphasizing his reliance on 400ms lights, the top finisher was slowed down. (It's enhanced property will be elaborated on in a bit) And finally, the Kick now guarantees damage, which gives him an in-chain mixup from a heavy. The damage of forward Dragon Dodge was buffed to give this mixup decent output and because it was a bit weak for a trade tool. Next, let's improve his sustained offense with two simple changes! * Flow like Water works with all attacks but Palm Strike (from only working with opener attacks) * Kick can now be used after heavy finishers on hit or block as well With this, Tiandi has options to follow up on his finishers for better sustained offense so that it doesn't stop so soon after it begins. Expanding on Flow like Water will give him more mobility for 4's as well. It also synchronizes with the new enhanced property on his 500ms top light finisher, allowing him to continue offense even if the opponent blocks it. The new way to use his Kick gives his heavy finishers a purpose since Tiandi will have more options for continuing his offense after a heavy finisher than after a light finisher. However, for Flow like Water to be worth much offensively his dodge attacks need improvements. Let's start with Tiger Dodge: * Tiger Dodge is now usable 100-300ms into a dodge, so that they can actually be used to... dodge! * Tiger Dodge CC frames now start 0ms into the attack * Tiger Dodge is now enhanced * Tiger Dodge CC damage is now 27. No longer guarantees Palm Strike for consistency's sake * Tiger Dodge now deals 15dmg Tiandi's Tiger Dodge has been made a better counter tool by increasing the input window and CC frames, though at the cost of some CC damage. This allows Tiandi to more reliably punish attempts to catch him in recovery in 4's as well, or attempts to interrupt Dragon Dodge. It has also been given some offensive worth by being made enhanced, making it a useful initiator against opponents who don't like to parry, or perhaps bait against those who do. In particular, the forward variant is mixup-able with Forward Dragon Dodge so it isn't just a free parry on indicator - while this doesn't mean it'll often do damage, it'll at least make it much easier to keep attacking with your recovery cancels. The damage was increased slightly to make the Palm Strike and Kick mixups slightly more damaging since Tiger Dodge is Tiandi's tool to catch early dodges. Now let's talk about the changes to Dragon Dodge. First some changes to the move's basic behavior: * Side Dragon Dodge is now 1000ms (from 1100ms). This lowers the GB vulnerability from 600ms to 400ms * Side Dragon Dodge can no longer hard feint * Side Dragon Dodge now has iframes until 700ms * Side Dragon Dodge can now softfeint into a dodge on a variable timing, as early as 400ms These changes are make side Dragon Dodges safer, but ensure it can't be turtly. Their iframes have been increased and their GB vulnerability decreased to improve the move's reliability. So Tiandi cannot turtle with this move, the ability to hard feint Dragon Dodge and its massive bash immunity has been removed, forcing you to commit to something if you use it and so it doesn't shut down certain mixups. (It'll be given better offensive options so that the move isn't parry bait.) In addition, the variable timing on dodge softfeints allows for more versatility in catching interrupt attempts. Now for the changes to Dragon Dodge's offensive use. This is where Tiandi's openers will be: * Side Dragon Dodge can now softfeint into 466ms palm strike. Non-variable timing * Forward Dragon Dodge can now softfeint into dodge as well * **All Dragon Dodges become unblockable if used from a softfeint dodge** These changes make Dragon Dodge Tiandi's main opener. The 466ms Palm Strike forces a reaction. Forward Dragon Dodge being given the softfeints means it can be used to start your offense as well since you can softfeint it into an unblockable Dragon Dodge more quickly, though it has one option fewer (palm strike). And finally - the big change - making the softfeint version of Dragon Dodge unblockable gives Tiandi some UB pressure, giving him some viable neutral damage-dealing potential. This suggestion has been in a LOT of Tiandi change requests lately so... hint hint Ubi! Finally, let's deal with his unique feats: * Rally Call now ""pulses"" every 15 seconds to apply a 20% damage bonus that lasts 8 seconds. Now includes Tiandi in the buff. Range increased to 18m. At critical health, becomes 25% bonus that lasts 10 seconds. * Sacrifice now heals 3 health/second and increases ally defense by 15% for 12 seconds (from healing 30 health over 24 seconds). Cooldown increased to 20 seconds. Rally call currently sucks because (aside from the fact that it's bugged and doesn't work), the damage bonus is low and short-lived. With these changes it would hopefully be more worth the risk of hanging around at low health. Sacrifice's problem is that it heals too little health too slowly. By healing more health and faster, it may be able to save teammates in a pinch during a team fight, and with excellent coordination can swing the fight in your favor, though at great personal risk. TL;DR * Chained Palm strike now 466ms; side light finishers now 366ms 12dmg; top light finisher now 500ms 17dmg + enhanced * Kick now guaranteed forward Dragon Dodge, which now deals 25dmg. Alternatively, Kick now deals 25dmg. Kick can now be used after heavy finishers * Flow like Water now works after all moves but Palm Strike * Tiger dodge is now usable from 100-300ms. It is also enhanced, 15dmg * Tiger dodge CC buffed to 27dmg, no longer guarantees Palm Strike. * Side dragon dodge is now 1000ms; no longer hard feints or has such long bash immunity; has iframes from 0-600ms; can feint into a dodge from 400-600ms * Side dragon dodge can now softfeint into 466ms palm strike at 600ms * Forward dragon dodge can now softfeint into a dodge * All Dragon Dodges become unblockable if used from a softfeint * Rally call now gives a 20% dmg bonus every 15 seconds, each buff lasting 8 seconds. Also buffs Tiandi's damage * Sacrifice now heals 3 health/s and increases defense by 15%, both for 12 seconds"

This rework focuses on giving ara openers, chain pressure, standardized defense and damage and (just as a personal choice) ability to take advantage of stamina depletion and oos state. I personally see the ronin as a fighter without honor compared to others like kensei, so I think it'd be in his character to fight dirty, with cheap tricks and abusing the weak and tired state of his opponent. Besides, knights have glad and vikings have jorm, why not give a stamina bully to the samurai as well? I know some won't like this stamina depleting version, but tell me what you think about the mixup potential and the way his bashes could be used. The concept itself can vary a lot and has the potential to be almost anything.* #Attack Chains **Heavies** - Heavies can be softfeinted into guardbreak -Opener and chained heavies from any direction have the following properties: - 30dmg openers and 25dmg chained (from 25/40 openers and 28/33 chained) - 700ms (from 600 for the top) *(they might as well be 800ms, it doesn't matter, I just like keeping things fast)* - default 400ms gb vulnerability (from 100) *The lack of openers, the huge damage differences between the heavies, the fast feints and the low gb vulnerability make aramusha more effective as a turtle than as an attacker. This would make his defense less abusable and his punishes more average. The chained heavies also have the same properties to keep the values consistent.* - Side heavies are confirmed on guardbreak - Top chained, side chained and side finisher heavies are undodgeable *You'll see why later...* - Side finishers are 800ms (from 900) and 35dmg (from 45) - Top heavy finisher is unblockable and has HA 400ms into the animation *Just to make it more useful. He is a half-heavy hybrid after all, let him learn something from big boy shugo.* **Lights** - Chained lights deal 15dmg (from 16/17) - Chained top light is enhanced *Since it's the only fast attack that can follow up side attacks it better have something that allows it to not be interrupted with an option select such as holding top guard and reacting to everything else.* - Deadly feints now deal 14dmg (from 15top/20side) *Maybe it's just me but 20dmg is way too much for a 400ms multi-directional soft feint. Besides, they're even more useful thanks to the unblockable top finisher. The top one too, who cares.* ^I'm ^sorry ^top ^one ^Q-Q **Dodge Attacks** - Startup is now 100-500ms (from 300) - Rushing Wind (forward dodge top heavy) has HA 300ms into the jump (from 100) and deals 25dmg (from 20) - Rushing Wind Alternate (forward dodge side heavy) is undodgeable and 600ms (from 700) - Rushing wind alternate can also be performed as a side dodge attack (direction of the attack is the same as the direction of the dodge) but can't be feinted as such *This would give him a great tool against bashes. I think the animation could really fit in a side dodge attack as well, dashing in the direction of the dodge and slashing through.* #Blade Blockade - Twin Vipers (side heavy) is 500ms (from 1000) and 20dmg (from 40) with a slightly increased hitbox *To hit multiple opponents in front of you and at least confirming damage on one guy.* - Fury Unleashed (top heavy) is unblockable and always confirmed *I imagine the way these attacks are confirmed the same way conq's full guard uppercut heavy in confirmed, so basically a damaging bash that can execute.* #BASHES **Push Back Kick** - Can be performed after forward dodges, lights and non-finisher heavies - 500ms with 100-500ms startup for dodges (remember, same goes for the other dodge attacks) - Deals 25 stamina damage (from 40) - Can chain into light and heavy openers when landed - Knocks down opponents that are OOS, confirming a heavy - Has 700ms miss recovery (same as glad's toe stab, basically punishable by dodge attacks on reaction and gb on read) - 600ms stun (from 1500) - When performed after a BB it deals 10dmg and can wallsplat - When performed offensively it doesn't guarantee any damage ^unless ^oos and it can't wallsplat *ALRIGHT, so... now it works as an opener, an opener mixup (with the undodgeable forward dodge side heavies) a chain mixup (with the undodgable chain and finisher side heavies) and a stamina bully move as well as an oos pressure tool. I decided to decrease the stamina depletion because it's 500ms and usable after any attack except for the finishers, so it could be used very frequently. The stun is also reduced so that it's still ^a ^bit useful but not as annoying as it would be with a full 1500ms of stun every time you got kicked. Or do you believe it should be removed? The BB properities make it situational, allowing it to deal 40dmg on a wallsplat.* **Ring the Bell** - Now can also be used after a guardbreak (input is light, the same way jorm's knee works) and in that case can be followed with a throw (not after BB) - Is 10dmg when performed after a gb (from 15) - No stamina damage (from 20) - Restores 50 stamina points to ara *This isn't exactly a fix. It's more of a compensation for the concept I have in mind, but there are many more possibilities. I just decided to remove the stam dmg because the kick already does that and added the stam restore because I liked the idea. If you have other suggestions I'd be more than happy to check them out. Anyways, the use after a guardbreak, combined with a throw, would allow ara to deliver 40dmg on a wallsplat and continue the chain. I'd keep the 15dmg on BB so that it basically works as a stunning light without reducing the damage. The stam restore, especially after BB, could also be situational, maybe when you're fighting jorm.* #In summary... -He has a kick that can be used as an opener and in chains and doesn't guarantee damage unless oos -The heavies are more useful, functioning as mixup tools with the kick and unblockable attacks -He has a side dodge attack -BB is more situational but can also deal damage more consistently -Gb invulnerability is gone -Fast top feints are gone -Damage is standardized -Ring the bell can also be used after a gb and restores stamina ... *I have the feeling that many wouldn't agree on some things regarding Ring the Bell or the stamina depletion style in general. That's fine, it's just my version of him. Still, the core concept of the mixups I gave him would give him much more viability, aramusha has lots of potential and the bashes he has would look cool af as offensive moves. What do you think? Feel free to leave a feedback and ask me any question you have, I hope you like it :)*"

And yes, I know that you're not supposed to survive a well synchronized gank, but I think that's just bad design from ubisoft. Not giving the player the chance to fight back, robbing him of control, is extremely anti-fun. Besides, he already has the disadvantage of being outnumbered, why should the game be designed to make it impossible to get out of a situation like that? The first solution is simpler, during a parry (and maybe even 200ms after that so that you really don't have a window of complete vulnerability) you are completely immune to attacks. Since normal attacks would get parried, that would include bashes, grabs and feats. The second solution would require a bit more skill, but it could make things faster and seem more realistic."

The emperor's chosen jester... what? He's certainly not the emperor's chosen warrior. This warrior has been an atrocity of character design since the start of the game. He lacks... everything, really. He lacks an opener, any external pressure, and any proper mix-ups. The only thing he has going for him are his chain lights, which only raise him from the status of ""absolute stillbirth"" to ""slight annoyance"". Quite simply, almost every single move he has somehow has more cons than pros. So this post is going to fix that, and hopefully move Orochi away from D-tier. **Light Combo** * Top light combo from neutral is reverted to being 500ms and dealing 15 + 7 damage(from 466ms and 12 + 6) *The change to Orochi's light combo were more detrimental than helpful. Sure, the zone plus the neutral top light created a slight mix-up, but it's pathetic compared to other heroes and their mix-ups. The changes are reverted, especially the damage.* **Chains** * Chain lights are sped up to 366ms from 400ms * Chain light damage is buffed to 13 from 12 * Finisher light speeds are flipped, with the top light being 466ms(used to be 400ms) and the side lights being 400ms(used to be 466ms) * Finisher light damage values are also flipped, with the top light dealing 17 damage(used to deal 15) and the side lights dealing 15(used to deal 17) * Top finisher heavy damage buffed to 38 from 35 * Side finisher heavy damage buffed to 33 from 30 * After a finisher attack, Orochi can initiate his ""Path of the Typhoon"" Mix-up *Out of all the miscellaneous changes in this list, Orochi should benefit. His chain lights will be far more threatening, and his finisher lights will have some actual mix-up potential. Also, extra damage on his finisher heavies is always nice.* *The ""Path of the Typhoon"" Mix-up will be explained down below.* **Storm Rush** * Left Storm Rush is sped up to 300ms from 400ms(now same as right SR) * Storm Rush entrance stamina cost lowered to 14 from 17 * Storm Rush feint cost lowered to 10 from 20 * Top Storm Rush damage is increased to 21 from 17 * Storm Rush hit stun is increased to medium hitstun from light hitstun *There are several issues with Storm Rush, including its ease of blocking, its unbelievably high stamina cost, and it's hitstun. Now it acts as a proper opener with reasonable stamina costs, and the hitstun no longer allows enemies to easily dodge Orochi's follow-ups after Storm Rush.* **Riptide Strike** * Dodge input increased to 200-400ms from 300ms * GB vulnerability is lowered to 100ms from 400ms * Damage is lowered to 20 from 22 *Riptide Strike has always had an issue of being oddly easy to GB. Now, with the dodge input changes and vulnerability changes, it should work properly.* **Zone** * Zone stamina cost lowered to 50 from 60 * Zone recovery can be dodge-cancelled * After a Zone, Orochi can initiate his ""Path of the Typhoon"" Mix-up *General buffs to Orochi's zone, making it more usable in anti-ganks.* *""Path of the Typhoon"" mix-up will now be explained.* **\[NEW MECHANIC\] Path of the Typhoon** *After a finisher light, finisher heavy, or zone, Orochi uses his momentum to charge his dodge attacks with more power, allowing him to use them more in battle.* * If used from a finisher attack or zone, forward dodge light is sped up to 466ms from 566ms, and is enhanced * If used from a finisher attack or zone, the side dodge lights are sped up to 500ms from 600ms, and are enhanced * If used from a finisher attack or zone, forward dodge light is sped up to 500ms from 600ms, and is enhanced *This alone would make his dodge cancels a lot more useful, but this is only a compliment to his real power.* **\[NEW MOVE\] Maelstrom Knee** *After throwing out an attack, Orochi sends his knee into the enemy's gut, stunning them long enough for a light combo.* Speed: 466ms Type: Bash Input: GB after a finisher light, finisher heavy, or a zone Damage: Stuns enough to guarantee a top light combo for 22 damage Properties: low tracking, capable of ledging ***AND...*** **\[NEW MOVE\] Hurricane Blast Alternative** *After throwing out an attack, Orochi turns around and charges his blade to stab at the enemy behind him, just like with regular Hurricane Blast.* Speed: 900ms Type: Non-directional Unblockable, like Warlord's fullblock stab Input: Heavy after a finisher light, finisher heavy, or a zone Damage: 38 direct damage Properties: Incredible side and backwards tracking(meant to catch dodgers that dodge Maelstrom Knee), Hard-feintable 400ms before landing, Soft-feintable into a GB or dodge 400ms before landing *These three new moves/mechanics give Orochi everything that he needs, from chain/finisher pressure to dodge capabilities for anti-ganks. Unsurprsingly, this also gives Orochi a mix-up that is actually worth it.* **Hurricane Blast(Deflect)** * The GB and dodge soft-feint window is increased to 300-500ms from 500ms * Hurricane Blast can now break through hyper armor * Hit recovery of Hurricane Blast is lowered to allow the enemy to block the oncoming zone * On a miss, Orochi can still chain into his chain lights and heavies *This deflect move rarely sees use since it's not guaranteed damage, but it's also because it's easier to avoid. Along with that, despite this deflect being slow and high-damaging, it's still beaten by lowly Hyper armor. Both of these issues should be solved.* **Maelstrom Knee(Deflect)** * This version of Maelstrom Knee is instant and guaranteed against a deflected enemy, and still guarantees 22 damage(from the top light combo) *A quick solution for HA, most deserving for a hero that supposedly specializes in deflects.* **TL;DR:** * Top light combo is reverted to 22 damage and 500ms * Chain lights are slightly faster * Finisher light speeds and damage values are switched * Finisher heavy damage is slightly buffed * Storm Rush is the same speed on both the right and left * Top Storm Rush deals more damage * Storm Rush stamina cost is lowered * Storm Rush hitstun is now medium instead of light * Riptide Strike has its GB vulnerability lowered and its dodge input window increased * Zone's stamina cost is lowered, and its recovery can be dodged cancelled * Orochi's new mechanic, the path of the Typhoon, allows for all of Orochi's dodge lights to be faster and enhanced from a dodge cancel * Orochi now has a bash/unblockable heavy mix-up after finisher attacks or a zone * Orochi's Hurricane Blast from deflect has a bigger dodge/GB soft-feint window, and can chain on miss * Hurricane Blast from deflect no longer guarantees a zone on hit * Orochi's new knee bash can be used from a deflect against enemies with hyper armor"

Still, the lack of changes to the shove is a bit underwhelming: it's still too unpunishable, too HyaperArmored and too useless as an offensive tool. Glad I'm glad they fixed the stab (and possibly the haymaker buff on the stab) and I'm honestly a bit surprised by the haymaker nerf. Not that it's useless now, but I still didn't see it coming. Jorm The wallsplat delays are some nice quality of life changes, but the stamina drain is still a bit strong. Also, the damage is still low on his normal attacks, which is probably what they're going for, but it will definitely keep pushing players to drain stamina rather than fighting like other heroes, making fights with jorm slow and frustrating since you have to regain your stamina to attack. Hito I like the damage nerf. It makes things more interesting and strengthens her identity of a mix of continuous normal attacks and powerful chain-ending ones. I have no idea what the throw distance increase is for tho (again, didn't watch the stream, if someone knows please enlighten me)... Tiandi He uhmmm... ye, they're pretty worthless. I mean come on, a 100ms window buff for his forward dodge light and a decreased stamina cost to his zone? That's it? Warlord Like the top light speed buff but why are they buffing his ledging capability? Even tho it's just 100ms more on his throws (beside the back one), so I dunno... Charged heavy option select nerf Nice I guess, especially for shinobi, but I think they're forgetting that conq will just zone their way out. Increased forward movement Hell yeah! Parry punish input window buff Nice Fixes So, they fixed JJ's unparryable attack bug, raider's fury gb vulnerability, highlander's... something, hey they made punch through useless again. Oh and the traps are now visible on stairs, etc. Pretty neat changes overall, although a bit underwhelming at times... well, there's still the whole year, and we might even get new changes in the mid season patch :D ^and ^you ^know ^who ^I'm ^talking ^about ^(   )"

Just the ability to access Blade Blockade into Blade Blockade Followups from Neutral and Chain. Twin Vipers can be both hard feinted into Guard Break or soft feinted into Deadly Feints while Fury Unleashed possess armor and undodgeable to deal with interrupts or rolls against Push Back Kick. Push Back Kick confirms Ring the Bell if Aramusha so chooses to. Ring the Bell recovers *both* the stamina of Aramusha *and* the opponent. This can be used to confirm damage off Push Back Kick without a wallsplat or recover stamina allowing Aramusha to continue the offensive. Both Top and Side Neutral Heavy have been standardized to 800ms as well as lowered to a 30 damage cap. Aramusha's Guard Breaks are now Highlander levels of bad crippling Aramusha's ability to Punish Guard Break Vulnerability. The lower Neutral Heavy Damage greatly lowers Aramusha's utility in and 4v4s or 2v2s. While a decent mid clearer and now duelist Aramusha can no longer greatly contribute damage in ganks or teamfights. From Light, Heavy, or Deadly Feint Aramusha has access to a Unblockable, Undodgeable, Bash, and Deadly Feint. From everything else Aramusha has access to all of the above minus Deadly Feint. Aside from the 40-45 damage Heavy Finisher these attacks range from 15 - 33 damage and Aramusha's punish damage has been brought down to similar levels with a 15 damage Guard Break Punish at worst."

The fact that you can be GBd mid chain. Why should I be punished for continuing my offence? Not continuing my offence would also lead to GB vulnerability. 2. Being GBd during revenge. I don't think that I should have GB vulnerability on any move during revenge, since you are supposed to be able to be on the offence then. 3. The fact that some moves can be only be countered by GBs like full blocks and dodges, while, at the same time; GBs are unusable in 1vX and XvX due to their slow speed. Meaning that a BP can sit in full block or a JJ can spam dodges during a gank or team fight without any counterplay.

They got hit too hard with the nerfs and need something to compensate, reduce the nerfs severity or add something else to the character, for Hito I suggest make her HA 400 ms, and finally fixing the kick because it still seems to catch people if they dodge too early, OR give her chained heavies HA so she can shine in ganaks and have more overall mixup potential, about Raider, just fix the animation and give him back his stun, maybe make it something like gladiators so it can hides the first attack or so but cannot be chained to infinity. Thoughts. P.S I haven't been playing Raider or Hito that much recently but for Hito there are some more problems deriving from the nerfs, like Raiders GB vulnerability after a chained zone, Hitos no longer working max punish or the fact that now she can't one-shot pikemen with the damage buff in breach."

His forward dodge light, and his side dodge heavies, and lights all are 400ms. **Short Answer:** Guard top when he forward dodges and side dodge on red (either direction) when he side dodge attacks (don't back dodge because the timing for those varies from his heavy and light side dodge attacks). **Long Explanation of the Short Answer:** Guard top as soon as he forward dodges (top and side dodge attack indicators appear 400ms into dodge and cannot be delayed (look at Freeze's YouTube video on Zhanhu for proof/more explanation). His side dodge attacks can be side dodged on one timing in either direction regardless of if he's using his heavy or light attack, though the margin of error for these single timings changes from hero to hero. I tested with the slowest dodging heroes I could think up: Lawbringer, Warlord, Shugoki, and Highlander in defensive stance (DS), and tested them by setting a Zhanhu bot in training mode to do both heavy and light side dodge attacks and I side dodged as soon as I saw an attack indicator, dodging to either side randomly for 30 attempts and recorded the number on times I didn't successfully dodge it. I found that Shugoki had the narrowest dodge input timing with LB second, and both Warlord and Highlander (DS) had no problem consistently side dodging the attacks. With LB I got hit 5/30 attempts , so a 83.34% accuracy with single timing but you might have better reflexes than me and be able to do it 100% of the time. Shugoki is the only hero I had a lot of problems dodging with, I got hit 8/30 attempts that's approximately a 73.34% accuracy with dodging either direction. Highlander in DS got hit 1/30 attempts so a 96.67% dodge accuracy, and Warlord I got hit 2/30 attempts for a 93.34% dodge accuracy but both of these varied a lot and I only reported my fist attempts here so I'm just going to say you can reliably dodge it 100% of the time unless you screw up like I did cause you're human. If you have any other heroes that you know have slow dodges (not dodge recoveries) then leave a comment and I'll test them and edit this post, I'll also leave you're name at the bottom of the post and credit you for your help. **Tips and Tricks:** With any hero you can get a 100% dodge accuracy by dodging a little before the attack indicator appears (still on one timing for any of the side dodge attacks and both side dodge directions), but I don't recommend this as something to do on reaction because a good player will dodge and get you to dodge on reaction then GB you once their Zhanhu recovers and they'll land a free GB for a guaranteed 30 damage heavy, and if your hero has a dodge attack and you dodge attack on indicator to get rid of the GB vulnerability of your dodge then a good player will dodge then parry you. Overall it's too dangerous to do it unless you're reading your opponent and know that the dodge attack is coming. The only hero I would recommend going for the parry with is LB because he has the health to take a 14 damage attack if you miss and his 50 damage light parry is just too alluring to pass up (both the heavy and light side dodge attacks count as a light parry and do 14 damage, the only difference is that the heavy can execute), in which case set your guard to either side and preemptively parry when the attack will appear (the attack can't be delayed so you don't have to react to the indicator, just learn the timing in training mode), you'll either get the light parry and make him not want to dodge attack any more or you'll eat 14 damage. Shugoki may have the same health pool as LB but his light parry punish isn't high enough (30 damage heavy) to make this gamble worth it in my opinion. Also if you're low HP expect him to do the heavy cause he'll want the execution so set your guard in the direction he's dodging to and parry attempt that direction (example: if he dodges to your right set your guard right for the parry). I tried getting Highlander to dodge then kick him in offensive stance, cause Highlander's offensive stance has the fastest dodge recoveries in the game so I thought maybe I could get Zhanhu to dodge attack miss into guaranteed offensive stance heavy, I did this by setting the bot to dodge attacks and to dodge incoming attacks, I found that under a few circumstance you can guarantee a Fomorian Kick, it has to do with with early dodging the light so you recover in time and distance doesn't seem to change anything. Keep in min that I have yet to even unlock Highlander, I just mess around in the training mode, so it might be that I just don't know how to play him and I encourage any Highlander Mains to test for themselves."

But anyway, let's get into it &amp;#x200B; So first, general changes, and these are rather quick, since I don't have many ideas on how to improve stamina system. \- All characters lose their ability to block when dodging unless they have superior block dodges.

Now, for the character changes &amp;#x200B; Warden Removal of backdodge sb will remove warden's ability to negate some mixups too well. Also, his cc is currently obnoxiously high in damage and that needs a slight change \- Backdodge shoulderbash removed, as it can negate some mixups too well, making warden way too powerful. \- Shoulderbash feint timing moved later into the bash, to prevent cancelling dodge recovery \- Top crushing counter no longer guarantees any followup move, as getting 40 dmg off a crushing counter is already a very good amount of damage &amp;#x200B; Conqueror I wanted to make conqueror less threatening as a turtle, since the amount of option selects he has is disgustingly high \- Heavies no longer have superior block properties, to nerf his ability to option select \- Zone now has a startup period (idk how many ms would be sufficient, share your ideas down below please) during which you can be guardbroken out of it, to prevent using it as an option select considering he already has so many \- Opener light damage increased to 15, to slightly buff his offense to compensate for his defense nerf \- Shield basher now deals 4 damage to prevent his bash from being too strong in team modes &amp;#x200B; Peacekeeper I tried to make getting people bleeding a state pk gets something out of, more than just enhanced lights and also increase her flow \- Pk can now perform a heavy after a deep gouge or a dagger cancel, which doesn't confirm deep gouge when it hits, but becomes unblockable from the top if the opponent is bleeding, dealing 33 direct damage. Alternatively, her finisher top heavy becomes unblockable if the opponent is bleeding, and again, it doesn't confirm deep gouge, but deals 33 direct damage. She can also chain this heavy if an opponent is already bleeding and blocks the dagger cancel. While she can't softfeint her UB heavy into a dagger cancel, she can softfeint it into a guardbreak &amp;#x200B; Lawbringer He's way too good of a turtle, but currently I have no idea how to change him to make him good without being cheap, and to give him usable offence \- Dodge shove hyperarmor removed. It is way too powerful of a move, and needs a nerf \- Top light speed increased to 466ms. Interrupting people with a 400 ms neutral attack with little to no stamina cost is not a healthy mechanic and needs to go \- Impale parry no longer guaranteed after a heavy parry, guaranteed only after a light parry, range reduced. Getting 40 damage on a heavy parry even if you're miles away from a wall isn't something we want any character to do \- Top heavy parry counter now doesn't confirm the light, but it deals 37 damage. 37 damage off a light parry seems like a bit too much anyway, but we'll see how it goes. \- Health reduced to 140. Currently he is like an undamageable mountain clad in armour, punishing people for even thinking about an attack. This should let people kill him a bit faster, and make lawbringers care more about their mistakes \- EXPERIMENTAL: Heavies can be softfeinted into a shove, or into a longarm, both of which will only confirm a light. Longarm sped up to 700 ms, and given tracking to catch people dodging on a heavy. It's experimental, as it can be a bit too powerful, but it would allow LB to have more or less viable offense &amp;#x200B; Centurion I won't touch him since he's already getting an official rework. We'll see how good he is , althought he'll still need a bash punish &amp;#x200B; Gladiator Currently glads offence is nonexistent on high levels of play, as everything he does is reactable. Also gb invulnerable heavies shouldn't be a thing for most characters, and his oos punishes can be obnoxiously high at times. \- Heavies now have 400 ms gb vulnerability \- New chain : heavy light light heavy/toestab/skewer. This should let him get slightly more offensive \- All second and third lights in chains now are 400 ms but deal 13 damage. This is to make his new chain worth using \- You can no longer use throw out of skewer, to prevent his ridiculous oos throw punish \- Skewer feint timing moved by 66 ms later into the attack to make it more believable \- EXPERIMENTAL: Skewer deals 15% more damage against oos opponents, to compensate for taking away his oos throw punish &amp;#x200B; Black Prior Now that undodgeable mixups are actually a thing, I think his finisher heavies should deal a little less. \- Finisher heavies now deal 25 damage &amp;#x200B; Raider He's allright but removal of stunning tap really hurt him probably too much \- Storming tap becomes stunning tap again \- Stunning tap doesn't refresh stun duration on multiple hits. It was kinda annoying, and we have to take casual players into consideration as well. This should let him still have some viability off his stun, but keep players away from complaining about stunning tap too much. \- All chain and finisher top lights standardised to 500ms. 600 and 700 ms lights that don't have any special properties have no place in this game \- Chain zone safe on hit &amp;#x200B; Warlord I think he needs more chain pressure to actually make his enhanced lights have any purpose, and also a way to punish bashes \- Finisher heavies all deal 35 damage, become unblockable and can be softfeinted into zone to discourage dodging too early and also to use the new no-guard dodge system \- Hyperarmor starts 500 ms into heavies \- EXPERIMENTAL: Top light opener cannot be performed as a backstep attack, instead it gains SUPERARMOR 100 ms into the attack, and if warlord gets hit by a bash during this attack's 600 ms of, well, duration, it becomes unblockable, but doesn't increase in damage. Its damage is also lowered to 16 \- EXPERIMENTAL: Warlord's zone becomes unblockable after a successful parry and deals 18 damage &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Berserker I think he's well balanced. No changes here &amp;#x200B; Valkyrie Valk is considered weak. Her damage is just way too low, and her bashes are bad. This should let her be a bit more threatening. \- Bashes now properly pause stamina regeneration when opponent is oos \- All second lights in chains now are 400 ms, and all lights in general deal 15 damage \- Opener heavies now deal 30 damage \- Sweep sped up to 566 ms &amp;#x200B; Highlander His kick/caber toss mixup can be negated completely by some characters. \- Caber toss now has hyperarmour, sped up to 566 ms to catch things like conqueror's bash \- Since his mixup should be a bit better now, I think that it shouldn't guarantee 40 dmg, therefore, his offensive heavies now deal 33 damage \- EXPERIMENTAL: Opener lights now are 500 ms and enhanced \- EXPERIMENTAL: Can follow up a missed kick with a celtic curse to try to catch early rolls, although I'm not sure if this would work considering celtic curse's speed, and the fact many won't roll against a kick &amp;#x200B; Shaman I don't think she needs changes. &amp;#x200B; Jormungandr Jorm is problematic and unhealthy currently. Getting an opponent oos on just one heavy parry is definitely a bad thing that needs to go, in exchange for some actual viability. He could use a complete rework, but I'll try to fix him without giving him one \- Dodges can now be cancelled with a neutral bash, to catch people backdodging his unblockables and give him a way to punish bashes like toestab or BP's shield bash \- Side heavies now deal 27 damage, to compensate for less stamina damage \- Serpent smite sped up to 900 ms to make more useful in general \- Neutral bash sped up to 566ms to make it slightly harder to dodge \- All bashes (except for parry counter) deal 10 less stamina damage (could be more if it's not enough to make him healthier) \- EXPERIMENTAL: Make all his bashes deal 7 damage \- EXPERIMENTAL: Hammar slam has lower recovery (I don't know what its recoveries are on a successful hammar slam, but I want to prevent it from being free damage for too long) \- EXPERIMENTAL: Hammar slam makes jorm take 10% less damage while performing the move (obviously to make this move not get you instakilled) \- EXPERIMENTAL: Jormungandr's zone becomes unblockable after a successful parry, and deals 18 damage &amp;#x200B; Kensei Kensei is not bad, but not great either. His opener is there, but it's very telegraphed and slow enough for people to interrupt him on reaction \- Top heavy opener sped up, maybe 866 ms would be good to stop people from just lighting him out of his mixup? Share your opinions on this one please \- Top heavy finisher sped up to 1000 ms. Raider's zone deals pretty much the same damage, isn't locked as a 3rd attack in a chain and is 1000 ms, so I see no reason for kensei to have a 1200 ms unblockable. It's slightly too slow. \- Dodge attack sped up to 500 ms (or left the same if it can punish 700 ms recovery bashes already) &amp;#x200B; Shugoki Shugoki could be a good character, but due to him being slow, and having no roll catching abilities, he can be easily countered. I think his hug should still reward you with a guardbreak on a correct read, but rolling away and still getting a punish is definitely not a good thing, as it promotes turtling. Also, he lacks a way to punish bashes, and in my opinion everyone should be allowed to do that \- New chain: Light into light, to make his headbutt slightly more useful \- Headbutt stun duration increased to 1500 ms to make it worth using a bit more \- Headbutt sped up to 533 ms (or could be 500 ms if it won't make it slightly too strong) \- Headbutt now deals 10 damage, to make it more useful \- Demon's embrace now has 900 ms recovery \- Crushing thunder can be performed out of neutral, input being dodge forward + heavy. It should let Shugoki catch rolls \- EXPERIMENTAL: Demon's embrace is now 700 ms \- EXPERIMENTAL: Shugoki can perform a new move called superior guardbreak. It has superarmour, and It doesn't function as an actual guardbreak, unless a bash hits you while the move is active. It performs a guardbreak then, catching the opponent in the bashes' recovery, but automatically performs an opener light off of it, to prevent his punish from being too damaging. If he uses the move and doesn't get hit with any bash, it has no GB vulnerability, but has 700 ms dodge and block recovery \- EXPERIMENTAL: Shugoki's zone becomes unblockable after a successful parry, and deals 18 damage. Although you could use your heavy with haymaker, the opponnet you are locked onto could still parry it, making it unsafe. &amp;#x200B; Orochi He lacks a real opener, so he basically has to turtle currently. and that's not fun to do and to play against. Also as previously mentioned gb invulnerable heavies need to go in most cases \- Top heavy now has 400 ms gb vulnerability. Orochi already has his zone as a good option select. \- Storm rush deals 15 damage to balance its changes below \- Side storm rush attacks (both left and right) are now 400 ms, with 66 ms hidden indicator to make it unreactable and give orochi more pressure from neutral \- Top storm rush sped up to 466 ms to catch people who try to dodge out of storm rush, and also to utilise no-block dodges better now \- Storm rush costs 20 stamina to enter, but doesn't consume more stamina when you hit your opponent. If it's supposed to be orochi's opener it can't eat 1/3 of his stamina when used \- Feinting storm rush costs 15 stamina, same with missing it. Same reason as above \- Finisher side lights sped up to 433 ms to make them slightly more useful &amp;#x200B; Nobushi Nobushi's problem is similar to glads'. She can't really do anything besides turtling. Her HS is useless offensively, while it could be used as a unique way to deal damage, and that's what I'm trying to achieve here \- Hidden stance lights now have superior block property. If superior block activates they deal 15 damage + 10 bleed damage \- Hidden stance kick is now 500 ms, the chain one is sped up to 533 ms &amp;#x200B; Shinobi Shinobi's in a weird spot now. He's only usable through turtling, even though the idea for him was a cool concept with lots of acrobatics and such. Also, he is way too squishy, to the point of being unusable at times \- Health increased to 120 \- Finisher heavies now deal 25 damage to balance their changes below \- Lights no longer guarantee a light on hit \- Light finishers sped up to 400 ms \- Opener heavies no longer guarantee a followup 10 damage light, but can be followed up with a light finisher \- Lights after double dodge are now 400 ms and count as openers. It makes double dodge slightly more useful \- Can perform a 400ms light opener after a front roll to give this move any purpose really \- Heavies after a front roll are finishers, and are unblockable. Same reasons as above \- Ranged GB has a proper external indicator now, to make it less op in ganks \- EXPERIMENTAL: New attack: Ranged light. Input is to charge a heavy and then use a light attack. Deal 12 damage, are 400 ms. Can be performed after a backflip. Chains into forward roll. I feel it could be a bit too much, but I'd love to hear your opinions down below &amp;#x200B; Aramusha Aramusha is currently ok, but he's too good of a turtle with his high punishes and gb invulnerable heavies. Also his blade blockade should be more useful with guaranteed damage, but not too strong either. He also needs a bash punisher \- Heavies now have proper 400 ms of gb vulnerability. I don't think anybody besides conqueror should have gb invulnerable heavies \- All heavy finisher damage reduced by 10, meaning top heavy finishers now deal 30, and side ones deal 35. \- Side heavy opener damage decreased to 35 damage. Aramusha's damage was just way too high overall and it needed a nerf \- All deadly feint attacks' damage changed to 17, since an unreactable attack shouldn't deal 20 damage, even if locked behind a chain \- Top heavy opener's speed increased to 700 ms, to prevent too high parry punishes \- Blade blockade doesn't confirm a kick, but it still can be used after it. Its range is reduced, but the kick itself deals 10 damage. The kick chains into a confirmed 300 ms followup 8 damage light, or a 600 ms heavy for 20 damage, but the heavy is only confirmed on a wallsplat. It gives aramusha a mixup out of his blade blockade, which won't be completely devastating in terms of damage but still pressurise the opponent \- Blade blockade's top heavy followup is now 300 ms to make sure it can punish all attacks. Its damage is reduced to 25. \- Blade blockade can now counter bashes, confirming a kick. &amp;#x200B; Hitokiri She's currently very strong, but she could use some tweaking here and there, as well as a dodge attack \- Chain heavies now have hyperarmour at the earliest possible timing of 500 ms into the attack. As a master of hyperarmour and a relentless attacker, these should have some purpose, while currently they have none \- Kick confirms a light opener. Her mixup won't be as menacing right now, but still strong nonetheless \- Sweep confirms a heavy now. Same reason as above \- Zone and forward dodge attack all chain now. Such attacks should chain, and many people talked about it before \- Hitokiri can perform a heavy 500 ms dodge attack, hitting her opponent with the blunt side of the masakari axe with great force, dealing 25 stamina damage, stunning for 1000 ms and dealing 12 damage. Counts as a chain opener \- EXPERIMENTAL: Hitokiri's zone becomes unblockable after a successful parry, dealing 18 damage. This is a global change to heavy characters, so they can be better at antiganking. &amp;#x200B; Tiandi He's a master of dodges and flow, but he's a bit lackluster overall \- Tiger dodge now has 200 ms of iframes. This is needed as currently it has none, and being a dodge attack, if initiated too early it won't actually dodge anything at all \- Kick now deals 10 damage on its own, and is sped up to 700 ms. 700 ms bash is still perfectly reactable, so I see no harm in speeding it up, and at the same time it will now have some damage pressure, even if it will still be small \- Dragon dodge has 200 ms more iframes, meaning they last until 300 ms before the impact \- Superior block on Tiger dodge now starts 200 ms into the attack and lasts until the end of it, to make his crushing counters slightly better &amp;#x200B; Jiang Jun Despite having a great dodge attack in terms of iframes, he doesn't have a way to actually punish bashes. Also his parry punishes can be a tad too high \- Sifu stance now has 100 ms earlier iframes, meaning they last from 100ms to 500ms into the move. This is to let his bash punish work properly \- Sifu stance can be initiated from blockstun. It's to make it possible to punish chain bashes \- Sifu's swirl can be performed 200 ms into the sifu stance animation, and its speed is increased to 500 ms. Its damage is reduced to 17. This allows JJ to punish bashes and some other attacks, making Sifu's stance useful \- Dou Shi's swirl's damage reduced to 18 damage. I think it's a good number for heavy parries, as more could be too much at times \- Choke no longer confirms a zone on anybody, no matter their guard side before the parry. It still can wallsplat though, as I think its' range is so small it isn't that unbalanced. Getting so much stamina damage and 25 damage off a heavy parry seriously seems unhealthy \- Shin kick can now be performed from a top heavy as well. This makes it harder to interrupt him on reaction, as the dodge forward has a distinct animation. \- Hyperarmour starts 500 ms into the heavy attack now. 600 ms is way too late for hyperarmour to activate into an attack \- Unblockable finishers given proper tracking now. Right now they can be backdodged and there's nothing jj can do about it &amp;#x200B; Nuxia Her traps make her heavies safe to parry, but are reactable and can actually be punished too well \- Deflect becomes unblockable, deals 35 damage. Blockable deflects shouldn't be a thing, considering how much risk you take to perform them \- Heavy attack traps are 333 ms, deal 14 damage to make them a useful but unique mechanic, and to balance their new speed with lower damage \- Zone attack changed to a 500 ms attack with a new animation, can be softfeinted into a trap as well. \- EXPERIMENTAL: Heavy finishers are unblockable, but can't be hard feinted. Can still be softfeinted into a trap &amp;#x200B; Shaolin Shaolin is ok, but he struggles to get into his mixups. These changes should make him a bit more viable \- Enhanced top light to get into his qi stance easier \- Undodgeable heavy from qi stance has iframes and deals 25 damage. Since its current damage would be too much for the no-block dodges, it needed a damage nerf, but at the same time I feel it should give him an option to dodge out of qi stance \- Top heavy speed increased to 900ms, deals 30 damage. 25 for a light parry is slightly too little, at least currently \- Deflect damage increased to 30 damage. A 25 damage deflect is probably one of the worst deflects in terms of damage out there, and it definitely could use a small buff \- Sun Kick Sweep sped up to 600 ms and can no longer be revenge parried. It should make him slightly more useful in team modes, and even allow for catching people off guard in duels \- EXPERIMENTAL: Can now enter qi stance after a successful kick followup light attack, &amp;#x200B; Zhanhu Zhanhu could be perfect on release, but he isn't. He needs very minor changes though \- Finishers sped up by 66 ms (now they would be 533 and 833 respectively) It makes the ""mixup"" a real mixup, as it was intended \- Improved tracking on side unblockables. This is to ensure he will catch mistimed dodges better \- Dodge cancel after opener can occur 166 ms after the attack. Right now his dodge cancels feel very clunky and delayed, and I think he should have any flow. His dodge cancels after a dodge attack are unchanged. \- Superior block ""Deflect"" now deals 18 fire damage in addition to its current effects. A deflect that doesn't guarantee anything at all shouldn't exist \- Dodge attacks can be input from 200ms to 400ms into the dodge , and have 200 ms of iframes. Currently they can be parried too easily, and them not having iframes makes them bad in certain situations &amp;#x200B; Please share your opinions about all of this down below. Remeber, that changes marked as EXPERIMENTAL are more or less, as the name suggests, an experiment, as I'm not entirely sure about them. And also please remember I'm not a tournament player, but I'd love this game to be more balanced and for all heroes to be viable in all modes, and that's what I was trying to achieve here"
104,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A big Shinobi rework using only his existing moves,1,ea9x7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ea9x7y/a_big_shinobi_rework_using_only_his_existing_moves/,2019-12-14 08:09:23,"**This is a pretty long post. TL;DR at the bottom.** Shinobi is kinda fucky right now. He's both weak because of his lack of offense and frustrating to play against because of his overly strong defense and high punishes. That's just about the worst two things a hero could be. He needs a looottt of changes, so this is gonna be a long post, but I tried to keep suggestions restricted to a rework that does not add or remove any moves requiring new animations. ### The Goals * Improve+encourage his approaches/strafes (front roll, side dodges) over his retreats (back dodge, back flip) * Retool his annoying moves - ranged attacks and retreats in particular * Encourage aggressive offense - make him a character who tries to end the fight fast with sustained, reliable offense * Give his bleed a purpose that encourages aggression ### Misc Changes * The double dodge (henceforth DD) cannot be a back dodge so you cannot use it to create distance * DD stamina cost reduced to 12. This will important to his sustained offense as new ways to use DD will be introduced, as well as new offense from DD, making it an initation tool * DD attacks can now be used from 200ms into the second dodge. Allows Shinobi to access his offense from it better without buffing his defense much * Forward DD recovery is now 400ms to encourage using it to approach * Charging stance is now GB vulnerable and has 300ms of exit vulnerability. This should fix the safety of the charged heavy option select. In addition, you must hold the button for at least 200ms for the charge to begin, so charged heavies don't interfere with neutral heavies. This also removes quad dodge. * New hero specific: Opportunist. Bleed lowers an opponent's damage by 15% and Shinobi's stamina costs by 20% (only applies while locked on to the bleeder). Makes Shinobi's offense somewhat safer while the opponent is bled, thereby encouraging aggression. New ways to bleed opponents will be added * Last hit of zone is now 18 bleed damage * Instead of a million entries for backflip/front roll in his moveset: have a simple hero-specific item dedicated to which moves can be followup up with front roll, back flip, and DD cancels (discussed below) * Shinobi can now cancel the recoveries of certain attacks with the DOUBLE dodge * To lay them out: DD cancels can be used after any light, non-ranged heavy, or forward roll; forward roll is useable after any ranged heavy or as a softfeint from a ranged heavy, in addition to from charging stance; backflip is usable after DD kick, **opener** light and heavy, and Shadow Strike ### Chain attacks * First light damage is now 12 (from 14). Guaranteed light damage is 6 (from 10); non-guaranteed light damage is still 14, but it is 400ms. * Side heavies are now 800ms. Damage is 28 (from 30). Still guarantees the followup light. Top heavy is 32 damage (from 30), still 900ms * Heavy finisher is now undodgeable. Damage decreased - intial hit is 25 (from 35), and each hit of Sickle Rain is 1+5 bleed (from 2+4) (43 damage total) * Heavies are no longer sped up by 100ms under certain circumstances (currently does so on GB &amp; after double dash) * Recovery on lights and non-ranged heavies can be canceled by the **double** dash only. Does not include Sickle Rain lights These changes rebalance Shinobi's wayyy overturned damage that contributed to his defensive playstyle, and addition to creating further opportunities for offense with the added bleed and recovery cancels. Let's talk about the DD now: ### Dash attacks * Kick is now **500ms from all sides.** * DD light and heavy now have 100ms of hidden indicator. * Lights are undodgeable after DD to catch people trying to dodge the kick * As mentioned above, DD attacks can be used after 200ms of dodge for better initiation This gives Shinobi viable offense out of a double dodge. The kick/light isnow a mixup, and the DD lights themselves are made difficult to react to with the hidden indicator. ### Forward Roll and Followups * Now has iframes from 100ms-end and immediate 100ms recovery to block and DD (makes the approach safer). Note that dodging after a roll results in the *double* dodge specifically * Can be done after any ranged heavy that isn't parried, or as a softfeint from a ranged heavy (the quick recovery to block/dodge is so you don't roll yourself into an opponent's parry attempt if you use this softfeint) * Front roll kick's recovery can be canceled by DD * Knockback range on front roll kick decreased such that forward DD kick and light can land (not heavy) * Forward roll can now be followup up with light openers with 100ms hidden indicator * Forward roll and its followups can all be target switched - ie you can hit one person with a ranged heavy, roll towards another, then attack a third The changes made to forward roll and its followups are to encourage players to use it after a ranged heavy rather than stay at a safe distance. The hidden indicator on his lights make this worth doing, and the undodgeable heavy finisher makes it risky to dodge the kick. In addition, the kick itself can now be followed up with a DD to access its offensive options if it successfully lands, giving the move more utility. ### Back Flip and Followups * Can be done on: DD kick, first light, any non-ranged heavy, and Shadow Strike * Same followups, but changes to those followups are discussed below. Simply restricting when thid can be used to limit its usefulness, as it now requires you to forego some damage to use it. This makes the move mostly from providing safety when getting a quick hit in during team fights ### Ranged heavies * As mentioned above, can now be softfeinted into forward roll by inputting a forward dodge * Both are now 700ms (The second was slowed down to accomodate the softfeint). Neither can be hard feinted. Deals 20dmg (from 23) * Range lowered by 20% - maybe more. Whatever makes it so Shinobi has to be reasonably close to the action to use this move * Can still chain if the heavy is blocked * Now have 100ms GB vulnerability * Shinobi is no longer unbalanced, but only pulled in when a ranged heavy is parried, allowing only a heavy parry punish Make the moves safer to be worth using, but also weaker to be less frustrating. Tbh i think the range would need to be nerfed more, as being attacked by someone you can't see is incredibly frustrating, but I didn't want to outright remove anything. Hopefully different values can be trialed in Testing Grounds. Perhaps they can also feed extra revenge so they have to be used tactfully. ### Ranged GB Now here's a tricky one. I don't want to outright remove it, as generally I'm against removing things that can be improved instead. That being said, despite the fact that I'm going to suggest changes, outright removal of this would be a viable solution because... i mean, it's ranged GB * Range GB now has a proper indicator and doesn't ignore revenge armor * Range lowered by 20% * Landing a ranged GB now just leads to a mixup: Shadow Strike Alt (his parry followup), which can be dodged but not blocked (think old LB shove), and does 5 direct + 15 bleed dmg; or the heavy finisher, which recall is now undodgeable. * If dodged, the light (Shadow Strike) cannot be punished - has Tenebris Rising-like recovery * Alternatively, Shinobi can use his Teleport Kick - the deflect followup - to kick them behind him. Guaranteed, but guarantees nothing, except on wallsplat. Done by pressing GB. * Now 500ms * CGB behaves the same as the ranged heavy parry mentioned above This nerfs ranged GB by making it not guarantee the crazy high damage and CC that ot currently does. It is now safer and only guarantees a mixup so that Dhinobi isn't immediately rewarded for landing it, which often requires defensive/campy play. In addition either options deals some bleed damage, which encourages aggression due to the added hero-specific Opportunist. ### Parry and Deflect Followups * Shadow Strike (parry followup) is now 5+15 bleed (from 29? Bleed). Input window is now delayable similar to LB's light riposte, which allows you to wait until an OOS opponent starts falling to hit * Deflect now does 5 direct and 15 bleed damage * The light followup is now 5 direct and 13 bleed damage. This means using the light followup results in 10 direct and 28 bleed damage, 38dmg total * The kick followup is still guaranteed, and does 35 stamina damage. Increased recovery to attack so it does not confirm a ranged heavy, but you can still throw one - and of course, softfeint it into forward roll. The ranged heavy is guaranteed on wallsplat. * Kick no longer knocks down when in revenge Shinobi's punishes and absolutely BONKERS right now, so some nerfs are much needed. The numbers speak for themselves. ### Feats * Nukekubi now works on blocked attacks as well as successful bashes (20 stam for a landed bash). Lights now recover 12 stamina, and heavies now recover 20. Gains are reduced by half on block. * Yama Uba life leech increased to 35% (from 25%) * Shooting stars can no longer shotgun someone - damage capped at 40 per individual Nukekubi is pretty useless on Shinobi right now. It's been buffed to reward Shinobi for going on the offense, whether than pffense is successful or not, allowing him to sustain pressure and secure quick kills. Yama Uba is given a leech in between its old and new value. In all these changes will allow Shinobi a multitude of options at every point by giving him numerous choices from a double dodge or forward roll that can be sustained afterwards with recovery cancels. Hopefully if any of these ideas are implemented they can properly unskew his defense:offense ratio. ### Summary * Lights are now 12 damage; guaranteed light is 6, non-guaranteed is 14 * Side heavy opener and finisher now 28 damage 800ms. Top heavy opener now 30 damage. Sickle rain lights are all 1+5 bleed * Side heavy openers now 800ms. Heavy finisher now undodgeable and 25dmg * All lights (except sickle rain) and the heavy opener can have their recovery canceled by the **double** dash * Double dodge attacks now have 100ms of hidden indicator * Double dodge attacks can now be used 200ms into the double dodge * Double dodge kick now 500ms from all sides * Double dodge lights undodgeable after double dodge for mixup with kick * Forward roll now has iframes from 100ms-end and very quick recovery to block and dodge * Front roll kick now does 35 stam damage. Knockback decreased. Recovery cancelable with DD. * Front roll can be used after any ranged heavy that isn't parried or as a softfeint from ranged heavies * Ranged heavies are now both 700ms 20dmg. Chain on block. Not hard-feintable. * Front roll can now be followed up with light openers as well with 100ms of hidden indicator * Front roll and followups can be properly target switched * Back flip can now be used only after: Kick, opener lights/heavy, and Shadow Strike * All ranged attacks have range lowered by 20% * When ranged attacks are parried/CGB'd, Shinobi is simply pulled in for a heavy parry punish * Ranged GB now guaranteed a mixup: Shadow Strike alt, which can be dodged but not blocked, or the heavy finisher * Alternatively, can use Teleport Kick for 35 stam damage. Guarantees uncharged ranged heavy ONLY on wallsplat. * Teleport kick no longer knocks down in revenge * Shadow strike is now 5+15 bleed * Deflect is not 5+15 bleed, and the light followup is now 5+8 bleed (33 total) * Nukekubi now works on blocked attacks as well. Heavies give 20 stamina, lights give 12, bashes give 20. Halved on block * Shooting stars damage capped at 40 per individual * Yama Uba life leech increased to 35% Wow that's a lot."

Such change would almost remove zone option selects from the game and it would be probably easier to implement into the game than fix input issues when light+heavy count as parry attempt. What do you think about that?
106,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Putting Nobushi back in the game,1,eci73u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/eci73u/putting_nobushi_back_in_the_game/,2019-12-19 07:34:26,"# ####Hidden Stance - Hidden stance will now affect the indicator of all attacks. - Hidden stance now only hides 33ms (was 100ms) of all attack indicators. - Hidden stance loses GB vulnerability once all I-frames end. (500ms into HS) - Can soft feint all heavies (changed from just neutral heavies) into HS in a 200-400ms variable window (from 200ms) &gt; Author Notes: Hidden stance now has an extra use besides being a dodge - itll provide a temple of options for Nobushi - she has her high range undodgeable heavies that allow her to stop opponents from dodging her HS, her top lights to get damage in if they backdodge without guard on top, and to stop one from dodging her lights with ease. Her heavies having a variable window of soft feint into HS will make this feature actually useful - as you could bait someone with a delayed soft feint into HS into a parry. HS losing GB vulnerability allows her to stay in stance without being punished for it - so you are able to hold it in a teamfight and not get immediately punished. &gt; &gt; The indicator shroud of 33ms will now affect all attacks from HS, including those started from a dodge - meaning its much easier and rewarding for the Nobu to actually attack out of this stance, rather than to use it as nothing but a double dodge. ####Light Attacks - Side lights in chain are 400ms (from 500ms) - Top light chain is now 466ms (from 500ms) and is now undodgeable. &gt; Author Notes: These changes to her lights are intended to further her chain pressure - and even more so in HS. Undodgeable top light means you cannot freely backdodge the stance, though static guard heroes 'can' guard top and backdodge. Also stops the dilemma of a hero like JJ who has his lights parried as they do not share the consistent UB property his heavies do. ####Heavy Attacks - Chain heavies are undodgeable (seeing as theyve made it pseudo-undodgeable with the range changes, this will cement that.) &gt; Author Notes: Hidden stance will now have a multitude of undodgeable options, meaning you can easily mixup and trick an opponent into parrying your light attack undodgeables. Her chain heavies aren't easily pointed out by this change, as vipers retreat and her chain top light are undodgeable too. ####New Chains - L H H chain added - H H H chain added. - Third heavy is the exact same in terms of damage and properties to the second heavy. (35 damage, undodgeable.) &gt; Author Notes: The third indicator (counting her double lights as a single move) is always a light, so adding x x H chains is direly needed, which allows for Nobushi to actually throw more attacks once her 'main' chain is over. This also provides additional flow - Nobu is able to sneak back into HS if she has the stamina at this point, and 'restart' her combo. ####Dodge Attacks - Sidewinder has actual I-frames, rather than being a dodge cancel, giving them an easier timing for usage on dodges. - Vipers retreat is now undodgeable. - Cobra Strike is an actual chain starter. (Didnt chain into heavies before.) - Cobra Strike is now 500ms. (from 600ms). &gt; Author Notes: This will give Nobushi flow - retaining both her dodge cancelling nature with her dodge lights (cobra strike), whilst speeding these up - allowing for them to land easily from neutral. The ability to chain out of them will add further flow to Nobushis kit, so shell be able to attack without going back into neutral. Sidewinder having I-frames will make them into a tool thats actually worth using a teamfight as itd have relative safety, comparative to Kensei, or Shamans dodge attack in one. This will allow for Nobushi to be much more user friendly at the lower levels too. Vipers retreat as an undodgeable causes Nobushi to have the tools to punish people spacing her on a read from neutral, whilst also being able to be used quickly from HS, so one cannot truly backdodge her stance. ####Kick Changes - Kick is now 533ms (from 566ms). - Kick GB recovery lowered to 600ms. (from 900ms). - Kick Dodge recovery lowered to 700ms (from 900ms). &gt; Author Notes: Theres no reason to keep bashes above 500ms when new characters exist. Thisll cause her kick to be a tool that one must dodge moreso on prediction, rather than reaction - especially from HS, where the indicator will be 500ms. Combined with her undodgeables, this will increase her pressure from HS and in chains dramatically, but not so much in chain as to allow for her to only rely upon kick. GB recovery has been lowered to cause GB punishes to come from prediction dodges - which can be combated on read from a Nobushi with delaying her kick. ####Zone Attack - Zone attack second strike is unblockable. - Zone attack second strike can be soft feinted into a dodge/HS. - Zone attack second strike is sped up to 700ms (from 900ms) (Not too sure on this one) - Zone attack second strike bleed stacks. - Zone attack second strike damage increased to 5+20b. (From 1+20b). &gt; Author Notes: Half of Nobushis zone has always been good, but the second half has consistently dragged it down. With these changes - itll now apply decent pressure, with Nobushi being able to move into her kit, or dodge cancel into an attack, providing some much needed pressure in 1s. Itll also remedy a bug that the developers either overlooked - or intentionally made. ####Recoveries - Starter light miss recovery (for blocking) adjusted to 600ms (from 700ms) - Starter light miss recovery (for dodging) adjusted to 600ms (from 900ms) - Zone attack second strike recovery can be cancelled with a dodge cancel. - Dodge now branches to Sidewinder from 100ms to 400ms (from 200ms to 400ms - this brings back her old flow, which is direly needed) - Dodge now branches to Cobra Strike from 100ms to 400ms (from 200ms to 400ms) - Sidewinder recovery now branches to Dodge, Retreating Viper, and Kick starting at 400ms (from 500ms) &gt; Author Notes: The much needed revert to her flow changes - this should fix and even improve what it was, compared to previously (due to the increase in windows, from 200ms variable, to a 300ms variable). Constant chaining will leave you GB vulnerable to enemies that you arent hitting. Nobushi previously had the issue of her lights leaving her incredibly vulnerable - so much so that you could feint a buffered heavy after, and have a shorter recovery. ####Quality of Life changes - Make her external heavies horizontal, allowing for easier unlocked attacks on minions/pikemen for the general playerbase. (currently right then top, make it right then right or right then left) - Give her [Off-Target Enhanced Attacks](URL (This will help with a few fringe cases - but this should be enabled on every character (currently isnt for 9 of them, and Nobu is among one of them.) &gt; Author Notes: This is a change thatll help her slightly in breach and in the dominion mid lane at lower levels - there is no reason to keep chained attacks while unlocked on a top guard, as they have the smallest hitboxes in terms of width, and all of hers now deal the same damage. ####Swift Recoil - Swift Recoil is reimplemented. - Swift Recoil is now used after hitting an enemy's guard. - Swift Recoil gives 200ms of iframes from usage. - Swift Recoil is used via the feint key, rather than the dodge key. - Swift Recoil's recovery can be cancelled with her dodges or cancelled into HS. - Distance moved by Swift Recoil is now 66% of what it used to be. - Removed the stamina pause of Swift Recoil. &gt; Author notes: Swift recoil used to be a completely dead move - even shown by Ubi with their inability to rework it into an actual move, as they instead opted to completely remove it. The move will now function as something Nobu can use to space in fours - giving her a healthy amount of I-frames rather than just distance (previously youd get hit whilst using this move). The ability to dash cancel and HS cancel allows for chaining more i-frames, in exchange for GB vulnerability. Again, allowing for her to quickly space against her opponent(s), allowing the zoner character to actually maintain a healthy distance - dictating where she wants to be in the fight. Changing the usage key to the feint key means that it will never be used on accident - unlike the previous version."
107,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Bash Changes: Open Guard State,1,ed4ty7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ed4ty7/bash_changes_open_guard_state/,2019-12-20 15:09:31,"Strap on in, or just skip to your main or most hated hero then run down to the comment section to say ""You gutted my main and made the most annoying hero OP"". Anywho, here's a reworking of bash and bash mixups of most of For Honor as of now to make them more interesting to play with (not necessarily buffing nor nerfing them). Most of them are fairly similar, so you dont need to read everything. **ALSO DISCLAIMER:** Likely NONE of this is ever going to be implemented, and as such this is mostly just speculative and wistful thinking. As such, there is no need to call u/Seraphendipity an idiot and retard just for writing this. That said, constructive criticism and such is welcome and enjoyable to discuss. Afterall, like all suggestions, it's mostly a bouncing board of ideas that, hopefully, a dev may accidentally see one day and think ""huh, that's a neat idea"" and see about putting it in Testing Grounds or such. Also note, Cent is assumed his rework as seen in Testing Grounds. ## Open Guard State * Cannot block for 1033ms (or until action taken or knocked out of it), 300ms delay to dodge. Instead of guaranteeing a light, bashes do small confirmed damage (5-10) and then put an opponent into an ""open-guard state"", where they cannot block and must take an active defense. As such, the followup light, guardbreak (to catch early dodges) and heavy from the opponent is now a mixup. This is similar to LB's old shove, albeit buffed a bit to make it viable. --- ## Bashes changes to Open-Guard Bashes Unless otherwise noted, these bashes put the opponent into an open-guard state (cannot block, but otherwise able to do anything else), do 5 confirmed damage, and allow the attacker to attack (chain, opener, or finisher is character dependent), dodge, full-block/special dodge, zone, guardbreak, or return to neutral by feinting. * **Lawbringer** * Shove - chains to mid-chain * **Conqueror** * FDodge Bash - 5dmg confirmed, chains to infinite * Mid-Chain Bash - 12 dmg * Softfeint Bash- 12dmg, now wallsplats similar to Mid-Chain Bash. * **Tiandi** * Palm Strike - chains to finishers, 500ms in chain * **Cent** * smol punch - 10 confirmed damage (due to being significantly slower, 800ms), stuns * Kick (from FDodge and after Parry Knee Counter) - 10 confirmed damage, wallsplats to confirm uncharged heavy (25dmg) * Post-Parry Grapple Knee - 10 dmg, wallsplats * **Warden** * Smol Shoulder Bash - chains to openers (small dmg still due to heavy being significantly more damaging than Cent) * **Jormy** * Neutral/Chain Bash - chains to finishers (extra spicy due to undodgeable; still does stamina damage) * **BP** * All Bashes (FDodge Bash, Chain Bash, Heavy Softfeint, Zone) - chains to finishers (extra spicy due to undodgeable) * **Valk** * Shield Bashes (not sweep) * **Gladiator** * Zone - 5dmg, opens guard, possibly allow chain to other attacks (such as skewer or chain heavy) * Sucker Punches - 10 confirmed damage, still only chains to heavy (which is now essentially ""unblockable"" due to open-guard state). * Deflect against Wall Punch - perhaps one of the most obscure moves in the game, but give it 20dmg plus open-guard state and 40stam damage for the damage tradeoff and dificult in using. * **JJ** * shin-Kick, would be nice to chain to openers instead of finishers but either is fine. * **Kensei** * pommelstrike - 10dmg, stun; chains to second attack, allow on all top heavies (even finisher, to counter those try to Hyper armor through) * **Warlord** * Headbutt from FDodge and Full block counter (extra spicy with undodgeable zone to counter dodging, or going from headbutt into fullblock into undodgeable heavy); possibly allow chaining to a 15dmg ""stab"" bash that doesn't open-guard and chains normally to finishers from there (mixupable with zone and GB), or he can just chain to finisher heavy. * Parry Counter - 15dmg, stuns, opens guard and allows the same aforementioned stab/zone mixup. * **Raider** * Fireman Carry - if possible, make his forward charge attack (both on ground drops and wallsplats) put them in an open-guard state (instead of confirming light/zone); wallsplat knee does 15dmg and stun. * On Valentines day, please add a quick and possibly ugly/crude animation to change it to a bridal carry with rosebuds coming off him as he carries them. * **Shaman** * Headbutt - confirms 7dmg, still wallsplats to allow heavy, allow faster chaining for Shaman (and thus less hitstun on opponent too). * **Shinobi** * Double Dodge Kick - confirms 15dmg, opens guard to allow non-guaranteed ranged heavy to hit, ranged heavy can be hardfeinted or softfeintfeinted into ranged GB, to complete the mini-mixup the ranged GB can be delayed to wait for them to dodge. * Frontroll Kick - 20 damage, possibly chain to the same aforementioned ranged mixup. * Deflect Kick - 10dmg, goes into ranged mixup. It'd be nice to give either his side-heavy-finishers undodgeable property or make his ranged GB catch dodges (though that'd look wonky, so likely just have players delay the GB). * **Nobushi** * Thicc Kicc - 8dmg, chains to her doublebleed light or heavy finisher (or zone, dodge, HS, etc.); Nobushi's zone is now undodgeable; can chain to zone mid-chain/after the chain ends; dodge heavies buffed to be 66ms faster, undodgeable; kick nerfed to 700ms (between current 600ms and original 800ms, to look less wonky), feintable. * **Shugoki** * Headbutt - 10dmg, stuns, opens guard (thus making neutral uncharged heavy a threat), hardfeintable, softfeintable to Demon's Embrace (hold or doubletap bash?) * **Aramusha** * Ring the Bell - 10dmg (already does iirc), opens--guard, PLEASE change the damage to happen on the *bop*, not the grab (looks so wonky when you die from the grab, not the bop). Accessible as softfeint from Top Heavy Finisher. * On Valentines day, change the animation to either hug the opponent, scruff their hair, or give them a brofist. * **Shaolin** * Qi Stance Kick - 10 dmg, opens-guard, flows into Qi Stance heavies (UB top, Undodgeable Sides) and sweep, except the lights, which go into the infinite (and thus if hit, allow chaining back to Qi, mixupable with the Qi side heavies due to open guard); Sweep - hardfeintable, still just confirms light as it does now (can't think of anything better). ## Notes on Other Bashes Bashes that *don't* go into open-guard stance (just notes on how they could be changed and made better). * **Glad** * Toestab - Still does its regular 10 dmg and that's it; perhaps buff to 15 dmg. * **Conq** * Sprint Bash - still just knocks down. Honestly it'd be nice for his bashes to be reworked such that the sprint bash is 20 dmg and chargeable from mid-chain and softfeint bash, but his sprint bash is just a normal FDodge bash (sprint attacks can't be too powerful, especially bash-types). * **Hito** * idk. I think leave her alone, but potentially make her kick a powerful hitter (20 dmg, slightly more powerful to compensate for her sweep being weaker than Warden or Cent's fullcharges) and put them in the Open-Guard State similar to Cent, and leave her sweep be to only confrim her a light. * **Warden** * Big Boi Shoulder - still confirms heavy, though nerfed to only confirm side heavy for 30dmg instead of top for 40. Alternatively, his bash can be the same all around and doesnt increase in power-- charging just lets you catch dodges and such. Ideally, his shoulder bash would just be a fast 500ms bash that cant be charged and doesnt do much just to be used every now and then in chain, but he gets a mordhau strike bash that does some heavy confirmed damage that essentially replaces what his shoulder bash is now. * **Cent** * Big Boi Punch - bash still knocks down as usual; ideally does 15 damage itself, and the buff to 45 dmg in his rework changed back to the current 35 dmg. Alternatively, his charged punch does 25dmg and goes into open guard state instead of knocking down the opponent, unless they're Out of Stamina, in which case his charged punch and kick knock down and confirm a 45dmg Eagle's Talon (which also restores stamina, to be fair to the opponent, and to Centurion) -- gives his knockdown less ease of use compared to Jorm, but potentially more damage with the punch and such. * **Tiandi** * Kick (after Heavy) - buffed to deal 20-25 dmg on impact (add cracked rib sound effect), accessible (non-guranteed) after GB throw, otherwise unchanged. * **Lawbringer** * Longarm of the Law - given superarmor, or ideally a new trait, bash armor (only armors through bashes, not regular attacks), essentially being his ""pancake flip"" like BP. * **Shaman** * Bite Attack - nothing to add except that it would be nice if it did less damage and more healing, and it scales more with how much bleed is on the opponent. * On Valentines day, she jumps on them and sweetly hugs them, before giving them a small kiss (which does the damage and heal). * **Highlander** * Kick - If possible, kick does 25 dmg itself, doesn't confirm anything else, can be hardfeinted (as well as softfeinted still to grab); grab still confirms heavy. * On Valentines day, please make the grab gently stroke their cheek or brush the hair out of their eye, like a romantic gesture, then gently lay them down to sleep on the ground (before quickly standing up and then following up with the heavy) * **Shugoki** * Demon's Embrace - buffed to superarmor (from hyperarmor), thus can be used to counter bashes (as his version of BP's ""pancake flip""). * On Valentines day, please change to a crude animation of him hugging them, spinning on his tippy toe with one foot in the air like a giddy school girl to face behind him, then kissing them and dropping them (the kiss does the damage). * **Aramsuha** * Kick - does 20dmg, can wallsplat to confirm FDodge Heavy, superarmored (to allow counterganking). Accessible as softfeint from Side Heavy Finisher. ## Bashes to Add * **Peacekeeper** * Deep Gouge - Make follow-up stab a bash that can be dodged, accessible on hit or block, PK can access GB mid-chain or afterfinisher. Doesn't open guard, just does bleed damage. Buff heavy damage (as now the stab doesn't factor in). * Softfeint Stab - Either buff it to bash (eh, rather not), or increase speed to 300ms to make it truly unreactable; heavy side finishers undodgeable. * **Orochi** Not a bash-centric hero, but these allow him to mix them into his kit while not being too powerful. Notably, the total time to land for a dodgekick from neutral would be around 1000ms (ie the time for a Kensei palm strike from neutral), and the leg-sweep requires getting through an entire chain (at the minimum a light and a heavy, usually at least three attacks that can all be countered), making him a low-pressure hero that can still counter turtles if need be. * Pommel Strike - Accessible from his backdodge state while running forward by pressing GB, 10dmg, stuns, opens guard, mixupable with Top Undodgeable Heavy from the rush attack (now buffed to be feintable, and 30dmg). * Dodge Kick - can side dodge into 700ms (starting 400ms into dodge; 233ms GB vulnerability, thus cannot be used to counter a GB) kick (Tozen's Kick), feintable, 8dmg, opens guard into chain. * Leg Sweep - accessible after finisher (blocked heavy or hit with light/heavy), 500ms, chains to guaranteed mid-air slash (similar to his leg sweep execution) for 30dmg, with a bonus 15 damage on opponents under 25% health, opponent rolls to their feet away from Orochi (so no more confirmed damage), Orochi can flow into Backdodge Heavy Stance to help close the gap, or flow into dodges; can mixup with zone (accessible now through or after chain, hopefully catches side dodges) as well as dodge recovery finisher into undodgeable light. --- ## Q &amp; A * **Q:** Doesn't this make bashes less interesting/too samey? * **A:** Almost all of the bashes affected ARE samey right now, merely confirming a light or such. Many of the bashes that are ""special"" are not touched with this change. * **Q:** Wouldn't this make some bashes (such as Jorm's Stam Draining ones) simply much better than similar ones (Tiandi's palm strike)? * **A:** Yes-ish. Naturally, just as with the previous system where the light damage of a hero made their bashes better or worse, the overall kit and damage of a hero will make their bash more or less powerful. Additionally, some bashes are simply better versions of others, although this has always been the case even in the current system. The important thing is to remember the kit overall and balance around that. For instance, comparing Tiandi and Jorm, who have neutral and chain bashes that now go into the same open-guard state. Jorm's are objectively better -- his lights do more damage and are undodgeable, his heavy can knockdown OOS, his bash does stam damage and guaranteed damage, etc. Tiandi's, unless buffed in guaranteed damage, does less damage on a light, and although he gets more damage on a Guardbreak and Heavy, it doesn't weigh up. So why? Well, look at their playstyles. Jorm is stationary, and aggressive, and up in your face. He has fairly sucky defense (no dodge options) and is designed to be rather oppressive and ontop of the opponent, thus his bash is a bit better. Tiandi, on the other hand, has very good dodge defenses, as well as another bash mixup (the kick), and as a vanguard, plays around between defense and offense fluidly. His dodge mid-chain is also a great offensive tool, allowing an attack into defense against, say, hyperarmor. This also applies to other heroes -- note how Orochi and LB have to really work their way up to an offense, *unless* they do a defense (deflect/parry) that gets them to their finishers easier. In contrast to Conq, BP, or Raider who can access bashes and unblockables very easily, this seems unfair, but recall what their primary roles are -- counter attackers, vs the more aggressive roles of the latter 3. Another comparison would be Centurion. Centurion and Jorm share several traits, notably stam punishment. However, Jorm is centered around stamina punishment and has many more tools to do so, whereas Cent's stamina game is less pronounced -- he has greater stamina, but his bashes do less stamina damage, and he doesn't have that many tools to capitalize on an OOS opponent (both currently, in his rework, and with these suggestions). As such, he does more damage and has more mixup potential with his chargeable heavies -- stamina punishment is more of a minor for Cent and Glad, whereas Jorm has majored in it. Lastly, to address 700ms feintable bashes (Orochi, HL, Nobushi) -- these are in-chain, and cannot be charged as compared to the 800ms Warden/Hito/New Cent feintable bashes. I think the speed increase is justified by the lack of charging, and ability to get in-chain. * **Q:** Why are you trying to weaken offense and cause turtling again? * **A:** I'm a BIG advocate for making this game offensive and fast and destroying turtling, namely through nerfing light parry punishes and the passivity of blocking (by increasing chip damage) to make blocking a choice/player decision rather than a care-free no-risk thing. However, I also want it to be in a fun and healthy way. Bashes are, essentially, *unparryable unblockables that go through hyperarmor and deal stamina damage and stun* -- that's why they're so powerful. Instead of playing *with* the art of battle, they completely ignore it, and by virtue ignore almost all traits and special properties of characters, grossly simplfying the game into nearly a whack-a-mole thing, hence why theyre hated. The more fun bashes, such as Kensei's, are due to their multitude of counterplay options allowing opponents to use their own kit in battle. These changes are intended to keep bashes relevent but interact with the art of combat system more, allowing opponents to interact with the post-bash in a myriad of ways -- full-block, parries, option selects, dodging, dodge attacks, etc. each of which can be countered. Blocking can't be countered (yet) due to the low chip damage and traps being only one character and reactable, which is why the bashes remove it temporarily, essentially acting as a guardbreak always should have. * **Q:** You think this will fix everything?/We need individual hero buffs. * **A:** Not at all, it won't fix all the problems. However, it can be a good start. While many heroes need individual changes, sweeping changes such as this produce a much bigger impact with much less work. While a lot of these will require individual hero tweaking, the main changes are near universal and can be applied (I think) with less work than to create a single new animation or such. * **Q:** Are these buffs or nerfs? | Congrats you just gutted X hero. | Hero Y is now way too OP. * **A:** They're not intended as buff nor nerfs specifically. They're not made to gut bashes nor make bashes unstoppable or anything like that. They're intended to make bashes more interactive. Most likely, the bashes will average the same damage -- many of the open-guard bashes will at least do 5 damage, and while lights are no longer guaranteed, you are likely to get GB's and Heavies out of it that can give some major damage (at the cost of being counterable). I'm not entirely sure whether this will be an overall nerf or buff, and indeed it'll largely depend on player mixups and skill level -- at the lowest level bash to light will be nigh confirmed, at mid-level attempts to parry light will allow many bash to heavies to hit, and at highest level it'll be a dance between mindgames. * **Q:** What's with that dmg tho? * **A:** I odd-balled the dmg values and rounded them. They'll of course change. My main point with them was making them either very small but can add up (5-10), usable (15ish), or very notable (20-25). Numbers are easy to change. * **Q:** If bashes are reduced in power (arguably), how do we open up turtles? * **A:** Define turtle. There are two types of turtles in For Honor right now. Blocking turtles abuse the fact that blocking is essentially free. You can block 20 high damaging heavies without a second-thought (it's not like it's dificult to react to 800ms+, even for the most noob player) and without any consequence, and as such the only way to get around blocking is to completely ignore it. These turtles can be countered, now, by bashes which force them to make a decision and active defense. Additionally, I hope that devs rework traps (which can vary in damage and ""priority"", or what defenses they counter) to be unreactable and usable to counter block-turtles. Lastly, it is my biggest wish that chip damage is increased significantly such that blocking, while still usable, is a choice and decision, not a brain-dead monkey-can-use-it-and-win maneuever that stales battles, and regular attacks can still be usable, not just pressure attacks; this will allow all heroes to use their basic attacks and still win, and play around with the art of combat system. Heck, heroes like Nobushi, Tiandi, Aramusha, Warlord, etc. would then be near entirely viable without any other changes, and future heroes can play around with chains and such that dont revolve around a bash or unblockable or very fast attacks and still be viable. All that said, bash heroes now should be able to counter block turtles with these changes. The second type of turtles are those that are defensively-minded, that ""parry-spam"" or dodge everything, etc. This type is, actually, not too problematic. If they are making an active defense, they can be counted. Whether it's zone option selects, light superior blocks, or deflects, there is a counter to them, and that's simply a matter of mixing up your defense. That said, light parries are waaaaay too high -- so much so that, while I dont suggest it, you can technically close your eyes and randomly parry a direction against an Orochi or PK chain and still outdamage them probability-speaking. Light parries need removal (so all parries only allow 20ish damage), and various other counters (such as Valk's dodge block counter and JJ's 33dmg + heavy stam dmg parry counter) need tweaking to allow offense to be more powerful. That said, in most these cases these sorta ""turtles"" are a playstyle, and a valid one at that -- you should *expect* an Orochi or Lawbringer to be defensive most of the time, even if the above bash changes are made, as they have relatively low-pressure chains compared to, say, BP or Conq, who can access bashes and unblockables from near neutral. Lastly, stamina. Stam values are good, but they're multiplied by double to triple on block and whiff, and 7 times on parry. Simply changing the multipliers will allow offenses to be much more sustainable, allowing greater offense against turtles. --- Tl;dr make many bashes just do small damage themselves, and remove blocking for the following strike, making light and heavies a mixup post bash instead of just confirmed damage."

This move has guardbreak vulnerability, meaning if he chains one bash into another the opponent can dodge the first one and guardbreak the second, interrupting it. Stun lasts 600ms. New Mechanic- Zhanhu's Ambition- When hitting an enemy that is stunned, Zhanhu gains back 4x the amount of stamina it cost him to make that attack. The idea of this rework was to make Zhanhu high tier and fun to play. Now he is rewarded for offense and defense. His new bash attack allows him to safely counter hard to punish moves with offense of his own, or he can go for the riskier dodge heavy or dodge lights. Now he has a gladiator esque punch that can be used to continue his offense and throw off defense. While guaranteeing nothing on it's own it makes follow up dodge attacks harder to block or allows Zhanhu to move directly into his finishers for potential large damage. One thing that may fall by the wayside is Zhanhu's unblockable light finishers. I still think they have their purpose. They offer additional threat to Zhanhu's finisher heavies and all of his mixups in general. They are a subsidiary to his other moves rather than his main mix up. The combination of stun and 400ms dodge attacks should hopefully make Zhanhu's offense a lot safer and troubling for any potential defenders. But Zhanhu doesn't normally have the stamina to keep up this pressure for long. That is why I included Zhanhu's ambition. Stunning an opponent and then succesfully hitting them grants bonus stamina, meaning Zhanhu can keep his offense up for longer and it gives his stun more meaning. Zhanhu can potentially do an infinite chain of dodge bash attacks. That kind of sounds like a meme thing to do and I included guardbreak vulnerability to make sure that it doesn't happen. Instead if the opponent dodges the dodge bash the mixup is now what attack he will do next, or if he will do an attack at all. The new dodge attacks mean Zhanhu can keep the pressure up and also feels better to play. IMO there's really no reason why his recovery dodge cancels should feel as awful as they do. They should be fast, fluid, responsive, and powerful. Still weak to guardbreak, or the Zhanhu could do a dodge attack to be immune to guardbreak but risk the opponent reading them and parrying. The uneven risk ratio of Zhanhu's light dodge and heavy dodge make things more interesting. Most people will expect the heavy, since it is the objectively better option. Safer, more damage, undodgeable, and can act as a chain starter even if it's blocked. It's now the best dodge attack in the game. Well this gives the light it's role as something surprising. Everyone will expect the heavy, so now the light has it's purpose. The light also does 15 damage. 14 damage is the worst number ever and any attack that does 14 damage should be increased to 15. 14 damage makes me want to shrivel up and die. That is kind of unrelated but in this rework Zhanhu no longer has 14 damage attacks, so that's good. Anyway, the goal is to make Zhanhu a dangerous, unpredictable, dodge attack specialist with many quick attacks that do enough damage so damage starts to add up. I think every character should be powerful and varied, with no dead moves, so I wanted to bring that to this somewhat underwhelming hero. Let me know what you think. Personally I think if these changes were implemented he would be an A-tier duelist and team fighter. His new recovery cancels would make it hard to nail down in a team fight as he zips around. His dodge heavy and bash mean that he can safely transfer one dodge attack to the other, even if he is being externally blocked. Of course he can still be punished for spamming on a read, but it isn't literally useless as it is rise now."
109,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Defense Changes for Various Heroes,1,egp3oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/egp3oo/defense_changes_for_various_heroes/,2019-12-28 21:01:13,"Tl;dr a mixture of buffs and nerfs aimed primarily at various defenses (both weak and strong). Note that... a. These are not intended to be the only changes ever to these heroes, and it wont likely change the tiers drastically. The changes are primarily targeted at a specific move or part of a kit -- I have even written the other changes Id love to see but trimmed them to have more focus. b. These are HIGHLY unlikely to ever have the slightest impact on the actual game, and this is meant, as always, for discussion -- so please, *please*, if youre gonna comment say something more interesting than ""what idiot would ever want these/it totally guts X hero/congrats you just made Y completely busted and OP"". Commentary, Constructive Criticism (even negative by nature), Critique, Dialogue and Memes are welcome; direct insults are not. c. Bash Armor is armor that can only negates bashes, not regular attacks (a natural inverse to hyperarmor, which goes through regular attacks but beaten by bashes; superarmor, which is applied in revenge, is a combination of both plus complete GB immunity/breakthrough). ## Full-Blocks ### Conqueror * + Fullblock counters bashes, allowing guaranteed upvote with his flail. * + Fullblock can go into chain bash (slow, wallsplats) with 200ms startup gb vulnerability, and punishable on dodge * - Fullblock has increased exit duration. * - Zone no longer full-blocks. * - Side Dodge Bash speed increased (made longer, perhaps replaced with in-chain bash). * + Chain heavies now have superior block. ### Aramusha * + Full-block has drastically lower end recovery (from some 1100ms to 200ms) - total move is 600ms (dodge length) * - Increased GB vulnerability on opener heavies (at least 300ms). * - Reduced opener side heavy dmg to 35dmg (from 40). * Forward Dodge Side Heavy * - Unfeintable * + Improved speed (600ms, from 800ms?) * + iFrames from 100ms-500ms. * Now a pseudo-dodge attack. ## Parry/Armor-Based Defenses ### Jiang Jun * - Zone nerfed to 25dmg (neutral, from sifu, and from parry). * - Choke only guarantees a light without wall, not zone. * + Zone has bash armor (in addition to hyperarmor). * + Parry choke slap does 5dmg to HP, 20 extra dmg to ego. ### Lawbringer * - Side dodge to shove removed. *""It is said that a lawbringer that dodges whenever an opponent flinches is no man of steel at all."" - Pope Vultcano III* * Long Arm of the Law * + Buffed to 700ms speed. * + Avaliable in chain. * + Catches Backdodges (lunges forward). * + Has Bash Armor (goes through bashes, nor guard attacks). * Opponent rolls to feet for quicker recovery; LB given all heavy parry options. * Impale - Two Potential Options 1. Impale increased to 15dmg, still ledges, does not wallsplat. 2. Impale made unblockable, feintable, 700ms (not guaranteed on parry), but still wallsplats. ### Shugoki * + Demon's Embrace now has Bash Armor (in addition to hyperarmor). * + Zone now has Bash Armor (in addition to hyperarmor). * - Lights hyperarmor starts at 300ms-500ms, instead of at 100ms. ### Centurion * + Increase GB Vulnerability on heavies (already being taken care of in rework). ## Dodge-Based Defenses ### Nobushi * + Hidden stance attacks now avaliable during startup after 66ms (ie now lights akin to dodge lights, beating GB). * + Hidden stance side lights now 400ms. * + Passively regenerates 10hp/sec in Hidden Stance. * + Side Heavy Dodge attacks 600ms (from 700ms), undodgeable * Kick * - Now 700ms (from 600ms; original speed was 800ms) * - GB Vulnerable for first 366ms (to not allow HS &gt; Kick to be too powerful) * + Hardfeintable * + Softfeintable to hiddenstance or dodge. ### Zhanhu * + Dodges avaliable as chain, ie instant access after any of his attacks, no delay. * + Dodges avaliable after finishers. * + Dodge Superior Block Counter Blow now deals 10dmg. ### Tiandi * + Dodges avaliable after finishers. * + Dodges avaliable after palm-strike and kick. * + Dodges avaliable after dodge-attack. ### Orochi * + Dodges avaliable throughout chain. * + Backdodge + Light has 100ms GB vulnerability (similar to side dodge lights). ### Kensei * - Dodge superior block window reduced to 66ms. * + Dodge superior block, on successful block, makes side heavy unblockable/guarantees dodge attack. * + Dodge in-chain avaliable after chain attack and finisher (not opener). ### Valkyrie * - Dodge Superior Block window reduced to 66ms. * - Impale strike does 20dmg + 10bleed; does not guarantee top light. * + Impale executes if it does more damage than enemy health (including bleed). * + Fullblock carries full-black through the release. * + Fullblock &gt; Heavy Input does a lunging impale strike (same impale as dodge block) with bash armor (but no fullblock). ## Other ### Gladiator * - Zone now 600ms. * - Zone does not guarantee followup attack; followup attack removed. * + Zone now stuns. * + Zone does 5dmg. * + Zone goes into chain (all chain options, not just heavy). * + Dodges bashes go into chain (any chain option, not just heavy). * + Dodge Bashes deal 10dmg to HP. * + Forward Dodge Bash now feintable."
110,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Talking about ""dodge-specialist"", and about how to improve it",1,eht8hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/eht8hf/talking_about_dodgespecialist_and_about_how_to/,2019-12-31 09:24:35,"In For Honor, the sub-categories for heroes(Hard-hitter, straightforward, adaptable, etc.) could be seen as ""vague, but somewhat true"". Hard-hitters like Hitokiri and Shugoki hit pretty hard, straightforward characters like Warden and Raider are relatively quick to learn, Warlord and Berzerker love to harass, etc. But there are two descriptions that are pretty much bullshit: ""Mix-up Intensive"", and ""Dodge-specialist"". Unsurprisingly, I'm going to talk about the latter one. &amp;#x200B; Dodge-specialist is on two characters: Tiandi and Zhanhu. And it's safe to say that this is essentially false advertising. You would expect that a ""dodge-specialist"" would have incredibly strong dodge attacks, but it turns out that it means the exact opposite. Tiandi's Dragon Dodges are faulty and don't work properly, his Tiger Dodges are designed ineffectively, and Zhanhu's dodge attacks(the side ones) are the most underwhelming in the game. At this point, all the other heroes with dodge attacks are better dodge-specialists. So, here are my suggestions for the heroes. These changes only help these heroes with their dodge attacks, not with the rest of their kit. # Tiandi **Tiger Dodges** * Input window is changed to 0-300ms from 100-200ms *This new input window does not improve Tiandi's dodging capabilities of Tiger Dodge. Tiger Dodge is meant more as a counter-attack thanks to the superior block frames, and it currently is hard to do so since the minimum overall start-up of those superior block frames is 200-300ms. Now, with this new input window, they are much easier to use for counter-attacking.* &amp;#x200B; **Dragon Dodges** * (Side) dragon dodges are sped up to 1000ms from 1100ms * (Side) dragon dodge I-frames are increased to 600ms from 500ms * (All) Input window is changed to 200-500ms from 200ms * (All) Dragon Dodge damage is buffed to 28 from 20/25 * (Side) Soft-feint window for Dragon Dodge into Tiger Dodge is increased to 400-600ms from a static 600ms *Side Dragon Dodges on Tiandi, especially when compared to JJ's side dodge heavies, are significantly weaker. GB vulnerability is higher, I-frames are insufficient, and yet the damage remains the same. The speed-up lowers the GB vulnerability, the I-frames now cover the whole move before the feint timing, and the damage is better.* *Along with that, a ""dodge-specialist"" would benefit greatly from a better input window. Also, the soft-feint into a dodge attack would be significantly better if it had an actual window; currently, the soft-feint window could be achieved just by hard-feinting. Both of these little issues are fixed.* # Zhanhu **Dodge Lights** * All dodge lights have a standardized stamina cost of 6(side dodge lights had a stamina cost of 12) * Side dodge lights now have an input window of 200-500ms from 400ms *Zhanhu's dodge lights do not exactly do their job at dodging. Now while I-frames would help with this issue, a wider dodge input window would be better. Unsurprisingly, a static input window makes for some very predictable offense. More control over the dodge input would be a good improvement to Zhanhu. Also, a lower stamina cost is always better.* &amp;#x200B; **Dodge Heavies** * Side dodge heavies are now enhanced * Side dodge heavies now have an input window of 200-500ms from 400ms *Zhanhu would improve from a different option to entering combat. Having a way to enter from his dodge attacks would be great. Enhancing the dodge heavies(which can already execute) would make sense, and due to the extra qualities, the higher stamina cost is justified.* &amp;#x200B; **Dodge Cancels** * All dodge cancels(for mid-chain, after dodge attacks, and after a zone) are now standardized to 300ms from 300/500/600ms *Zhanhu's dodge cancels are bad, that's all it is. They're inconsistent, and some of them are so high that they're pretty much pointless. Making them consistent would help significantly, and making them all relatively fast would make Zhanhu an actual ""dodge-specialist"".* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; After all of these changes, both of the ""dodge-specialists"" would actually deserve their title. &amp;#x200B; ***Little Extra******:*** I know that there are going to be those comments that say ""Oh, these changes won't change the fact that both Tiandi and Zhanhu are still weak offensively"". This subreddit is extremely predictable. So here are the *other* changes, that would make these heroes actually good. Both Tiandi and Zhanhu can now dodge-cancel their finisher attacks. Zhanhu has the added bonus of his finisher heavy recoveries being lowered down to the recoveries for his dodge lights. Tiandi's Dragon Kick now deals 25 direct damage. And the soft-feint timing is moved to 400ms before impact, instead of 500ms before impact. Since the damage and the soft-feint timing were both improved, the kick's recovery should be increased to allow a GB after a dodge, but only on an earlier dodge(so on prediction). Also, as an added bonus, the stun is normalized to 1500ms from the odd 500ms. Zhanhu's deflect bash now deals 55 stamina damage, instead of 30. Zhanhu's finisher lights are sped up to 533ms from 600ms. The current speed is too slow and easy to parry. Zhanhu can delay his finisher attacks a little longer, about as much as Orochi can with his chain lights."
111,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Tiandi buffs,1,ehvj9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ehvj9a/tiandi_buffs/,2019-12-31 12:19:35,Make forward dodge heavy confirmed on a kick. Make forward dodge heavy have quicker hyper armour. Make forward dodge heavy 28 damage (from 20). Make sure dodge heavy 28 damage (from 25) Give side dodge heavies more i-frames and less gb vulnerability. Make all dash lights enhanced and up the damage to 16 Allow flow like water to work on chain finishers. Allow the kick to be performed on a heavy chain finisher and also be performed after a wiffed heavy. Decrease stamina costs for all soft feints and on a wiffed kick. Make palm strike do more stamina damage and also make the light follow up deal 16-18 damage. Allow him to soft feint into palm strike from forward dodge heavy make it 466ms. I think this would give him some OOS pressure much like JJs. Palm strike is now 500ms from neutral and 466ms in chain. Spread the stamina cost of the zone over the two hits not just the full cost when you use it.
112,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A Rework of Breach,1,ei4piw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ei4piw/a_rework_of_breach/,2020-01-01 03:03:54,"These are changes aimed at making Breach more competitive while at the same time making it more fun and less frustrating. *General Changes* - Attackers no longer have tickets. - The complete removal of the second gate and the area that accompanies it. (The area after the first gate but before the commander's area.) - The game timer is reduced to 20 minutes from 30. - Respawn timer is now the same as it is for dominion. 12 seconds with a +3 second penalty along with no revives for an execution. - There is now a 10 second time limit upon respawning on the spawn ramp. After 10 seconds you will begin to take a 10 dmg bleed dot per second. Once you leave the ramp you become invulnerable for 7 seconds. (100% damage reduction and super armour.) - The banner spawn location has been moved to inbetween zone 2 and 3. - The healing point is now more centrally located. - Pikemen damage reduced to 5 dmg from 10 dmg per hit. - Captain damage reduced to 25 dmg from 40 dmg per hit. *Comments: These range from massive to barely QOL but I will try to explain everything. * *Attackers having tickets felt like an unnecessary disadvantage, I want the main focus of the defenders to be destroying and impeding the ram whether by controlling zones or direct damage.* * The second stage is just useless filler as most games are decided by the first gate, time limit change is to acknowledge the shorter game.* * The respawn penalty was just bad game design.* * The bleed dot is to force players to leave the ramp instead of hiding up there but to prevent the other team from just camping underneath the spawn point I added the vulnerability.* *I felt the spawn point of the banner favoured the Attackers for no reason. This should centre it more and further incentive the secondary objective of pushing the rampart.* *The healing point also favoured the Attackers more. This should help equalise the playing field.* *High pikeman damage gave a big advantage to high HP pool heroes by making it nearly impossible for low HP pool heroes to approach the ram, this should encourage hero diversity more. Captain damage was just far too high as well.* *First Gate* - Upon starting, the attackers now control zones 1 and 2, defenders still control zone 3 and 4. - Zone 2 and 3 can now be captured and recaptured by the two teams. - Zone 1 and 4 are now uncapturable but can be contested. - Zone 4 now has spaces for archers to shoot from. With the addition of 3 respawning archers. - When uncontested by Players, pikemen or captains, zone 1 will now heal the Attackers. Same for zone 4 for defenders. - It now takes exactly 4 hits of the battering ram to destroy the gate. (Equal to 4 bars of health, one for each hit.) - It takes exactly 5 hits for the mortar to damage the ram. (Equal to 4.5 bars of health.) -The Banner is equivalent to 1 bar of health. *Comments: One of the problems of Breach is that zones cannot be recaptured. This enhances the problem of the game outcome being decided very early. I also think the idea of a constantly tide-turning battle is a lot more fun and less frustrating.* * Adding archers to zone 4 will make it more valuable as a zone.* * An extra healing point is needed in Breach to encourage hero viability as pretty much only heavies, vanguards and Lawbringer are viable due to their survivability. The zones are already very far from the healing point as it stands so this should help as a fallback point. This also further encourages you to push the rampart as a side objective so as not to have your healing point contested.* *The extra 0.5 bar of health is to account for the fact that the ram can be damaged before it reaches the Gate while the gate can only be damaged by the ram.* *Final Stage* - Upon entering, the current time limit is replaced by a 5 minute time limit. - The Attackers now have 5 minutes to kill the commander. If they kill the commander within the 5 minutes they win the game, if they do not then the defenders win. - The single zone along the side still cannot be recaptured by the defenders to enforce that this is a desperate last attempt at beating the the Attackers away. *Comments: The odds are intentionally stacked against the defenders here. They're true goal was to destroy the ram before it breached the gate. This is a slim second chance for them.* These are my proposed changes. If anything is unclear or downright questionable please ask me in the comments. If I have missed anything please tell me."
113,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Lets talk about Aramusha... Nerfs.,1,ei5mzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ei5mzk/lets_talk_about_aramusha_nerfs/,2020-01-01 04:11:00,"I feel, and so does anyone aware of how unhealthy he is, like this hero needs more attention right now, not just buff-ey, but nerf-ey. Don't get me wrong, Aramusha still needs overall buffs, and outside of 4s, he is very much on the weaker end of the spectrum. Howhever, he still has ridiculous aspects of his kit, that honestly, would be understandable if they were to get the Nobushi treatment. But most of his problems lies on his Damage. ( I think Infohub has those punishes if you need them ) - *His neutral side heavies are ridiculous. 40 damage from neutral, which shouldn't exist to begin with, on a 700ms heavy, with 100ms GB vulnerability.* This is a problem on all gamemodes. Its stupid. -*His maximum OOL/roll punish is 76 combined.* -*The punish above becomes 129 with Fear Itself.* -*If they are OOS AND OOL, the punish is 154.* -*With Fear Itself and Revenge, his Side Heavies deal 78 damage.* -*He has omnidirectional feint GB immune heavies.* -*In a chain, he has very high damage finisher heavies with 20 damage softfeints. The fact he cant access them easily does not justify those numbers, regardless if they dont make him strong.* -*25 damage Heavy Parry / 40 damage Light Parry.* Regardless if you think Ara is super weak ( Which he quite isn't anymore, he has climbed up a bit ), those damage values are absolutely ridiculous and need to be toned down."
114,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha Rework Ideas,1,eipsrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/eipsrg/aramusha_rework_ideas/,2020-01-02 10:42:41,"Happy New Year to all reading this on the posted day. The main purpose of this rework is to introduce possible moves to increase the viability of Aramusha without changing his playstyle or differing from his intended use and character identity. For this I will be looking at the For Honor Information Hub and addressing his weaknesses listed on the Balance and Playstyle Information Section here [URL To be honest I don't think any of this will end up in the game so this is more like a fan-fic than a real suggestion but it's fun to think and talk about so here it goes. I did read the rework post guidelines before and during the writing and if I missed anything feel free to comment so. **Character Identity/Indented Use:** He is considered a Counter Attacker, with Fast Attacks, and is labelled Hard. His best use in 4v4s is as an AI clearer, be this with pikemen, officers, and the commander in Breach or minions in Dominion. In duels he is supposed to be defensive, hence his counter attacker status. **New Moves:** * Spinning Wheel Kick/Ushio Mawashi Geri (this is a karate move that is close to his push-back kick) 1. In the information hub under Duel Weaknesses it says ""Lacks an opener to get into finisher mix-up which requires multiple reads to land."" this move is here to address that weakness. 2. Will be a 633ms Unblockable Bash dealing 15 stamina damage and costing 20 stamina to use, doesn't stun or wallsplat but can ledge, initiated by holding back on the movement stick and pressing the Guard Break button, counts as a chain starter and chains on a hit or miss. The punish will be a delayed 28 damage chain top heavy. 3. The reason the punish is a chain top heavy )even when delayed) is because that heavy is 600ms and his lights are 500ms, if the bash stuns the enemy long enough to guarantee a delayed light input (so you can input the light after you see the bash hit, as opposed to having to buffer the input and hope the bash hits cause if it misses it's a free light parry for the enemy) then it would also guarantee a buffered heavy input and on a missed kick then you could just feint the heavy. The only possible solutions to make the kick only guarantee a light but not the heavy, that I see, is to make his chain lights 400ms which I don't want to see, a hero with infinite chain 400ms lights would be pretty much cancer for the game, especially console, and then nerfing his top heavies down to 700ms which I also don't want to see cause it would lower his heavy parry from the top heavy to a light attack moving away from his Counter-Attacker status, so I made the bash 633ms as opposed to 600ms (like Tiandi's palm strike) to compensate for the high damage punish, it's still not as good as Hitokiri's kick because his can't be feinted and doesn't have hyperarmor and it's not as good a Highlanders cause it cause be feinted into a different bash and doesn't grantee 40 damage, I also made the stamina cost double that of Tiandi's palm strike so that with the heavy punish it will take 30 stamina to use meaning that it won't be practical to spam unless you want to go OOS. Overall this gives him a consistent opener to deal damage, deal with turtles, and get the finisher mixup. 4. I'm uncertain what to put his miss recovery times at so for now they'll be that same as Jormungandr's neutral bash with 600ms till block and 1000ms till both dodge and counter-GB, if anyone has better ideas for the recoveries I'm all ears. 5. This move will use the same motion tracking as the push-back kick with different in-game values so as to reduce the amount of work that Ubisoft would have to put in to implement this move. * Razor Slash (just made up a random name if you have a better one I'll put it here and give you credit) 1. In the information hub under Duel Weaknesses it says ""No side dodge attack, so very vulnerable to bashes."" this will be a dodge attack to address his weakness to bash related offense. 2. Will be an undodgeable 500ms dodge light attack dealing 15 damage and costing 6 stamina to use, can be initiated from 100ms to 300 ms into a side dodge, comes from the same guard as the direction dodged to. 3. By making the input timing so soon in the dodge it will allow him to punish Black Prior's bash somewhat consistently, the move is basically copied from Tiandi so the attack input will have to be delayed to actually dodge an incoming attack because the attack portion won't have i-frames and the dodge properties come from a dodge input and not the attack input. 4. I'm not certain about making it undodgeable and I don't think it's necessary I just put it in in case but if other people think that making it undodgeable is bad then I'm willing to remove that part. 5. This move will sadly require new motion tracking. * Deadly Feint Heavy 1. In the information hub under Duel Weaknesses it says ""Deadly Feints are easier to reaction parry than other 400ms attacks, because there is no heavy option to catch light parry attempts."" this will address this weakness. 2. Deadly Feint Heavy attacks will all be 700ms and deal 30 damage for a top heavy and 35 for a side heavy, they will both cost 10 stamina to use just like the deadly feint light attacks, these heavy attacks will be preformed during a heavy finisher by inputting a heavy attack in a different direction 500ms into the heavy finisher (same timing as the deadly feint lights) 3. This is just here to catch light parry attempts similar to Berserker's feint game except they're soft feints. The reason the top Deadly Feint Heavy is 700ms instead of 600ms like all of Musha's other top heavies is because if the enemy tries to parry the light and would have parried too late it's possible that they would accidentally get the parry timing of a 600ms attack, by decreasing the speed to 700ms the chances of accidentally getting the heavy parry is lowered. Another utility of this is to bait out someone trying to dodge the light and catch them with the Heavy cause they dodged too early. This also serves to catch all guard attempts, if a Black Prior tries to flip the lights then they'll get hit with the heavy attack. 4. This move might require new motion tracking or Ubisoft could use moves that already exist to make this happen, it would really be a regular deadly feint except it lasts 700ms and both the swords are in the attack. **Current Move Tweaks:** * Locked-On Movement Speed 1. A consistently complained about thing in the information hub so I'm just going to buff it to equal Raider's locked-on movement speed. 2. Forward buffed from 1.50m/s to 2.00m/s, side buffed from 1.00m/s to 1.75m/s, and back buffed from 0.75m/s to 1.25m/s * Blade Blockade 1. Get rid of Twin Vipers, these are the unblockable side heavies from blade blockade that I don't think are ever guaranteed and are therefore almost completely useless. Any Heavy input from a Black Blockade, regardless of guard direction will now preform Fury Unleashed (top heavy from Blade Blockade). Fury Unleashed is now Unblockable and therefore guaranteed from any blockaded, blockable attack. 2. Ring the Bell now has uninterruptible stance from 100ms and makes the enemy's guard inactive for 1100ms (and therefore last 1100ms), they cannot dodge for this time , and this move revenge locks. 3. The changes to the heavy input mean that his go to punish for blade blockade will be the 30 damage top heavy and he won't have to delay the input for a guard switch to top now that twin vipers aren't there, and since it's unblockable it will be guaranteed even on a blockaded light attack and not just high recovery moves. The kick will still be his go-to for environmental punishes like ledges, wallsplat for 40 damage (10 more that the heavy), spikes, and other fun stuff, but Ring the Bell is where things get fun. Ring the bell now has hyperarmor and revenge locks someone meaning that in a gank he can activate this like a defensive version of Gladiator's tow stab and since he has hyperarmor and it revenge locks his allies just get to wail on the enemy during Ring the Bell as long as he has enough health to take 20% of the damage after the 80% friendly fire damage nerf, instead of his blockaded light punish it becomes his gank tool. * Deadly Feints and Heavy Finishers 1. All Heavy Finishers have uninterruptible stance at 100ms 2. All Deadly Feints, Light and Heavy, have uninterruptible stance at 100ms 3. This is to help against heroes who like to trade and get hyperarmor during the Deadly Feint mix-up specifically Shugoki, Raider, Berserker, Hitokiri, Highlander, Jormungandr, and Jiang Jun. **Weaknesses After These Changes** * The GB vulnerability of his Blade Blockade is still 1000ms overall. * He still has no guard on forward dodges making him very vulnerable in team fights. * Short range limit his gank and anti-gank potential. * His only option against external guard is a kick that feeds revenge. * If used improperly, Ring the Bell makes him very vulnerable in team fights. * Only having 120 health means that the on the finisher mixup hyperarmor is likely to leave him with low health, this will be a major issue in breach where healing is scarce, this will probably pressure people to take the Bulk Up and Bastion gear perks to help with trading. * Relatively High stamina cost of his opener means that it's use will be limited to when Musha has most of his stamina * His opener is easily react-able even if it's hard to punish (he can do a followup heavy with low go vulnerability to punish dodge GB attempts and his guard recovery is very low). * The only unblockable attacks are an easily reactable bash and a stamina intensive zone. * Reactable neutral offence means that defensive play is still his best option. **Strengths After These Changes** * High damage opener that is difficult to punish. * High damage parry punishes that lead into finisher mixup * High damage for killing minions, pikemen, generals, and commanders. * Decent finisher mix-up with unreactable attacks forcing the enemy to make reads to consistently deal with and moves to punish incorrect reads for high damage. * Decent option select with unblockable pressure * Ring the Bell can be a powerful ganking tool. **Synopsis** It looks like I changes a lot but I just gave him an opener, a dodge attack, a heavy soft feint, removed 1 move (Twin Vipers), gave him more hyperarmor, changed some values of moves, and buffed his locked-on movement speed. I don't recommend doing all of these changes at once but all of these are good ideas to increase his viability while maintaining his character and playstyle. I don't see any of these moves being broken, the only thing that is overtuned is the damage from the kick punish but I've explained why that is the way it is. I think that these moves would be healthy for the hero and wouldn't harm the overall balance of the game."
115,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Ideal way to improve Orochi.,5,ds7rzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ds7rzk/ideal_way_to_improve_orochi/,2019-11-06 10:48:48,"Recent AMA Q&amp;A, Stefan confirmed Orochi can be improved and be viable without Unblockable and bash. It's quite interest, how are they going to achieve it? *Let's be clear that in 4v4 modes, Orochi is a side pointer not a ganker or a supporter. He is a Staller and he goes after flee enemies and roam around to find enemies alone or 2.* From my understanding Hyperarmour, Soft feint and undodgeable are still on the table. **Pros :-** * 466ms zone option select. * Wind Gust(Light deflect) can be chained. * Hurricane Blast (Heavy deflect) can beat/trade HA followups. * Dodge recovery cancels. * Delayed ti-directional 400ms lights. * 100ms GB vulnerability on top heavy. * Can whiff any attacks. * Delayed dodge attacks. * 70 dmg on OOS punish. * Feat1 - Bounty Hunter/Kiai, Feat2 - Smoke bomb, Feat3 - Slip through. **Cons :-** * Hard to access 400ms lights * Stormrush can be easily interrupted. * High GB vulnerability on Riptide strike. * No OOS pressure. * Lack of pressure. * Lack of opener. * Rely on turtle/defensive play. * Lack of external pressure. * Outdated/bad choice of feats. **Improvements :-** His recent improvements were increase in sprint speed and Crushing wave is 600ms(700ms). My ideal way to improve him, * Able chain from crushing wave. * Dodge cancel on Wind Gust. * Zephyr slash are enhanced. * lighting strike is enhanced * Riptide strike is enhanced and 533ms(600ms) * His side dodge are 533ms(standarded 600ms) * Side heavy finishers are HA(Active at 400ms) and can be softfeinted to GB or Dodge. * Top heavy finisher is Undodgable. * Able to dodge cancel after zone. * Finisher lights are enhanced. * Increase the distance of forward throw same as shaman forward throw(Can't find the numbers). * When in chained attacks ( L+H+dodge) all dodge attacks are 200ms GB vulnerability. Heavy deflect(Hurricane Blast) improvements : (*Since Valk and Shinobi can stop any combo and do 50 dmg confirmed.)* * Heavy deflect is 800ms(900ms). * Soft feint initiated at 400ms - 600ms * His soft feint will have HA (GB or Wind Gust) between 400ms to 600ms. *This will create mixups and mind game from his heavy deflect instead of people dodging and GB / Roll back, It will make the deflect more threatening.* **Damage changes :-** * Side opening lights are 17dmg(15dmg). * 400ms lights are 14dmg(12dmg). * Light strike is 17dmg(15dmg). * Top opening heavy is 30dmg(35dmg). * Side heavy finishers are 35dmg(30dmg). * Crushing wave is 20dmg(17dmg). OOS punish, * On parry - Top double lights + Top heavy finisher (18+35) = 53dmg. * On GB side throw - Side light + Top heavy finisher (17+35) = 52dmg. * On forward throw - Lighting strike + Top heavy finisher (17+35) = 52dmg. These are my collective ideas i came up with., Hope my ideas make Orochi the best staller in the game and do fine in antiganking. There are few areas i haven't covered like * Stormrush improvements. * Lack on Opener. * OOS pressure. * External pressure. * Better feats selection. Further few more. i would like your suggestions and ideas even if it's better for the game and the hero. Everyone is welcomed for their own opinions. If Freeze and Mods can give their suggestions to help for the improvement of Orochi, we could help devs to achieve what they want. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading."

119,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,All neutral heavies should be given 400ms of GB vulnerability (with some exceptions),1,dw36hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/dw36hm/all_neutral_heavies_should_be_given_400ms_of_gb/,2019-11-14 14:01:35,"Feint-into-GB is one of the most basic mix-ups in the game. While it is arguable on how effective it is, it is very much healthy for the game. You try to parry something, the enemy feints into a GB, and you get punished. **However, everyone knows that not every single hero applies to this.** Aramusha, Gladiator, (partially) Orochi: they all have neutral heavies that are immune to this mix-up, since their heavies are fast enough that the game gives them 100ms GB vulnerability. This makes their heavies incredibly safe and defensive, incentivizing turtling in a game that is already incredibly defense-oriented. The only real way that someone can even remotely punish these types of heroes is if someone has a 400ms neutral light, which only two heroes have(and would fail against Aramusha's top heavy). So my simple solution is to give them all 400ms of GB vulnerability. That way, the heroes listed above will be susceptible to the feint-into-GB mix-up, and future heroes won't be locked to having neutral heavies that are always around the 800-1000ms range of speeds. &amp;#x200B; **However... as I said above in the title, I believe that there should be some exceptions.** One being Centurion, the other being Conqueror. Allow me to explain. **Centurion** has neutral heavies that are chargeable, and their uncharged speed is 600ms. But then Cent can't just parry safely. *If he feints, he must fully charge the neutral heavy(1000ms) before being able to feint, allowing enemies to be able to GB him with some prediction required.* In the Testing Grounds, they changed his heavies so that they ranged 700-900ms, then they gave the uncharged heavies 400ms of GB vulnerability. Frankly, I believe that the range should be 600-900ms, and the GB vulnerability for the uncharged heavies should be 100ms. *That way, they wouldn't be used defensively in the same way as Glad's current neutral heavies, but they would still be fast.* &amp;#x200B; **Conqueror**, meanwhile, has 700ms side neutral heavies, and a 800ms top heavy. *All of his heavies have 100ms of GB vulnerability, but he cannot hard-feint them.* That is why I believe that he should keep his GB vulnerability. Now that does not mean that he should not be changed. The reason why he is considered a turtle is due to his parry-option-select. Being able to charge his heavies and parry attacks with next-to-no risk is incredibly unhealthy, even moreso than feintable 100ms-GB-vulnerability neutral heavies. *If Conqueror's charging stance was changed so that he no longer had his parry-option-select, he would be far healthier.* And before anyone says that his neutral heavies would still be oppressive, be reminded that you can just feint-into-light the Conq and punish his attempted parry that way. &amp;#x200B; So yes, that's the reason why I excluded these two heroes from having 400ms of GB vulnerability: their neutral heavies do not operate in the standard way(i.e. forced to fully charge to hard-feint and having no hard-feint option)"
120,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,How do Options from Neutral?,1,dwcfwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/dwcfwk/how_do_options_from_neutral/,2019-11-15 04:08:09,"Would making neutral light / heavy / guardbreak viable openers be a good idea? For the sake of argument lets ignore lack of chain offense and external guard pressure. Following up to my last post where I ranted incoherently on inputs in For Honor and lack thereof. The conclusion coming to that For Honor would have no use for more complex inputs as we are able to comfortably input every option currently in the game as is at the cost of some overlap. Unfortunately those options from neutral are garbage. Lights are a incredibly risky interrupt that leads into chain IF it isn't blocked. Heavies are a uphill battle against option selects that lead into chain. Guard breaks catch MOST heavies on a complete read (gb speed/vulnerability 1:1) and can only punished in the same manner. Not to mention punishes such as shinobi and valk places neutral risk reward ratio somewhere around 5:4 at best and 10:3 at worst. Characters with viable openers reduce the risk of being punished by circumventing the whole ordeal with bashes, traps, and heavy feints with a extra property to cover for some of the many defensive options vs a raw heavy. The ability to safely access chain pressure is incredibly rare and dependent on unique tools in a characters moveset relegating all the other neutral options for defense. What if those neutral options such as neutral lights / heavies / guardbreaks or the combination of the three allowed for chain access at a LOW risk. Would a combinations of a universal opener in addition to a unique opener be too much neutral offense? Would filling out the rest of the cast with a ""unique"" way to safely access their chain and leaving the rest as is be a better alternative? Would it prove too problematic as neutral attacks also serve as defensive options. ( 400ms light interrupt, 100ms gb vulnerable heavies just to name the two that are NOT option selects) Would it be worth while to retool lights / heavies / guradbreaks into a viable low risk opener that everyone can use to access chains from neutral?"

This is mostly an interruption tool, so the damage is decreased to balance this attack. - Opening side light damage increased to 16 (from 15). Allows LB to kill pikemen in a light then heavy. - Opening side light range slightly increased. Gives this attack some more use. - New move: Impaling Charge Alternate. Input: forward dodge + heavy. Can be accessed 100  300ms into the dodge. Speed: 600ms. Same qualities as other impales, only coming from the left. Gives LB a potential roll-catcher. Chain Attacks - Chain side light damage increased to 17 (from 15). Increases the damage of shove. - Chain side heavy speed increased to 767ms (from 800ms). Should give this move 100ms GB vulnerability (from 400ms), improving the safety of side light into heavy. - Finisher side heavy damage decreased to 35 (from 38). For a 800ms unblockable, this move deals quite a bit of damage, so this is slightly reduced. - Finisher top heavy tracks early dodges. Prevents this move from being safely countered. - Finisher top heavy has hyper armor from 300ms. Gives this move a separate use in team-fights, as well as preventing interruption in general. - Swift Justice finisher removed. This move only makes LBs top unblockable overtuned. Longarm - Finisher recoveries can be cancelled with Longarm. Currently, after the unblockable the ability to shove has little offensive use, but rather makes the move safer from GB. This however allows LB to continue his offense, by mixing up between shove and Longarm, only being limited by his stamina and Longarms long recovery. Shove - Improved tracking. Allows for consistent target-swapping. - Recovery to block/parry increased by 100ms (from 500 to 600ms). Decreases the safety of LBs shove. - Recovery to dodge decreased by 100ms (from 800 to 700ms). Balances the additional changes to shove. - Hyper-armor from 200-500ms (from 100-500ms). Decreases the safety of LBs shove. - Forward shove can be activated 100ms into the dodge (from 300ms). Links with the next change. - Forward shove speed increased to 600ms (from 700ms). Reduces the overall time for forward shove to 700ms (from 1000ms), while leaving side shoves untouched. This does not make the move competitively viable, but gives some quality of life. If the move were competitively viable offensively, LBs kit would be too strong. - Can be accessed after a parry via GB input. Gives the option for slightly more stamina damage and linking straight into finishers, but with less confirmed damage. Parry Follow-ups - Blind Justice has hyper-armor from 300ms. Gives this move a use in team-fights, as well as preventing interruption in general. - Blind Justice damage increased to 40. An overall damage nerf from 50. - Blind Justice now acts as a chain-starter. Improves LBs flow of offense. - Make Way damage increased to 25. Brings this move on par with JJs parry zone. - Make Way stamina cost decreased to 45 (from 60). As a parry follow-up, this uses up too much stamina. - Impale stamina cost on block reduced to 60 (from 105). Also applies to impaling charge. Reduces how often LB will be put OOS from this being blocked. - Impale is now enhanced, as with other heavy attacks. Also applies to impaling charge. This is simply to add consistency. - Impale can no longer traditionally wallsplat. Also applies to impaling charge. Reduces both the strength of LBs heavy parries and gank. - Impale applies 18 bleed damage (3 ticks of 6) upon contact with a wall, very briefly holding the opponent in place (guarantees ally attack). Also applies to impaling charge. This still allows LBs impale a use, and reduces the overall heavy parry punish to 28 (from 40), and still allows LB his impale gank, while no longer guaranteeing Longarm. - New move: Death Sentence (I dont do names). Input: right heavy. Can be accessed early into the parry. Qualities: 700ms, unblockable, 20 damage, drains 12 stamina and executes. Same animation as finisher side heavy. As LB revolves around parries, it makes sense for him to be able to execute off any parry, and this makes all impales consistent, in that they always come from the left. Additionally, this gives LB the option to opt for shove mix-ups, giving him a total of 6 options off a parry (Blind Justice, Impale, Death Sentence, Light, Make Way and Shove). Version B Basic Attacks - Opening top light damage reduced to 12 (from 15). This is mostly an interruption tool, so the damage is decreased to balance this attack. - Opening side light damage increased to 18 (from 15). Allows LB to kill pikemen in a light then heavy. Also works together with LBs rebalanced impale. - New move: Impaling Charge Alternate. Input: forward dodge + heavy. Can be accessed 100  300ms into the dodge. Speed: 600ms. Same qualities as other impales, only coming from the left. Gives LB a potential roll-catcher. Chain Attacks - Chain side light damage increased to 17 (from 15). Increases the damage of shove. - Chain side heavy speed increased to 700ms (from 800ms). Should give this move 100ms GB vulnerability (from 400ms), improving the safety of side light into heavy. The additional speed increase may also give this move increased utility. - Chain side heavy damage reduced to 28 (from 30). Balances the new speed-damage ratio. - Finisher side heavy damage decreased to 35 (from 38). For a 800ms unblockable, this move deals quite a bit of damage, so this is slightly reduced. - Finisher top heavy tracks early dodges. Prevents this move from being safely countered. - Finisher top heavy can be soft-feinted into a parry between 300  700ms. Not sure if this is possible, but this allows an easier time baiting interruptions for light parries, fitting nicely with LBs theme. - Swift Justice finisher removed. This move only makes LBs top unblockable overtuned. Longarm - Finisher recoveries can be cancelled with Longarm. Currently, after the unblockable the ability to shove has little offensive use, but rather makes the move safer from GB. This however allows LB to continue his offense, by mixing up between shove and Longarm, only being limited by his stamina and Longarms long recovery. Shove - Improved tracking.

This is simply to add consistency. - Impale now only guarantees a light. Also applies to impaling charge. Impale can still be used to guarantee an ally heavy, similar to Hitos sweep, but is no longer overtuned. This also reduces the max heavy parry punish to 28 (from 40), keeping the max punish from being overtuned but still strong. - New move: Death Sentence (I dont do names). Input: right heavy. Can be accessed early into the parry. Qualities: 700ms, unblockable, 20 damage, drains 12 stamina and executes. Same animation as finisher side heavy. As LB revolves around parries, it makes sense for him to be able to execute off any parry, and this makes all impales consistent, in that they always come from the left. Additionally, this gives LB the option to opt for shove mix-ups, giving him a total of 6 options off a parry (Blind Justice, Impale, Death Sentence, Light, Make Way and Shove). TL;DR of both versions: Improved Pikeman clear, max heavy parry 28 (from 40), max light parry 40 (from 50), shove offensively stronger but less safe, 2 new moves, slightly improved chain offense, and more options off a parry."

123,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Some small QoL buffs to some heroes,1,dyxeap,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/dyxeap/some_small_qol_buffs_to_some_heroes/,2019-11-20 16:23:57,"The heroes I'm targeting are the ones I think need these QoL tweaks to feel at the least, fun to play in the current environment. All these buffs are additional to what the characters already have. I'll be honest, a lot of changes here aren't simply speeding up attacks by 100 ms (which would help greatly). The main reason for such is that thanks to our experiences with Raider and Jian Jung, speeding up attacks without the proper animations made for these faster attacks will result in frustration rather than enjoyable play. Remaking animations for old characters seem to be a very low priority for Ubisoft, and I can imagine that they'd rather animate a new character (which would turn a profit) rather than make an old one mildly better. I personally believe a lot of the cast already have the tool-kits to keep up in a competitive environment, they're simply too inflexible with the tools they have. Increasing speed, chip damage increases, reducing recovery, adding properties to their basic attacks, and/or allowing heroes to delay attacks by a little bit would do wonders in making the older heroes feel much better to play. **Shugoki**: * Headbutt is a chain starter now * Adversely: Orange color and Unblockable symbol don't appear until 100 ms later into the attack animation * Headbutt is 566 ms now from 600 ms * Stun now lasts 1500 ms from 400 ms **Nobushi**: * Cobra Strike counts as a chain starter * Cobra Strike can chain into Kick * Sidewinder Form chains into heavy finisher * Viper's Retreat is now undodgable * Chain lights are 466 ms now from 500 ms * Heavy finishers are now undodgable * Hidden Stance now hides the first 100 ms of all moves that can come out of it (includes the kick; orange glow and symbol won't appear until 100 ms after the attack starts) * Hidden Stance heavies are undodgeable and chain into heavy finishers * Chip damage increased to 30% **Peacekeeper**: * Peacekeeper can now additionally soft-feint into a Guard Break or a Dodge on the second part of her zone * Top-heavy-feint-into-Dagger Cancel now comes from the Right Guard Stance * Other option: Top-heavy-feint-into-Dagger Cancel is now unblockable. * Dodge attacks input are now a variable 200-500 ms input instead of a set 300 ms into dodge * Dashing Thrust and Sidestep Strike are now are undodgable and both count as a chain starter * All heavy soft-feint options now have a variable input of 300-500 ms (was 400 ms only) * Can now cancel the recovery of Deep Gouge and Dagger Cancel with a dodge **Warden**: * Superior Block Light active is now 300 ms (was 200 ms) * Unblockable top heavy finisher is now 900 ms (was 1100 ms) **Orochi**: * Storm Rush can be soft-feinted into a dodge or GB. All side attacks are undodgeable, top attack is unblockable. * Stamina costs halved: 9 stamina to enter, 7 on hit, 9 on block, 15 on miss, 10 on feint * Riptide Strike has 100 ms Guard Break vulnerability, only gives a heavy parry punish (light attack on successful parry) Alternative Orochi buff (no unblockables): * Storm Rush can be soft-feinted into a dodge or GB. * Stamina costs halved: 9 stamina to enter, 7 on hit, 9 on block, 15 on miss, 10 on feint * Storm Rush damage increased to 22 from 17 * Top opener heavy can be soft-feinted into any side stance 400 ms light. This move is a chain starter * Riptide Strike has 100 ms Guard Break vulnerability, only gives a heavy parry punish (light attack on successful parry) * Finisher lights are now enhanced * Lightning Strike and Zephyr Slash are now enhanced * Chip damage increased to 30%"

It takes 30+ stamina to do 38 damage (bleed included). Her side heavies do 20 damage, and top does 23. The reason why I didnt include the +10 bleed damage is because the deep gouge gives no incentive to continue the chain if you landed a heavy. Her kit lacks good defense. She's kinda like Orochi but with less damage, more GB vulnerability on her heavies, less mixups, less moves, and more stamina consumption on her moves. Why dont we give PK sonething that suits her kit, gives her a defensive buff and keep the rest as it is. She still needs 30 stamina to do the bleed attacks, but this just adds a new element to her kit."

The Devils Dance Devils Dance unblockable attack animation is most comparable from the tempest chained side heavy, as it has almost the exact frame time. I cant think of many differences. Though I think it would be nice if we could get a different animation, and mo-cap for it. Snake Eyes While he does the spin there will be a way to tell from which direction hes going to hit you from, as he will rest his swords on his right shoulder for the right spin, and left for the left spin. For the side dodge hell do a spin about half way (and when you enter Devils Dance itll complete the spin) For the forward dodge spin hell do a stumble and have his back bent slightly, and on the second part of the stumble he falls forward into the devils dance top unblockable. ***Discussion*** For Devil's Dance as it's a new chain with lots of dynamics I believe the stamina cost should go through balancing checks with devs before implemented. Though I don't think the recommended stamina cost is bad. Because of certain technical difficulties I will be adding more to this later. (this will also give me a chance to see what the community doesn't understand, and clarify more in depth)"
126,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,My Centurion Rework idea,1,e1irz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/e1irz8/my_centurion_rework_idea/,2019-11-26 03:54:15,"If you notice any spelling/grammar mistakes, feel free to point them out. &amp;#x200B; Centurion has long been one of, if not, the worst character in the game, with a notable exception being pre-rework Shugoki. He has long been in need of a rework, and with more and more characters becoming viable, and more already viable ones being released, the need has only grown. Being a Centurion main, I believe I am qualified to at least propose a rework for Centurion that not only makes him viable and fun, but also makes him live up to his stamina draining vanguard-assassin hybrid description. For the majority of this modest proposal, I will be referring to Centurion as Cent, as that is how I normally refer to him as. ### Foreword I would like to say beforehand that the Cent rework we saw in the open test was good in that it made him viable, but lacking in that it left out certain aspects of his kit, and made him feel like a one-trick pony, almost like Warden. I aim to create a slightly more complex character that has more tools for more situations while not leaving any part of his kit unmentioned. ## Lights Cents lights have long been near useless, with the exception of his opener light (but even thats pushing it). This is mainly because the only thing his lights lead into besides a heavy is a quick flow guardbreak which, against anyone with more minutes in this game than there are degrees at room temperature, is useless. My proposal for his lights are as follows: * Opener lights are 466ms, deal 15 damage, and are enhanced on top guard * Second chain lights are 466ms, deal 16 damage, and are enhanced on all guards * Third chain lights are 500ms, deal 17 damage, and are enhanced on all guards Making the top light opener enhanced changes up the rule of side lights being enhanced only, like with Warlord or Lawbringer. Making the opener 466ms makes it slightly more usable than a standard 500ms light, while not making them the ever-annoying 400ms. The lights being enhanced in chains and doing damage increasing by 1 makes the 3 light chain more appealing to use, as well as keeping up his chain pressure. Light into guardbreak is completely replaced by light into Legion Kick. Giving his lights more horizontal reach is something that would help Cent greatly, especially in 1vX situations. In his animations, Cent is clearly swinging in an arc that would hit to his side, yet the lights never do this. ## Heavies Cents heavies are often the only kind of attack youll see a Cent do, as they are much more ideal to use over his lights in their current state. Not much is needed to make his heavies more viable, but there are some notable things that can be done regardless: * Heavy openers are now 700ms, deal 30 damage when uncharged, and have more forward movement * Second heavies are now 500ms (all sides), deal 30 damage when uncharged, and have more forward movement * Lions Pounce (charged heavy opener) is now 900ms and deals 35 damage * Imperial Might (charged chain heavy) is now 1200ms and deals 35 damage, with unblockable starting at 733ms * Centurions Zone attack is the same with the exception that the 2nd and 3rd hit can be feinted * Eagles Talons now does 45 damage, all else is the same The changes listed are a mix of changes for balance and changes for viability. Making his opener heavies 700ms means he cant get a heavy off heavy parry, but making Lions Pounce 900ms means he can get a charged heavy off light parry. Changing the unblockable to start at 733ms allows us to use normal feint timing while making the unblockable visible before feinting, as to give his soft feint to guardbreak more usefulness, and give him more out of stamina pressure. All heavies also have the normal 400ms of guardbreak vulnerability. I also would like to completely gut Eagles Fury, as it is completely and utterly useless outside of trading with other sprint attacks, as it has hyper armor in the late stage of the animation. Instead, I would like to propose a forward dash attack similar to what we see in the Veni Vidi Vici execution (a jump forward, stabbing his opponents shoulder while landing behind them). Making this fast would be the key as well as giving it decent range. This attack would have no hyper armor and could lead to an execution if it is the killing blow. * Eagles Dive is 433ms, does 25 damage, and moves you behind your opponent Keep in mind it is the indicator that is 433ms, as the whole attack can only be done a dodge forward or sprinting, which are dead giveaways. Having it move you behind your opponent could add a little bit of movement to a fight, and make you look cool doing it. If this move is done while your opponent's back is to the wall, you could use it to get behind them, and if you successfully guardbreak them for whatever reason, you would be closer to the wall and more likely to get a wallsplat. Eagles Dive should be given enough range to catch people rolling away from the Jab mixup (see mixup details under Bashes section). Another thing of note is that you still move behind your opponent if it is the killing blow, and you will begin the execution from behind them. ## Bashes In his current state, Cents bashes except for his parry counter and Lions Roar are virtually useless. Legion Kick is 600ms and can only be done on a giveaway forward dodge, and can be dodged on reaction to unblockable. His uncharged jab is also about 700ms and can only be done after a heavy. It is also my belief that his jab follows the absolutely ridiculously strict charge timing that can be seen on Shinobis heavies. I believe this for two reasons; his parry counter has that strict timing, and Shinobi came out at the same time as Cent. All complaints aside, these changes to his various bashes, as well as a couple of new ones will help make Cent a viable character: * Legion Kick is now 600ms, does the same stamina damage as current, confirms a light, and is now done on back+guardbreak, or just guardbreak when after a light (can be followed up with an attack on whiff) * Jab is now 700ms, can be feinted 333ms into the attack, does the same stamina damage as current, and confirms a light (only done after heavy) * Charged Jab is now 1200ms and can be feinted 400ms before impact, does the same stamina damage as current, and knocks down opponents * Parry Counter now has much more lenient timing, and only confirms a light or Legion Kick, all else is the same In addition to the changes to the current bashes, I would like to suggest two more bashes: * Imperial Strength is 533ms, does the same stamina damage as Legion Kick, cannot be feinted, and confirms a light (side dodge+guardbreak) * Imperial Strength is a side dodge bash that is meant to deal stamina damage. The animation is a shoulder bash like Warden, but is more similar to Cents forward throw animation * Imperial Force is 700ms, does 30 stamina damage, blinds, cannot be feinted, and knocks opponents down if it puts them out of stamina (press guardbreak after a throw) * Imperial Force was an idea suggested to me by a friend of mine, and we both think it would fit Cent quite well. The animation is Centurion rushing forward and close lining his opponent into the wall. It is meant to give Cent more methods of stamina drain outside of Parry Counter and Legion Kick, as well knock them down if it puts them out of stamina. It only does 30 stamina damage as it would probably be combined with two bashes of Lions Roar and a throw. It is only confirmed on wallsplat, and will punish you for bad spacing as it gives the opponent a free guardbreak if it whiffs (redirect from last paragraph under Heavies is in this paragraph) The changes and additional moves suggested are to give Cent more options for draining his opponents stamina, as well as make his bashes more viable is neutral, instead of only being usable when confirmed. Legion Kick now being on back+guardbreak puts it on the same level as Glads toe stab and Jorms neutral bash, not impossible to dodge, but more viable than its current state. (Redirect here) The changes to Jab make it act more like Wardens shoulder bash, as Charged Jab tracks opponents who dodged on normal Jab timing, and normal Jab will hit those who are expecting a Charged Jab. Jab can also be feinted to punish dodge attacks. Opponents rolling away from the mixup entirely could be caught by Eagle's Dive. Parry Counter now only confirms a light as to not bypass the efforts made to not allow a heavy on heavy parry, although it still wallsplats for a charged heavy. The more lenient timing would bring it in line with things like Jorms parry counter. Imperial Strength gives centurion the ability to punish bashes like Black Priors Tenebris Rising or Conquerers Shield Bash that would normally be safe on whiff. Imperial Strength can be baited and punished with dodge and guardbreak. Imperial Force simply allows for more options for stamina drain. ## Cutscene I should make it clear that the pin from charged heavies no longer confirms any punch afterward, as to remove the cutscene which is both unhealthy for the game and is not engaging for the victim or the one doing it. With the changes listed earlier, you might notice that a pseudo cutscene is possible (Lions pounce/Imperial Might into charged jab, where opponent dodges on uncharged jab timing, into Eagles Talons), this is not confirmed, however, and is done by making a read against your opponent, which is engaging for both parties. ## Parry * Heavy parry confirms a light or Legion Kick * Light parry confirms a Lions Pounce * All parries confirm a Parry Counter ## Guardbreak * Lions Pounce and Lions Roar are confirmed off guardbreak ## Wallsplat * Lions Pounce, Imperial Might, and Imperial Force are confirmed on wallsplat ### Chains * Light, light, light * Light, light, heavy * Light, heavy, heavy * Heavy, heavy ### Execution This is simply my idea for a new Cent execution. Centurion first knocks his opponent down like in the Inglorious Execution execution but then proceeds to beat the sh\*t out of his opponent (think wardens punch execution, but he doesnt stop punching). I believe this execution, combined with the Glowing Eyes effect, would be a perfect fit for Cent and would make all those who play him very, very happy."

129,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"A weirdly thought out Orochi Rework , which is needlessly complicated.",1,e44p0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/e44p0h/a_weirdly_thought_out_orochi_rework_which_is/,2019-12-01 09:30:24,"While I was working on a Peacekeeper Guide I found myself thinking more and more about Orochi. Knowing that the devs specified how they don't like the idea of adding a bash or something similar I struggled to search for a way to make him at least more interesting without changing him too much. I don't know if I've actually found the way to make him more viable so this isn't the same ""do this to make him more viable"" but rather a discussion on what you think about my ideas. This will become quite complicated and perhaps needlessly so but that's because I can't just throw in the easy, give him a bash answer so I had to look for a work around. &amp;#x200B; # Light Attacks * His light attack chains are the bread and butter of his kit. Although the casual player base calls Orochi a light spammer he is quite bad at it. In a better world where we would be ready for more drastic changes and faster offensive the values I would have change would be truly un-reactable, by that I mean 366 and faster attacks, but since that is very unlikely to happen I will stop at only 400ms attack, but read as if it is written 366 or faster. **Openers** * The top light opener is the fastest of the three but also the one that does more damage but at the cost of consuming one light attack to deal 18 damage overall. Since this chain costs two lights but deals more damage I would make Orochi's offense move around. Top light will become a 500ms light attack, used mainly for punishes which deals 14 initial damage and 8 guaranteed damage in case you want to use the second guaranteed light. I increase the damage on the second light so that you will have to choose between throwing out the zone attack, the side lights or the top light as a punish after a heavy parry. 1. The top light would be the biggest punish dealing 22 damage but you will be able to get only into your light finisher thus having less offensive potential, your zone would do 20 damage but it would cost quite a lot of stamina and your side lights would do only 15 damage but they would be able to chain into second and third light attacks. * Side light openers become 466 and deal 15 damage. (Returning to the idea of the better world, orochi would have 400ms side light openers so that there would be more of a guessing game between where the opener would start from but that would also making him oppressively annoying as he would have a great interrupting tool with bidirectional 400ms lights. That is the problem we face without a bash to get him into his light chain.) * Included amongst the light openers shall be the zone. It remains a 20 damage heavy attack that comes out 466ms fast. The cost of the zone attack is reduced to 40 stamina, it keeps it's enhanced properties and now it can chain. The weird thing the devs did was to give Orochi a 466 zone and top light but the zone doesn't chain thus it doesn't even work as a (pseudo) 50/50 between the two. Although side lights are now 466 too, the zone would have the enhanced property, thus you will be able to get into your chained lights easier against a turtle. **Chained lights** * Chain lights will always suffer the huge risk low reward problem. I shall keep them at 12 damage and they shall all be 400ms, although and this will be the last time I repeat myself, the should be truly un-reactable at 366 or lower. * Light finishers become standardised at 15 damage, 400m. Since his side lights are the moment are 466 it makes them less usable since at least they will be easier to block. Turning them into proper 400ms lights should do the job as it stands now. If an orochi manages to hit all three hits of his light chains he would do a total of 42 damage. One light parry would do around 35 damage on average and you have three chances to get one so I think the damage to risk ratio is pretty balanced considering the current situation. Whether we will have a damage nerf all around the board or a HP buff is unknown so I shall keep these values. &amp;#x200B; # Heavy attacks * His heavy attacks are strong and one could even say quite balanced if not for the fact that they lack the pressure of being unblockable or undodgeable. Doing to many changes here would be unnecessary but I will do it anyways so that I may analise better his kit. **Openers** * Once again I find myself in the way of baffling game design, the top heavy opener is 700ms and deals 35 damage. It is quite a good move, especially compared to the side heavies but making all his heavy openers 700 would be an obnoxious buff. It would be strong indeed but also very annoying as Aramusha proves us since 700ms heavies, even on weaker characters are quite strong since feint to GB bounces off them thus making them a defensive tool rather than an offensive one. Thus, I will just invert the damage values. Top heavy now deals 30 damage and side heavy deals 35 damage, although 33 would be balanced as well. To concentrate all the changes in one sentence, top heavy deals 30 damage, 700ms, 12 stamina. Side heavy deals 33 damage, 800ms, 12 stamina. Top heavy can still be used as an option select on read when the enemy wants to do a heavy feint into GB from the left or the right. * Heavy openers can now be chained into second chain lights since all Orochi wants is to be able to get into his offense and maintain it. The damage output might increase quite a lot from this change so the heavies might be required to be lowered, however nuxia can chain her heavies into second and third lights with only 6 less damage if she lands all the hits so this can't be that world breaking. **Finishers** * Chained pressure is good and having stronger chain pressure that can't be stopped by a random external GB mid animation is a nice thing to have, thus all his heavies become 700ms. Warlord has 700ms heavies and they deal 35-40 damage. Giving Orochi just slightly faster heavies which are less likely to be interrupted by a random GB will be better. * Top heavy will remain special since it will continue dealing 35 damage while side heavies will continue dealing only 30 damage but they will be speed up to 700ms. Stamina cost remains 12 until the devs decide to change the stamina values, this is not a rework the whole game post. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # Dodge attacks * Orochi has light dodge attacks that are uncomfortably slow. Considering that shaman has 500ms heavy dodge attacks that deal even more damage than his it would be unreasonable not to make them 500ms. But before all that: **Forward Dodge attack** * I wanted to give him an opener without making his light openers obnoxious to deal with since they can interrupt everything. Thus I was thinking of giving orochi a forward dodge attack capable of hitting from all directions, somewhat like shamans. His top light attack becomes a 17 damage, 500ms undodgeable. His forward dodge side light attacks are 12 damage 400ms light attacks. The top can be used to catch back dodges and the sides are a 50/50 between the two sides, something like how Zhanhu's dodge work. This will not be that huge of a change since shaman already has a tri-directional forward dodge attack, although slower, thus imputing the attack won't be difficult and it won't be confused with side dodge attacks since the forward side lights won't be undodgeable. The dodge attack can be initiated as it is now between 200-500 ms into the forward dodge. **Side Dodge attacks** * They are speed up to 500ms and become enhanced on block thus allowing you to continue your offence even against bashes with very low recovery. **Back Dodge attacks:** **Riptide strike** * Riptide strike now becomes enhanced and gains the undodgeable property. It's animation is speed up to 500ms although that won't solve it's problem. It is too easy to bait out on an Orochi that tries to use it since it is technically a 900ms light with a 300ms hidden indicator at the moment. There is also the problem with it's high GB vulnerability. * The two ways I've thought about are: 1. Just speed it up even more thus making it at least harder to parry once baited out but that won't solve much. 2. Make orochi capable of holding down the light button after the back dodge and release it to unleash a 400ms light attack (read as 300) In this second case if the opponent baits it out he is safe since he can hold it and it is fast enough to punish the opponent in case he tries to approach and hit Orochi out of it. Since it is a 400ms holding attack it will trade with opponent's lights if they use them 22&gt; most lights and it will most likely than not break the opponent out of a heavy if they try to use that. The Orochi will have to throw the light if he want to get out of the stance however but the recoveries should be very small as not to punish him. Only his blocking recovery should be 600ms thus he would have to choose between risking to be hit by a light attack or throw a light attack of his own to stop the opponent. **Storm Rush** * Although the forward dodge light becomes the better version of this move I will not remove storm rush from his moveset. * First of all, since this is a harder to access, easier to interrupt move it will deal more damage. Both left and right side attacks will now be 300ms 17 damage heavies. His top heavy will remain undodgeable and it will now deal 20 damage. There shall not be any additional stamina cost after using this move. It will cost 12 stamina to enter, 3 stamina per second to hold and it will cost no stamina on hit, block or whiff. Standard stamina consumption on feint. * You can now chain your second chain lights after landing this attack. * You can now chain a dodge or dodge attack after landing this move. (Chaining this move into itself is the desired outcome) * Animation change. It is too easy and obvious when you are going to do a storm rush thus the animation receives a small change. Orochi will now throw a smoke bomb the same way Aramusha and Shinobi do during their respective dodge attacks or dodges to confuse the enemy. Orochi will also cover more ground as the move is about to hit thus making it harder to break him out on reaction since he will be at a similar distance when he is at the latest possible to feint the move and when the move will hit. As to not be a dead giveaway, the smoke bomb will be thrown just before the last moment to feint the attack thus not allowing the opponent to read you by animations. &amp;#x200B; **Thought out rework is done. Here come the mad ramblings that you shouldn't take too serious, unless (   ).** * Hurricane Blast now deals 35 damage. After every second chain light you can access Hurricane Blast. Besides the damage value change it retains all properties but it can be soft feinted only into a light instead of a Wind Gust, the normal dodge or a GB. (yes, it will be useless to chose it instead of the Wind gust after a deflect). Hurricane Blast costs 40 stamina if used after a chain light. Hurricane Blast can be chained after a Wind Gust, deals 50 damage and costs only 12 stamina, to incentivise deflecting. It has instant, as in 0ms hyper armour if chained after a deflect but doesn't have hyper armour if used after a chained light. I know a 900ms unblockable heavy that can be soft feinted into everything can be a little ridiculous so I kept it here in the ""what is he even talking about section"" since it could be too strong although it can be accessed only after two landed lights. * You can use dodge attacks mid chain to spice up the timings and to catch dodge attacks, punish hyper armour. This would be a nice change but we already have a lot of mid chain dodge characters. I'd rather say, give all dodge specialists, such as Tiandi, Zhanhu and Orochi the mid chain and chain finisher recovery dodge attack. &amp;#x200B; That's all, I might have went on a tangent and made everything too complicated, but that's kind of the point since the devs won't give us a simple bash. Don't take it too serious since I made it just to unwind as I am working on a PK guide and I was bored talking only about her. Take this as a vanity project only to see if I'm still reasonable."

I think): Chip damage is doubled (40% instead of 20%) Guard break duration increased to 800ms (from 700ms, allows a side heavy still) **Zone Attack:** Chain zone damage increased to 10 (from 5) **Light Attacks:** All Chain lights forward tracking increased, speed increased to 466ms (from 500ms), now are enhanced (to stop it from missing when you delay it or the opponent walks backwards) **Heavy Attacks:** Opener side heavy speed increased to 800ms (from 700ms) Opener top heavy speed increased to 900ms (from 800ms) Opener top heavy guard break vulnerability increased to 400ms (from 100ms, one less set of option selects) Chain top heavy speed reduced to 700ms (from 900ms) Chain side heavy speed reduced to 700ms (from 800ms, to make it harder to differentiate between chain lights and heavies) **Charged Heavies:** Add a minimum charge time (I dont know how what the number should be, but enough to make sure that his charged attack isnt obscenely safe) Opener side charged heavy speed increased to 800ms (from 700ms) Opener top charged heavy speed increased to 900ms (from 800ms) Opener top charged heavy guard break vulnerability increased to 400ms (from 100ms, just to keep them in line with the regular heavy attacks) Side charged heavy damage increase to 36 (from 33) While charging, guard switch speed is reduced to 100ms (from 300ms), blocking will no longer stop your charge (a little quality of life) **Shield Bash Mixup:** Speed increased to 600ms (from 800ms) Stamina damage reduced to 12 (from 29) **Shield Upercut:** Speed increased to 600ms (from 800ms) Stamina damage reduced to 12 (from 29) The idea is you have your shield bash opener, then keep mixing it up with lights, heavies and shield upercuts after that to chip them down or deal straight damage when they miss a parry. Not sure how ridiculous this would be with the punch through feat, I mean, how is 80% chip damage for a tier 3 feat (8-15 chip damage on a light and 10-27 damage on a heavy depending on whether or not you have the feat active)?"

Insane parry punish,super safe defensive tool (dodge bash). Most people agreed that those thing could get some nerf, in my opinion his parry should do lower damage and his dodge bash (only dodge bash) has a little bit GB vulnerability at start up, so he can't just use it to safely avoid some mix-up without being punish. To compensate his nerf, he will get a offense buff, that is allow him to feint his neutral shove. His neutral shove is 700ms, same as warden bash, with the ability to feint, his shove will serve as a weaker version of Warden's bash, but it will help Lawbringer access to his chain and unblockable heavy much easier."

Look, everyone in this sub is smart enough to know that Conqueror is a defensive powerhouse. It can get to the point where non bash offense is borderline useless against a good Conqueror player. With so many option selects, a full block that guarantees damage for blocking that is completely safe due to the 200ms startup and exit time, and a really safe bash with variable timings to it, Conqueror has such an amazing kit defensively, but offensively he is lacking. Conqueror has the same problem as Lawbringer currently: He cannot sustain offense. He may get a few bashes off, maybe a light or two, then it's back to playing passively and shutting down your opponents offense completely. Why not change Conqueror in a way that makes him more of an oppressive hero rather than a unkillable tank? **I have come up with i list of changes that** ***I*** **think would improve on his current situation:** * Remove Parry Frames from charged heavy startup *We all know why this has to go. If a Conqueror consistently tries to parry on light timing by charging a heavy, he is completely safe. If it's a light, he gets the parry. If it isn't, he can just cancel the charge, or trade with superior block heavies.* &amp;#x200B; * Remove Guard Swap On Dodge *Because his guard switches on a dodge, Conqueror can make some things that are very hard to react to... not hard to react to at all, and can escape a lot of mix-ups by just dodging into an attack.* &amp;#x200B; * Remove GB Immunity from heavies *GB immunity just adds onto Conqueror's ridiculously powerful defensive tools. This ability shuts down a lot of unblockable 50/50s* &amp;#x200B; * Speed up unblockable charged heavies. * Remove stamina drain from charging heavies * Increase movement speed while charging heavies in order to catch up to heros that back pedal away. * Retain Charge momentum with a forward dodge *This is, of course, to keep pressure and not allow the opponent to just back dodge out of the mix-up* &amp;#x200B; * Can counter GB while charging * Shield bash while charging a heavy is faster * blocking no longer depletes charge * Heavy into bash soft feint is a tad bit faster &amp;#x200B; * **Give the ability to charge chained heavies** *Good lord, this one simple ability would give Conqueror so much variety in his chains that it would make the character much more fun to play. This change would increase the flow of the fight, not resetting to neutral every 5 seconds. This would also make conqueror's offense much better, as being able to mix charged unblockable heavies into your chains would force reactions, and throw some people off.* &amp;#x200B; * Chained top light speed increased to 433ms * ""Momentum"" mechanic: The more attacks thrown in a single chain, the more damage they deal, up to a maximum of 10 more damage. *For instance, if I start a light chain, and continue this infinite light chain for I dunno, say about 10 light attacks, then the last few light attacks would deal more damage than the first few due to momentum. This would see people trying to throw out more attacks in order to get the damage boost, and in turn, would allow other players to counter attack. This also rewards the Conqueror for landing hits, blocked or not, the momentum will continue to build up. And like, come on, if you're not parrying a guy that's just spamming attacks at you over and over again, why are you even playing at this point?* &amp;#x200B; * Increase full block recovery speed to 300ms *This is mainly to experiment with the timing for guardbreak vulnerability. This move shouldn't be used as an option select, but rather a prediction tool to get good damage in and continue a chain.* &amp;#x200B; **Anyways, that's all I have really. Feel free to let me know what you think, and what changes you would make. I don't think anyone really likes the way Conqueror is played...**"

135,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Changes Gladiator still needs,6,dhlpfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/dhlpfs/changes_gladiator_still_needs/,2019-10-14 15:45:30,"**Heavies** The opener heavy needs to have it's GB vulnerability increased, to remove the guard break invulnerability issue. (It should have at least 300 ms of vulnerability.) - **Chain/Parry pressure** Currently, Glad has close to no chain pressure (on heavy attacks, light attacks are okay in this regard), especially after a dodge bash or parry bash, as the stun effect doesn't last long enough for any meaningful mixups. I propose a new move be made for gladiator, that allows him to chain a punch off of any heavy attack, even if blocked. However, this bash will *not* guarantee anything, and will be different from the normal sucker punch off of a dodge. This move can count as the first hit in the chain, and allow the toe stab, skewer or another heavy to be chained from it. The parry bash will work the same way. However, the stamina damage should be increased. Sucker Punch will remain as is, and allow a way to enter this mixup. - **Skewer** Skewer is an absolutely useless unblockable, sure it may give a nice reward for landing it, but the risks carried with it are way too high. If you use it in the middle of a chain, say goodbye to your stamina. For this move, I feel that the animation needs to be changed; so that the feint is less obvious. Lower the stamina penalty as well, and allow the punch to be chained off of Skewer. The punch I am talking about is the punch you are able to do if you pin an enemy against a wall with Skewer, which ""should"" guarantee a heavy. What I'm suggesting is that you should be able to punch regardless if you have them pinned against a wall or not. The punch would knock them back a small distance (Think Orochi's throw distance), and it will also wall splat, enabling it to always guarantee a heavy. - **Zone Attack** Now with all of these changes, there needs to be a nerf somewhere, and that is the zone attack. I feel that a neat change for the zone would be that it knocks back the opponent you are currently locked on to, and out of range of the second attack. However the second attack will hit in a 260 degree angle around you (This lets the attack hit people that are standing to the side of you, and a little further back, but not enemies directly behind you.) This'll make the move less oppressive in 1v1. It will still be feintable, it will still be 600 ms, you can still option select with it, however the attack after the bash will not be guaranteed. - Overall I think these changes will enable glad to be more ""mix-up intensive"", especially with the stuns and chainable skewer from his bashes."
136,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Things i think should be changed for the better.,44,dj1sxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/dj1sxf/things_i_think_should_be_changed_for_the_better/,2019-10-17 16:24:12,"These are just a few minor changes i think should be made, across all heroes, to improve the health of the game. Keep in mind that, as a human being, i am highly fallible and may make mistakes. If you think you have found one, please point it out. Politely. Also note that i am a casual player. A sensible one, but still. If you have any suggestions, comment them. I can't stop you. &amp;#x200B; 1. GB should be made more consistent. Have you ever tried to GB someone, only to completely miss and get GB'd yourself? Have you ever dodged backwards, only to get GB'd by your opponent teleporting several metres forward to reach you? Because that happens to me all the time. Simply, i suggest changing GB so that it has much more forward movement, even if you miss, but doesn't move you any further forward as part of tracking(but it can still move you from side to side). This should make GB a much easier move to guess distances for, and also stop people from teleporting long distances when they GB. Also, make the GB vulnerability consistent across all heavy attacks. I'm cool with how it works on dodge attacks, but all heavies should have some vulnerability to it. 2. Reduce highest damage, Increase Health. People die way too quickly these days. Raider's heavies can kill you in 1 chain if they all hit. That sort of thing shouldn't be allowed to happen. Basically, increase the HP of all heroes by \~50, and reduce the damage of every move that deals +35 damage by some amount based on what it already deals. Bringing 50 down to 40, etc. This will make every fight a bit longer, and bring down the absurd power held by characters with high damage attacks. 3. Give more stamina. Increase everyone's stamina pools, Increase everyone's stamina damage. This'll make the game consistently faster, without bringing down the power of stamina bullies like Jorm and Glad. Simple. &amp;#x200B; If i think of anything else, i'll just edit the post. Thank you for reading my suggestions."
137,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Over the top Warlord Redesign,153,djwgig,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/djwgig/over_the_top_warlord_redesign/,2019-10-19 11:29:44,"**Disclaimer:** Very long post with massive changes/new moves ahead. I'm well aware that Ubi will never put this much effort into an old character, so this is more wishful thinking than a reasonable, realistic rework suggestion. &amp;#x200B; **Warlords Issues:** One can easily tell that Warlord is one of the original characters with his ancient and clunky kit. He has little flow, lacks a reliable way to punish bashes/low recovery moves and most importantly he's got very meh offense. He does have some neat things going for him like decent parry / OOS punishes, high health ,ledging prowess and pretty good feats in 4v4, but they don't make up for all his shortcomings as many other characters have the same strengths and more. Another issue is that Black Prior is pretty much a more fleshed out Warlord, which means that Warlord needs changes that make him better while also making him more distinct from Bp. The following changes should fix these issues. On top of that the new toys should make you feel like you're playing a Viking of massive size and girth who pushes others around like the milkdrinkers they are. # General changes: &amp;#x200B; **Light/heavy** Warlords lights and heavies do a good job on what they're supposed to do. Superiour block and enhanced property is more than most lights have and finisher heavies are good at trading with the early hyperarmor activation and high damage. Their main issue is that they have zero offensive pressure which makes the enhanced property of the lights kinda wasted. *changes:* * \+ Top light opener and finisher speed/damage changed to be the same as side lights. * \+ Reduced the recovery of missed heavy finishers by 200ms (I don't know the exact values) * \+ Reduced the recovery of heavy finishers on hit and on block by 100ms * \+ Increased forward momentum of heavy finishers by 0.5m * \- Finisher side heavy damage reduced from 40&gt;&gt;35 Effect: Warlord can throw his finishers more often now in teamfights with lesser risk of getting punished during the recovery. As for the offense part, this will be covered with the new moves. While giving him 3-attack chains like Kensei or Valk would be neat, he won't need it and he doesn't look like the type of guy to flail his weapon around all the time. &amp;#x200B; **Headsplitter Leap:** This move is pretty wack overall. It's a free parry/deflect, the headbutt followup/zone mix-up gets negated by characters with active guard during dodges and most importantly, it's useless at catching dodgers/rollers. The following changes apply to both the locked-on and out-of-lock variants. *changes:* * \+ Input window increased from 300ms-400ms into f. dodge &gt;&gt;&gt; 100ms-400ms * \+ Speed increased from 900ms&gt;&gt;&gt;600ms * \+ Range increased by approximately 1m * \+ Counts as chain starter * \- Damage decreased from 35&gt;&gt;25 * \- Can no longer chain into headbutt * \- No longer has hyperarmor * &amp;#x200B; Effect: Headsplitter Leap now acts as a simple tool to catch rollers or join the fight in 4v4 more reliably. The removal of chaining into headbutt might seem lame, but the other changes more than make up for it. &amp;#x200B; **Zone attack:** His zone is pretty good actually, it's a reliable OS select, deals good damage or rather too much as a heavy parry punish and has deceptively long range. *changes:* * \+ Stamina cost reduced from 60&gt;&gt;&gt;40 * \+ Counts as chain starter * \- Damage reduced from 25&gt;&gt;&gt;20 &amp;#x200B; Effect: the damage nerf brings Warlords heavy parry punish more in line with other characters and the 2 buffs allow warlord to continue his offense afterwards without being near OOS. &amp;#x200B; **Headbutt/stab:** Headbutt is not that bad of an opener, Warlords low forward dodge recovery allows him to gb late dodgers and it can only be punished with gb on prediction dodges, that's why i refrain of buffing headbutt too much, i doubt anyone wants Warlord to be yet another forward dodge + gb based character. *changes:* * \+ Can followup with a finisher heavy after landing headbutt ( not confirmed obviously) * \+ stab counts as a chain starter * \+ range increased by 0.5m, side dodge tracking still the same * \+ range of gb after forward dodge also increased by 0.5m * \- stamina damage reduced from 20&gt;&gt;15 Effect: Warlord can use the finisher heavy in 4v4 to punish/trade with enemies that try to to attack him during headbutt&gt;stab. With stab counting as a chain starter, Warlord can continue his offense after a headbutt/full-block stance riposte. The increased range also helps against opponents that are constantly backpedaling outside your light attack range. &amp;#x200B; **Shield counter ( parry counter):** This move is kinda unnecessary as warlord can get a headbutt of any parry for the same amount of stamina damage and damage. The only advantage is that it's slightly faster to perform and costs no stamina. *changes:* * \+ Parry counter knocks target back about the same length as HLs kick * \+ Parry counter hits in a wide arc in front of Warlord * \+ Parry counter restores 40 stamina * \+ Ledges * \- Due to the increased knockback distance, Warlord no longer gets a confirmed followup unless there's a wall behind the enemy. * \- Doesn't wallsplat to prevent 35 damage heavy parry punishes Effect: Shield counter now acts as a ""Don't touch me there"" move when outnumbered to give Warlord some breathing room. This helps Warlord alot when holding positions, which he's not that great at at the moment compared to other heavies like bp or conq. &amp;#x200B; **Full block stance:** Warlords full block stance is a mixed bag. On one hand it has a rather quick startup and costs little stamina but on the other he gets a measly 15 damage of a successful block and it has huge gb vulnerability after releasing it. Also the heavy followup is pretty inconsistent as its only confirmed against high recovery attacks. *changes:* * \+ stab followup damage increased from 15&gt;&gt;&gt;20 (headbutt + stab is unchanged) * \+ reduced gb vulnerability after release from 600ms&gt;&gt;300ms * \+ The recovery of any chain starter can be cancelled with Fbs. * \+ Heavies can be cancelled with Fbs. * \+ Can followup with Parry counter after succesfull block with backwards+gb * \+ Can followup with a UB zone after a succesfull block (still deals 20 damage/40 stamina cost) * \+ Board and blade removed, which allows WL to use regular heavies in Fbs. * \- Stamina cost to enter Fbs increased from 10&gt;&gt;25 Effect: The various Cancel options make Fbs much more accessible and with the increased stab damage WL can choose between the 5 additional damage or the 20 stam damage from headbutt. The Parry counter followup again helps WL hold his ground and regain stamina, while the UB zone followup deals damage at the cost of lotsa stamina. Board and Blade didn't serve much of a purpose and deserves to be dumped. Fbs still looses to feint&gt;gb and only confirms 20 damage at the most as compensation for it's new flexibility. The increased stamina cost ensures that you can't just spam Fbs whenever you feel like it. &amp;#x200B; **Gb throws:** Remember season 1 Warlord with the increase throw distance stat? That was quite the ^(golden) experience. WL still maintains one of the highest throw distances, so there's no need to buff it back to the levels of the old days. *changes:* * \+ Warlord can hold his throws for an additional 100ms in all directions * \- Increased the recovery from forward throw by 100ms * \- Stamina damage when throwing opponent into wall reduced from 60&gt;&gt;&gt;20 Effect: The increased throw distance makes it easier to ledge people on High Fort while the increased recovery prevents Warlord from getting his ridiculous 70 damage Top heavy &gt; Side heavy OOS throw punish. With all the other buffs Warlord doesn't need ludicrous OOS punishes or punishes in general. For Honor still suffers from low stamina pools and high stamina costs/punishes, that's why i'm tuning down all of Warlords ways of dealing stamina damage. &amp;#x200B; **Crashing charge:** In my opinion crashing charge is fine as it is. Sure, it's useless in 1v1 but that not it's purpose. in 2v2 or 4v4 it's useful to disrupt battles and separate enemies so i don't think anything needs to be changed. &amp;#x200B; # New Moves: This is where the fun begins. &amp;#x200B; **Jarls Perseverance:** Animation: Warlord spins around and performs a very wide swipe. *Stats:* * Input: full block stance + gb, comes from your left * Accessibility: Whenever you have access to Full block stance. * Numbers: speed is 800ms, deals 30 damage, can't be feinted, 30 stamina cost, 700ms recovery * Special properties: gains *superarmor 200ms into the attack, if Warlord gets hit by any attack or bash during the move, the attack becomes unblockable, counts as a chain starter.* *Description*: The main purpose of this move is to allow Warlord to punish bashes/grabs etc. whose recoveries are to low to punish with dodge&gt;gb ( fyi: superarmor also works against bashes/grabs compared to hyperarmor). This move fills the same niche as Black Priors Bullwarkcounter with each having their own strenghts. Bullwarkcounter works against everything, except gb and Bp doesn't take any damage when pulling it off, while Warlord does if he decides to trade with an attack. Bp can also cancel the recovery of his finisheres while WL can't. To compensate Jarls Perseverance doesn't require such a strict timing and he can chain afterwards. While the very early armor activation might give of the dreaded ""heby on red"" vibes, remember that it can't be feinted and gives a free parry/deflect if baited out and it also has 400ms gb-vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; **Concealed strike:** Animation: Warlord uses his shield to cover the windup of his attack to make it more difficult for the enemy to see where the attack comes from. *stats:* * Input: hold backwards + top/right heavy * Accessibility: From Neutral or as a chain finisher * Stats: Speed is 900ms, deals 20 damage from both top and right, damage increased to 25 when used as chain finisher can be feinted + soft feint into forward dodge at regular feint timing, can't chain afterwards to prevent infinite loop, 30 stamina cost, 700ms recovery, * Special properties: Indicator is hidden for the first 600 ms. Warlord can soft-feint the attacks from top to right and right to top with very subtle animation changes which are barely visible for the opponent. *Description:* The only move where Warlord makes clever use of sword AND shield are his superior block lights, with Concealed strike that makes two. The premise of the move is simple, the enemy needs to make a read if the heavy comes from the top or their left as the 300ms indicators and animations hidden behind the shield make the move unreactable. The forward dodge cancel allows Warlord to catch backdodgers/rollers with headbutt or Headsplitter leap. With this move being feintable it's pretty safe but also deals mediocre damage, so a low risk/low reward move. &amp;#x200B; **Odins grasp part 1:** Animation: Warlord stows away his weapons and charges at the enemy and then grabs them by their waist. *stats:* * Input: hold left/right movement keys + gb * Accessibility: After any chain starter, parry counter ( not confirmed of course ) * Stats: speed is 800ms, classified as a grab, can't be feinted, costs 40 stamina, 1000ms recovery * Special properties: Move can be performed near instantly after a chain starter to make use of hit/blockstun, Gain superarmor 500ms into the move, has a lot of forward momentum ( he's running at you after all) to catch backdodges, depending if you press left/right on the input, Warlord extends his arms in that direction and catches his target dodging in that direction ignoring i-frames. For example, if you press left + gb Warlord extends his arms to the left which catches people that dodge/roll to his left or backwards and vice verca for right side, Warlord extends his arms 300 ms before impact *Description:* Odins grasp brings a unique take on bashes/grabs compared to the numerous 500ms bashes or feintable ones. The only thing the enemy can do to dodge Warlords meaty hands is to dodge in the right direction. The block/hitstun applied from the previous chain starter prevents the enemy from building up enough distance trough backpedaling and the superarmor prevents the move from being stopped by dodgebashes like conqs or glads. If the enemy does dodge correctly they're rewarded with a free gb. Black Prior might be able to bullwarkcounter for free if he's only stuck in light hitstun or heavy blockstun, i dunno. &amp;#x200B; **Odins grasp part 2:** Animation: After grabbing an opponent he lifts them up and does some shittalk about how screwed/dead they are. Afterwards Warlord can decide between 2 options: Suplex and launch. Suplex *:* Animation: What do i need to say? Warlord fucking S U P L E X E S whatever poor soul's in his grasp into the ground. *stats:* * Input is heavy or light * Suplex takes 700ms to perform and both lay on the ground for another 500ms and then stand up at the same time. * Deals 40 damage * Doesn't deal stamina damage but completely restores Warlords stamina * Warlord knocks back anyone in his way * Warlord drops his opponent if he gets hit during the animation like all other grab moves. * If Warlord doesn't decide between launch and Suplex in 2 second after grabbing the enemy, he automatically performs Suplex *Description:* A simple, but satisfying, big damage move which resets the fight to neutral. In 4v4 Warlords allies can also land an attack or two. &amp;#x200B; Launch: Animation: Warlord hoists his opponent on his shoulder and then repurposes them as a a human projectile against a target of his choosing. *stats:* * Launch takes 800ms to perform and puts Warlord in recovery for 800ms * Launch direction can be decided either trough direction input + gb like regular gb throws or by locking onto an enemy * Launch distance is about the same as Tiandis kick * Warlords ""projectile"" stops on the first obstacle hit and takes 30 damage on impact (doesn't matter if enemy/ally/wall) * If Warlord hits an enemy with his projectile, said enemy also takes 30 damage and is knocked over briefly. * The projectile quickly stands up after impact/landing to prevent eating too many top heavies. * You bet it ledges Description: Think of the possibilities and hilarious scenes of Warlords just yeeting the enemy team across the map and over ledges, but jokes aside, the ability to use your own enemies as weapons could prove itself very usefull in 2v2 or 4v4. However you have to be beware of the long animation and recovery of the move, so it's not the best idea to use Launch right next to another enemy. &amp;#x200B; # New Warlord in different gamemodes: **1v1:** Warlord now has decent pressure from neutral with headbutt and concealed strike and combined with his enhanced lights he should have no problem accessing his midchain moves like Odins Grasp or chain finisher concealed strike. With Jarls perseverance he can deal with bashy characters like Black prior, Warden or Lb with his dodge shove. New Warlord still has drawbacks in the form of, no traditional dodgeattacks, few OS selects with Jarls perseverance being easily punished if baited and with decently high stamina costs on Concealed strike and Odins grasp, he can't keep up the pressure for very long. **2v2:** Warlord can do some nasty setups with Odins grasp. When performing Suplex your ally can land a heavy and when both opponents are still alive you can put huge pressure on the other foe when you grasp someone. If your ally is smart, he can gb his opponent / put them in blockstun while your launching yours to knock down both of them. **4v4:** Now that zone attack costs less stamina and chains into finishers, Warlord should be more useful now for clearing minions or pikemen. With the buffs to Full block stance, access to an Ub zone after a Fbs block and the new Parry counter Warlord should be a bit better at holding positions. Not as amazing conq but still pretty good. **Ganking:** This is the one function where he's not that much better than before. Concealed strike is countered by external block and while Odins Grasp could be very powerful you need to rely on an ally to set you up as you can't perform it from neutral. **Anti-gank:** While Warlord can definitely survive longer with his new toys he can't exactly kill his enemies faster as his moves take to long to perform and he lacks big damage aoe unblockables like raider or JJ. However, when you do a parry counter and perform Odins Grasp you could pull off a quick suplex or even throw a enemy of the ledge. &amp;#x200B; **Conclusion:** Warlord can suplex enemies or yeet them of a cliff. Enough said. Oh, and thanks for reading this wall of text. Now tell me in the comments how awful / ridiculously overpowered these suggestions are."

Health and damage need to be standardized as well as heal rate for feats, defensive mechanics, and perks all need to be standardized in their level of strength. Global changes we need to see, especially for assassins.",41,dkfnhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/dkfnhs/no_hp_no_revenge_health_and_damage_need_to_be/,2019-10-20 16:45:43,"I'm not saying ""no hero diversity"", but I'm sick of this lazy argument that ""well we can't balance everything and expect it to be perfect"", it's not an excuse for how unbalanced this game is and to not even try. I think it's ridiculous how gutted mobility is in this game, strictly limited and standardized it to be nearly the same for every character to the point it's no longer useful or reliable globally unless you have a specific hero mechanic like a dodge heavy or dodge bash that isn't too risky to safely dodge, which usually doesn't even favor mobile assassins classes who a lot of which have riskier dodge lights. The problem was feint GB being stationary, and they over nerfed mobility with removal of diagonal dodges and 900ms GB vulnerability on dodge into roll that makes it almost impossible to dodge roll on read because someone in a gank can reaction GB your dodge. There's huge weaknesses with reflex guard and standardization and nerfs on mobility as well as gear perks has disproportionately nerfed assassins and other low HP heroes with almost every global change. High HP heroes with bashes have proportionally benefited much more than everyone else in the game from these changes, especially with exclusive perks that are much better. You can spam GB's and bashes in 1v1 with almost no risk and not feeding revenge, which used to be punishable and feed revenge. Assassins as a class need global buffs to offense to deal with external guard, HP buffs, defensive mechanics like deflects and reflex guard, and standardized damage. Just ask yourself what the justification for low HP and average damage is, there isn't one. In theory assassins were supposed to have better offense and deal more damage at the expense of HP and reflex guard, which we know assassins don't have, and is flawed logic anyways, assassins also need HP and defensive mechanics that should be standard. Probably the biggest change I want to see for assassins are big global HP buffs and changes to deflect mechanics. Deflects should be as strong as BP's bulwark flip. There's no reason why he should be doing around the same damage (35 dmg), but to EVERYONE he counters, and be much safer while doing it and countering EVERYTHING. Nothing against BP, I think he's balanced, but we need to bring every hero and class up to his level. Assassins should simply get iframes after the deflect animation because they are dodging and the iframes get wrongfully canceled by the deflect, they should have those iframes for the duration of the punish, but during the deflect itself when you can chain deflects it should have super armor to not get bashed out of your deflect AND every person who chains into your deflect should get punished just like BP's flip. The last part could take a bit of work, but imagine getting a chain deflect as shinobi and he teleports and punishes everyone with 25 dmg, or orochi and other assassins deflecting into a special zone to punish multiple people. Don't get bashed out of your deflect, and have iframes on the punish. That's the level BP's flip is on, and they both wouldn't be unpunishable, it would give new use to undodgables to catch deflects mid punish that could get chain punished if mistimed, just as BP can circumstantially get flipped or long armed out of his flip. But they need to stronger, even with these changes that sound crazy, the truth is deflects still wouldn't be as good as bulwark with 1/3 the window of a parry (67ms) and not being able to counter bashes directly and longer recovery from dodging. There's your hero diversity and imperfect balance, it's not an excuse to not give massive buffs to assassins. As far as HP, honestly with the crazy damage in this game that I don't think will change, it just makes sense to give everyone 200 hp, heavies can already net 250 hp with perks and feats anyways."

He is both strong and weak. Strong in a way because when he hits you, he hits you hard, yet weak because he has no openers and without lag or flickering guards he's gonna have a pretty hard time hitting anyone! So, after some thought I've come up with a few quality of life changes for Aramusha, that I think are needed. **Without going any further, I want to thank you all for reading and ""any"" feedback is welcome** My goal here is to: \- Make Aramusha more versatile; \- Give him more options; \- Balance speed and damage; \- Other. I don't want to change his chains, meaning that the whole **top/side/top/side** **\*Tempest\*** thing will stay as it is. Although: \- Neutral Side Heavies can be soft feinted to a Light Attack either to Top or the opposite Side (just like his ""Deadly Feint""); \- (Mid Chain) Top Light is Enhanced (meaning they don't bounce off if blocked); Another change would be to his **\*Rushing Wind\*** **(Alternate)** (Dodge Forward Side Heavy): \- Has Undodgeable properties (to better catch rolls and more pressure); \- Can be soft feinted to a Light Attack from the opposite side; \- Can be soft feinted to a kick (same kick from Blade Blockade and it will push the enemy away and even wall splat and/or ledge just like it does in BB) if the kick connects with the enemy it can be chained to an Unstoppable Heavy from any guard. Although, only the Top Heavy is guaranteed and acts like a chain starter; it will teleport Aramusha to the enemy (just like the ""teleport"" from the Sprint Attack) (the animation of the attack is like the one from the Dodge Forward Top Heavy, **with a teleport**); The teleport also applies to the Side Heavies, although this one counts as a chain finisher, so it can chain to the **Deadly Feint** mix up (but it's also guaranteed if the kick wall splats); \- Since it's an Heavy Attack (even with all the changes I said) obviously they can all be hard feinted like all Heavy Attacks; **\*Guard Break:\*** \- Top Light Attack will be changed to the **Ring the Bell**; You can still throw the enemy after doing that; **\*Blade Blockade:\*** \- Kick, will now have the mix up I described above; \- Ring the Bell, will also make you able to throw the enemy just like in the guard break; **\*Damage/Speed Changes:\*** \- Top Neutral Light - 15dmg; \- Top Chain Light - 17dmg; \- Side Neutral Light - 15dmg; \- Side Chain Light - 15dmg; \- Chain Heavies - 30dmg (any side); \- All Heavy Chain Finishers will do 45dmg; \- Deadly Feint Speed nerf - 400ms to 433ms; \- Deadly Feint Damage: Side - 20dmg to 17dmg; Top - 15dmg to 17dmg; \- Ring the Bell - 15dmg to 12dmg; **\*Standard Changes\*** \- Heavy Attacks have the same Guard Break vulnerability like ""all"" heroes.

Of course it isn't enough and he still won't be really strong, but that doesn't mean these changes can't be implemented to the game. If character won't get full rework then he can at least get small buffs like PK every patch and will eventually become decent character. &amp;#x200B; **Rushing Wind:** Rushing Wind Alternate (Side Heavy) input changed from \[Forward Dodge + Side Guard + Heavy\] to \[Side Dodge + Heavy\]. Now this move is unfeintable to prevent multi-dodges with lower recovery. Input window is 200-500ms. Rushing Wind Alternate (Top Heavy) now works after Forward Dodge with guard in any direction. &amp;#x200B; **Lights, Heavies and chains:** Chain Side Lights are now 400ms (instead of 500ms). Chain Top Light is now enhanced. Chain Top Heavy is 700ms 33dmg (instead of 600ms 28dmg) as Chain Side Heavies. Side Heavy Openers now have 300ms GB vulnerability (instead of 100ms). (It is optional, because all these changes won't be enough to make him viable and not outclassed in all modes, so maybe it isn't time to talk about nerfs, but I can be wrong and 40dmg 100ms GB vulnerable Heavy Openers need to go). &amp;#x200B; **Zone attack:** First hit is 20dmg now (instead of 15dmg) and cost 40 stamina (instead of 60). Second hit is 40dmg now (instead of 35dmg) and still cost 0 stamina. &amp;#x200B; **Blade Blockade:** Ring The Bell is 22dmg instead of 15dmg. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR 1. Aramusha now has dodge attack. 2.

The purpose of a dodge is to evade a non-undodgeable attack and potentially allow follow-up. It can be countered with a Guard Break on read. However, if said dodge is converted into a dodge attack, it suddenly loses its GB vulnerability. In addition, most of them somehow lose i-frames and take hits from attacks they are supposed to be dodged. The change would add more consistency to the dodge-reaction game in exchange for arguably unhealthy mix-ups coming with the dodges."

They many not be ideal but none of them are anywhere near the absolute uselessness of Orochi. Orochi is completely useless in all 3 modes as you can see by their placement at the bottom of Duels, Brawl, and Dominion. After learning a lot more about the fundamentals of viable offense, I feel that this iteration of an Orochi rework will be the most realistic (in terms of what the devs are willing to do) while also being very effective. So, what needs to be addressed? 1. Lack of any Viable Opener Orochis neutral game is completely garbage since it is all reactable and highly punishable. Being considerate of the devs time and available resources, a new opener can be created from existing resources. You guessed it, its the Tozen Kick animation. [New Move: Tornado Kick] - From a side or forward dodge, Orochi can do a spin kick that will stun the opponent and deal stamina damage but does not guarantee any damage. Forward kick is 500ms and side kick is 600ms, both have the same input window as the dodge attacks. It will initiate chains (counts as a light attack). This new kick will allow Orochi to immediately follow through with their L H, L L L, or L L H chains. This means that the kick will allow Orochi safe access to their 400ms lights and chain pressure. This also gives a reason for the opponent to dodge against Orochi, which will also make Orochis undodgeable dodge attacks an alternative and reliable way to get into their chains. Were not done their either, now that Orochi has a pressure thanks to the kick, finisher dodge recovery cancel has actually use now: continuing pressure. Orochis kit will now have better post finisher flow since they can initiate a kick or undodgeable attack to continue their pressure. Its crazy how this one move makes the rest of Orochis kit useful before tweaks, but about that... 2. General Tweaks To further improve the flow and new strategy that the new kick employs heres a few minor tweaks:  Orochis finisher top light is 500ms (from 400ms) but becomes enhanced. This is to allow an option to prevent the enemys block from denying Orochi their finisher dodge recovery cancel.  Orochis finisher side lights are sped up to 400ms (from 466ms) and damage lowered to 13 (from 17). This is self-explanatory, it makes Orochi able to safely use their chain finishers without risk of a guaranteed parry.  Chain finisher side heavies sped up to 700ms (from 800ms). There really was no point in throwing out side heavies because of how slow they were which made it easy to differentiate between a light. At 700ms, side heavies finishers should make parrying at light timing more dangerous since it will allow Orochi to dodge cancel them for more options.  Speed up Lightning Strike to 500ms (from 566). This is to put it in line with the forward Tornado Kicks speed.  Left stance Storm Rush same speed as the right. This should have been the case to begin with. Now the only reliable way to avoid it is to dodge which will give top stance a use now.  Lower the GB vulnerability on Riptide Strike to 100ms (from 400ms). This is more of a QoL change since it was dumb for a dodge attack like this to have it to begin with. And thats it. Just a reused asset and some number tweaks and Orochi is viable. Come on Ubi, we know you can do it."

144,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Centurion's needed changes/fixes prioritized,22,d0n9n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/d0n9n9/centurions_needed_changesfixes_prioritized/,2019-09-07 07:56:59,"From a fellow reputation 70 Centurion. I won't go over in detail what Centurion is, has become, his identity, role, reasons for changes and so on. You can read Knight\_Raime's thread for that, it's written pretty well. I will simply list everything wrong with TG Centurion and say how important it is to fix it plus the best way to fix it before the rework going live. First of all... &amp;#x200B; ***Very high priority - compulsory, must be addressed:*** \- *Centurion's mixup can be back dodge-rolled on reaction if you are hit by a light or you have blocked a heavy*. Comment: The main thing that even remotely justifies all of the numerous nerfs he received, does not work. Yeap, kind of ridiculous, but it's why Centurion's in Testing Grounds. There are a number of ways to fix this, involving adding forward movement, improving tracking, leaving it to roll catchers, etc. However, the **preferred** method is to make his Jab feint-GB track backdodges, which it should, but it doesn't. Hitokiri does not have this issue at all, Centurion shouldn't either. \- *Jab feint is extremely slow unless feinted instantly, delay + 400ms, making dodges either being out of range (back dodge) or recovering in time for a Counter Guardbreak (side dodge)* Comment: I previously thought the feint-GB was simply not standardized to the new 300ms timing, but after finding a willing player to test, it's actually even more than that. There is a very noticeable delay of about 100-200ms before Guardbreak even comes out at its old speed. That's just insane. Jab needs to have the standard feint-GB timing of 300ms throughout its whole feint window. Nothing less. &amp;#x200B; **High priority - need to be updated to the current pace of the game:** \- *Legion's Kick is unchanged, a bash requiring 300ms of forward dash and being 600ms fast.* Comment: Outdated, archaic, reactable to below average players 100% of the time, very punishable. Cannot remain this way. This is where you can freely choose from your established neutral bash models, most are at least usable. Tiandi's and Warlord's are the most balanced, in my opinion. \- *Delays.* Comment: So many of them... everything has a delay. This makes Centurion feel very clunky to play, his flow from the live game is completely out the window. There is no reason for any of this. He does not care about walls anymore. His heavies are not 600ms anymore. He does not get guaranteed 65 damage anymore. Hell, his UB heavy can be parried very consistently unless his throw/Parry Counter hit a wall from at least above medium range. What the hell? These delays are atrocious, serve no purpose and need to be completely scrapped. \- *Eagle's Fury is unchanged.* Comment: His dash heavy is very slow, has terrible tracking, terrible recovery and terrible range. Completely fails at being a roll catcher, or anything really. Increasing its range and speeding it up would be the best course of action. &amp;#x200B; **Medium priority - things that should be reviewed over a second time:** *- Heavies' GB vulnerability is too high* Comment: 400ms of GB vulnerability for a 700ms heavy. Not only did his heavies take a hit in the speed department, they also got quadruple recovery? Excessive. Either his heavies should return to 600ms and have 200ms of vulnerability, or they should stay at 700ms and return to 100ms. At the very least, halve that 400ms to 200ms. Right now, it's too much. \- *Lion's Roar triggers stamina regen and does not benefit from Haymaker.* Comment: I'm not too sure whether these are bugs or not, but I'm putting it here. Centurion's overall damage was nuked already, don't see why the move should not proc Haymaker. However, the stamina damage is more important. It is currently useless for it, so fixing the opponent's stamina starting to regenerate during it is very important. Otherwise there is just no use for it. \- *Parry Counter's input window and range are too small* Comment: The input window is harsh, but honestly it can be looked past if the range was set to its old value. Still, a bit of leniency on it would be appreciated. Parry Counter would be okay even like this, however, if that incessant delay before the heavy was removed, as already mentioned above. &amp;#x200B; **Low priority/quality of life - would be great to get adjusted:** \- Charged finisher heavies range is very, very small. A notable, but not too big of an increase would be helfpul \- His Jab and UB heavy should be target-swappable during charging &amp;#x200B; **Conclusion:** currently, Centurion is far from a good and finished state. In my opinion, and from the looks of comments I've read, he kind of... lost more than he gained. Everything that I've listed up above has been the result of a nerf, so you can see the list is huge. The exchange for all of those nerfs - the mixup - doesn't even work properly, but even if it did, it would still be too big of a price to pay. He is currently just a worse Hitokiri - yeah, everyone hates these comparisons, but it's true. However, the foundation of the new Centurion has great potential. Hopefully the purpose of the testing grounds is utilized just for that: turning the potential into reality. Addressing his mixup not functioning the way it should, buffing his two outdated moves, adjusting his bad flow due to delays and doing some smaller tweaks would make him, I dare say, a model hero of this game. I hope this feedback is helpful."

Players who get hit by a 30+ damage heavy will not understand what happened and blame it on technical problems * GB immunity shuts down mixups *entirely*. While you can play around it with knowledge (that the game won't give you) and attempt to bait heavy parries, whoever is on the receiving end of the mixup is in control, which should be the privilege of offense, not defense. Shutting down one of the most basic mixups in the game affects the offense the entire cast across the board negatively, and some more than others suffer from it GB immunity should be officialized in-game as a special property, but it should also have a vulnerability of sorts to still be a powerful character advantage while not shutting down offense.

146,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Making Jormungandr a complete character.,1,d1y2he,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/d1y2he/making_jormungandr_a_complete_character/,2019-09-10 08:14:10,"This season the viking hero ""jormungandr"" was released. They were super hyped up, they were supposed to be bad-ass vikings with a giant war hammer who would dominate the battlefield. Unfortunately reality often doesn't meet expectations and what we actually got was a homeless man/woman with a criminal lack of kit. Many things are wrong with jorm currently so I am going to go over each thing I find holding jorm back and attempt to fix them. That said lets jump right into them. * 1 The neutral melee bash needs a few changes, now based off how ubi have done things in the past there are two options. Either you speed up the neutral bash to 500ms and guarantee a follow up light that chains or Keep the bash at 600 ms and lower all 3 types of recoveries on a dodged bash to 400 ms, akin to what you find on lawbringer's side dodge shove. Point in case a 600 ms melee bash that guarantees no damage, can be reacted to consistently and allows a gb on reaction to orange is simply unacceptable. Regardless of what is ultimately chosen it needs significantly better tracking/range, as you can currently just backwalk/backdodge the jorm player and there isn't shit they can do. This change will also help jorm in teamfights and in ganks. * 2 The unblockable ""mix-up"" isn't effective due to its early feint window, if the move is ever going to fulfill its purpose then you need to be able to soft-feint it into a gb as late as 400 ms before the attack lands. This will put in line to whats already in the game. Ex: Shamens unblockable mix-up. * 3 His attacks need a bigger hit-box area in general, currently one of the reason jorm suffers so much in 4's is his abysmal range/hit-box on all of his moves. In particular I believe his zone attack, side heavies and unblockable side heavies, all need nearly double their currently range to allow jorm to do something besides feed revenge in teamfights. * 4 Make the forward dodge heavy unblockable and allow soft-feints up to 400 ms before the attack lands, next his zone should be unblockable after a successful parry. This would give jorm a decent team-fighting/anti-ganking tool that can't be spammed and rewards skill. * 5 Allow jorm to soft-feint his lights to neutral. Similar to what conq and nobushi could do with full-block and hidden stance respectively. As is jorm's lights are basically parry/deflect bait due to their speed 500 ms , (their animation very fluid) and their undodgeable property. By allowing him to soft-feint his lights back to neutral it will enable jorm to punish a parry attempt of his lights ON READ with his neutral melee bash. This doesn't give jorm any free damage and since his lights are 500 ms it can't be used as an option select. The entire point of this is to let jorm condition his opponents into being afraid to parry his lights thus allowing him to use them without speeding them up. * 6 Set the guard-break vulnerability of hammer slap to 100 ms both during startup and during block/hit/miss. Its a good move once you land it but too many things can knock you out of it/punish you for using it. * 7 Finally make it so all unblockables knock oos down( including during wakeup armor) as well as all normal stamina opponents when the jorm in question has revenge activated. Thats it folks, I know this post is probably going to be down-voted into oblivion but I figured I might as well take my crack at fixing jorm's severe lack of kit. I acknowledge that a large portion of players simply hate jorm's current playstyle but it's what the developers wanted and it doesn't justify him being as garbage as he currently is. Currently placing in the bottom of the 4v4 tier lists, its evident to anyone that plays jorm against competent opponents his flawed/small kit makes it nearly impossible to win as."

I know it won't make him super good because it still wouldn't deal damage but it would give him something for dodging moves like conqueror's bash and take some stamina from conq to catch some breath from rain of bashes or live up to his purpose of stamina harasser. So I wanted to talk with someone about this. He would probably be able to stop more chains off dodge like this and this is probably OP thing about this idea.

This also makes it safer for him to go into SR after a finisher since you can no longer GB on reaction to his back dodge thanks to improved GB frames of riptide I think these are his top 3 problems and i believe the solutions above fix the hero as a whole without adding any bashes &amp;#x200B; Do discuss, curious as to why this would get downvotes. so please for those that do , explain why my solutions dont perfect fix his issues"
149,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A small but much needed rework for tiandi,15,d5rrig,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/d5rrig/a_small_but_much_needed_rework_for_tiandi/,2019-09-18 13:08:56,This could also be just a buff considered how small it is. Right now tiandi really struggles to get damage in and usually has to result to chip damage against a good opponent. So this first buff will be the biggest and this will aim to make his kick mix up actually threatening in 1v1s while also making it less threatening in 4s. -He now gains the ability to soft feint a kick into guard break -If the opponent gets knocked down by the kick it only pushes the opponent half as far and guarantees the forward dash heavy -Make it to where it no longer means half your health gone if you get hit by this kick in a gank This next buff is optional but i think would make a good addition -He can now soft feint the palm strike out of tiger dodge -This will need to be buffered as it MOST of the guard break vulnerability. This will make it so that opponents are discouraged to go for the guard break while you are doing your dodge mix ups and will overall make the dodge safer and hopefully usable. Let me know what you think about these changes. Maybe there should be some buffs/nerfs in this to balance it out? Just let me know.
150,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,How I would rework shinobi,1,d7evz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/d7evz0/how_i_would_rework_shinobi/,2019-09-22 05:18:37,"Many players agree that shinobi is kind of lackluster, though very fun to play he is one pretty badly designed character, one of the best defensively while having litterally no viable offense. Lots of people say he's fine (that's true) others say he's thrash (that's also true in a way). What to do about it then. There's a lot of good ideas around the forums and there has been for a while but I think mine has lots of potential because it doesn't make shinobis feel weak less diverse or unfair, it would be fairly easy to make and it keeps/improves every move the character has. I already proposed the core of said changes a while ago, but I now found that I did a bad job in trying to convey them so here we go again I hope this gets understood more easily. General changes: -Shinobi's health is increased to 120 hp to make him less frale. -Shinobi's deflect isn't automatic anymore, you have to press dodge button to teleport, this is to prevent lucky deflects and shinobi getting oos because he deflected an attack. -Shinobi's sprinting speed is increased at the cost of super sprint. Why because super sprint was too strong in scenarios where a shinobi could easily outrun people at the cost of stamina, now opponents have a better chance at catching up to him. It also wouldn't affect his really short rotation speed (because the sprint buff). -Shinobi's double dodge no longer costs stamina. -Shinobi's backflip gets back previous range, still has no hyper armor, but keeps its i-frames. In exchange, shinobi cannot whiff an attack into a backflip. -The punish for parrying shinobi's ranged heavy is now the regular heavy parry punish. -The punish for countering a ranged guardbreak is now only stamina damage on shinobi. Feats improvements: -Nukekubi now gives back stamina on blocked hits and when getting hit (but at a slower pace for the second). It's a good way to buff the weakest level three feat. -Yama Uba now gives health back based on the number of opponents attacking you. The feat used to be extremely good when surviving in a gank and was really fun to use, but because you constently had an advantage in duels it was nerfed. Now it's one of the weakest healing feat. Changes, for 1v1's 15% hp on hit, 1v2's 30% hp on hit, 1v3's 50% hp on hit, 1v4's 75% hp on hit. Chain improvements -Shinobi can now cancel the recovery of all his two hit chains and parry counter by the charging of his ranged heavies. This is to give shinobi more options other than hit and run tactics he can now decide to stay in longer or to retreat. After a chain shinobi would be able to either backflip, range heavy, or cancel the charge with a dodge and pressure the opponent with his dodge attacks. -Shinobi's parry counter now does only 20 damage total but stuns the opponent. This is to balance his damage. -Shinobi's second chain light, the one that is guaranteed now does 5 damage from 10. This is to bring shinobi in line with the rest of the cast in terms of damage. -Shinobi's first heavies now have hyper armor after 400ms. To allow shinobi to trade more with his slow and high damaging heavies. -Shinobi's first heavies are now 900 ms from all sides. His side heavies get a tweaked animation like the tech you can currently do when you input left heavy on a gb. This is meant to make his feints less readable. -Shinobi now has a much needed single dodge heavy attack. It's 766 ms (is based around his oos heavy animations), does 25 damage is unblockable, has late HA, is feintable and like nuxia's heavy finishers it grabs and throws it's target if it lands. This is to help shinobi get up close and give him more mix-ups when he's dodging or better pressure when his opponent is oos, when he is in revenge and allow for more mix-ups for example: with his kick, he could triple dash then do the dodge attack. It's also meant to give him quick access to damage after a dodge and to get rid of the quick dodge tech. New mix-up -Tracking on ranged gb is increased to make it catch dodges like regular guardbreaks. -Shinobi's sickle rain now only does 35 damage from 53. To compensate for the loss of damage, all his three lights get a new draining property that deals no damage, but heals shinobi 10 hp per light. The lights also fill shinobi's opponent's stamina so it's not completely unfair. -Shinobi's double dodge kick now is 400 ms from all sides and gets pretty much all it's day one stats but without it's hyper and super armor. It's also still unpunishable and can be mixed-up with the new dodge heavy attack and quad dashes to hit opponents. Now an opponent has to predict when shinobi will throw the kick or not. The kick no longer directly garanties damage but opens a new mix-up in which the opponent has to either dodge after getting kicked, or do nothing. Then if shinobi throws a ranged heavy, it is dodgeable if read but guaranteed if the opponent doesn't move or tries to dodge on reaction. In the other hand if shinobi throws a ranged gb, it is guaranteed if the opponent dodges on read after getting hit by kick, but counterable if he does not. Opponents that have fast side dodge attacks can also try to punish shinobi, but he can deflect the dodge attack on read because kick is unpunishable. With this shinobi has to take a risk and try to attack his opponent (with a punishable ranged attack). It uses an old dead chain he has, allows his kick to stay unpunishable (not counting season 11) and it also let's him keep the quad dash (his unintended signature move), while having a fast kick without it being broken. This mix-up is now also accessible from the deflect kick. Without directly reducing it's potential damage if not increasing it's output, shinobi's deflect damage now is balanced. Either 25 bleed, 50 (25-25), or 65 (25-35) and 30 hp healed. It also is now accessible from shinobi's backflip kick, this kick has now a normal delay window and it's follow-up attack gets a 30% damage reduction to avoid backflip kick becoming spammed. This would also make shinobi's current roll mix-up better. We see it getting buffed in other rework posts, the heavy becoming undodgeable still it already tracks well enough (or making it unblockable, which would be fine but it wouldn't be interesting). So the mix-up is bad because the kick has no pressure (still ledge and stamina presure and ""wallsplat"" if your really lucky but). Now that the kick has potential damage output, an opponent has to make a read to either dodge or don't move. It also becomes a great ganking tool with a lot of potential with the recent gb changes it would not feed insane amounts of revenge. Ranged attacks -Shinobi no longer has two levels of charge for his ranged attacks. All ranged attacks are locked on level one charge (Insentive to make some shinobi's always fighting a mile away fight up close) -Shinobi's ranged heavy speed is standardised to 600 ms both at max and point blank range. Only ranged heavy after kick and backflip keeps the same speed (500 ms ish). -Shinobi's first ranged heavy now is feintable and bounces on block like other heavies. -Shinobi now has proper gb vulnerability to his ranged attacks to enable him from having really good option select parries. There was also the change where you wouldn't be able to parry lights if you held heavy button for too long. Both could work just get rid of the option selects. -Recommended- Shinobi's ranged guardbreak can only be used from a successful kick (this is optional because some shinobi players were eager to loose such a tool, but with the recent changes the likelyhood of hitting ranged gb has been reduced and with the proposed changes, shinobi can still gank using backflip/double dodge kick/ranged gb so I'm ok with it being removed because it's cancer). It would make antiganks against a good shinobi less annoying. It would be like how shugoki's ganks work now. No more timing with recoveries to make the move impossible to counter. Only reads and 50/50s. Conclusions and flow of the character With these buffs, shinobi can use all of his kit now and mix-up his opponents while having a fairly varied and diverse moveset. He keeps the in and out vibe, but now has more pressure and options other than light attacks and getting away to punish whiffs. He now is a tremendously better 1v1er and still has lots of his old strenghts in team fights. He can now properly put 50/50 pressure constantly on his opponents. Example go for a safe ranged attack get blocked then roll, then open the roll mix-up, then decide to go for backflip kick and get to open another 50/50 mix-up etc. Chains are stopped only when he uses his signature sickle rain and heals up or has no stamina left. He has more stamina to go for all these moves and has better feats. He would have pressure durability, mobility, gank potential. This means an all around better character that plays on his own tempo when dancing and flowing with his opponents. Please make it happen ubi. Thanks if you sticked to the end, this was a long post. "

153,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha damage changes (follow-up to another rework post),0,d901ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/d901ov/aramusha_damage_changes_followup_to_another/,2019-09-25 17:42:26,"A few weeks ago I made a post about changes that wouldn't essentially _change_ how Aramusha plays, but would make him more effective in both 1v1s and in team fights. Here's the link: URL I didn't include damage changes because I think that was part of a different discussion, namely the necessity to reduce the damage of attacks, especially light parries, to at least 3/4 of what it is now. But in this post I am going to address Aramusha's damage nerfs according to the current meta. So here we go: _HEAVIES_ 1. Top neutral heavy: stays the same. 2. Neutral side heavy: now has 400ms GB-vulnerability and damage is 35, down from 40 damage 3. Chained top: still does 28 dmg 4. Chained side: down to 30 from 33. 5. Top finisher: down to 25 from 40 6. Side finisher: down to 30 from 45 _LIGHTS_ 1. Deadly feint lights: 2. Neutral side and top lights: 3. Chained top and side lights: _BB PUNISHES_ 1. Ring the bell: 20 dmg up from 15. 2. Top heavy UB (guaranteed): 15 damage 4. Side heavy UB and deadly feints: they stay the same. 5. Kick: stays the same. _CONCLUSION_ The whole idea of Aramusha is to be a relentless attacker that mixes you up with his attacks, justifying his high DO. His problem, which I tried to address in my other post, is that he lacks the ability to open opponents up, since they only need to _block_ ; in a very weird way he has similar problems to what berserker had pre-rework. This problem justifies his high DO at the moment, but once it's gone it should be clear that his damage should be turned down a notch."
154,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Evaluating Cases Of Enhanced Lights And Whether They Benefit Their Respective Characters,30,da5msa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/da5msa/evaluating_cases_of_enhanced_lights_and_whether/,2019-09-28 05:56:20,"Enhanced property is a unique tool that can be very valuable to a character when well implemented into their kit, however there are unfortunately not many situations in live game / testing grounds where this is the case. With this post I want to discuss what exactly is the purpose of enhanced lights, evaluate cases where the property is present, and give my thoughts on how this property can be used moving forward. For starters, enhanced property really only does three things, two of which are only relevant to brawl and 4v4 modes. First is that an enhanced light does not experience additional recovery when blocked, unlike a regular light which will bounce off into a vulnerable state. This makes enhanced property fairly valuable in 4v4, as when getting ganked or in a teamfight, you are less vulnerable to external GBs on reaction to your light being blocked. That being said, without any 700ms chained attacks or faster, this can be irrelevant as you may not have any tools to stuff that GB (most enhanced light finishers have fairly low recovery when blocked, so this only really applies to neutral and chained lights). Enhanced lights can also be used for gank set-ups that usually need heavy block stun set-ups, as blocking an enemy enhanced light will still send you into block recovery just as a heavy does, albeit to a lesser extent. This is a pretty valuable aspect of enhanced lights, as although the timing is tighter, it is much easier to force an enemy to block with a 500ms light than an 800ms heavy. Most importantly however, enhanced lights provide easy access to chained or finisher pressure. Regarding that point, I must stress that **enhanced lights serve very little purpose if they don't lead into significant pressure**. If everything an enhanced light leads into is reactable and cannot force reads, then the property does not substantially benefit the character. Now with their uses outlined, let's take a look at all cases of enhanced lights currently **Lawbringer neutral, chained and finisher side lights** are all enhanced. Enhanced property on neutral lights is completely obsolete. In terms of leading into significant pressure, neutral lights only lead into an 800ms chained heavy, which is actually worse than his neutral pressure. Since the heavy isn't 700ms or faster, it cannot be used to stuff a GB either. As for setting up ganks with block stun, in most cases LB himself is the ganker, so although it is useful for setting up ally ganks you're usually not going to have an ally with a better gank than LB's, making the property once again obsolete unless setting up a quick gank in the midst of a teamfight. Chained side lights make more use of the property as they lead into LB's finisher unblockables, so even if they are blocked after a light riposte, impale wallsplat heavy or just raw neutral heavy, they still lead into pressure. The chained side lights are an example of enhanced property implemented well. Finisher side lights have fairly low recovery when blocked, so they're pretty safe from external punish attempts, but don't have much use outside of that. **Shugoki neutral lights** are enhanced and lead into headbutt or his finisher heavy mixup. Although his finisher heavy mixup doesn't really differ from his neutral heavy, the block stun of the neutral enhanced light means that backdodge/backroll cannot be used to negate the mixup. I would credit this more to Shugoki's neutral charged heavy mixup not functioning as well as intended rather than his enhanced lights acting as a bridge to access his pressure, but they lead into pressure nonetheless. Since neutral lights also chain into headbutt, Shugoki has a 600ms tool to stuff GBs against his neutral light recovery, providing additional safety (not great but gets the job done). They can also be used to set up ally ganks as Shugoki's gank is nowhere near as strong as it used to be. I would regard Shugoki's enhanced lights as relatively well implemented, but certainly not the best example. **Highlander offensive stance lights** would be pretty much unusable if they weren't enhanced, as you'd fall out of offensive stance every time one is blocked. You're able to chain multiple offensive stance lights together for sustained offense with this property, and although they don't have enough range to properly set up ally ganks, this clearly isn't their intended function. Offensive stance's vulnerability to interrupts means this property doesn't prevent external GBs/attacks, but this is more of an issue regarding the design of offensive stance as a whole. So although they only accomplish one of enhanced property's functions, they perform that one function well enough to be considered well designed. **Peacekeeper lights against bleeding opponents** is probably one of the best implementations so far. PK's strongest offence is her chained lights, but she's always had difficulty accessing these lights without a heavy light chain. With this new property, a blocked neutral light against a bleeding enemy leads straight into these tri-directional 400ms 15 damage enhanced lights, which can certainly be considered substantial pressure. These lights can also be used to stuff a GB from an external enemy, with a good chance of landing even if the external enemy doesn't go for a GB due to their speed. Most importantly however, this property gives extreme synergy with Shaman ganks. After Shaman sets up a bleed stab off PK GB, PK can then set up the bite with just a blocked light (yes other neutral enhanced lights do the same thing, but this is especially important on PK since she can set up bleed for Shaman before she even arrives to a gank). I would easily consider this the gold standard for enhanced lights. **Jormungandr neutral and chained lights** are also an example of well-implemented enhanced lights. A blocked neutral light leads into a 500ms bash that synergizes with tri-directional 500ms 18 damage enhanced undodgeable lights and his unblockable finisher heavies. I would wish not all of Jorm's pressure was locked behind his chain starters but that's another discussion; the enhanced property definitely does its job at leading into pressure. The 500ms chained bash and lights can also be used to stuff an external GB. The low recovery on finisher lights when blocked also keeps them relatively safe from external punish attempts. Jorm's role as a ganking partner due to hamar slam's synergy with knockdown based ganks is significantly improved with his neutral lights setting up bashes. **Orochi riptide strike** is a very pointless example of an enhanced light. It is a 600ms attack that foreshadowed by 300ms of backdodge animation. If there is a situation where riptide can potentially be blocked, riptide will be parried. A very consistent parry at that, riptide is pitifully reactable. Sure it can lead into his chained lights for pressure or a 700ms top heavy to stuff an external GB, but what's the point if it will never be blocked in the first place. This is the worst example of enhanced property in the game. **Warlord neutral and chained lights** are enhanced as of the testing grounds phase 1. Like most neutral enhanced lights, they can be used to set up ally ganks, which is great since WL's ganks are quite poor. To stuff an external GB, neutral lights lead into a 700ms 40 damage HA heavy, which is actually very good, or tri-directional 500ms enhanced lights, which are at least low recovery if blocked. However, Warlord doesn't have any chain pressure whatsoever. His chains are fully reactable, so enhanced property doesn't give WL an offensive advantage at all. So enhanced property for WL certainly helps outside of duel gamemodes, but doesn't improve the character at all from a duel standpoint. **Hitikori neutral and chained lights** is another poor example of enhanced property. Hitikori's neutral lights don't lead into chained heavies or her kick mixup, only a light finisher. This effectively means that if you block her neutral light, a followup red indicator is always a chained light, which is a free light parry as her chained light isn't threatening enough at 500ms. Because of this, she can't even use her chained light to stuff an external GB, as the external enemy can just wait for red indicator and parry (yes the enemy needs to make a read on whether she'll go for it, but risk/reward certainly is not in Hito's favor). Overall, there are a few characters that make good use of their enhanced properties, but there are much too many cases of neutral enhanced lights not leading into significant pressure. Hopefully moving forward, Ubi will refine cases of already implemented enhanced property to serve more of a purpose in characters' kits, as well as introduce the property to other characters that can benefit from it (e.g Cent neutral lights, Tiandi neutral lights, all Kensei lights, etc). As always I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts in the comments and look forward for any generated discussion."

156,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Highlander Rework Ideas,0,db536p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/db536p/highlander_rework_ideas/,2019-09-30 12:27:19,"I just hit rep 32 HL so I feel like I'm qualified to make the 103738th HL rework suggestion guide. Will ubi see this? No, I just want to write my thoughts down somewhere. Let's start with Defensive Form Chains: -Light-Heavt chain has been changed to Light-Heavy-Heavy -Heavy-Heavy chain has been changed to Heavy-Heavy-Heavy chain -New Chain: Heavy-Light-Heavy Comments: HL needed more options in DF. Hopefully these chains will give him more things to do when he's on the back foot in a fight. Light attacks: -Opener Lights are 533ms (from 600) -CC frames have been reduced to fit the new speed of the opener lights -Chained lights are 500ms (from 700) -Light attacks are now enhanced -Light attacks deal 18 damage (from 15) Comments: HLs lights were the worst in the game being 600ms and only 15 damage. These new lights allow HL to better enter OF with them being enhanced, and now that they're faster they won't be parry bait anymore Heavy Attacks: -Top heavy opener damage is reduced to 40 (from 45) -Side heavy openers are now 900ms (from 1000) -Chained Heavies and Finisher Heavies damage has been standardized to 40 (from 45 top and 35 side) -Chained and Finisher Heavies gain uninterruptable stance at 100ms (from 300) -Can cancel heavy finisher recoveries into OF Comments: HL has always been known for high damage, but 45 dmg off of a wallsplat is pretty high. And with a side heavy guarenteed off of a light parry, it gives HL an option of he wishes to chain after a light parry punish (and he isn't stuck with a light after a surprise light parry). The faster HA on heavy finishers makes them more viable as a tool for trading with those who want to poke you out of OF as soon as you enter it, and the damage standardization and the recovery cancellation is some nice QOL. Celtic Curse: -Celtic Curse and Celtic Curse Cancel is undodgeable -Can feint Celtic Curse before it is soft feinted into Celtic Curse Cancel by pressing cancel -Can be soft feinted from Balors Might and Famorian Kick -Celtic Curse Cancel speed has been standardized to 500ms (from 600 right and 700 left) Comments: The undodgeable properties and soft feint give HL a tool to catch those who try to Dodge roll from you OF mix-ups. The speed increase makes the move more viable to initiate fights, and the hard feint ability serves as QOL New Move-Scottish Shove: HL can preform this by walking backwards and pressing gb. Animation would be HL gripping the hilt and the blade of his sword and striking the opponent in the chest area with the flat of his blade -600ms bash with 600ms of Gb and guard vulnerability -Does 25 Stam damage -doesnt guarentee any damage but it allows HL to safely enter OF via enhanced light (the light can be block but not parried deflected, etc. The move ledges and wallsplat, guarenteeing the light (the follow-up heavy would be delayed and would come out too slow) Comments: this gives HL a tool to open up turtling opponents and to give him a way to enter OF safely without backstep light. The Stam damage is to make HL better at getting opponents to be oos. New Move-Hilt Strike: Off of a Gb HL can preform this move by pressing light attack. Animation would be HL stabbing the opponent in the face with the guard of his sword -Does 20 damage, stuns, and does 15 Stam damage -Can chain and flows into OF Comments: HL had an abysmal gb punish. This serves to make HL gbs a little more rewarding Zone: -Can soft feint each hit of the zone into OF -Second and Third hit have HA and are unblockable Comments: The soft feints into OF serves to make the zone a viable punish off of a Gb is HL wishes to do so, and the unblockable and HL serves to make the move better in 1vX situations as well as team fights. Run Speed is now on par with Kensei Comments: HL was very slow in 4s which made him rarely picked due to how bad he was at objective play as well as rotating. Ok now we get to Offensive Form Can no longer enter OF by holding down heavy attack Comments: This removes one of HLs option selects. Wavedashing is removed Comments: as much as I love it, it is a very broken mechanic that makes HL dodges even better. Hopefully the devs will find a way to bring it back without it being op but for now it needs to be removed. Balors Might: -Following a Famorian Kick, BM damage is reduced to 30 -Following a Caber Toss, BM damage is reduced to 35 -Balors Might gains HA at 400ms -Side Balors Might have better hitboxes will hit opponents on HLs sides Comments: The damage reduction is to make Balors Might less punishing for an opponent who guessed wrong on a mixup, or an opponent who got their chain dodged. The HA and better hitboxes is to make the move more usable in Team Fights and 1vX situations. Famorian Kick: -Can be hard feinted by pressing cancel -Gains HA at 300ms -If it is soft feinted from Balors Might, Famorian Kick gains HA at 100ms and has better tracking against dodges Comments: the kick having HA now makes it so the opponent can't just backstep light to nullify any mixup. The feintability is to punish any who try. Caber Toss: -Gains HA at 300ms -If from a soft feint, gains HA at 100ms -Removes the artificial delay when thrown from neutral OF -Removes the delay between a successful Caber Toss and the victim being thrown on the ground -Caber Toss will ignore the Rocksteady feat Comments: The HA allows HL to preform the move without worrying about backstep light. The removal of the delays is to make the move more useable when HL has revenge or is in a team fight. OF Lights: -OF top light is now 400ms (from 500) Comments: Standardization Balors Might into OF light: -The light can be have it's direction changed, and it is undodgeable Comments: The fact that I almost forgot this soft feint existed means that it needs some sort of a buff New property-Stamina refund: If HL successfully uses a soft feint, the first attack has its stamina reduced Example: If HL preforms Balors Might into Caber Toss, and the Caber toss lands, the Stamina drain from the Balors Might will be refunded Comments: This is to allow HL to preform more mix-ups without being oos after just two Well that's it. Alot of these ideas aren't mine, so if you see a line that you know 100% is yours link the post in the comments and I'll credit your idea. TLDR: Got rid of his high damage and removed his option selects and wave dashing and gave him HA on attacks in Offensive Form as well as more options when dealing with opponents."
157,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Feint GB still sucks and can't catch back-dodges consistently. Guess we should nerf mobility again and just remove all dodging in the game...,38,dchrl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/dchrl0/feint_gb_still_sucks_and_cant_catch_backdodges/,2019-10-03 08:32:41,"Seriously, when are we going to address this problem? Mobility has been continually nerfed and over nerfed when it wasn't the main problem. Diagonal dodge should of never been removed, now you can't escape where you want and roll into walls. Unlock rolling should of only got 100ms GB vuln, 300 was excessive and combined with a dodge is 900ms of GB vulnerability and you can reaction GB dodge into roll attempts. It just needed enough vulnerability so you can't chain an unlock and react to a GB, but enough immunity so you can still do it on read, which now you can't reasonably escape at all. It's made ganking worse and now there's noway to deal with options that you need to dodge and be GB immune. Now you need a safe target switched dodge attack with good hit-box, or a dodge bash to be as safe. It's made hero disparity worse and people are now more dependent on hero specific mechanics to have reliable defense like conq or LB with a simple dodge bash, assassins can't compete with that and they're mobility isn't worth nearly as much because it's an annoyance at best and parry bait at worst. I mean seriously, how many more mobility nerfs before we expect things to change? TLDR: Here's the solution, allow players to move and not be stationary when feinting or guard-breaking so they don't lose ground on a back-walking or back dodging opponent and GB's will track. It's really that simple. Then you can bring back diagonal dodge and reduce GB vuln on rolls with no problems."

Everything is in the title. I have a bit of experience with the game now (currently rep 163) and I played a lot of different heroes. The only one I can't seem to manage is nobushi in any 1v1 scenario : my best waifu is completely shut down by other mid/high level players, and this for a couple of reasons. Basically all of her "" viable "" offense is locked behind hidden stance, which is one of the most obvious moves of the game : when using it from neutral, I usually get option selected pretty hard by a zone, a light, or a GB (which needs to be thrown rather quickly in order to connect since GB vulnerability is low on attacks from HS, I already know that). When my opponent doesn't try to option select, they just side or backdodge, which prevents them for getting kicked or taking any damage (even if lights from HS are better than before). Well, you got it : I don't understand how to use hidden stance to attack or put pressure on my opponent during a match. On the defensive side, HS is really risky to use in my opinion : you can't use it to create space between you and your target, and it is really weak against variable timing attacks/mixups or feint into GB mixups. So... I don't really understand how to efficiently use it on the defensive side either. Do you have any tips ? How to use hidden stance in a little bit safer way ? How to use it against dodging opponent ? How to git gud ? Should i just abandon my hopes of playing her in duels ? PS : Sorry for my bad english, I'm a french dood."

164,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Another Dumb Minimal Warden Rework,0,cnwn1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cnwn1o/another_dumb_minimal_warden_rework/,2019-08-09 13:25:40,"Currenlty, Centurion, Aramusha, PK, Warlord, Valk, Nobu, and Roach are perhaps the most in need of love. And may characters could use some QoL changes or number changes ro another move. Im not saying Warden should come first, but with a few tweaks to his kit, I believe he'd be a lot more beloved both by newbies and competitively. # Primary Warden Changes These changes are the simplest, and would make Warden more entertaining to all. ## Shoulder Bash - the Infamous Bash --&gt; Mordhau Strike - **ANIMATION**: from shoulder charge to Mordhau strike - Warden's bash is hated in part because it is weird that the most viable thing for a longsword user to do is throw their body at the enemy rather than use sword techniques. This changes the animation to mordhau strike, using the pommel end, which also negates any parry animation issues or such. - Aesthetically, he flips his sword around and goes for a horizontal strike with it. If he charges it, he morphs it into an overhead strike much like his eexecution and lunges at the opponent. - **Damage**: instead of guaranteed lights or such, the bash itself does damage, 20 for the uncharged version and 35 for the full-charge. - **Range**: the uncharged bash has medium range (about the range of his heavy), the charged has a lunge effect thus goes much further, catching backdodges. - **Property - HA**: consider removing the HA -- it makes it easier to use, but he has all of the tools from feinting it. - **Property - Feinting**: while it's recovery is great, it may be a bit too good; consider increasing the feint time by a tad in order to force or at least heavily suggest a read on Warden's part in parrying attacks. - **Chaining**: Perhaps force it to end the chain, thus requiring accessing it again, though an arguement could be made for chaining into openers, or chain/finishers, albeit unguaranteed of course. ## Chains and Access to the Bash - Bash accessible from a Heavy (blocked, whiffed, hit, etc.) or Side or Forward dodges. - Nothing against back dodge attacks in principle, but in practise it made the bash a fairly annoying tool as backdodge beat many mixups unless close to the opponent. - Dodge bash should have a fair amount of startup, i.e. should not be relied heavily on. - Having it on heavies instead of lights not only makes the attack more ""fair"" to newer players by giving them a chance to counter it before it is accessed, but also more fair to the Warden in competitive play where is 500ms lights are extremely risky, ie allows more mindgames with feinting or not feinting his heavy. - Light to Shoulder Bash: Keep the shoulderbash from lights, albeit change it a 500ms unfeintable unchargeable bash that merely does stamina dmg and decent pushback. - Not really a pressure tool (unless they are low on stamina or near an edge), but a homage to his shoulderbash, and usable in teamfights similar to Tiandi's kick in pushing someone out of the fight for a second. - Perhaps allow it wallsplat to guarantee a light MAYBE, but again the mordhau strike is the new bash to deal dmg and such. ## Heavy Finisher - **Speed**: 1100ms -&gt; 900ms, on par with his opener top heavy. - This may have been too much in the past, but nowadays a combo 900ms unblockable heavy with no softfeints is not particularly powerful nor entirely useless --- # Seconday Wishful Warden Changes And here's just the part where I ramble on various cool things that could be done. I do not fully expect all or even any of these to be truly considered, but I enjoy wishful daydreams... ## QoL Warden - Totally Unecessary but Wishful Thinking Additions - **Heavy ""Traps""**: GB from heavies performs blade-glide, crossing the guard of the opponent, while stepping in and hitting them with the pommel. Functionally similar to Nuxia's traps, with the following differences: - **Unreactable**: while it must be inputted sooner, the trap itself does not show until 200-300 ms before the attack lands, requiring a read; not simply a noob tool that is irrelevant in higher level play. - **Only on Passive Defense**: Unlike Nuxia's Traps which trap ANY defensive measure, this only stops blocks -- active defenses can be beaten by a hard-feint to gb or attack or defense or whatnot. - **Damage**: 15-25 dmg, if 15 perhaps a stun as it is a blow to the face. - **Maybe Maybe...**: - Can also beat no guard (slicing across the gut), but this can be beaten by simply letting it fly. - Top attacks into this trap glide across the blade then impale the opponent for more damage. - Perhaps only on the finisher heavies, or side heavy finishers, in which case a damage buff and possibly countering all defenses like Nuxia's may be warranted. - If you REALLY hate Warden, one could have this trap or landing a combo finisher heavy to be the ONLY way to access the bash -- a powerful bash, but one that requires a good bit of work on Warden, by necessity requiring him to use his full kit and feints, guardbreaks, etc. to win, and making the bash moreover a threat against turtles and occasional use tool rather than his bread and butter. This would likely drop him from S to A tier, but I sorta also like how he can use the bash as his bread and butter, so again this may only be necessary if they are seeking to drop the S tiers down. - **Side Attacks**: Instead of guaranteed attacks on side lights, make it interesting. - Opposite side lights from a heavy or light side opener are 333ms unblockable 10dmg, requiring a read - On-hit only, or hit or block with the heavy. Implies a HLH chain to be added. - ""333ms ATTACKS?! You must be crazy he'll be the new roach!"" Well it's already *guaranteed* right now, objectively making it counterable, if ridiculously fast, is nothing but a straight up nerf. In a sense, right now guaranteed lights are 200ms-300 unblockable unparryable uncounterable attacks with no risk. - Sorta tired of unblockables being only on fast attack, like you have to ""power through"" the guard, when a finesse strike would also be unblockable by the game mechanics. - Can mixup with top lights and same side strikes if they try to parry the side. - Same Side Lights - fix the animation, it looks wonky, as I guess they were planning on people always using the guaranteed second light; look at the whiff side light combo for instance, he looks derpy. Make it into an overhead full-circle strike to the other side, like in the HEMA manuals. - **Side Dodge Attacks** - If his dodge bashes are removed, or perhaps even if they stay, it would be cool to get some dodge overhand half-circle attack, perhaps similar to Kenseis. - This doesn't necessarily fit his kit too much, but would be a neat feature to give him another defensive option (as dodge to bash is beaten by gb, same as dodge neutral). Not necessary of course though. - **Bracing Counter** - Assumes a crouched position, and half-grips his sword - Counters bashes, guardbreaks, and movement into him, however loses to any attack (light, heavy, etc.). - Mechanic wise, forces such characters such as BP and Conq to not only do bash or gb, but also perhaps Fdodge into attack; likewise with other bash characters. - If it catches an opponent, impales them and pushes them back, or perhaps flips them overhead (maybe even just allowing him to throw them any direction, similar to Glad's skewer) - If it kills the opponent, he raises them over head then drops his hand fromt he blade to allow the opponent to ""drop"" onto the whole blade, similar to shugo's hug killing having a slight extra animation/ - Input: backwalk+gb (or maybe C/down on joystcik) - **Deflecting FullBlock** - Holds sword downard diagonally, deflects attacks from all directions - As it is a deflect, lets opponents continue their combo - Full blocks are generally fairly balanced as they are beaten on guardbreak, thus are an active defense that can be baited - No guaranteed counters (again, the enemy can combo after), but can feint to neutral immediately after a deflect, or launch an attack (perhaps the mordhau bash), but keep in mind the enemy if they choose to continue their combo and are able will it you out first. - Perhaps heals Warden slightly and maybe even gives some stamina back, due to being weaker than other full-blocks and no true followups. - Input: C or down on joystick - **Parry/GB Strikes**: - GB -&gt; Heavy: perhaps does a half-sword impale to the gut for 20 dmg + 10 bleed; or some variable numbers there. Just for style, or to allow easier balancing if you want to change the gb dmg reward. - Parry -&gt; Light: a fast 20 dmg strike, just to get him into the action faster - Parry -&gt; GB: a stunning 10-15 dmg pommel strike to the face, alongside a bit of stamina drain (20). - Parry -&gt; Heavy: an impale or such, 20-25 dmg; only real purpose is to tone down his light parry damage to something less than a third of the enemy's health. --- # General Wishful Changes - just a few today... More rambling on things I wish to see in the game to make it more balanced, interesting, and dynamic. - While the feint input windows can remain, change the feint animation to happen only 200-300ms before the attack lands (from 400ms I believe), requiring a true read, as better players can parry on reaction (which, funnily enough, makes Kensei's pommel strike mixup more viable than his UB finisher) - Feints are guardbreak vulnerable: make feints have a fair amount of gb vulnerability, thus if an opponent attempts a parry and then feints, they are either susceptible to a guardbreak or can canel that recovery into a light, which can be beaten by a parry; they may also feint to a heavy, which is gb vulnerable, but can mixup an attacker who feint to an expecting light parry. This will not only make attacking more viable (forcing some active defense and having a true way to feint-to-punish even Hitos, Glad's, etc.), while also making them more complex and interesting than simply ""feint to gb or dont feint"". - Alternatively rework the parry system to require a parry input 400ms to 200ms BEFORE the attack lands, ie a prepared defense; the attacker and defender input their decision at the same time. This would probably be too much work though - Chip Damage -&gt; 30-40% would make a whole lot of kits more viable apart from bashes or unblockables - Bashes: some need to deal some small dmg if they hit (ie Tiandi's kick doing 15 dmg, or Cent's punches and Jorm's bashes doing just 5-10 dmg would be fine), and also consider not having ALL bashes do stam dmg -- ie ""damgage bashes"" like Glad's toestab, shoulder bash/mordhau strike, maybe Hito's kicks and Conq's bashes -- the stamina pressure isnt really necessary, just sort of annoying. Save it for bashes that focus on it, such as Jorm's kit or Tiandi's/Shinobi's kick. - UI: - If I turn off player health bars, what makes you think I want to see minion health bars? Please have these options tied together or allow me to get rid of minion health bars or such - Options to remove the glowing revive lights and zone borders -- I like full-immersion, and have most of my UI off, and these just get in the way. - Allow turning off of on-death circle and that weird black overlay, on ultra-widescreens it creates this weird effect where the center of the screen is dark and then a sharp cutoff to non-overlayed sides. - Allow turning off of the random dot when out of lock - Allow turning off the weird white circle underneath locked-on opponent's feet - Allow turning off or at least toning down the grayscale OOS effect; likewise with the near-death blood overlay. - Allow turning off the health-sound, or changing it out with something... bloodier and more menacing (I mean they're getting more health solely off their sadistic pleasue of mutilating their opponent). - Lastly, while you dont like the idea of adding too much health to characters as it would make fights perhaps too long, consider adding more health-regen mechanics in the game. This allow players to quickly blitz down opponents, but also allow more prolonged back and forth fights for equally matched veterans. Of course, damage should always outclass any healing."
165,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Is Warden's defense balanced?,11,cq8o8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cq8o8o/is_wardens_defense_balanced/,2019-08-14 22:00:12,"I think his defense with side/back dodge into SB is too strong and makes Warden an annoying turtle. Unlike most dodge attacks, Warden's SB can be feinted (much safer than unfeintable dodge attacks), can't be baited for a parry (safer than other feintable dodge attacks), and can be used after a back dodge (even safer). He can simply dodge on reaction to any dodgeable attack, cancel a big part of his GB vulnerability by charging his SB, then either release on reaction to a whiff (or a failed GB) for free damage or feint on reaction to a feint to reset the fight. Backdodge into SB is a pure turtle move and it should be removed. SB after side dodge should have a much later timing. Again, it is a super safe turtle mechanic that makes attacking a Warden favor him while the attacking player should be favored. If you disagree, give some good reasons and don't be that ""omg he wants my main to be nerfed *downvotes and insults the OP * "" guy."

With the changes this season to dodge vulnerability/ feint to GB / roll to disengage, I kinda think bringing back the old shove mixup and polishing it up can bring back some of that personality while still being viable. Feel free to tear this apart. - (No changes) Shove on block = still gone. - (No changes) Shove still not guaranteed after heavy - (No changes) Shove itself still has uninterruptible stance - (No changes) Shove mixup can still be performed after heavy hit, whiff, or block - Light after shove no longer guaranteed, but is sped up to like 266/300/333 ms (intended to be unreactable), and is guaranteed if not dodged - Better back tracking of guard break after shove against backdodges/ disengaging rolls. Possibly, speed up the post-shove GB to match the speed of the post-feint GB - Heavy after shove either gets undodgeable property or uninterruptible stance, or sped up to 633/666/700 ms (or no changes, it actually wasn't that bad at dodge catching on jumpy players) - Long arm after shove gets either uninterruptible OR sped up by ~200 to 300 ms to catch dodge bashers like Conquerer, OR OR bash immunity (Neutral long arm may or may not also benefit from these changes) - Both heavy and light after shove is considered 2nd in chain, and both can lead to either UB heavy finisher or light finisher. - (No changes) Heavy after shove, if for some reason you are doing that right now, can re-engage another shove mixup after whiff/block/hit. Even though the hold shove mixup sucked, it also set LB apart from being just another bash -&gt; light character. His new shove just makes him another Conq/Valk/BP etc. Changes like the above forces both players to make a read on the other and make a choice about what the other will do."
167,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Some small Aramusha changes to round out his kit,12,cs1j99,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cs1j99/some_small_aramusha_changes_to_round_out_his_kit/,2019-08-19 00:01:28,"The recent patch finally allowed Aramusha to catch bockdodges on HF with feint-GB. This eliminates one of his biggest problems, but others persist. Namely: Lack of an opener; poor chain pressure outside of DF; a weak fullblock; lack of a bash punish; and no pressure on external blockers. So I'll recommend some things to change that in the most minimalistic way. * To fix his poor intiating and external pressure: Ring the bell is now available as a forward dash light, and it chains into chained lights or heavy finishers whether it hits or not. The move is 500ms after 200ms of dodge, non-variable. If you opt not to chain, you recover in time to CGB and block dodge attacks (a similar recovery to BP's shield bash.). Tracks backdodges very well, but not side dodges. I realize this attack would be dodged easily, but as it allows you to go straight into a HF or a light and is pretty safe I think it'd still allow Aramusha to access his offense * To fix his lack of chain pressure: Tempest is now *bidirectional* and after any heavy, the next light is 400ms 12dmg. Side-to-side heavies no longer trigger a finisher * To fix his fullblock: Blade Blockade can now have its recovery canceled with Push Back Kick, or Twin Vipers after 100ms of recovery (600ms of animation). In addition, BB can now be used as a softfeint from all heavies. Finally, Fury Unleased is 20dmg and becomes UB on successful block. * To fix his vulnerability to bashes: Rushing Wind (Alternate) (The side one) is given 300ms of iframes after 100ms of animation. In addition, all Rushing Wind can now be used 100ms-400ms into a dodge and is now 100ms faster. (I would rather he get a side dash attack which is basically just rushing wind, but this is the way to do it without adding a new move). Added to the move is a ""fade"" effect like the OOL version * Additionally, Aramusha can cancel recoveries with a *forward dash only* for some extra teamfight ability and to follow up on Push Back Kick That's it. There are other changes that I'd add in my ideal rework ([If anyone's curious](URL but I feel that these are the most minimalistic changes to give him what he needs."
168,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,An Attempt to Make the Wu-lin Competitive Through a Couple Minor Buffs,46,cu9za2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cu9za2/an_attempt_to_make_the_wulin_competitive_through/,2019-08-23 16:27:32,"As everyone knows, the Wu-lin are kinda... well, they aren't bad. But that doesn't mean that they are good. While JJ and Shaolin are the best designed, even they still struggle along w/ Nuxia and Tiandi when it comes to competitive play. Most of their gimmicks or moves are found out easily and are dealt with with impunity: Tiandi is blocked and dodged a lot, Shaolin can hardly enter his Qi Stance, JJ's opener is not an opener, and Nuxia just... sucks. One of the main reasons is that some of their gimmicks are just poorly designed. Tiandi's Dragon Kick is worthless in duels unless near a wall, and his Dragon Dodges are outright worthless. Shaolin's Qi Stance, while greatly designed, is incredibly difficult to enter into. Jiang Jun's opener is made worthless through a dodge, which even the universal dodge changes couldn't fix. And Nuxia's traps, her whole shtick, are solved with easy lights(non-superior) on reaction. Within this post are some buff suggestions that I believe would give each character an edge in competitive play without making them absolute monsters to newbies. &amp;#x200B; # Tiandi **Dragon Dodges** * Forward dodge heavy damage is buffed to 28 from 20 * Side dodge heavy damage is buffed to 28 from 25 * Side dodge heavy speed is buffed to 1000ms from 1100ms * Side dodge heavy I-frames are buffed to 600ms from 500ms * Side dodge input window is increased to 200-300ms from 200ms *Tiandi's Dragon Dodges were weak: his forward dodge heavy dealt little damage despite having HA, and his side dodge heavies were easy to GB and didn't even have adequate I-frames. And yet, Tiandi is called a ""dodge-specialist"".* *Now his forward dodge heavy is capable of some trading, and his side dodge heavies have less GB vulnerability and enough I-frames to last until the hard-feint time(like w/ JJ's side dodge heavies).* &amp;#x200B; **Tiger Dodges** * All Tiger Dodges have slightly increased forward movement * Tiger Dodge input window is increased to 100-300ms from 100-200ms * Tiger Dodge superior block frames are increased to 300ms from 200ms(making them like BP's neutral lights) *Tiandi's Tiger Dodges could hardly do their only job: counter-attacks. Due to the odd timing of 100ms minimum dodge input and 100ms start-up on the superior frames, it is hard to use Tiandi's Tiger dodges to counter-attack on reaction. And since that was the move's main purpose(which it failed to live up to), most people have to use it as a dodge attack, and fail due to their insistence of not being very good at dodging stuff.* *Now, Tiger Dodges can be used to dodge attacks, have better tracking, and are easier to counter-attack with.* &amp;#x200B; **Dragon Kick** * Kick knockback range is halved * Tiandi can now immediately branch into a forward dodge heavy * Hit stun on the opponent is significantly reduced to only allow the dodge heavy and a few external attacks * The soft-feint-into-dodge timing is moved to 400ms before the kick lands from 500ms before *Tiandi's kick was inconsequential in duels, while being a good ganking tool in 4v4s. Now it is usable in duels, is still good in ganks, and is unreactable due to the dodge input change.* &amp;#x200B; **Palm Strike** * Palm Strike is sped up to 566ms from 600ms *While not an insane speed, it is still an improvement.* &amp;#x200B; # Jiang Jun **JJ can now forward dodge into a GB.** *This is pretty much the only change that JJ needs, as it allows him to catch anyone back-dodging his heavies or shin kick.* &amp;#x200B; # Nuxia **Traps** * The first 100ms of the trap indicators are now hidden(Ala raider's stunning tap) * The heavy trap damage is lowered to 28 from 30 * OPTIONAL: Nuxia's Traps work against players who are unlocked or emoting *Now, with a much harder indicator to react to, pro players will have difficulty trying to emote, unlock, or simply lighting out of the traps.* &amp;#x200B; **Zone** * Zone damage is buffed to 35 from 25 * Zone range is doubled * Nuxia's zone is changed to be like Kensei's old zone where he would hit an opponent from behind before hitting an opponent in front of him(only Nuxia's can be hard- and soft-feinted) *Nuxia's zone is quite bad as an option select, but it's rather bad at actually zoning. Now, Nuxia should have no hard time creating space for herself.* *Disclaimer: While it would be good to make Nuxia's zone like Kensei's* ***current*** *zone, I do not feel like copy-pasting a move would be good for this game. So while these zone changes are not groundbreaking, they do make her zone better.* &amp;#x200B; **Nuxia now has the option to (heavy)trap someone after a deflect.** *Disclaimer: Of course, this ""deflect"" trap can work without having an active guard. So it's only a trap by name.* *Nuxia's deflect light is blockable... and punishable. While it is hard for players to block the deflect light, it is not impossible, and some can even punish it, most especially bots. Some people suggest making her deflect light unblockable. And while I feel that would solve Nuxia's deflect game, it would be too easy. So I went a different way as to make her a bit more unique('cause she's lacking a lot of that).* *With this, Nuxia can now reliably punish everything after a deflect, with the deflect light there to act as a higher risk, higher reward option.* &amp;#x200B; **Dodge lights** * Forward dodge light is now enhanced * Dodge light input window is increased to 300-500ms from 300ms *Nuxia's dodge lights were lacking in dodge capability due to fixed dodge inputs. With that fixed and an added enhanced property to her forward dodge light, she will have some dodge capabilities, along with some better catch-up capabilities.* &amp;#x200B; **Heavy Finishers** * After landing a heavy finisher, Nuxia can choose where to throw the opponent *A minor quality of life change that makes it easier for her to wall splat and ledge.* &amp;#x200B; # Shaolin **Damage** * Neutral heavy damage is buffed to 28 from 28 * Chain heavy damage is buffed to 28 from 28 * Finisher heavy damage is nerfed to 33 from 35 * Death Point Strike damage is nerfed to 22 from 24(12+4+6 from 12+6+6) * Deflect heavy damage is buffed to 28 from 25 **Speed** * Neutral side lights are sped up to 466ms from 500ms * Chain lights are sped up to 366ms from 400ms *These damage changes give Shaolin a better light parry punish and a better deflect punish. And the Death Point Strike damage nerf is compensated with a minor speed up, giving Shaolin an easier time entering Qi stance.* *The chain light changes make it easier for Shaolin to sustain his infinite chain.* &amp;#x200B; **Side Dodge heavies** * Dodge input window is buffed to 300-400ms from 300ms *A QOL change that gives Shaolin better dodge capabilities.* &amp;#x200B; **Zone** * First attack damage is buffed to 15 from 10 * Second attack damage is buffed to 20 from 10 * Third attack damage is buffed to 25 from 20 * Shaolin can enter Qi stance after the second and third strike * Stamina costs are changed to 20-20-20 from 60-0-0 *Shaolin's zone is quite underwhelming. It does not deal much damage, has a large stamina cost for little benefit, and does not help him to continue pressure.* *These changes give him better damage and stamina consumption, but also gives Shaolin's zone the capability of being used to enter Qi stance, giving Shaolin another option to enter Qi stance.* &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR:** * Tiandi's dragon dodges deal more damages * Tiandi's side dragon dodges are better at dodging * Tiandi's tiger dodges are easier to use at counter-attacking * Tiandi's dragon dodge has an unreactable mix-up and a proper punish in duels * Tiandi's palm strike is faster * JJ now has a forward dodge into a GB * Nuxia's traps have the first 100ms of the indicator hidden * Nuxia's zone is better at zoning with better a better hitbox, damage, and range * Nuxia can use a trap after a deflect * Nuxia's dodge lights now have a variable timing * Nuxia's forward dodge light is now enhanced * Shaolin's light parry punish is better * Shaolin's neutral side lights are faster but deal slightly less damage * Shaolin's chain lights are faster * Shaolin's zone deals more damage, has its stamina cost spread out across the strikes, and allow Shaolin to enter Qi stance after the second or third strikes * Shaolin's side dodge heavies have variable timing inputs &amp;#x200B; If anyone has any suggestions, comment them below.

I've been trying to play him but aside from Blade Blockade stuns and wallsplats I don't seem to be have a very consistent way of doing damage. 1vs1 are very frustrating due to a lack of tools, and 4vs4 external pressure is non-existent, which really makes it a headscratcher as to how he could have the highest win % in the game in Dominion of all things. So what is it? Theory: he has good minion clear and can destroy the Breach commander fast, and the low 100ms gb vulnerability on heavies + 40 damage 700ms side heavies are making him win many engagements in chaotic 4vs4... but is that really enough to make him jump straight to #1 winrate in Dominion? Am I missing something here? I know that if I was in Ubi's shoes I also wouldn't be inclined to straight buff him. It's almost guaranteed that a rework would nerf his heavies into having more consistent values."

Here are some changes that I think would help. On charged heavy openers: - Depending on the charge time, heavies are now 600-900ms as opposed to 700-900ms, which is how it currently is in testing grounds (I think so). This would let him get a simple heavy on heavy parry. I dont think that their gb vulnerability should be touched because 600ms gb invulnerable heavies with huge variable timing windows are just completely unhealthy for the game. Maybe make it so that it's 200ms instead of 300? But that's as far as that should go. - Revert whatever changes were made to range and tracking, because as they currently are they'll invariably whiff at ranges they just shouldn't. - Fully charged heavy now deals 35 damage. (Not really sure on this one, but I believe a 35 damage light parry punish wouldn't be way over the top) Charged unblockable heavy finisher - Increase the damage to 35. - Change speed to 1000ms. (They're currently kinda easy to interrupt, but I'm not sure how this change would affect his non-unblockable charged heavy finishers. Idea from TechnoThefirst's current post on here) Guardbreaks - Remove the newly added delays after throwing, so that it's easier to get the unblockable heavy after wallsplatting. I don't think there was any reason for this change since 30 damage wasn't really that strong for a wallsplat punish. Most heroes can get a lot more than that, and more consistently. Kensei can get 45 regardless of the distance to the wall, raider can get 40-50 depending on distance, warden always gets 40, etc etc - Fix whatever currently makes lion's roar force you to buffer the guardbreak throw on OOS opponents, and have it pause stamina regen. Eagle's fury - Increase damage to 25 - Significantly buff the tracking of the move - Change speed from 900ms to 700ms. - Remove the guaranteed jab afterwards.(42 damage would be just insanely strong for a roll catcher) Legion Kick - Improved forward tracking, increase input window from 100-300ms to 100-500 ms.(This will help him more easily track backdodges on orange should they not be converted to rolls, and will no longer make it so that he has to do so on a hard read) Also, an idea that would maybe go a bit over the top, but still: Would it be too strong for him to get a heavy on uncharged jab? I think it would add a little bit of more incentive to dodge, and given the fact that someone like hitokiri gets 30dmg on a similar mixup and she also has somewhat of an easier time entering it, I dont think it would be that unfair. Another way this could be implemented in is make level 2 jab guarantee a heavy cause as it currently stands the risk-reward for that is in favor of the defender by a large margin, as it's gb vulnerable when dodged. I'm obviously not a game designer but I think these are some good ideas to discuss here."
172,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A breakdown of Centurions rework and why it needs further attention from the devs,4,cybjrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cybjrm/a_breakdown_of_centurions_rework_and_why_it_needs/,2019-09-02 01:48:24,"Hello Competitive for Honor, after taking a break from the Tournament scene i got back to test the new Centurion rework. This post wont be a rant, instead ill try to analyze the state of the new centurion. First of all im satisfied with the rework but it did not make it better, let me explain why by breaking down every tool in the kit: Raw Heavy: 700ms from previous 600ms. Bad faint timings. 400ms gb vulnerability. I dont understand the choice of slowing it down and not increasing the range of the raw uncharged heavy. Backwalking denies pressure from centurion. Charged heavies: why do they even pin now? The cutscene gone from neutral is good but it left a complete mess in cents kit. (now wallsplat doesnt guarantee fully charged heavy and that is just a bad design choice). Punishes: its ok to have light on heavy parry and fully charged on light parry... but oos and wall punishes are non existent right now. Kick: why not slowing it down and make it faintable or speeding it up? Kick is still the most stupid move in cents kit. Here are some suggestions for making cent an actual GOOD tournament character: - Wallsplat now guarantees a fully charged punch (cent can access punch after a successful gb throw or knee parry). - Kick is speeded up or faintable for better oos pressure. - Knee parry punish drains more stamina and has a bigger imput window. - While opponent is oos centurion with a successful parry or gb can heavy into fully charged punch (make it so punches against oos opponents are faster ms wise)."
173,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,What does it take to make Highlander competitive again?,2,cyc2ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cyc2ws/what_does_it_take_to_make_highlander_competitive/,2019-09-02 02:30:47,"Hey comp sub. I've been really tryharding Highlander these last few weeks. He is struggling in 4's and duels. He's probably the most technical hero FH has to offer, yet most of his moves are completely reactable. He is one of the heroes struggling the most with stamina management and definitely the hero with the most polarizing matchups. From the reps I rushed on him last week, I want to share my thoughts and start a discussion on him, as I think he's not discussed a lot around here recently. Entering offensive stance can be quite difficult, and borderline impossible depending matchups (fought Shinos and Shaolins that would literally deflect EVERY backstep light). With the overall 500 ms normalization of light attacks he's pretty exposed to interruptions and has pretty much no reasons to try and throw lights except entering OS. His attacks brings him a lot forward, which is good but not good enough to compensate his terrible movement speed (both sprint and locked on). I feel like his Offensive Heavy have a lot of GB vulnerability, as I stuff some feint to GB attempts with defensive heavies, while it rarely works with offensive ones. His kick is entirely reactable, but the grab soft feint keep people on their toes. It's a solid mixup. But the opponent has too much easy responses without even reading. Light interrupts and dodge convert into roll is very problematic, because while someone has Warden can read and respond adequately with a feint into light parry, or feint into VB, HL can't hard feint and can't pressure at all. Not to mention that it costs half of your stamina to enter OS, kick and grab cancel, so you're on par stamina wise with your rolling opponent. Of of my mains concerns is the reactability of his openers. Celtic curse is entirely reactable. Let go, soft feint or OS cancel. Lights are a danger. He depends too much on spacing for a character that can't close gaps fast or create space easily. In 4's, his ganks are obviously deadly when well executed, but he's not much of a teamfighter. He can't stay in OS in group fights and is very hard to execute when not hanging in the back for easy grabs and fast OS heavies. He also has in my opinion the worse revenge pressure of the entire cast. His 1vX potential is inexistant as everything he does is either too long or too reactable to have impact when in revenge. What could the devs do to preserve his identity but make him usable again? He didn't change at all for over a year but the upbringing of old cast and new heroes keep putting him down."
174,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Hito is not as unhealthy as people say she is. [And what i would do to improve her],0,cydmc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cydmc0/hito_is_not_as_unhealthy_as_people_say_she_is_and/,2019-09-02 04:31:06,"People recently started making a big deal of her. But the way i see it, its nothing compared to other abominations such as Shinobi, Lawbringer, and Jor. I agree that her HA is a big problem, but again, its not that bad compared to 124 stamina damage parry, or a 40-50 damage parry, and etc. Of course i'd rather have it gone of course. Im also not much a fan of 700ms heavies, regardless of how much GB vulnerability they have. I also agree that her TTK is a bit ridiculous. I wouldnt say its unfair ( Because the kick doesnt have much of a great risk reward and all of its options are punished quite hard ), but i agree that someone shouldnt kill a hero in 30 seconds. Though, im not saying i totally disagree. I can perfectly see hito is, well, kinda yikes to fight against due to her obnoxious HA, and also with how fast she can delete your healthbar. If i were to improve hito while not hurting her current position too much, i would do this : First, removing her super fast damage output on streaks of correct reads : *1. Kick can now only be done after an opener attack. Kick is given a special feint GB that starts her chain.* By doing this, the kick mixup can be only used once in a single chain. Second, lets improve her chain pressure to compensate, that of course, end her chain. *2. In a chain of three attacks or more, the chained light attack finisher is sped up to **400ms***. *3. Try to make her charged heavy feints more delayable and more belieavable so they are now a proper mixup. Give heavies said softfeints to guardbreak so the inconsistency when it comes to feint GBing her unblockables is gone. Neutral and second unblockable heavy reduced to 30 damage. Lastly, heavy lands 100ms faster after being released. Chained heavies are given HA.* Those two enforce the idea of chain progression, and makes her chain usable outside of chip damage and kick. Now, tone down her defense : *4. HA on neutral heavies is removed unless charged. Neutral heavies come out at 800ms minimum.*"
175,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Give All Heavies that are at 600-700ms 200ms of GB vulnerability,1,cydojw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cydojw/give_all_heavies_that_are_at_600700ms_200ms_of_gb/,2019-09-02 04:35:41,"Title. 600-700ms moves are pretty much impossible to feint-into-gb due to their low GB vulnerability. And while I will say that this is not exactly the most healthy of game design choices, it is certainly not the worst. Either way, these low GB vulnerable moves can be quite easy to be used defensively, as you can just see it in characters such as Gladiator, Aramusha, and Conqueror(centurion is different considering his version of feinting heavies). I think we should try and give these types of heavies 200ms of GB vulnerability, as an experiment, to see how it would affect the game. Why did I bring this up? To anyone that has played the Testing grounds will know, Cent's heavies were nerfed in their GB vulnerability, giving them 400ms of GB vulnerability as opposed to the 100ms we're used to. The devs did this, yet they didn't do the same for Glad's heavies, which I would say can be used in an even more defensive manner than Cent's heavies. And as Freeze said in his ""Centurion Testing Grounds' Changes"" video, the devs should hold some consistency: either all of these fast heavies should have 400ms GB vulnerability, or they shouldn't. There is no in-between."
176,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Back-walking has been addressed, but it hasn't solved the problems of unreliable chase-down and mix-ups. Everyone needs chase-down and the problem has stemmed from feint into GB being stationary, mobility was never at fault in my opinion. I think it's been over nerfed to compensate.",9,cz3k4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cz3k4e/backwalking_has_been_addressed_but_it_hasnt/,2019-09-03 21:25:48,"This may be another topic on it's own, but I disagreed with removal of the old diagonal back-dodge because I knew it wasn't really the problem and wrongfully limited mobility in my view because of a stagnant problem with feint and guard-break. I don't disagree with most of the recent mobility nerfs, but they gutted shinobi with no compensation, and they didn't solve the issue as you can still back-walk and back dodge out of GB range, the safety isn't exceptionally unique to shinobi anymore however, he's about as good at it as everyone else now, meaning his mobility doesn't give him much of an advantage over anyone else, in fact he's much weaker when GB range is maintained with how slow he is and how much more GB vulnerability he has. Just walk forward and reaction GB shut him down completely now. His strength relies on being out of range and he's poorly designed. Even with escape and mobility so heavily nerfed. I also think they went too far with the rolling nerfs, you're simply vulnerable to GB for too long and can be reaction GB'd out of dodge into roll. But none of these changes solved the problems of feint into GB being stationary and lack of viable chase-down, it's still inconsistent and chase-down and mix-ups aren't as reliable as they should be. Chase-down or lack there of is a huge issue in this game. Every character needs good chase-down, this should be standard, yes of course some should be better at it than others for hero diversity and specialization, such as Shaman is better at it than Shigoki, but still every hero fundamentally needs a viable chase-down tool for balance in the game. Shigoki for example shouldn't be denied chase-down simply because it would be as good as PK's chase-down and undermine her specialty, that wouldn't be logical. Give shigoki viable chase-down and if you feel PK's should be better, than simply expand her chase-down because it is pretty bare-bones and outdated. Giving her the option to feint her dodge heavy for example would be huge. And not just for her, this move is by far one the best chase-down moves in the game imo without making it so fast you can just react like warden can with his chase-down. Examples of characters with great chase-down imo are shaolin, tiandi, and Jorm imo. Feint-able dodge heavies are best to be standard. Everyone should have a forward dodge heavy that is feint-able, unless they specialize in chase-down like shaman or warden and have faster chase-down that can punish on reaction. A feint-able dodge attack allow you to punish on read, but also allows you safety and potential mix-ups as well as other utility in Jorm's case of early hyper armor and trading. Berserker and Warlord's dodge heavies are simply too slow and should be feint-able. It's too risky and even if they throw it they might still get punished after a roll, but they have to commit on early read and it's simply too slow and it gets baited and punished easily. [URL Here's a basic PK guide I saw on YT. I timestamped it so you can see the tracking her running GB. Look at forward movement and tracking combined with a GB, look how effective it is at simply not whiffing with T-rex arms. It is possible, the right solutions just haven't been put forward. We shouldn't completely gut defense and mobility in the game, most of the problems aren't even from defense and mobility but a lack or mechanics or offense to deal with it. Fundamentally with Shinobi, it's never been his fault, there just wasn't reliable mechanics such as feint into GB or chase-down mix-ups to deal with him. He's been wrongfully nerfed into the ground, his kit has many flaws that won't get addressed for years to come. He deserves a lot of buffs to single dodge attacks, to better recoveries, healthier risk/reward for everyone etc. He needs a lot and it hasn't even begun to be addressed. But it is possible to balance him and this game. I know it. The right solution was to be able to move while throwing a GB or feinting so you don't lose ground on a back-walking opponent. Removing diagonal dodge was wrong and adding ungodly amounts of GB vulnerability to roll and dodge roll was wrong. 600ms+333ms=933ms window you can reaction GB. The only thing still good about dodge roll is just how much feint GB sucks at catching things and you can get out of range, that's it. It was too extreme and didn't solve the issue. Now you simply can't move or escape optimal ganks, and you can't move where you want. If you're at a weird angle, you will dodge roll into a wall instead of going where you want because you can't diagonal dodge. It's an unnecessary nerf on mobility that was never the problem imo. It's a large reason why assassins are just that much more unbearable to play. Both because of limited to no chase-down options and because of mobility being over-nerfed and have to escape more often with mobility and low health. It's the worst of both worlds. The new defense meta is 200hp, damage reduction and better fundamental mechanics other characters don't have. Assassins are the worst class in the game right now. If you're walking forward, and you GB, you should be able to keep moving and not lose ground and not become stationary. You should be in the same place as if you never stopped walking forward. Controlled movement during heavy feint animations and during guard-breaks. That will solve the problem when it come to escaping normal mix-ups. Roll GB vulnerability doesn't need to be more than 100-200ms, they should also bring back diagonal dodges assuming fixes to feint GB are made and can punish it. Also give everyone chase-down of at least a dodge forward heavy that is feint-able. Shigoki should have this to shortcut his running attack. Every character should have this move or something better. There's also different utility when you apply hyper armor, other properties and speeds. I don't think any chase-down should be slower than 900ms, and no faster than 500ms. You should also be able to feint your chase-down later than other attacks to make the feints unreactable and serve as opener and make the bait game on mobility a two way street. Mobility was strong because the bait game was one sided and most characters have to commit to chase-down preemptively. Some of the changes have unfairly crippled mobility into a nonviable aspect and play-style of the game due to poor mechanics and offense to catch or counter it. I really don't think mobility was ever at fault. Feint into GB itself has always been terrible. Everyone can back-walk and then early back-dodge out of GB range because of the issues with feint GB, and all mobile classes have been unfairly nerfed to essentially this limited level of mobility. Mobility was strong because of feint GB being a poor mechanic that stops your forward movement for 800ms and having poor chase-down options that are easily baited and punish. Mobility and defense have a place in this game. Shinobi and ranged attacks also have a place in this game. They just need the right solutions to be balanced. Shinobi's risk reward and punish frequency on ranged attacks should be like shaman's. She effectively has a better ranged kit in 1v1. She's now better than him in every-way. Better gank, better 1v1, 1vX, better dodge attacks, low key buff to standard rolls, Shin has no chase-down and shaman has the best chase. He's not in a good place, he's never been healthy for the game, but it is possible to get him healthy and it's not his fault and he's been over nerfed and the real problems still haven't been solved."

178,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Thoughts on centurion's update,27,cz8c2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cz8c2q/thoughts_on_centurions_update/,2019-09-04 03:56:27,"This is a copy paste from my post on their main forums as to ensure the likelyhood it is seen. ""I wanted to hold off on making this kind of thread till near the end of testing grounds time frame but seeing as how i'm already spending 5 plus minutes for duels and struggling to even get into a match for dominion already I might as well put my thoughts down while they're fresh. I am on pc and i've already filled out the survey today but I want to make a thread about it. As while the survey did have some specifics to it there wasn't enough for me to say about my main. Further more I want to encompass his whole kit and not just the changes. Along with giving my suggestions. I will also be posting this to the competitive subreddit as to make sure it will be seen and picked up by someone so it can be sent in. With all of that out of the way lets start with what I liked: [B]Likes:[/B] -Jab after light. I can't really express in words how great this feels. See from the beginning i've always felt like centurion was supposed to mix between his lights and heavies. But not in your traditional fashion of a combo. But rather with grabs and punches acting as a bridge to extend his mix up potential. Having jab after a light does what quick throw could not and this makes him much more fun to engage with and use. This change a long with 3 other changes are changes I feel should absolutely carry over to live when all is said and done. I really could not imagine playing centurion without this anymore. -Feintable Jab and unblockable heavy. these two changes compliment that bridge being built by jab after light. Again these feel like natural parts of his kit that i've been trying to do with his mix ups since he launched. I feel the main reason behind this is because centurion actually really cares about guard breaks since throws are massively important to his kit identity. These and the jab after light make up 3 of the 4 changes that I think should exist going forward. -Removal of the cutscene. I'm not going to say I hated the cutscene. I didn't mind being hit by it at all. Really the more annoying aspect about it for me has always been the fact that I NEED to do it. As he had no other easy way to pump out damage. His other source of main damage always came from wall throw punishes or OOS punishes. Neither of which were of easy access to centurion compared to the cutscene. It is true that punishes are a big part of his kit and I will get into that later. But I don't think cutscene should come back in any form moving forward. It feels much better to keep mixing up and then landing that full punch after you've successfully mind gamed your opponent. It's a feeling that not enough heros sport and I think it's important to keep. -Minor details. The devs managed to make a few small changes that I honestly wasn't expecting to happen but I appreciate none the less. These would be the recoveries/tracking/and vulnerabilities of his jabs and heavy finishers. These were sore spots in centurion's kit that prevented him from using his mix up potential and even more importantly prevented him from being able to properly anti gank/participate in a team fight. I do think that maybe his level 2 jab might have a bit too much recovery on it. But i'll have to play with it more. I also really like the increased speed on his charged heavies and decreased speed on the jab. The former makes baits like spacing and punishing someone's whiff games with a fully charged heavy more easier to do while the later adds to the mind game of dodging on someone who's properly mixed up. Though the feint timing is meant to be 300ms before the move per patch notes yet on the testing grounds it's 400ms before the move lands. Should be fixed. [B]Dislikes:[/B] -Lion's roar. I'm not sure how much is intentional here or if these are mistakes. But I don't enjoy how the stamina damage it does is negated by someone regening stamina now. I understand that maybe having it pause someone's regen in OOS might be too oppressive. And I could maybe get behind it. But this happens when they have stamina too. You also couple that with the removal of haymaker effecting his move and you essentially kill this move entirely. Dead moves should never exist in a kit and that's unfortunately what's happened here. -Throws. I don't know who thought throws needed to be nerfed. But they clearly were not being very objective about their decision making. They made kicks and heavies after throws take an extra 200ms to do. I don't see why this was needed as neither were guaranteed after a throw. in open space. This seems aimed at tackling Centurion's threatening presence around walls. But this is about punishes which is something I am making it's own section. I'm unsure if this throw change is also what has bugged throwing after lion's roar smacks or not. But i'm including it here anyway. It's input is finicky now requiring you to buffer/mash the input. That NEEDS to be looked at. -Opening heavy speed/GB vulnerability changes. I'm at odds on this one. As power has to be taken away in order for power to be gained for proper balancing. Obviously one of the things we lost in turn for mix up power was the removal for cutscene. I do not have an issue with this. And I understand how safe his heavies used to be and i'm not 100% against making them a bit more vulnerable. However I think increasing charged heavy GB vulnerability ON TOP OF making his heavy opener 100ms slower is overkill. What this does is essentially makes it harder to attempt heavy mix ups from neutral. I am fully aware that Centurion can and does use his soft feint into GB to cover up GB attempts on reads and the devs left this in. However, making these two changes only slightly effects that power whilst unintentionally effecting something else. 600-700ms heavies are known for being pretty difficult to punish with feint into GB. But there needs to be some standardizing here. we can't punish centurion for this but let people like aramusha get away with super safe heavies either. So, if you're going to take a stance on this do so with all heros who benefit from this. Otherwise revert one or both changes made to centurion here. Also worth mentioning feint/soft feint timings feel wonky with charged heavy finisher now. I have yet to figure out what causes it. -effectiveness of unblockable mix ups. Yes, unfortunately his unblockable mix ups are not super good. Both can currently be back dodged on reaction to orange if you've not been hit by a heavy or a pin. In jabs case I believe this is because feinting into GB for the charged portion isn't the sped up GB speed like all other feint to GB's. (even his slight charged jab has this.) I am unsure if this is a design decision or a bug. But it needs to be fixed. In his UB heavy case I think it's just a matter of distance. I think his charged heavie's distances were nerfed. But that's so hard to test. Either way, they should get a range increase in order to be able to properly threaten someone who's not spacing optimally. -kick/dodge heavy went untouched. I understand this is phase 1 implying there will be more done and that perhaps they didn't want to change too much at once. However I'm mentioning them because both play into something that centurion lacks. Chase. Not every hero should be an excellent 1v1 hero. Not every hero needs to be able to chase as sometimes simply deterring your opponent is valuable enough in 4's. However, for heros that are DESIGNED to be single pickers, heros that are meant to be a power house in cqc they need chase. because all it takes is one slip up by the person and they get to leave the fight. This is what happens with centurion. Even if his mix up problems are addressed there is still a very real possibility for the person to escape because centurion lacks both range and chase down in order to make attempting to leave the fight not something to worry about. As you're at no risk for trying to. Both moves should be addressed to fill this gap in his kit. [B]Punishes:[/B] I wanted to make this it's own section because it's very core to who centurion is as a hero. He doesn't need to be the most damaging person with his mix ups. Nor does he need to have insane normal (i.e parry) punishes for this to be fulfilled. All that needs to be done is giving him multiple viable options. If done correctly the hero will have to make decisions based on what would be appropriate at the time. We have other heros that do semi focus on punishes. Even a dlc hero who needs a specific punish to be lethal. But no hero revolves around the punisher style quite like centurion does. I understand the developers don't usually look at punishes when updating/making heros but they'd make an exception for centurion because this is who he is. So them attempting to reel him in isn't confusing to me. Or rather did. The devs pulled back on his punish capabilities imo as a way to attempt to balance his new found mix up power. This isn't totally wrong of them to do. But I feel they over did it. Them changing his parry punishes are fine. 27 damage with stamina damage on a heavy parry or just 17 damage. One lets centurion pressure at the cost of more revenge to the opponent but also potentially opens up more with a wall near by. Or the 17 damage that's lower than the former with less potential but it's safer. 27 damage is also on par with his jab into light. Which means no real loss in damage or gain in damage between offensive and defensive playing. This is really good. 30 damage from a charged heavy on a light parry. This is decent enough damage on it's own but the real value comes from the fact that you're getting a pin on a parry. this means centurion can effectively setup for his team or gank partner. and of course you still get his parry counter punish too if you think ledging might be possible or OOS state will be a thing. However, where I think they went too far is with his GB/throw/wall punishes. This is where centurion himself stands the most to gain from his own efforts. But it is also the riskiest because all of these including his full charge jab almost guarantee revenge for the opponent if they live. This is where centurion arguably did too much pre update so it's understandable that they want to focus on this. Specifically they shouldn't have messed with his throw timings. And they should have only minorly adjusted his lion's roar potential. Without lion's roar in the picture the only satisfying punish and area centurion benefits the most from damage wise is landing eagle's talons. Which is 100% worth going for still both due to the boosted damage and also because it still allows multiple heavies for allies. but for centurion himself it means the rest of his efforts feel wasteful. It doesn't feel good. Currently on live if centurion gets a GB near a wall that nets him 95 damage. 30 from smacks and a wall throw and 65 from his cutscene and OOS opponent for his troubles. Testing grounds centurion gets 30 damage and no meaningful stamina damage. That's too far of a swing. If centurion gets a throw on an OOS opponent on live he gets 105 damage. 30 from smacks into a throw into a delayed raw heavy into a cutscene. if centurion gets a throw in testing grounds he gets 55 if you buffer a uncharged heavy into full heavy. Too far of a swing. If centurion on testing had access to lion's roar damage a wall throw would net him 60 damage. Which is half of his biggest punish at 130 damage. If centurion on testing had access to lion's roar damage a ground throw would net him 55 damage. I don't personally see these numbers as too high. But i'd be willing to nerf haymaker damage down if we fixed lion's roars usefulness. Changing the damage from 10 to 5. and allowing centurion to do meaningful stamina damage with lion's roar again. He still wouldn't be hitting harder than lots of other heros. but he'd at least have options for punishes now instead of just defaulting to either a heavy or talons. [B]Bugs:[/B] -parrying his UB side heavies throws him out of range to be punished -you whiff heavies on heavy parry now -throwing after lion's roar is bugged -stamina regen when hit with lion's roar is bugged and lets people regen through your damage -parry counter input is stricter than it used to be [B]Suggestions:[/B] Here is a quick bullet point list of changes that i'd make to centurion for testing in the next phase. -Revert throw delays -haymaker now works on lion's roar again but at reduced damage to 5 -lion's roar does more stamina damage and doesn't get regened through even if the person is oos. (but the pause on stamina regen is less compared to other bashes.) -revert opening heavy speed to 600ms -buff charged heavy ranges -speed up the feint into GB for charged jabs -Allow centurion to target swap his UB's during charging -Kick can now be done 100ms into his dodge and has increased range -Dodge forward heavy is now 700ms from 900ms and has less whiff recovery [B]Closing thoughts:[/B] Overall I like the direction the developers are taking with Centurion. he's more fun to play with/against. I just think they over nerfed him in a few areas and they need to fine tune some other moves/aspects to his kit. Currently he feels like a worse hitokiri despite having more options for kitflow.

180,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Unique take on Blocking?,2,d01ol6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/d01ol6/unique_take_on_blocking/,2019-09-06 00:40:06,"What if blocking was changed in a way that encourages attacking and parrying? How does this have to do with Blocking? well here are my ideas to update Blocking. Now of course this is literally a core mechanic so it'll need to be tested way before its released. Blocking on a static guard. When you successfully block an attack, it damages your guard position. lights do less damage while heavies deal more. when your guard position is broken, you will fall on the ground. This is usually the highest damage punish in the game. However, a parry will deny any block damage. While attacking replenishes your guard. You can regen your guard naturally but the lower your stamina, the more guard damage you will take and the slower it regens. (maybe have light parries regen guard while heavily damaging their guard?) Indication Your Guard will show the amount of damage it has taken. In whatever direction you're guarding aka left, right, or top, your indicator will start shrinking as it takes more damage. If your guard no longer appears white, it will break on the next attack. (there will be a white outline on it so its still easy to see where you are guarding) your parry as well as other moves listed below will prevent any damage no matter how weakened your guard is Blocking on reflex guard. Most likely will have the same amount of block as a static guard but instead, deflecting will regen a large portion of guard while also damaging their guard heavily. They could simply have a weaker guard but a deflect will regen most if not all? All blocks and crushing counters. Regular attacks on all blocks will not damage it however bashes or unblockables can punish this by dealing extra heavy guard damage. (maybe increase the time of GB vulnerability or maybe if you have no guard left your all guard will break?) Crushing counters will not damage your guard but will damage their guard lightly. Superior Guard Characters like valk and kensai who can dodge into attacks while blocking. Doing this will result in no damage in your guard but damages their guard lightly. Ganks? Your Guard will take the damage of only one attack if you successfully block all attacks at once while also taking slightly but increasingly less damage from 2v1s, 3v1s, 4v1s. Parries will not damage your guard. Revenege will regen your guard to full also preventing it from taking any damage while in revenge. Now keep in mind all these counters lead into you moving from defence into offense. like wise for your opponent. Now theres the issue of certain heroes who have no opener so they have to resort on defence (becoming a turtle). Of course other heroes would actually benefit off this. Tho this isn't a huge priority in the game as much more work is needed to be done first before they could add something like this. I'd like to hear your thoughts about it."
181,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha rework (offer for testing grounds in next season).,14,d01xl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/d01xl6/aramusha_rework_offer_for_testing_grounds_in_next/,2019-09-06 01:00:32,"With that changes aramusha follow character concept as master of infinite combo and soft feints but now it will be really useful! BLADE BLOCKADE - (Full Block - FB): * Blade Blockade now can be Soft Feinted into New ""Unblockable Heavy Attack"" (not new actually) and Push Back Kick. Comments: How it works. FB enter is 100ms then directly FB 400ms (you can do Soft Feints on first 100ms of directly FB) and then recovery 500ms. Those changes will give to aramusha a lot of potential in all situations, duels, teamfights, ganks and others. NEW UNBLOCKABLE HEAVY: * Unblockable Heavy have animation like right side ""Twin Vipers"". * Animation speed 800ms. * Damage 30. * No Uninterruptible Stance. * Can be Soft Feinted into 400ms Light attacks (left or top). * Have Vulnerability to Guard Break is 400ms. * Twin Vipers and ""New Unblockable Heavy"" Increased range to forward by 1 meter. Comments: it will be really strong opener and chain pressure. Also it will give to aramusha a lot of potential in teamfights. PUSH BACK KICK: * Successful hit Push Back Kick now can be chained to Rushing Wind by pressing heavy button but it is not guaranteed without wallsplat. * Push Back Kick now have recovery after hit and miss is 600ms (if not continued to Rushing Wind after hit) and guaranteed punish by dodge attacks. * Stamina damage decreased to 20 (from 40). * Animation speed 566ms. * Still have Uninterruptible Stance but only after blocking hits by Blade Blockade not after Soft Feint. * Push Back Kick now can Knock Down the enemy in oos. And then chained Rushing Wind will be guaranteed. Comment: kick will be very useful gank tool. Guaranteed Rushing Wind from Aramusha for 30 dmg after wallsplat or guaranteed Heavy attack from ally or you can ledge the enemy. Also it will be very good oos pressure because you will have 50/50 between Soft Feinted Unblockable heavy or Push Back Kick. LIGHT &amp; HEAVY ATTACKS: * Now you can cancel recoveries by Blade Blockade after Any Light, Heavy attacks and after Rushing Wind and Rushing Wind Alternate (like Black Prior). Comment: its need for more convenience and variability in infinite combo and a lot of potential in teamfights because now you will can chain your infinite combo to Blade Blockade and then Unblockable Heavy or Push Back Kick. + Light Opener attacks damage increased to 17 (was 15). + All Infinite Lights attacks damage are normalized to 17 (top were 16) + All Deadly Feint attacks damage are normalized to 15 (side were 20) * Side Heavy Opener attacks animation Speed decreased to 800ms (was 700ms). * Top Heavy Opener attacks animation Speed decreased to 700ms (was 600ms). * Top Heavy Opener attacks damage increased to 30 (was 25). * You can do guaranteed Top Heavy attack in Guard Break. * Heavy Opener attacks now have Vulnerability to Guard Break is 400ms. Comments: 25 dmg after heavy parry it is too much but with that changes, aramusha will have better guard break punish and now have a reason to buff Fury Unleashed. * All Heavy Finisher attacks now have Uninterruptible Stance on 200ms from start animation. * All Heavy Finisher attacks recovery decreased to 800ms. Comments: its need for more potential in teamfights. FURY UNLEASHED &amp; RING THE BELL * Fury Unleashed damage decreased to 25 (was 30). * Fury Unleashe now is Unblockable. + Ring The Bell damage decreased to 0 (was 15). + Ring The Bell stamina damage increased to 80 (was 20). + Ring The Bell now Knock Down the enemy in oos. Comments: now Fury Unleased will be very nice to punish enemy after blocking by Blade Blockade. It will be guaranteed punish after blocking Heavy attacks and i think not guaranteed after blocking light attacks but parry timing will be very very hard, like on Raiders Zone attack after Charge and knee. So it will be almost guaranteed after blocking lights too. Ring the Bell will be very good tool for stamina pressure. RUSHING WIND: * Rushing Wind damage increased to 30 (was 25). * Now you can do Rushing Wind with side stance. + Rushing Wind Alternate now a NEW MOVE! + Rushing Wind Alternate now have animation like Rushing Wind. + Now you can do Rushing Wind Alternate only after Side Dodges by cancel recoveries Side Dodges into Rushing Wind Alternate (just like Raider with Stunning Tap). + Animation Speed 600ms. + No Uninterruptible Stance. + Damage 20 + Cant be Feinted. Comments: It is very important changes for teamfights. Also now you will can punish more enemy moves, like Valkyrie Spear Sweep or Conqueror Bashes and others. ZONE ATTACK: * First hit Zone attack damage increased to 20 (was 15). * 2nd hit Zone attack now have Uninterruptible Stance on 200ms from start animation. * Stamina Cost changed to 30-30 (was 60-0). Comment: with that changes zone attack will be very strong tool for teamfights."
182,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Cents rework is not that great,4,d0k22x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/d0k22x/cents_rework_is_not_that_great/,2019-09-07 03:52:32,"To share my thoughts on the testing grounds, I would have to say that I like the Warlord and Gladiator changes. Much needed. Im not too happy with the Centurion changes. I feel that he much needed changes, with his slow kick which can easily be punished, and his slow, predictable punch, and having no real opener whatsoever. However, I feel that the testing grounds cent has been robbed of some of the more balanced, yet strong aspects of his gameplay. And no, Im not talking about the cutscene. Im talking about his fast heavies, which were not gb vulnerable, and would allow you to almost safely go for consistent parries/charged heavy mixups. And his heavy parry punish. Forget the wall splat cutscene after the knee. Now you only get 17 off of a heavy parry and 25 off of a heavy (only if you dont do the counter on reaction)? And if youre lucky it will wallsplat and you get a charged heavy. His heavies are pretty basic now, and hes basically turned into Hito with no enhanced lights. As far as the punch changes, just speed up the punch to Jorms speed so after a light or heavy they have to dodge on prediction? But keep the charged punch tracking and the Eagles talons damage. I feel like they couldve reached the same goal with adding a feintable charged heavy but just speeding up the punch so if an enemy dodges on prediction and you gb you catch them. But, if you want my opinion on just one thing about Cent, bring back the fast heavies and heavy on any parry punish. We just cant keep getting 17 damage off of light parries Ubi. And keep his heavies with very low gb vulnerability."

On the one hand, it is absolutely useless on high level, on the other hand, he is too strong against newbies. * Now all attacks branch into any chain attacks at 200ms into the Hit Recovery (was 100ms). (Exept Stormrush). Comments: It is necessary for beginners to let them counter Orochi light spam easier. * Double Top Lights attacks damage increased to 15-10 (was 15-7). Comments: From the start of the game, Double Top Lights attacks were one of the main Orochi's feature. After rework they was nerfed too much and now they are weaker than even Shinobi's double lights, who has them from all sides, not only top. These Lights will be decent interruption tool and it will suit Orochi's specialization ""Counter Attacker"". At the same time, he will have good parry punish. Also he will be better in teamfights. * All Second Light attacks damage increased to 15 (was 12). Comments: Second Light attacks have unreasonably low damage. * Stormrush damage increased to 25 (was 17). * Now Stormrush can Interrupt the enemy with Uninterruptible Stance. (Like Gladiator Fuscina Ictus). * Now Stormrush Right attack have Uninterruptible Stance from start 0ms to the end 500ms animation. (Hidden animation without changes. Overall speed 500ms. Run 200ms and directly attack is 300ms). * Now Stormrush Left attack is Unblockable. (Hidden animation without changes. Overall speed 600ms. Run 200ms and directly attack is 400ms). * Now u can do Soft-Feint Stormrush Left attack into Dodge after 200ms from start animation. (It means you appear Unblockable indicator on 200ms your run animation and right before the directly attack and attack indicator you can do soft-feint into dodge). * Now if the distance allows you can immediately do Left, Right or Top Stormrush attack without minimum 200ms ""run animation"" of Stormrush. (Hidden animation run still here). This will reduce the run animation to the actual attack from 400 ms to 200 ms. Stormrush Top attack without changes. Overall speed 700ms. Run 200ms and directly attack is 500ms. Comments: Stormrush is almost completely useless move now. In 1v1 it is easy to block/parry it or interrupt/trade. In team fights it is high risky and you deal only 17dmg. With these changes Orochi will have a good variation in the attack through the Stormrush Now it will be quite strong offensive move which will give Orochi opportunity to open his opponents and start chains. It will also be a rather useful move in team fights and ganks, since it will interrupt enemy attacks with an armor. * Sprint Heavy attack damage increased to 20 (was 17). * All Side Heavy attacks damage increased to 35 (was 30). * All Side Heavy attacks animation speed increased to 700ms (was 800ms). Vulnerability to Guard Break 200ms (like top heavies). Comments: Side Heavy attacks are slower and have less damage than Top Heavy attacks. The same damage and speed as on Top Heavy attacks will make them relevant for use directly, as the attack itself. * Now you can cancel recoveries by dodges not only after any Light and Heavy finishers but even after Any Light and Heavy attacks or Zone attack. (You can cancel recoveries after successful hit, whiff or blocked). * Riptide Strike are no longer interrupted on Block. * Side Light Finishers are no longer interrupted on Block. * Helm Splitter and Zephyr Slash animation speed increased to 500ms (was 600ms). (Like Shaman side dodge attacks). (Orochi still can delay them). * Now after Parry enemy attacks you can do Unblockable Zone attack. Comments: Orochi need to be able to move in team fights, because he has no static guard, big HP or Hyper Armor. Now he will be able to quickly move away from the opponent's attacks, canceling the recovery of his own attacks by dodges, which will be easier thanks to i-frames on his dodge attacks. With these changes, he will become a strong teamfighter in 2v2 and 4v4."
184,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A plausible fix to both rolls and revenge issues,1,cdtmyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cdtmyr/a_plausible_fix_to_both_rolls_and_revenge_issues/,2019-07-16 17:03:48,"Hey, so Ive had a few ideas Ive wanted to state on both rolls and revenge, in both duels and 4s. The Roll Issue: Rolls are a real issue in 1v1s because it lets you just delete offense in favor of a basically unpublishable defensive for some of the heros in this game. On the same side of this issue though, in 4s, your roll can be GBd even if you are trying to escape a gank, which makes large ganks even harder to beat, especially if you are trying to reposition. The devs gave rolls minor gb vulnerability to move them down defensively, which was supposed to fix the issue, but as a stated before, it sucks in 4s, and in duels, rolls can STILL be used very effectively to escape pressure. My proposed change: make rolls inaccessible in duels, and give the player the ability to roll if one or more enemies are around them. I feel like this could very simply fix the issue in duels and in 4s, whilst still having rolls be useful when they should be. The Revenge Issue: Revenge is still finicky in the best of situations, but I wanna tackle a different problem that I dont hear being discussed much: Revenge gain from trickle-enemies. What does it mean to trickle in? Trickling is the term used for when enemies continuously drop into a point, after being killed and having their spawns stagger. This to me, is a large issue, because its very easy to have your point stolen by tricking, because you cant heal from someone stalling the point. It sucks to kill one people by yourself, have half your health gone, then have the rest of the team trickle in. With no revenge to start off with. This is something that frustrates me often, and I had an idea to fix it: Give players revenge in 1v1, HOWEVER, cap the revenge at 50%, so theyll have extra revenge to start off with, if people trickle into point. This to me, would save me from a lot of irrational at killing one, or multiple trickled-in opponents, to just have more trickle in and kill me via attrition. I feel like my idea could help in this issue. Anyway, those are just my ideas! Id love to hear what people have to say, and if they have any ideas, comments, or questions!"

190,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,The nerfs to Shinobi's Kick HA were unwarranted,0,cijlcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cijlcr/the_nerfs_to_shinobis_kick_ha_were_unwarranted/,2019-07-28 02:32:45,"Shinobi's dodge kicks were already underwhelming as both an offensive option and dodge attack. As an offensive tool, it is way too reactable even at 500ms, while the long startup easily telegraphs it and makes you susceptible to attacks, especially in 4s and 2s. The kick is also a lackluster dodge attack, as the two dodges have massive GB vulnerability during it, and due to the slow nature it would often trade. The only things that made kick tolerable was how safe it was, and the HA, which Ubi decided to nerf both without any compensation. Trading with kick isn't even as much of a problem as the likes of Sakura or Shugoki where they can almost just hit you on a soft read to interrupt; the kick was way too slow for that, if you got hit by it it was almost certainly because you were outplayed."
191,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Enhanced dodges?,0,cje4k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cje4k3/enhanced_dodges/,2019-07-30 03:08:00,"I would like to preface this post by saying I am not a competitive player or a pro in anyway. After all the changes this game has had there is now no advantage to having a reflex guard. The intention was for assassins to have high speed and damage in exchange for lower health and less reliable guard. Now there is no advantage. Aside from Shinobi, none of the assassins have particularly great damage, yet all of them have low health. So now there are no advantages to the reflex guard. Many people want reflex guard removed, but that would make assassins play exactly like every other class. I like that assassins can't just block everything and they should be required to use their speed defensively to compensate for a crappy block. My suggestion is enhanced dodges. What I mean by this is assassins dodges have significantly lower GB vulnerability. The only time an assassin could be GB'ed is at the very start of a dodge. This would force opponents to GB entirely on prediction and not on read. This would allow assassins to dip and dodge out of combos instead of sitting and blocking. What do you guys think? Again, not an expert, just want to see what the pros think about this change! Tl;dr - assassins dodges should have extremely limited GB vulnerability to make them use their speed on defense while also allowing them to feel unique compared to other classes."

On today's Warrior's Den, Big Mike and Not-So-Big Mike were [joined by Fight Team Lead Dev Stefan Jewinski and Associate Art Director Andrew Im](URL to answer some [community questions.](URL If you haven't had a chance to watch, I recommend you do, but here's a summary in text if you haven't got the time. I've put Stefan's answers first, followed by Andrew's (as they aren't technically ""competitive content"", and *my own opinions/analysis in italics in case you're interested*: ##Stefan's Questions: 1. **Attacks that aren't multiples of 100ms - are these going to be coming to other characters, and are you concerned that it will widen the gap between players with slower reactions or those on consoles, compared to the top competitive players?** The dev team is no longer constrained to multiples of 100ms, and can now change timings by increments of 33ms. This is giving them the freedom to make smaller, more fine-tuned tweaks. In particular he emphasised that Orochi is a test case, and also drew attention to the change of GB vulnerability of side dodges to 633ms which should make mix-ups more reliable across the board. We will almost certainly see more changes in 33ms increments in the future. *This is pretty interesting as previously the 100ms time-gaps have resulted in quite big gaps between ""reactable"" and ""unreactable"", meaning that attacks would either be powerful, or ""useless"". Whilst Stefan didn't really comment on the issue of widening the ""reaction gap"" between top PC players and the rest of us (it was a long question after all!), potentially this could also allow speeding up of some attacks that are not quite unreactable for the top players, to be truly unreactable. As we saw with the accidental dodge buff in S9, 33ms can make a big difference.* 2. **Are the Warlord, Gladiator, and Centurion changes that have been hinted at going to be small changes or big reworks?** Not only were WL, Glad and Cent updates officially announced in this stream, we will be given a chance to see them early in the first use of ""The Testing Grounds"" on August 29th (across all platforms)! Stefan commented that the Warlord changes are relatively small, Gladiator changes are a bit bigger and Centurion changes are very extensive. ""Centurion will be fun to beat the crap out of people."" *Pretty excited about these, and I'd agree with their priorities!** 3. **Is Jormungandr's Hamarr Slam the ultimate goal of the playstyle or will it be possible to win without using it?** Stefan compared it to Shaman's bite - a big attack that puts you ""on the road to winning"" but should be possible to win and apply pressure without it too. ""If your opponent can't block 500ms lights, you're gonna be fine"". *Whilst Stefan's undoubtedly correct that opponent who can't block 500ms lights will be in trouble vs Jorm, I'm not 100% convinced that the rest of her kit holds up in the way that Shaman's does. I guess we'll see as the season progresses.* 4. **Any plans to make feints less reactable?** Yes, Stefan agrees that they want feints to be more believable, and they are currently doing experiments along these lines, but that changes won't be coming ""anytime soon"". *Sounds like we won't be seeing feint changes in a mid season patch, or next season, but hopefully in the pipeline for the future.* 5. **Nobushi's Hidden Stance option select parry has been nerfed - will we see similar nerfs to Conq's Shinobi's and Highlander's charging heavy OSs?** Very much not a fan of the charging heavy option select, and would like to see it changed - but warns that they have to be careful to not destroy the mechanical ""feel"" of playing a character and make controls clunky. On the other hand, he is fine with the zone option selects, as there is a counter-play to them if baited. *Very reasonable response, and its good to know that the devs are keeping these kinds of option selects in mind for future balancing.* 6. **Any plans to look at reducing damage on punishes? Especially light parries - you're risking a 50 damage punish for a 15 damage light against Lawbringer?** They are continually looking at tweaking damage of punishes, and balancing damage of heavy parries vs light parries vs openers etc. He does think that the damage in many cases is too high. With the case of Lawbringer though, ""parries"" are part of his identity, and whilst it is ""maybe, yes, no"" too high, they are considering bringing the damage down. *We've seen with Nobushi that her punishes got significantly reduced in this update, and I think this response confirms that it's something they are considering. Whilst I agree that LB's ""parry identity"" is important, I don't think he needs quite as high damage as he currently has... Potentially a way of changing parry punishes could be a global damage reduction during parry stun?* 7. **Peacekeeper? Are there any more adjustments coming? Heavy finisher recoveries?** They don't want to go back to the situation they were before the rework where she was hugely overpowered. Instead they are going to go ""step-by-step"" to not ""overshoot the mark"". *I think this is a good approach but I hope that a stepwise approach doesn't preclude larger mechanical changes eg. HLH chain, or making dagger cancel an opener etc. On the other hand, smaller, more frequent changes are exactly what people have been asking for for a while, so that they are continuing this way is great news,* 8. **Hitokiri - less defensive?** Referring to the start-up of Hitokiri's hyperarmour, Stefan mentioned that Jormungandr's HA starts at 400ms instead of HK's 300ms. They will see how this pans out and apply it to HK. *A good approach, hopefully this will result in a nerf to HK's HA start-up soon. There is still the issue of charged heavies having instant HA on release, which also probably needs looking at (a 100ms delay is likely to be warranted imo)* 9. **Orochi - do the devs consider him a pure 1v1 hero, and will he get more tools to be viable in this way?** They are also taking a step-by-step approach with Orochi, so we'll likely see more changes to him soon. *No mention of his issues with external block, but that's more on the question than the answer. Hopefully some of the team-fight weaknesses of Roach and PK will be addressed in this stepwise approach.* ##Andrew's Questions: 1. **New armour sets? For the Year 1 heroes?** Yes and *soon*.  2. **New visuals for minions/pikemen?** Again, coming eventually, will ""have a more traditional look"", *which should please a lot of players* 3. **Plans to remove forced ~~pain~~ paint areas?** Removing mandatory paint areas requires revisiting a lot of the original heroes' outfits, and currently they are more focused on updating the material system. *Material system changes eh? Very nice!* 4. **New cosmetics?** New weapons, outfits, armours and so on are all being worked on and coming *soon* ;) I hope that summary was useful, thank you very much to Stefan and Andrew for coming on the show and answering our questions! I'm looking forward to seeing them on the Warrior's Den again in the future. In other news, the Year 3 Season 3 patch is NOW LIVE, so get out there and check out the changes, new breach map, and of course, start slamming your enemies~~'s crotches~~ with Jormungandr! All the changes are already [added to the info hub](URL and we'll be double checking that they are all correct ASAP. EDIT. ""Forced pain areas"" XD"
193,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Issues I find with Jorg's design, and the changes that I think should be made to them",10,clo57z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/clo57z/issues_i_find_with_jorgs_design_and_the_changes/,2019-08-04 07:31:45,"Jorg's design, as an idea, is not a terrible one. The staggering heavies, the stamina draining bashes, the nutcracker. I have fun with him. It's just that there are issues in his design that I do not find to be very good. This will be to existing moves, and I will not suggest adding new moves to Jorg. &amp;#x200B; # #1(not really) The game's stamina costs are insane in the current system For further clarification, when I mean stamina costs, I mean the multipliers added to the stamina cost. 1.75X on whiff, 2.5X on block, 3.5X on superior block, and 7X on parry. Those multipliers are insane and will put any hero into OOS if they try to attack for too long. This one problem in the system is why stamina bullies cannot exist in the game. Because draining stamina is *too easy*. For a solution here, I suggest looking at the link here. [Boop, here it is.](URL It suggests, in short summary, that the multipliers should be changed to flat stamina taxes, which would allow for prolonged offense without being punished for it. Once more, this is one that I had to get out of the way. It is the greatest issue with Jorg's design, and it's not even about him, but the game in general. But I digress, it's time to move on to Jorg for real. # #1 - His neutral heavies deal too low damage His heavies deal shit damage. While it might be true that he has some good HA(either on the last 400ms or after 400ms) it does not mean that the damage should be nearly on par with Shaolin. It is this low neutral damage that contributes to Jorg relying so much on his OOS tools and design. For this argument, I am going to bring in Hito. When you consider the neutral heavies of both heroes(Hito and Jorg), Hito's is much stronger due to the earlier HA, faster heavies, and variable timing. Jorg's, however, are GB vulnerable, are on one timing, and have less HA than Hito. So, in fact, Jorg should have higher damage. Here's the simple suggestion: Make Jorg's side heavies deal 30 damage, and make his top heavy deal 35. With these changes, they will become better for trading... which is... you know... the main point of HA existing? &amp;#x200B; # #2 - Both of his main bashes are inconsistent and deal too much stamina damage Jorg's neutral bash is 600ms, deals 40 stamina damage, and is GB vulnerable but allows for him to chain to his finishers. His chain bash is 500ms, deals 45 stamina damage, is not GB vulnerable and ends his chain. Two issues here: One - do these bashes even relate to Jorg other than the stamina damage!? Two - that's too much stamina damage! These things put people OOS too quickly. Most heroes have a 120 stamina pool, and would simply need to be hit three times and would be put OOS easily. That is a problem. The solution here solves both the overtuned stamina damage, while also making them at least somewhat related in design. The neutral bash will remain at 600ms. But it will now do 30 stamina damage. At the same time, the whiff recovery will be lowered to 800ms from 1100ms, which will make it harder to GB on reaction, and force them to read. Jorg can still chain into his finishers. The chain bash will remain at 500ms. But it will now do 35 stamina damage. And the whiff recovery is increased to 800ms from 700ms, making it slightly easier to punish on read. Along with that, it can now chain into Jorg's finishers instead of ending them, so that Jorg has increased flow and pressure. Both of these changed moves allow for more flow and offense, while at the same time are not too oppressive for the opponent when it comes to being stamina punished, or trying to punish on a dodge(for those who don't have side dodge attacks) &amp;#x200B; # #3 - His dodge heavy deals too low of damage for its HA and speed Jorg's dodge heavy is 1000ms. And while people will complain about its slow speed, I enjoy the outlier. I don't want every single heavy to be fast like some would want. But I will say this: the dodge heavy sucks. Its damage is too low for its speed, and once again, a heavy with that much HA should have damage worthy of trading with. So I want to make this dodge heavy good without doing the usual gamer suggestion of ""SPeEd iT uP!"" Make it deal 40 damage instead of 25 damage. Considering its speed and HA, it should deserve higher damage. &amp;#x200B; # #4 - His ""Nutcracker"" deals too much damage I would not say that this move deals too much damage if it were on its own. But on Jorg, this move can destroy one person entirely. A somewhat competent Jorg will learn to use the 80 damage OOS punish, which is just whiff the opener light and hit w/ the staggering UB heavy, then finally use the nutcracker. That damage is already pretty insane... in duels. In 4v4s, Jorg can become a whole new beast when combined with other heroes. With precision, someone can put a 120 HP hero, at full health, in the ground with a group combo. That is absolutely insane. And don't get me started with the hypothetical of ""more than one Jorg"" on one team. At this point, I cannot make an argument as to why Jorg should keep such high damage on this move. On his own, he can deal good damage. With others, he can crush people. That alone should warrant a damage nerf on the move, especially with the buffs that I am suggesting to his neutral game. The solution here is also simple: lower his ""nutcracker"" damage to 40, down from 50. At least with this, he shouldn't be able to absolutely annihilate any opponent's health bar in an instant. &amp;#x200B; # Misc changes: * Change the GB vulnerability on his zone to 100ms from 400ms * Make his top UB heavy stagger on hit like his side UB heavies(I do not know if the top UB heavy not being able to stagger is a conscious decision by Ubi or if it is a bug. Either way, I feel it should stagger) &amp;#x200B; Jorg's design is interesting but incompatible with the current iteration of the stamina system in the game. His neutral heavies and dodge heavy don't deal enough damage worthy of their HA and slowness. His stamina damage is too high and his bashes are inconsistent. His nutcracker deals too much damage considering the synergy he has with other players. Make his neutral heavies and his dodge heavy deal more damage, lower the stamina damage of his bashes, but give them all flow into his finishers, and lower the damage of the nutcracker."
194,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Lawbringer is on the brink of becoming a fully fleshed out hero, he just needs a few more tweaks to get him there.",7,cmdxyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/cmdxyc/lawbringer_is_on_the_brink_of_becoming_a_fully/,2019-08-06 03:23:20,"After this season's evasion nerfs, Lawbringer's heavy finishers are finally functional, giving him a viable offense alongside his other options. Lawbringer is close to becoming what I would call a ""complete"" hero, where the hero is not only viable, but all of their moves function and at least have some sort of use (unlike someone like Conq, who is viable yet can only use a small part of his offensive options). All Lawbringer needs is a few tweeks to fix his last few issues in order for him to achieve greatness. - **Dodge shove:** Guardbreak vulnerability after the shove is increased enough to make it vulnerable to guardbreak after a reaction dodge. Right now Dodge Shove is a very powerful defensive tool. It's a bash, has very early armor, and can be done very early into a dodge. However, the move is essentially unpunishable by all but a handful of heros, which means baiting it out like you would against other dodge attacks is often impossible. A recovery nerf to Dodge Shove would put it in line with other dodge attacks while still keeping it strong. - **Long Arm:** Speed is increased from 1000ms to 700ms. Recovery reduced to make it safe if dodged. Stamina cost increased from 12 to 18. Aside from a few niche situations, Long Arm is essentially a meme move in 1v1s. The biggest proposed change would be the recovery buff, making it about as safe as his current shoves are. The speed buff makes it fast enough that you can interrupt slower attacks on a good read, but slow enough that you can still be interrupted if you aren't careful. Essentially the point of these changes are to make the move worthwhile in certain situations, without making it some OP gimmick move that gets spammed nonstop. - **Impaling Riposte:** Damage decreased from 10 to 1. - **Blind Justice:** Damage reduced from 38 to 33. Can now chain into lights and heavies as well as chain shove. Lawbringer is meant to be the Parry Lord of the game, but even then his parries still deal too much damage, especially now that he has a working offense. The Impaling Riposte change would reduce the damage of a heavy parry wallsplat punish from 40 to 31, and the Blind Justice with guarenteed Swift Justice finisher deals 45. Still very high damage, but not as ridiculous. The ability to go into a light or heavy after Blind Justice is to make the optional shove follow up actually work. Right now you can follow up the attack with a confirmed Swift Justice or you can go for a shove mixup. However, this mixup doesn't really work, since Lawbringer has no way to catch people dodging it. Letting him chain into his other moves would fix this problem. And that's it! He could still maybe use some other number changes but aside from that I feel that this would be enough to put him in a very good position. What do y'all think?"

198,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha rework concept.,0,bzvg2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bzvg2x/aramusha_rework_concept/,2019-06-13 05:20:52,"Ok it's no secret aramushas shit rn... everything's safe on back dodge or roll and his recoveries are something to be questioned... So me and a hand ful of others got in-game with aramusha in situation matchups and tried to find everything wrong with him and fix it. So without further delay let's get started- - 1. Decrease damage on the heavy finishers to 35 from all sides. *with upcoming changes aramushas viability will skyrocket to unreactable and unavoidable lowering the punish is neccessary for balance* - 2.All deadly feints are given undodgeable property. *this will aid in fixing an issue where aramushas big mixups are safely avoidable, however by blocking one dealt feint direction and dodging back that leaves in deadly feint option that can land, the next change will help with this* - 3.aramusha can GB soft feint heavy finishers at variable timing (300ms buffered, up till before the last 200ms max delayed) *this is your fix to back dodge avoidable mixups, early timings will grap back dodge, but late timings make for a very very very hard to read or react to feint GB....* - 4.increase GB vulnerability on side heavies to 200ms. *just God please it'll fix issue on read for some heros but that 100ms shit doesnt help* - 5.decrease damage on neutral side heavies to 30. *again balance change, restraining his punished below the nutty high 40s in trade for sustainable offense is a fair trade* - 6.give aramusha the ability to cancel recovery on a missed heavy finisher with a forward dodge. *roll catch coming up in the next change aswell as being able to deny GB punishes on back dodge.* - 7.forward dash heavy given undodgeable property. *roll catch bois, this will help early rolls from aramushas finisher mixups by canceling into the forward heavy* - 8.give aramusha hyper armor on all chain heavies (finishers included). *this will startup at 100ms on normal chain heavies, and 200ms on finishers and deadly feints aramusha has these big long chains but in 4v4 there is no point as they are constantly shut down, adding HA to all chain heavies and deadly feints will help with this offensive major to shut down aramusha for 4v4.* - 9.aramushas blade blockade heavy punish is consistently guaranteed on all attacks... *I'll be giving more utility to his other punishes but this will be the main use one* - 10.blade blockade ring the bell punish has a 800ms animation of the grab, it acts as CC and guarantees ally attacks.... similar to all other cc nowadays, any ally attack will interrupt it. *I'm changing this to CC so he has utility for 4v4 combat, so there's a time and a place for this optimal punish* - 11. Blade blockade kick punish now sends enemies flying back into the ground similar to tiandi kick. *another CC option for team fight support and has better ledge potential... so like ring the belm it's not optimal normally, but has situational use* - 12.Zone now acts as a chain starter, and executes on kill. *everyone wants this, let's be honest* - 13. Top heavy finisher given unblockable property. *more pressure, and utility in a chain option and unblockable pressure is required on almost every hero except specific KIT designs.* AND THAT'S IT! let us know what you think on the comments, other ideas, feedback, advice all much appreciated. We've also made rework concepts for PK, warlord, shugoki, and gladiator... so if anyone cares to view them just ask in the comments. Thank you all for past support and we hope you enjoy."
199,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Proposed QoL changes for some characters,0,c0jdax,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/c0jdax/proposed_qol_changes_for_some_characters/,2019-06-14 22:11:31,"So I've decided to give some suggestions of characters I've played as and against enough to have a good understanding of their weaknesses and strengths, these are just changes I would make to existing characters to make them slightly more in-line with other characters without completely reworking them. I'll give a brief explanation after each character's proposed changes. As a foreword, sorry if I'm just repeating anything someone's already said, I don't frequent the comp reddit often. &amp;#x200B; Valkyrie: * Buff heavy openers to 25 damage (please for the love of god) * Make heavy chain finishers undodgeable. In all seriousness Valk currently has the lowest damage off a guardbreak with no wall in the game, this isn't exactly a bad thing but why does she need to do one point less damage than the next tier up (which is 25 damage btw, not counting PK as deep gouge buffs her side heavies to 31 damage total if you have the stamina). As for the undodgeable heavy chain finishers, Black Prior is a good example of why this is a good dynamic for a bashed based character, forcing the opponent to commit to either dodging the bash or blocking/parrying the heavy. Valk's bash/sweep tend to be fairly important for her offence so making her heavies more threatening would let them try for the sweep/bash mixup more often. &amp;#x200B; Kensei: * Standardise all light openers to 500ms with 15 damage * Side heavy feint from opener and chain top heavy treated as a chain finisher side heavy (e.g. hyper armour side heavy from unblockable) Kensei is a pretty fun character but against opponents that know how he works he suffers from a lack of ways to open up his opponent due to the fact that his top heavy softfeint mixup game can be stuffed on reaction by most characters with a light attack. Letting him access the hyper armour from his chain finisher softfeints is intended to put the opponent into a guessing situation as to whether he will do one of his many uninterruptible softfeints or if he'll call out the light with a side heavy. As far as his lights are concerned, it's kinda fucked that Kensei can't access one of the most universally available mixups in the game (heavy feint into light) because his lights are basically parry bait. While his side lights get an overall buff you might notice that this nerfs his top light, which wouldn't do 20 damage anymore, there's no particular reason to do this but I feel like this change would incentivise players to go for the helmsplitter into unblockable mixup. &amp;#x200B; Nobushi: * Slow down top heavy from 800ms to 900ms * Add guardbreak vulnerability to Hidden Stance * Standardise all light openers to 500ms 15 damage, all chain lights to 500ms 18 damage * Increase speed of Vipers Retreat to 500ms I'm gonna preface this by saying I think Nobushi is probably one of the most well designed and balanced characters in the game atm, I've seen what good nobushi players can do, she just feels overtuned in some areas and undertuned in others. So I'm going to say right now I think getting 38 damage off a guardbreak without a wall is pretty absurd, it's even more absurd when the opponent is bleeding because now that's 46 damage. I don't think Nobushi is a character that needs the highest damage off a guardbreak without a wall in the game. Next hidden stance, we know it's good, guardbreak vulnerability would keep it more inline with other defensive abilities like fullblock or JJ's sifu stance. 600ms lights are parry bait and we don't need them in the game, especially when they're not crushing counters like highlanders, making her light attacks and Vipers Retreat 500ms seems like it'd make them more usable in offensive situations. &amp;#x200B; And that's it for my opinions, let me know if they're shit or not."
200,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,An apology for why lb needs HA.,0,c14h61,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/c14h61/an_apology_for_why_lb_needs_ha/,2019-06-16 11:08:46,"First off, i have the opinion that every hero must have a purpose in teamfights, this means that every hero should be capable of fullfil a role, those being a punisher (Dash attacks that can interrupt or hit enemies on their recoveries), preassurer (heroes that can't be externally blocked safely), fighter (heroes that with their hitboxes can perform target swapped attacks reliably and hit multiple enemies) or a mix of the previous. Now lb is know to be a bad teamfighter, even tho there is potential on his kit, he is a mix of a punisher (dodge shove with HA) and a preassurer with his unblockables finisher, but there is a big problem, is quite difficult to reach his unblockable because how easily and safely he is shut down, this point is born because he lacks a tool to counter interrupts after a shove, having in mind how much time he takes to reach his finisher, at least 1500 ms from a dodge shove, the usual way, an enemy would have plenty of time to interrupt him. So, first, he takes too much time to reach his finisher, this gives more than enough time to be interrupted, second, his finisher doesn't have any other mechanic or alternative that would allow to punish interrupt attempts, this makes him easily shut down in teamfights and antiganks/stalling situation, third, he can't avoid dmg easily, so the alternative is giving him the potential to sustain his offense through interrupts attempts, having in mind his huge hp pool, being capable of sustain his offense at the expense of his hp makes sense. If he had a tool to deal against interruptions he wouldn't need HA, but another rework in nowhere on the horizon for him, so the easiest, effective and flavourful way to fix that issue is giving him HA on certain part that would allow him to sustain his offense in teambased modes without hurting his 1v1 potential. Just think about it, the most realiable way to reach his finisher is from a shove that will only hit as a reactive tool, that would take at least 1500 ms to reach, the other way would be side heavy into side light and that takes 1300 ms, this is a big window of vulnerability to be interrupted, against good players you will be interrupted out off your unblockable finisher constantly unless the star align. So if we want a character viable and interactive offensively, he needs a way to deal against interruptions and with his current kit that only HA can provide to this problem, i propose some changes that won't affect his 1v1 game but with help him massively his teamfighter potential. * Heavy after shove should have HA. This option would allow you to punish interrupt attemps on read, you shove someone and his teammate would interrupt you with a dash attack to save him, with his chained heavy having HA would allow you to trade (this heavy would never land against the shoved enemy) against this interrupt attempt and also would allow to continue with your offense. This would create a mind game similar in nature to conqs bash into light/full block, were the enemy will risk himself at attempting to stop you. * Chained light increased hit stun from light to medium. Currently your enemy can throw a 500 ms attack to trade against your side finisher, it seems you cannot parry it, just block it, this means you cannot perform an unblockable finisher on low health, and is even worse against ganks because both enemies can interrupt you out off your finisher safely, this change will eliminate a variable allowing to at least throw his side unblockable without worrying about trading in duels and be able to feint into parry from your top heavy finisher. * Side finisher should have HA. If by some miracle you havent been interrupted afer the shove and light follow up, you can be safely interrupted from his unblockable, incapable of feinting and parrying in time, HA would fix that, with the presence of said mechanic he would be capable of actually throwing this attack during teamfights and antigank situations. The first and third point would synergize each other in such a way that you want to stop the lb from reaching his finishers exposing yourself to the heavy after shove, making him this way an actual decent teamfighter. &amp;#x200B; The incorporation of HA this way would help him in team based modes big time without affecting duel situations, i agree that this is not enough to fix his lack of offense, overtuned light parry or how boring is to fight him, but it would change his playstyle from run around looking for an impale to actually be capable of pressing buttons."
201,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Move Comparison, what makes similar moves good or bad, All Full Blocks including Blade Blockade",63,c1m1nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/c1m1nd/move_comparison_what_makes_similar_moves_good_or/,2019-06-17 20:42:58,"This is the second part of comparing all the Full Block stances in the game. [Here](URL you can see the first part where I analyse and compare Warlord's Full Guard with Conqueror's. This is an informative post aimed towards newer players as well as those that want to grasp a better understanding of certain moves. By no means this is the ultimate guide to those moves and it is highly recommended to learn each individual move in the context of each individual character. Here we will compare Black Prior's Bulwark Stance, Valkyrie's Full Guard and Aramusha's Blade Blockade amongst themselves as well as with Conqueror's Full Guard. **Black Prior- Bulwark Stance** * Bulwark Stance differently that Full Guard doesn't have superior block while activated and it doesn't guarantee any damage on block. The move has two different start-ups. From neutral it has 200ms start-up while you can fast flow into it immediately after you block an attack or any regular attack. While in Bulwark Stance you do not consume stamina but your regeneration is stopped. It costs 10 stamina to activate Bulwark Stance. You can move while the stance is active. You have 300ms of recovery while exiting from bulwark stance. * Since Bulwark stance can be maintained indefinitely it doesn't guarantee damage on block. Bulwark stance requires the user to time their counter against the enemy to deal damage. To do so one must input a light while in Bulwark Stance to activate the counter frames. They start 100ms after the input, last for 300ms and have a 500ms recovery if you mistimed it. Bulwark counter is a move capable of countering everything that causes stagger, as short list of those things being: Attacks, Unblockables, Bashes, Command Grabs (such as Shugoki's demon's embrace), getting off ladders, falling to the ground from a throw or parry, being bumped into by another player, Shinobi's ranged attacks and so forth. The Bulwark counter when timed correctly deals 30 guaranteed damage not only to the countered enemy but also in a 360 ark around the Black Prior with a generous enough range. The counter itself has two stages. The flip animation and the slashing animation. As long as the enemy will attack you while you are in the flip animation, no matter what they will activate the counter and you will restart the flip animation again. This cycle can be continued indefinitely as long as enemies keep attacking you. While in the slashing animation the enemy will no longer be flipped but you will keep gaining revenge for their hits, just as you do during the flip animation and be immune to any kind of damage, including mortal damage from plunging attacks as well as feats such as Catapult. The only counter during the slashing animation is if a player is quick enough to start a bash just after the flipping animation finished to break the black prior out of the slashing animation, otherwise you have full immunity to everything. After the flipping animation the enemy is thrown behind the Black Prior which can ledge. * Bulwark Stance cannot counter Nuxia's traps but they have no effect over Black prior if used during the counter activation frames in which case both moves miss. * To counter Bulwark Stance the enemy can only use Guard Breaks, everything else is counterable by the Black prior. Unless countered properly bashes and unblockables will go through the guard. * Bulwark Stance grants the Black Prior a new move, called Bulwark Slash. It is a feintable 800 ms heavy that always comes from the right side and deals 30 direct damage. It has 400ms GB vulnerability. Since it is feintable and has a generous range Bulwark slash it is used best at max range as a tool to apply pressure to the enemy. Since Bulwark stance can be accessed immediately after any attack Black Prior can fast flow into it mid chain allowing him to mix up his attacks with Bulwark Slash as well as having an infinite combo as long as the Black Prior has stamina or the enemy doesn't parry. Use it to bait attacks out or while the enemy is outnumbered to apply pressure. The move synergizes perfectly with Black Prior's second feat ""Healing Ward"". This feat allows Black Prior to heal while in Bulwark Stance even during combat. It heals 5 hp per second. It doesn't remove bleed like other healing feats such as second wind. This allows black prior complete safety anywhere on the battlefield, even in the middle of pikemen in breach. Other than that Bulwark stance has no other feats that directly link to it's activation. **Comparisons:** Bulwark Stance is definitely amongst the best stances in the game. It is more versatile that any other Full Guard stance, including Conqueror's full guard. Since it can be activated 0ms after you block an attack it negates all 400ms mix ups. Since deflects normally don't cause attacks to bounce back Black Prior is capable of stopping and countering each and every deflect. Valkyrie 's shoulder pin being the exception since it counts as a superior block. The only weakness Bulwark stance has is being vulnerable to Guard Breaks but thanks to it's short recovery when normally exiting it a good player can keep the distance while using it to heal and exit it before the enemy is in range for a Guard Break. The sheer versatility and power of this move, combined to how easily it can protect the Black Prior from external attacks during an outnumbered scenario one could argue this is the best Full Guard stance in the game. &amp;#x200B; **Valkyrie- Shield Tackle.** * Differently than all other Full Guards in the game Valkyrie doesn't activates her using the C button or the downwards right analog button. She instead enters Full Guard by back dodging then inputting a guard break. * The full guard activates only after 400 to 500ms into the back-dodge and can be maintained as long as the Valkyrie has stamina. To activate Full Guard you use 35 stamina and it consumes 4 stamina per second while you maintain it. The move has to be feinted out of it or released. If the move is feinted it costs an additional 30 stamina. * The moves does not guarantee any damage on block. Shield Tackle guarantees damage only if the enemy is hit by the Shield Charge Valkyrie does after the move is normally released. If the Shield Tackle is released and lands it confirms a light attack which can be chained as if after a regular shield charge. If missed Shield Tackle cannot be followed up with any attack and it leaves the Valkyrie vulnerable to a Guard Break or an attack. * Valkyrie's Full Guard is active only while she is holding the stance. Once the Shield Tackle is released it no longer has the full guard properties and it acts purely as a Shield Charge. * Valkyrie's Full Guard has no synergi with any of her feats. **Comparisons:** Valkyrie's Shield Tackle is a pseudo Full Guard. It doesn't grant her any new moves, doesn't guarantee any damage on block and it consumes more stamina to be activated. Shield Tackle if compared solely as a Full guard it is lackluster since at most it grants a light, however that is not ture. Shield Tackle, thanks to it's animation and how it can be activated during a back dodge it is a great tool to avoid completely mix ups. It isn't meant to be activated on reaction to punish attacks but it serves as a countering tools to mix ups. The safest way of using the Tackle itself is by activating it after the enemy hits your full guard. Compared to Bulwark Stance the moves is less relevant since Bulwark Stance not only negates mix ups, it counters them completely and allows the Black Prior to go on the offensive. Do not use Shield Tackle as a standard Full Guard but rather use it to counter mix ups such as Highlander's kick to caber toss. It is sometimes better to simply back up using this move then feint it rather than letting it go since it is very unsafe on whiff. Each character has different interactions with this move and to use it to the fullest you have to learn the match ups, a better guide to Valkyrie can explain better in which situations to properly use this move and when not to do so. &amp;#x200B; ***Aramusha- Blade Blockade*** * Blade Blockade is somehow similar but not the same as all other Full Guards on this list. Blade Blockade cannot be maintained and it always has the same duration. Blade Blockade has 100ms start-up frames, it lasts for 400ms and it has 500ms of recovery on a missed Blade Blockade. The move consumes 18 stamina on activation and 8 stamina every time it blacks an attack. Aramusha cannot move or counter guard break during any of the duration of the Blade Blockade and there is no way to cancel out of the recovery by yourself. Blade Blockade can be used only out of neutral. * Blade Blockade does not allow Aramusha to access new moves out of neutral and he can use them only on a perfectly timed block. There are four different moves Aramusha has access to after a blocked attack 1. Ring The Bell- By inputting a light after a blocked attack you have a guaranteed 15 damage command grab that stuns the enemy and deals 20 stamina damage as well. Although the animation last for a while the damage is applied as soon as the attack is activated. This is the only truly guarantee attack after a block. It costs 6 stamina to activate. 2. Push Back Kick- By inputting a Guard Break After a properly timed block you kick the enemy backwards. The move costs 25 stamina, it lasts 500ms and deals 50 stamina damage to the enemy. The kick can wallsplat which guarantees a side heavy for 40 damage. The kick can ledge as well. Low recovery moves can allow the opponent to dodge the attack such as Nobushi being able to cancel her attack recovery with a dodge otherwise it is confirmed on all other attacks. It costs 8 stamina to activate. 3. Furry Unleashed- By inputting a top Heavy after blocking an attack Aramusha does a 30 damage 500ms top heavy uninterruptible attack. The attack is not guaranteed most of the times especially on low recovery moves or when the enemy attacked from the top stance. It acts as a chain starter. It costs 8 stamina to activate 4. Twin Vipers- By inputting a side heavy after blocking Aramusha has access to a 40 damage unblockable 1000ms side attack. The attack can be feinted with a deadly feint as well as a hard feint. You can switch targets during the animation to hit additional opponents. The move is uninterruptible during the animation, bashes will break you out of it though. The move costs 8 stamina to activate. * Just as Valkyrie's Shield Tackle and Warlord's full guard Aramusha's blade blockade does not have any feats that interact with the move itself. **Comparisons:** Compared to Full Guard Blade Blockade is just a worst version of it. While full guard allows the user to throw an attack in order to beat a Guard Break attempt if Aramusha doesn't time the move correctly he has a whole second of vulnerability in which the enemy can Guard Break and punish you. Blade Blockade has the same problem as Warlord's Full Guard which is guaranteeing too little damage compared to any parry. Aramusha is capable of landing a top heavy after a heavy parry giving him one of the best parry punishes in the game. On a light parry the damage is even better since he gets a 40 damage side heavy. Aramusha's heavies are also safe from Guard break mix-ups which makes his Balde Blockade even more needlessly dangerous. The only use one can get out of it is to option select unfeintable fast attacks such as dodge attacks or Kensei's top light dash attack-zone mixup. Compared to all other stances it doesn't grant access to any other new move either unless after a block which makes Blade Blockade one of the weakest Full Guards and a very unsafe defensive tool. While all other Full Guards have their own uses and don't require major improvements Armausha's Blade Blockade could use some changes: 1. Even when whiffed Blade Blockade allows Aramusha access to his kick and heavies. 2. Allow Aramusha to access blade blockade mid chain or feint his heavy finishers into it. 3. Allow Aramusha to cancel it's recovery with an attack or move rather than being helpless. 4. Allow it to guarantee 30 damage on block to incentivise it's use since it is so unsafe."
202,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Next Hero's to be ReWorked?,0,c2ln0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/c2ln0r/next_heros_to_be_reworked/,2019-06-20 05:41:56,"I wanted to get the opinion of the Competitive sub on which heroes are most in need of reworks. It's not easy to just sum up all the pros and cons of each hero and compare them but to me, it seems like **PeaceKeeper** and **Gladiator should** be next in line. I'm also trying to consider across all game modes, what they have to offer. For example, I understand that Cent is in an awful place right now but in 4v4 ganks he has a lot to give to the team so I wouldn't put him to be the next since he has some sort of play style that works. Same for Aramusha, He has a hard time landing hits but in gank situations he can dish out some serious damage / punishes. I'm a glad main so I may be biased but he is starting to feel bottom of the bottom to me. Of course, the Zone is exceptional, but its 20 dmg for half a stam bar and people that suspect you using it often will just keep their distance. The low GB vulnerability heavies are also sometimes nice but typically doesn't come into play all that much. But Lights are poop. Deflect Can be poop, When it gets beaten by HA move, it deals 2 damage, Or Thick blood feat also shuts it down. 500ms Guard is poop (I know its getting buffed ""Soon"" but every day till then it sucks) and IIRC he recently got a slight stamina nerf? He is arguably horrible in all game modes (duels being his strongest suit from my experience). I've practically never played PK so I will let a main of her explain if they wish, Just an observation that she's terrible rn. Curious of what you guys think."

But if you have a fast recovery like BP for example, it's the extreme opposite and you have an almost completely safe offense or very low risk and high reward that is also unhealthy for the game. Making GB's 100ms faster will still be react-able but is more likely to catch people off guard and could potentially give everyone an opener from neutral without adding a bash. You react to a GB after impact, a GB is 400ms, which is fast, but since you have another 400ms or so after impact to react and counter, it makes it easy and more like reacting to an 800ms heavy. So the speed of the initial GB isn't a huge issue and would just allow for faster punishes and faster recoveries. Adjusting the window after impact that allow you to counter would be what makes a GB an effective opener anyways, and could be tweaked easily by devs to adjust for how useful it is offensively and they wouldn't even have to change the animation to effect its offensive potential. That can be another discussion on it's own what that window should be, I would say 200ms to make it effective. Trimming 100ms off GB as well as dodge recovery, the changes will cancel each other out in relation to each other, so catching a dodge will be the same timing so to say. Recover 100ms faster, but GB comes out 100ms faster, nets same results as it currently is. But it will allow for faster game-play in general as well as the potential for offense from GB's. It would take dodge+GB from being 1000ms+, to 800ms plus your reaction time. So you wouldn't need ridiculous recoveries of 1300ms, especially on chain finisher moves. Currently for a 500ms bash to be punishable by GB, assuming you react and dodge the bash at 300ms which is a standard reaction time + 1000ms dodge GB, that bash needs a 700-800ms recovery in order to be punishable by dodge GB on reaction. Well some people would argue that GB is too big of a punish, and you shouldn't get that big of a punish for offense. which I also agree with. But that doesn't excuse having an unpunishable offense just because we came from the extreme opposite and are tired of turtle meta. Damage in general is said to be too high, I agree, but maybe it's also how that damage is accessed. It seems too extreme, like you either eat a ton of damage off one thing that confirms it all, like the ganks that are being nerfed one by one, or it's very hard to access damage with no offense. So maybe GB punishes should be changed to only allow light attack punishes. Because it is too much damage, and it gives too much time for other people to que up heavies in ganks and stack damage. In a 1v3, a GB is pretty much death for a 120hp hero. They eat 25-40 per heavy that stack up to 90 damage even with damage reduction on. This would add more significance for throwing and wall splatting, allowing a heavy and timing up attacks with coordinated teammates as well as playing into strategy and not having your back against a wall in a fight to be a little safer. It adds relevance to these moves and adds new dynamics while adding layers to ganking and damage. Ultimately I think it would make the game-play more satisfying and enjoyable. Faster dodge recovery and faster GB allow for faster recoveries, faster gameplay, potentially offense for everyone from neutral with a faster GB. Allowing for faster heavies and less GB vulnerability. A lot of aspects of the game need to be sped up, not just offense. We're getting some faster recoveries and they are presenting huge balancing obstacles that game needs to evolve around. Light attacks should be 400-500ms, heavies 600-800ms, dodge recoveries 500ms, GB's 300ms. Recovery after a light or bash being 600ms. So a 500ms bash+600ms recovery =1100ms. 300ms reaction +500ms dodge+300ms GB= 1100ms. Bash is now punishable and shaving 200ms off recovery because 100ms was shaved off GB and dodge recovery. I think BP is one of the most well balanced heroes in the game offensively and defensively, the problem is the game hasn't evolved to be able to deal with his bash, so his offense is too safe, but in terms of reaction and recovery, his bash is great for offense, but really bad for counter attacking and defense, which still has a significant place in this game."

208,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Possible shinobi rework idea,3,c8g4e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/c8g4e7/possible_shinobi_rework_idea/,2019-07-03 08:37:02,"As a rep 60 shinobi main, I have been brought to think about a way to improve shinobi, without hurting his identity. I know he is the least well designed character in the game and I never managed to figure out how you could mess him up this badly. I still think he is a cool and interesting character. First off, I want to start by stating what I think composes the character's identity. Quad dash and being fast as f**k. Shinobi is also a versatile defensive and counter offensive glass canon who shouldn't have too much trouble getting in and out of a fight. He shouldn't be encouraged to fight a mile away like he is and so would need to have some better mix-ups and a better ability to sustain. He should be able to get hits across a team fight and flow in an elegant way from one opponent to an other like a real ninja. Here are the changes that I would make: -Standardise his reflex guard duration -Remove the damn knock off on teleport kick while in revenge (why is it still in the game) -Add an indicator to see when he is externally charging his long ranged attacks and throwing long range guard break (maybe a purple indicator) -Reduce the counter punish for ranged guard break to some stamina cost only and maybe a light, but I think it should be safe -Increase a little bit the tracking for range guard break -Remove the different charging levels on ranged attacks (it would mean that shinobi's overall range would be nerfed, we're in a mele fighting game aren't we) -Slow down the first ranged heavy (600-650ms ish), add some guard break vulnerability to it's start up (to avoid option select parrying) , make the attack feintable and not bounce on block. -Create new animations for all regular heavies (they are so slow, could also add hyper armor like warlord has). Maybe the new animation could look like the current left heavy attack from GB -Reduce shinobi's hp to 100. -Reduce shinobi's damage on confirmed light finishers from 10 to 8, maybe 5. -Remove super armor on the second part of his zone -Make the shinobi be able to cancel the recovery of all his chain finishers to the charging of his ranged heavy. (Insentive to make the shinobi continue his attacks instead of always attacking, retreating, attacking, retreating... the shinobi could do his chain and continue with a ranged attack or dodge cancel.) -Make the shinobi double dodge kick 400ms, like day one -Shinobi's double dodge kick and teleport kick do not garanty damage anymore. Only exception being zone attack. -Shinobi's backflip kick now stuns -Sickle rain now only does 35 damage, the three light at the end are given a special property that heals the shinobi 10 hp on each hit (just an idea to make the move more intersting). Each light could also give back some stamina if the stamina drain on the heavy is removed. -Sickle rain doesn't revenge lock anymore -So here is my idea to implement a new mix up for shinobi. His ranged guard break after kick (it's in his chains),even though useless, gave me the idea. It ressembles pre rework lawbringer shove. After the kick hits an opponent, if he/she doesn't dodge it garantees a ranged heavy. If he/she does it garantees the new sickle rain. If the opponent tries to do some kind of dodge attack, the skilled shinobi could cancel ranged charge into a deflect. If the opponent dodge rolls, the shinobi can cancel ranged charge into double or quad dash into another kick. It would balance shinobi's deflect (the two options now being smaller guaranteed damage or higher unguaranteed damage ). This mix-up would only be present on double dodge kick and teleport kick. -Shinobi's backflip has now starting frames vulnerable to guard break (backflip nerf) -And then to prevent opponents from guard breaking shinobi's to stop them after their chains or prevent backflip, creation of a new move. A 400ms finisher kick that doesn't chain in anything and only slightly pushes the opponent. This kick might ressemble the deflect kick or tozen's without the knockdown. The issue without the move is that shinobi's would not be able to escape or continue their chains: you get guardbroken if you try to backflip after a chain and if you try to charge a ranged heavy, you also get guardbroken, ranged heavy itself now being vulnerable to GB. -I'm not sure if the devs would need to remove super armor off his kicks. In conclusion, this rework is meant to nerf bad character design and give the shinobi proper offense, and slightly higher than average defense. Tell me what you think of it."

211,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"has the gb vaunrability of heavies been actually tested across all characters, or is it assumed that heavies of the same speed have the same window of gb vaunrability?",112,bneipa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bneipa/has_the_gb_vaunrability_of_heavies_been_actually/,2019-05-12 03:20:33,"the reason i ask this is that i've been playing as hitikori a lot recently, and whenever i feint my unblockable into a gb, half the time i get hit out of my gb by the enemy's parry attempt.

However against some characters (raider for example), my gbs frequently seem to bounce off their parry attempts, so i end up getting hit with a fat 40dmg, even though they supposedly made the wrong read.

213,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A toxic yet useful change for Orochi,0,bntxzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bntxzz/a_toxic_yet_useful_change_for_orochi/,2019-05-13 06:45:41,"So, Orochi has been struggling a lot since the beggining of the game basically (his rework didn't help him that much, at least not for a very long time). I'm not an Orochi player myself, but today I had an idea that might help him get better at 1v1 and teamfighting, while possibly maintaining the concept of the character and without being a total rework His main problems are: \- he has no external pressure \- storm rush is really bad, as you can block it and then backdodge to avoid everything \- riptide strike is basically useless \- despite being good at stalling, he has no antigank nor teamfighting presence \- has no good 4th feat (unfortunately I can't do much about thise one) For the first problem, the truth is: not having any kind of external block pressure is terrible. Every character should have access to at least an unblockable and/or a bash, or they won't really go that far With that being said, here is the idea &amp;#x200B; BUFFS &amp;#x200B; \- Storm Rush is now unblockable from all 3 sides, while maintaining the undodgeable property on the top one \- Storm Rush makes Orochi run faster \- Riptide Strike can change opponent mid chain (the new target is revealed after the backdodge. Basically, he'll move to the new opponent only in the portion of the attack where he puts his sword above his head and moves forward) \- Riptide Strike is now a heavy attack (can execute and deals heavy block reaction and chip damage) (I hope it can be done even if its input remain the light button. Otherwise it should probably use a different input, maybe the one pre-rework) \- Riptide Strike's recovery can be cancelled with a dodge \- Riptide Strike now has 100 ms GB vulnerability \- Combo lights deal now 14 damages \- Side heavies do 35 damage (from 30) &amp;#x200B; NERFS &amp;#x200B; \- Storm Rush deals now 15 damage (from 17) \- Storm Rush forward move is reduced (it won't catch people who backdodge) \- Storm Rush's top side is now 600 ms (from 500 ms) \- Storm Rush can't chain with lights if it whiffs \- Top heavy deals 30 damage (from 35) &amp;#x200B; So, a quick explanation of why I would make these changes: &amp;#x200B; \- yes, Storm Rush is super fast and making it unblockable seems stupid, but as it is right now it has no reason to exist. Not only you can put your guard on the left and react to the other two sides (and even on console it is somehow do-able, by looking at the right side while reacting to the top since it's a lot slower), but static guard heroes (those that don't move their guard when dodging) can put their guard top side and dodge, being safe from every option. Making Storm Rush unblockable and making it punishable on whiff with a GB means that now you have to deal with a 50/50 of side/top rush, making it way better. Not only that but, thanks to the speed of the attack, you can gank effectively by stunlocking someone and allowing an opponent to get a heavy. The reduced damage helps making this kind of gank a little less powerful, while it won't change the total damage in 1v1 thanks to the chained light buff. The reduced forward movement makes sure that opponents that are not locking Orochi can side dodge to avoid this gank (while exposing themselves to the top one). The top speed change to 600 ms helps so that also less experienced people who guess correctly (and stay still to punish the top one) can react to it fairly easily, making Orochi's offense powerful but not unfair (since it is unfeintable). The bonus speed when using Storm Rush helps to not be stopped too easily in teamfight or when surviving a gank \- Riptide strike sucks ass, we all know that. Making it heavy will lower the punish it gets since it is really easy to punish once baited. Making its vulnerability 100 ms means that it can now be used as an effective option select against GB-based mixups, while also not being able to be used in reaction to a GB. Changing opponent makes it more useful in an antigank situation, coupled with the change to the target only during the last half of the animation (which is pretty fast) and the option to dodge cancel it after it hits (coupled with the new heavy block reaction, in order to not be stopped by just blocking top), making its point-stalling ability even stronger and making his chances of surviving an anti gank WAY higher \- The changes to the heavies are just there to satisfy my autistic desire of a balance between speed and damage. In my opinion, it makes absolutely zero sense that a character has a heavy which is WAY better than the other two. Every character should have a reason to use every direction they have when attacking. This change makes top heavy less powerful while maintaining its safety from GBs, while the side ones are still vulnerable but more powerful &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; So, let me know what you think. Of course this is just an idea (and probably a lot of you will hate it because you hate Orochi. I don't blame you, I hate it myself, I just had this idea) and will never become a thing, but maybe it can give some ideas on how to make him better as a character"

All of her heavy attacks are, of course, chargeable. This applies even to the lowest possible charge amount, which results in the first 700ms heavy. During her charging period she is always susceptible to getting guardbroken. If you piece this together, it would seem that rather than her first heavy being a 700ms attack with variable timing, it is more likely that her heavy attacks are composed of the charging period, followed by the released 400ms heavy itself upon being done with the charging. As such, her first heavy without any inputted charging is charged for 300ms and followed up by 400ms attack itself, meaning she can be guardbroken for the first 300ms in her first 700ms heavy attack. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Imo this is great, because if her heavy attacks were any safer than they currently are, with the ridiculous hyperarmor, it would be a bit too much.

[in today's Warrior's Den](URL Luc was once again joined by Stefan Jewinski to answer community questions. I'd recommend you watch it, but I've written a summary for you if you haven't got the time: 1. **Why are some light attacks deal 18+ damage?** So they are actually threatening/rewarding to land. May revisit when light attack are landing more often. 2. **Will we see more enhanced light attacks (eg. Shugo, LB side lights)?** Yes. But not on all characters all - dont want them on Orochi, worry of blockstun in 4v4s 3. **Why was Raider's Dodge GB not removed?** The entire community wasnt ready like they were for Shove on Block + Shugo passive HA. (?!) Now that raider is strong, might nerf his reactive defence in future. *I guess this means we didn't complain loudly enough about dodge GB* 4. **Stamina damage on raider/stunning tap?** Stamina changes are coming in mid season patch, will not be able to deal stamina damage on opponents in OOS - although stamina regen pauses will still be a thing. Stun moves that set to 20 stamina (eg. stunning tap, LB top heavies, valk side light finishers), will be changed with mid season patch to get flat stamina damage. 30-35 for Stunning tap, different values for other attacks. Requests to get more stamina overall may also be solved in the mid season patch. 5. **Any more tweaks to LB? Unblockable mix-up easily backdodged/interrupted?** Changes to escapes coming next season. Timing is the same as a lot of 2nd + 3rd chain attacks, so should all be fixed w. Changes With regards to getting hyperarmour on LB - it wouldnt fit with LB's identity of wanting to get parries. *Makes sense to me - LB can get 50 damage off parrying a light attack interrupt, so it's a good idea for him to be able to bait them.* 6. **Are parries different in Season 10?** Stefan thinks its the usual new season complaints, which happen every time people have to get used to new characters. *It would seem that the dev's havent realised that there used to be a few blocking frames on static guard heroes after a late parry, which seem to have been removed this season, although this does need extra testing. u/DaSharkCraft might be able to explain some more about this?* 7. **Hitokiris 4th feat absolutely destroys the breach commander?** Being looked at atm, but seems worse probably because lots of HKs seems worse than usual. *Later on in the show, in community corner, they showed a clip of a HK taking half the commander's health with some buff-stacking and this feat. I think it's safe to say it needs a nerf in this scenario.* 8. **Warlord hyperarmour on heavies starts very late?** Different timings are interesting, might make HA start earlier on WL finishers. Potentially also making HKs HA start later, as she is currently often wins out when parrying incorrectly. 9. **Are they going to fix side deflects/dodge i-frames?** Yes mid season patch. *It wasn't clear if this is ""just"" a fix to the recent i-frame buff, or also an improvement to side deflects as well* 10. **Are the devs ok with having characters that cant counter/punish bashes? (Eg. WL, Shugo, HK)** Wants the question to be, what are my tools to initiate? Wants punishes to be less important, so you wont need to punish bashes as much. Also wants characters to continue in chains, rather than just doing bash follow-up, repeat. *Personally I'm not particularly satisfied with this answer - it's not like characters with bashes to initiate can't still parry for example. As long as there is such an imbalance in the cast, we'll end up with situations like Shugoki, where Glad's zone can option select everything he can do...* 11. **Revenge??!1?!** They are trying to fix it, were having trouble reproducing the bug, but might have discovered the reason now. Hopefully a fix will be coming soon. 12 **Which other broken defensive mechanics will get nerfed?** Stefan mentioned Hidden stance, Sifus Poise, Shinobi backflip and that they are all very hard to punish, even on a read. Wants more risk to each of them. *I'm a bit surprised he mentioned Sifu's Poise with its large GB vulnerability, but didn't mention any of the very safe charging heavy option selects, like Conq's Shinobi's and HL's* 13. **Is Gladiator's guard getting buffed?** Yes and Shinobi's too, soon. *Mid season patch?* &amp;nbsp; Aside from the Q&amp;A, there were several other guests on the show today: Klarissa Armada (Mistressed) once again [joined to talk tournaments.](URL You can see [upcoming tournaments on battlefy.com](URL In addition, Ubisoft's devs have an internal tournament league, and tonight is the final of their breach tournament series, which you can watch [on their twitch channel](URL &amp;nbsp; Also, Mathieu Latulippe, the Technical Director of Animation once again joined the show [to talk about the mechanics of fabrics in the game](URL Whilst not technically competitive content, I'd highly recommend checking it out if you have any interest in game design, as it was very clearly explained and extremely interesting."

But without further adieu let's get started- 1. Raider- Almost all the changes i would've proposed have already been given to him in the recent rework, an AMAZING job and improvement in ubisoft's balance development... However there are things that do need adressing. Raiders dodge GB needs to be removed (only sides need this) With his really good offensive power now, he no longer requires a strong defensive tool as hes no longer a defensively oriented hero. 2. Berserker- Yet another shining example of ubisoft's potential... not much needs to be changed about berserker... he has viable but countable offense that's ""read based"" for both opponents, this offense is toned down by short range... its truly good balance. 3. Highlander- The big Scots man is in need of help... he was difficult to come up with balanced improvements without janking up his KIT but here's what we got. HL needs speed on defensive heavies increased by 100ms (if you bait someone into misstiming a parry on your heavy by making them think it's a light, most heros can simply feint to block it and protect their mistake) hence the 100ms speed increases. HL stam cost buff on all offensive stance heavies and lights (not kick/caber)... we proposed not to change the 600ms defensive lights on HL as they have good counter frames, and a long backstep... but he does need his stam costs on offensive swings lowered SUBSTANTIALLY... 15 for lights, 28 for heavies. HL chain defensive light attack sped up to 500ms, with 100ms HA startup, and enhanced property. This will allow him to have a viable defensive light that can be used to trade, and because of enhanced property it can be used to enter offensive stance. Add a visual (bash) icon effect and sound to offensive stance emote. This will allow him to bait rolls by using the caber like animated emote and flash a visual and audible bash icon and sound to scare opponents with a false indicator hopefully to increase his mixup game. 3. Warlord- Warlord needs more than most on the viking list due to lack of offense and mediocre opener. With viable but mundane defense. Increase WL top light speed to 500ms *why is it 600? Just why?* Increase HA startup on neutral heavies by 200ms... increase HA startup on chain heavies by 100ms. He needs better HA with trash range like his... Increased tracking on headbutt (about conq bash levels) He needs a viable opener and headbutt doesnt land, it just doesnt. Add New chain- 4 hit combo (heavy-light-heavy-light/heavy to end combo) AND (light-heavy-light-heavy/light to end combo) These chains will allow him better potential in 4v4 especially with his improved HA. Reduce zone attack recovery to 400ms (similar to LB current zone recovery). This will allow WL to not get GB immediately after zoning in 4v4... and allow him go recover and continue pressuring. Increase hitbox on all attacks. This is simply for minion clear and possibly hitting more targets in 4v4. Rework WL helm splitter leap to be a feintable unblockable. This move has ALOT of GB vulnerability but he needs some orange in his KIT for 4v4 target swap and OOS pressure. Full-block board'n'blade heavy increased hit radius to a full 360 around the WL, unblockable property, instant HA startup. dmg lowered to 28. This will make the heavy punish guaranteed on a blocked attack, and allow him to punish bankers around him similar to BP flip slash. (The attack will be accessible from full-block without a blocked attack, however it will still not be feintable). Grant ability to cancel any basic attack recovery (lights or heavies chained or neutral) into a forward dodge. This will allow him to cancel the recovery of a basic light or heavy into a forward dash, this means a headbutt mixup... OR the unblockable leap mixup... for chain pressure and 4v4 fight potential DRASTICALLY improved. Increased stamina pool, and decreased stamina cost on headbutt. Headbutt costs ALOT of stam as does most of WL kit. 4. Valkarie- Increased sweep speed to 500ms, and removal of the ability to sweep team mates... to nullify this buff slightly, we lower the sweep reposte damage to 25. Increased light damage to the standard 15. Increase heavy damage to 25 neutral, 35 chain, and 40 finisher. Removal of full-block. I'm giving her a very offensive mixup oriented KIT , all overturned defensive moves should be dropped. Stam costs raised slightly across all of her bash attacks. This offense needs to be more bursted, if she can sustain it like she can now she would be overtuned. Removal of her superior block lights. Again having too many defensive options will overturn her. Superior block dodge PINs now are 25 dmg CC attacks that hold enemies vulnerable for a 2 second animation. This is a nice little CC like counter method for 4v4 potential, it will operate similar to glads skewer pin. Dodge lights changes into dodge heavies, damage and all other properties are the same. This is simply keeping an easy to punish dash attack, from being punished with 40+dmg. 5. Shaman- Not much I could work out for shaman, a solid design overall. But there a couple. Stamina pool increased. She runs out extremely quickly. Recovery on any any chain finisher can be canceled by a dodge. She's a wild assassin who moves wildly... she shouldn't have 1000ms recoveries on finishers. and that's it! I'd like to say pardon my formatting I dont have formatting reddit option available to me currently. Please tread the resd carefully and dont skip details and expect me to take your opinion seriously. However if theirs anything you want to clarify or dont understand simply ask in the comments and I will respond. I'd love to hear your opinions and thoughts about my and my group's concepts for hero improvements number 2. And as once again if it's taken well there 3rd samurai will be in the making. (With better formatting). Thank you all and good fight!"
220,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Orochi Rework Suggestion: Because Even a Counter-attacking Character can be Well Designed,11,br2fg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/br2fg1/orochi_rework_suggestion_because_even_a/,2019-05-21 08:38:09,"Orochi. A warrior worth as much as one hundred men... is hardly even worth one. He is, at best, a pest. Droning around and trying to get hits through someone's external guard. His greatest problems are as follows: * His stamina management is atrocious * His unique dodge moves are mediocre, borderline bad * His ""opener""(Storm Rush) is easily countered * His finisher chain pressure is non-existent * His finisher recovery cancel is made near-useless due to a lack of offensive options * His zone has nothing special to it and doesn't help him much in ganks * His heavies are unbalanced(top heavies are faster and deal more damage, side ones are slower and deal less damage and somehow have just as good a hitbox as the top one) &amp;#x200B; Now many people would say that Orochi does not need another rework. I say otherwise. He has the same issue as PK: sub-par in duels, unusable in ganks. And if one character is nearly unusable in one or more game modes, then that screams bad design. Which is why I'm going to try to fix him while trying to keep him as an agile hero, centered around counter-attacking enemies that try to punish him. &amp;#x200B; **Stamina** * Stamina pool increased to 130 from 120 * The hard feint stamina cost for heavies are reduced to 10 from 18(10 is the standard cost for when heavies are feinted) * Storm Rush stamina cost for entering is reduced to 15 from 17 * The extra 9 stamina cost for Storm Rush is removed * \[NEW\] The Stamina cost for light finishers are increased to 6 from 3 *Orochi's stamina has always been the worst, but that's been fabricated by the devs. His heavy hard feints had an extra 8 stamina cost, and his Storm Rush has an unnecessary stamina tax of 9. Both of these changes, plus a general stamina pool buff, would significantly help Orochi in holding up for longer and keeping up his offense.* *For anyone who doesn't understand, Orochi's Storm Rush costs about 38 stamina ON HIT. Breaking it down, that's 17 stamina for entering into Storm Rush, 12 stamina for committing to SR, and an extra 9 stamina cost for no real reason. And remember that that is on hit, not whiff or block. These overall stamina changes for SR would bring the cost down to 27 from 38. A full 11 stamina cut from the cost.* &amp;#x200B; **Chains** * Orochi's starter and finisher side heavies now have wider/larger hitboxes * Orochi's finisher light stats are now switched; now the side finisher lights are 400ms and 15 damage, while the top light is 500ms and 17 *Orochi's side heavies are only really used to distract the opponent from guarding top so that the double top light can be used. The side heavies have no other benefits other than that. A larger hitbox should make them more worthwhile.* *Orochi's finisher lights are simple to deal with: block top and parry the sides. These stat changes make the finisher lights more of a mix-up.* &amp;#x200B; **Riptide Strike** * Orochi can now chain after a whiffed Riptide Strike * The dodge input window for Riptide Strike is now widened to 300-400ms from 300ms * The GB vulnerability of Riptide Strike is now fixed *Riptide Strike has always been disappointing: while it might have been damaging, it was buggy and more likely to be guardbroken, and the inability to chain afterward only compounded on its uselessness.* *Now it can be used more consistently, the GB vulnerability is standardized, and it can chain.* &amp;#x200B; **Finisher Recovery Dodge Cancel** * After a finisher, Orochi's dodge attacks become more powerful versions: * The side and forward dodge lights are sped up to 500ms * Riptide Strike is sped up to 500ms and is enhanced *Orochi's finisher recovery dodge cancel was unique to him, but it did nothing to really help him in duels and only slightly helped him in ganks. His slow dodge lights held this property back, and now he is able to find ways to continue his chains in 1v1s and 4v4s.* \[NEW MOVE!\] Riptide Crash *After Orochi lands his finisher attack, he pulls his sword upwards, jumps back a little, and brings the sword down onto the opponent's skull with full force. (Yep, Orochi basically gets back his heavy Riptide Strike)* Input: Heavy after finisher attack(light or heavy) Speed: 900ms Damage: 35 Special properties: Unblockable, has i-frames on first 300-400ms, finishes the chain and can no longer attack afterward *An unblockable. On Orochi. It should go without saying that someone without an unblockable to use for offensive reasons is near worthless(look at PK). And while people may scream that since Orochi is a counter-attacker he shouldn't have an unblockable, I would strongly disagree. Without an unblockable you can't incite an attack, as the enemy could just block and do nothing. I am going to quote another redditor here,* u/Squib1239*, who put it best:* &gt;Having a defensive oriented character can be fine as long as they have a useable unreactable offense themselves, and that there defense is used on a read, and is punishable by the attacker also on a correct read. *Basically, being a counter-attacker can be viable as long as that character has something that forces people to attack. And an unblockable is the most basic way of doing so.* &amp;#x200B; **Storm Rush** * Both sides of SR are now 400ms(the fastest speed on SR) * Damage for both sides are nerfed to 15 from 17 * Damage for top side of SR is buffed to 20 from 17 * The block stun that SR puts the opponent in is increased so that Orochi's chain light is undodgeable *SR has always been easy to deal with: block the right side, parry the left side and deflect the top side. This speedup makes that strategy obsolete.* *The damage changes are to make the side SRs fairer(since the stamina costs are being changed as well) and so the top SR is more punishing for dodgers(to which there will be more of since the sides are faster).* *The Block stun change was simply to make Orochi's chain light more useful after an SR, since the opponent could just backdodge after a blocked SR and the light cannot hit the opponent.* [*Evidence provided by BarakYEET.*](URL *This fixes that.* &amp;#x200B; **Zone** * After a zone, Orochi can use Riptide Crash(the unblockable) *Orochi's zone is a 500ms 20 damaging attack with a respectively wide hitbox. That's it. Meanwhile, other assassins get soft-feint options, the ability to chain into their combos, and even second attacks that are feintable. This gives his zone more offensive and chaining capability.* &amp;#x200B; **Hurricane Blast** * The soft-feint window of Hurricane Blast is widened to 300-500ms from 500ms *This helps Orochi more in countering rollers during Hurricane Blast.* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR:** * Orochi's side heavies have a larger hitbox * Orochi can handle his stamina better w/ lower stamina costs and a higher stamina pool * Orochi's side light finishers are switched w/ his top light finisher(basically, side light finishers are 400ms while the top is 500ms) * Riptide Strike has less GB vulnerability, a wider dodge input window, and can chain after a whiff * Both sides of Storm Rush are now 400ms and deal 15 damage; top is still 600ms but now deals 20 damage; block stun of Storm Rush is increased so that you cannot buffer a backdodge and dodge Orochi's follow-ups * Orochi's dodge lights are faster and more viable after a finisher recovery dodge cancel * Orochi now has an unblockable(called Riptide Crash) that's usable after a finisher attack * Orochi can chain his zone into a Riptide Crash * Orochi's Hurricane Blast now has a variable-timed soft-feint window"

222,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Improvement Ideas for Orochi,8,br84c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/br84c8/improvement_ideas_for_orochi/,2019-05-21 19:11:52,"u/razza-tu u/shadowpuppett &amp;#x200B; Feedback is required. &amp;#x200B; Orochi despite being a counter attacker literally forces nothing, you never even need to be aggressive against him. I am hoping some minor tweaks to his kit which i suggest can at least achieve that. The idea here is more to give him tools that would want to encourage the enemy to stop his momentum &amp;#x200B; **Recovery cancel additions** &amp;#x200B; All heavies can now be dash cancelled in their recovery. Which now means after a heavy on block or whiff. you dont only have to worry about the 400ms light. But now the potential Dash attack, riptide, or SR &amp;#x200B; **Forward dash light Changes** &amp;#x200B; Forward dash light sped up to 500ms . &amp;#x200B; **Riptide strike changes** \- Gb vulnerability is now on par with other dodge light attacks. This stops him from being GB'd on reaction when trying to enter Riptide strike. \- Another glaring issue with riptide strike is even if used to dodge punish moves like shaman dash attacks which have low recovery, or BP bash. Riptide still would fail at actually doing anything other than bouncing off. &amp;#x200B; As such i suggest a further change would be to create the first unblockable light. Riptide now becomes unblockable. &amp;#x200B; With the reduced GB vulnerability and the fact that it is UB. it now can successfully punish all attacks it dodges , while being vulnerable to feint to parry &amp;#x200B; **Storm rush Changes** &amp;#x200B; SR can now be feinted 100ms later into the animation. Speed on both sides is now equalized to avoid the issue of block one side react to the others &amp;#x200B; SR can now be soft feinted to GB. This would stop those who aim to block top while dodging backwards &amp;#x200B; **Wind gust** &amp;#x200B; Damage reduced to 25. counts as first light in the chain on hit. Damage reduced because with more likely deflects it seems like a fair trade. &amp;#x200B; **Hurricane blast** &amp;#x200B; HB can now be target swapped like other charged heavies. This allows for target swapped heavy deflects, and gives orochi another way to beat external guard when he has a team mate around. HB now has Hyper armor , i.e resistant to bashes &amp;#x200B; Note: For assassins a general change should be deflect frames take priority over dodge frames &amp;#x200B; In general these changes now force a reaction with orochi in 1's and 4's Because : 1) SR is now tough to deal with and finally works as an opener, dodging back while holding top is not safe for static guard heroes. With both sides being as fast its a 50/50 you cant block fastest and react to the other 2 sides SR and other dodge attacks are easier to get into thanks to heavy cancel recoveries. SR entry itself would only be GB'd on prediction as attempting to GB SR on back dodge would mean you could eat a riptide strike &amp;#x200B; 2) has some form of external pressure in gank now. By himself thanks to riptide which yes is parry bait, but at least if you parry him and he is teamed up you leave yourself open to an attack by his team mate something blocking never allowed him to do &amp;#x200B; Further pressure applied by target swapping heavy deflects &amp;#x200B; Orochi is now finally a counter attacker, who can force you to be aggressive and punish you greatly for doing so."
223,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Would removing Nobu's ability to dodge out of HS enough of a nerf to it?,0,bsd3x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bsd3x5/would_removing_nobus_ability_to_dodge_out_of_hs/,2019-05-24 15:32:30,"Most agree that nobu needs nerfs in her defense and some of her dmg values to justify a viable offense. I agree with that. Though adding simple gb vulnerability would eliminate what was so special about it... and that would be a too radical of a change to her defense. So, what if similar to JJ (who I believe should get the ability to dodge attack out of his stance), she will no longer be able to dodge out of HS? Alone, I believe this would not be enough, so what if nobu's HS exit would have more block recovery, to motivate some kind of counterplay. If HS's defense is nerfed harder than this, idk how viable using it would be in most situations. Unless of course her updated kit has viable options out of it and a good way to get into it without the opponent backwalking you with a followup dodge"

Anyway, I've been starting to notice more often that when both me and an opponent go for a guard break, one of us will get hit through it and be unable to cgb. I thought you were supposed to just bounce off of each other. It's extremely frustrating to deal with. The timing seems a little funky. You have to be right infront of each other, and it feels like even though I gb first, I get guard broken through it without any chance to cgb.

226,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Orochi Rebalance Ideas,70,buebmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/buebmx/orochi_rebalance_ideas/,2019-05-29 22:55:07,"This is not a complete rework, but an attempt to make Orochi better at what he does, while giving him better form of offense to chip turtles down. I've refrained from giving strong gank tools, but have attempted to make his 1v1 and anti gank survival better. 1. Storm Rush indicators from both Left and Right are the equated to be 267ms. This makes it a borderline unreactable move (like the right from Orochi's perspective is currently) and 50/50 between the 2 sides, so it acts as an opener, or if failing that, provides a safer way to access 400ms chained lights. Can be avoided by dodging, but is caught by top and even if guarded by static guard heroes, gives access to chained lights. 2. Riptide strike has no GB vulnerability during the animation (still vulnerable during the backdodge itself, so backdodging is not completely safe for Orochi). This makes riptide a risky but good counter for bash/GB mixups. 3. Orochi's third chain lights are superior on block and are top 500ms and sides 400ms. This allows easier dash cancel recovery to access various Dodge attacks easier in case the opponent tries to counter attack. 4. Hurricane blast now has 80% damage reduction and no GB vulnerability. This makes it a decent survival and teamfighting tool in case of an external deflect. (Assuming deflect windows are made better again) 5. Soft feints from hurricane blast can be target switched. Again, this gives his deflects utility in teamfights. 6. Dodge lights are superior on block. Making them faster would take the advantage of dual i-frames away, so this acts as a way to get to chain better, albeit still not extremely useful. 7. Forward Dodge light is 500ms with better range. 8. Chain heavy finisher has increased blockstun properties. This is solely to help his ganking marginally to help others get their CC easier."

And I promised a tierlist for all competitive modes from me and my crew of competitive friends have been working on for a while. So without further stalling let's get started with DUELS! (S tier)- 1. Conqueror *conqs offense is very mediocre, any over agression results in instant punish... however with his bash being semi-safe enough to be used, and his MANY option selects making him have the most broken defense in the game... we all decided to place him as the number 1 hero in the game...* 2. Black prior *another hero with lackluster offense but he has more than conq has with all the orange in his KIT, but like conq black prior excels at defense, using whiffs to bait punishes he can flip, with an extremely safe bash to use when hes getting turtled out to hard... with bulwark flip recoveries to counter alot of punish options, he also has a classic crushing counter/parry option... making feint baiting him a risky game due to similar animations but each denying different baits and offering him reliable mixup counters to all non-unblockabke attacks, he lacks the option selects that conq has, but his superior offense allows him to be 2nd in out minds* 3. Berserker *by far the best designed hero in the game and in this tierlist in our minds, hes viable in a diverse and fair way... with 400ms lights to mixup with slower 800ms heavies all hyper armored, and all having unblockable pressure when feeling insecure with dash cancels on all whiffed attacks allow for a powerful hero offensively... however his power requires both opponents to make reads this makes him balanced and fair but also is why hes only 3rd on this list.* 4. Warden *certainly a powerful hero with a Jack of all trades shoulder bash making up all hos offense and defense... it forces ALOT of reads between opponent and warden though the charged SB is safe for warden as he can react and feint to opponents able to dodge, and the opponent cannot... the down side to this is that proper read on uncharged, half charged, or feint does grant opponent some punish (GB or light), this and the lack of actual pressure with anything other than SB keeps him too high up S tier* (A tier)- 1. Raider *I can hear the hate for this one now, however the only thing that would put him in S tier is dash GB which is confirmed to be removed... with this change in mind we put him as our big A tier boi... with 400ms indicators hes certainly viable but but no means unreactable, jaw dropping HA allows his wiffed attacks to be safe from most punishes aswell as having incredible damage numbers so if you make a mistake or bad reaction you get punished HARD.* 2. Shaolin *hes an interesting hero to place, because good read nets you punish... however shaolin has an option to counter every possible read you can make so it's a very mind game oriented fight... but 400ms neutral attack in his top light makes for nice interrupts, and his QI stance 50/50 allows for his main offense... he does have options with his fast walking speed, and crushing counters from qi stance... however despite having OK offense and OK defense, it's enough to make him a viable pick even at top GM in duels... though his power is nowhere approaching the heros of S tier.* 3. Shaman *solid hero with similar reaction paths to raider... damage numbers being power of course, access go a flicker bash mixup with nice range is nice, aswell as her unrivaled chase potential... managing to land a bleed on the opponent allows access to heal in attacks, aswell as the pounce becoming a 50dmg grab that regens stamina, and has better tracking... however her only high pressure comes from top bleed soft feint mixed up with raw side heavies, and her 2nd hit unblockable...a solid dash attack and low recoveries on some attacks is good but not enough to push her any higher on the list* 4. Highlander *originally was in-line for B tier due to many many heros having a reliable counter to his kick/caber, and all heros being able to roll. However with roll nerfs inbound and confirmed we decided he would be vastly better offensively... good evasion in offensive stance with dash recoveries, and low recoveries on unblockable and kick... however defensive stance has little utility and is only used when OOS... however he does have access to the offensive stance parry option select which almost single handedly brought him into A tier.* (B tier) 1. Kensei *honestly his rework was really good, but numbers on some things need to be increased to push him out of this tier... many diverse soft feint options mixed with hard feints make for DEEPLY layered offense that makes good kensei a nightmare to parry... however hes simple to just block out to avoid his tempting parry baits... this results in the classic lack of pressure issue which he suffers greatly from, his unblockable is solid and has decent utility but this is hard to access for only a chance at damage. So with all this it's clear most of his offense comes from pommel strike mixups at competitive 1v1s... he does possess solid dash attacks, and good range, but neither of these are enough to compensate for this lack of true offense.* 2. Hitokiri *weak hero offensively... all to say, she has incredible parry game with her mind boggling HA startups and variable timing to make read counter to people baiting these trade attempts...however her unblockables are slow and easily rolled away from... and her kicks are avoidable via back step light, timed back dodge l, and roll... with roll nerfs coming we thought these issues would resolve themselves, however with timed back dodge and back step lights still voiding the mixups she has very little offense... though her defense and HA alone puts her here out of C tier* 3. Lawbringer *he got better with his rework, however he still lacks offense... his unblockables have early no pressure with being safe on dodge, and neutral shove having only mediocre defensive potential and 0 offensive potential... Hes fell off. His chain shove is viableish offense being 500ms, however its startup is 400ms after the heavy at buffered timing... this allows opponents to react to the enormous pause between heavy and no chain attack coming out rather than the shove itself, allowing for a reliable and safe prediction dodge that isn't even reacting to the actual attack... there is no counter to this dodge as their is no mixup with chain shove so LB is stuck with a parry turtle playstyle still.* 4. Shinobi *previous tierlists put him in S tier due to slide tackle and time stall tactics... this is no longer possible... so despite being nearly unpunishable, shinobi is a garbage hero due to literally NO offense... hes impossible to punish however he will now get any damage at all ever. Simple chip damage will beat out even the most determined to be defensive shinobi, winning a time battle. Aswell as if hes bored enough to throw an attack it will get parried and hes lost the game already, however shinobi can win if a mistake is made by the opponent cause he can still time stall if he manages to get more damage than the opponent has... this alone puts him at rock bottom B tier.* (C tier) 1. Valkarie *some more garbage...valk has lackluster chain pressure that only ever hits opponents who are asleep or who are willing to take a risk parry... simply blocking her out removes all her offense and her bash is avoidable via timed dodge... sweep simply isn't viable at all in 1v1 so it's just a free GB when thrown. Her full-block and defensive option selects are her only excuse for being out of D tier.* 2. Warlord *a personal favorite of mine I'm sad to see him here, however similar to kensei warlord only can be successful on opponents willing to parry, by using his light/heavy animation similarities to make some great parry bait is fun but countered by blocking... his lack luster HA allows him to be interrupted even in 1v1 with reliability, and his full-block is borderline useless. He does have a 500ms opener with heabutt but its punishable on reaction dodge, and has 0 tracking meaning at competitive levels it almost never hits and has no mixup potential... His redeeming quality is his crushing counter/parry mixups for counter attacking being safer, aswell... and the light/heavy animations allow for him to punish parry gods looking for a montage. 3. Nuxia *traps are effectively useless in a 1v1 setting, however 400ms chain lights are her excuse for being out of D tier.. She has no defense whatsoever, but unreactable chain lights are enough to keep out out of the scum barrel* 4. Tiandi *he has a safe bash with palm strike but it doesnt ever land anyway so best you get is your 5 chip damage from the heavy. Dash lights can be used defensively but it's very inconsistent and difficult to do... however he does have high I framed dash heavies which can be used situationally, and a 400ms chain light are all that keep him from going D tier... long recoveries on finishers, and no neutral pressure and piss poor chain pressure are his issues.* 5. Peacekeeper *really simple, 400ms option select and dagger cancel are her dog turd excuse for offense and defense... the end... in all serious of one of these were any worse in any way, she would be in D tier.* 6. Gladiator *difficult choosing weather glad is better than PK or not... we all chose PK due to actual unreactability and a good option select no matter how trash the rest is... glad has one thing allowing him to be here and this is skewer... its unblockable pressure... nothing else about him has viability in a competitive setting but he has unblockable mixup... and that's why hes not in D tier.* (D tier)*aka scum class* 1. Jiang Jun *JJ has safely avoidable unblockable pressure which means no pressure... he has some nutty range on chain attacks, and a decent dash attack but none of these are unreactable, and highly punishable... Sifu is a nice situational dodge cancel, but he never gets rewarded for it, and often will get GB'd anyway due to lack of immune frames... Shin kick can be used as OOS pressure but is avoidable for opponents with stamina. Lack of offense, and lack of defense both keep JJ away from any viability.* 2. Orochi *an argument can be made that hes closer to nuxia for the same reason she's not in D tier... however traps being reactable doesnt mean they wont land once in a blue moon... orochi also has the good ol 400ms excuse however he had nothing else in his favor... all his dash attacks especially the back one have alot of vulnerability to GB, and have almost no special point to using them.... We elected to place orochi here due to no utility and one dimensional offense with lights alone... and some of the worst defense in the game. 3. Shugoki *same problems as before just not as severe... no opener, lack of chain pressure... he does have an unblockable mixups now however any correct read rewards BEYOND fair punish, aswell as every option being safe on dodge roll... hugs recovery is also 2000ms allowing for any hero to get their max dmg attack even after a roll for many (raider can actually get his chain zone after dodging shugo hug by backstepping a light into the zone)* 4. Aramusha *hopefully another obvious one, he does have mixups however all are safe on back dodge... this meaning he has no pressure... and no viability beyond turtling and using zone as a 1 diamentional offense... we would have him tied for rock bottom, however he can reliably block 400 chain lights with his blade blockade on a semi- reliable read... only thing keeping him off that dreaded worst hero spot* 5. Centurian *I think we all know why hes here... no opener, no chain pressure, no mixups whatsoever... He can turtle parry... and the cutscene is nice punish for proper parries and GB punishes... but centurian had nothing to pressure you into doing anything...* And this is the end!... I did promise a tierlist for every mode but well make it a 4 part series as I dont want to make it too long of a read here. As always I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions in the comments, these are always controversial so if you share a different opinions please share it... Again I can never stress this enough, thank you all for the great support and comments in the past, we all appreciate it and it keeps us making rework concepts, tips and tricks for newer players to learn from, and now competitive tierlists. Thank you all! And good fight."
228,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Small Tiandi Buffs,0,bv31jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bv31jy/small_tiandi_buffs/,2019-05-31 14:21:26,"Just some things I'd like to see for Tiandi in the next season or so. - Lowered recovery on successful attacks Just enough to not get GB'd for trying to do anything in a 2v1. Really annoying to get a revenge activation punish only to get grabbed and then thrown off a ledge. - Slightly reduced gb vulnerability on dodge heavy or dodge heavy sped up to 900ms I also play JJ quite a bit and it still feels ridiculous to get gb'ed when you're already one whole step into your dodge heavy as Tiandi compared to JJ. I know this would change how easy it is to avoid mixups like kick to toss but it's a welcome trade. - Increase hitbox of zone attack to Tiandi's left during second half of zone This is mostly for minion clearing but Tiandi's zone only really covers an arc to his right side. It's okay for clearing the lane but you have to position Tiandi's body well enough to hit a good amount of minions and it can be a real pain in the ass sometimes. Having it only be on the second part should keep its use as a quick lock on attack unchanged. That's it, nothing game breaking just some QoL stuff I'd like to see"
229,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Raider's Neutral Heavies' GB Vulnerability,52,bvzs03,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bvzs03/raiders_neutral_heavies_gb_vulnerability/,2019-06-03 03:22:57,"Does anyone know how much GB vulnerability Raider has on his neutral heavies? From my understanding, he had 400 ms, so a simple feint into GB would work against a Raider; however, I just played against a Raider, and every single one of my GB bounced off his heavies. When I let them go, they were parried. Sure, he could have mistimed the parries only when I feinted, but the odds of doing that consistently and still parrying correctly when I let them go is very slim. Any explanation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
230,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Orochi Rework V2,0,bw2orp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bw2orp/orochi_rework_v2/,2019-06-03 07:43:12,"I know there has been several posts before but after looking at these and thinking about it this seems to be the best combination to 1. Spin Kick/Jump Kick The Tozen kick (500ms) has come into play and it can be done from a forward dash + GB, pressing GB while in storm rush, and after a heavy attack. It guarantees a light attack. The kick is guaranteed off a blocked heavy attack. 2. Speed up Dodge Lights to 500ms This is to make it safer but also a good way to catch early dodges from the kick. Chain finisher dodge cancel will allow Orochi to either forward dash undodgeable light or do the kick. 3. Light Attack Adjustments Chain starter top lights have enhanced property. This allows Orochi an easier way to get into their chains without being blocked all the time. Chain finisher side lights are 400ms, the top light is 500ms but has enhanced property. This allows Orochi to actually take advantage of the finisher recovery dodge cancel to get into the kick, dodge lights, or storm rush. 4. Universal 700ms Heavy Speeds Theres no point to using the side heavies that are slower and do less damage. At 700ms the heavies serve as a good mix up tool since they can guarantee the kick if they are blocked so now just bl0cK is no longer completely viable against Orochi. 5. Riptide Strike Adjustments Remove GB vulnerability. Doing Riptide strike after a finisher recovery cancel dodge makes it unblockable. This is to catch GBs on Orochi after a chain finisher. 6. Storm Rush Adjustments Aside from the ability to do a jump kick from storm rush, both left and right sides on storm rush are the same speed now. Any thoughts? The only thing that I think would be overtuned is the unblockable riptide and kick guaranteed on block."
231,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Shinobi Rework/Rebalance Idea,0,bwgvcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bwgvcn/shinobi_reworkrebalance_idea/,2019-06-04 08:18:02,"Now hear me out, I know Shinobi doesn't exactly need a rework. I'm just proposing a couple sets of nerfs and buffs that will change gameplay up. - Well, what are the annoying parts of Shinobi? In my opinion, not being able to punish him, and quad dash. The only option of fighting him should *not* be spamming GB. And yes, he is annoying in 4v4, but my fix will only work against uncoordinated teams. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *You can only dash out of your charged heavy when it is fully charged. &gt;This should completely nerf quad dash. I wouldn't have done this if I weren't going to buff him later. *Backflip is no longer uninterruptible, and has GB vulnerability for the first half of the move. &gt;This needs to happen to make him punishable overall, and make him even worse in team fights. I believe he shouldn't be even possibly viable as a team fighter, and have the role of ganker. A Shinobi's job needs to be specializing in 1v1s and picking a weak enemy out of a fight. His low health and super sprint already reinforce this role as the weak but deadly assassin. *Make second ranged heavy not bounce off block. &gt;This is just so he gets a forward roll, and it also pairs with the next buff.. *Allow Shinobi a ""33/33/33"" soft feint on the second ranged heavy in a chain. Backflip, the second heavy in a chain (Sickle Rain), or of course, just letting the ranged heavy go. &gt;This gives Shinobi *way* more options after kick. This makes him mix-up *intensive* and again, sticks to the role of him keeping you on your feet and being a duel god. And this isn't as broken as Raider 33/33/33 because Shinobi has to feint into a non-stunning light/guard break. *Shinobi health reduced to 100 &gt;Oh no! Ew! Another Shinobi health nerf! Okay, look at it this way. My buffs are making Shinobi that deadly but weak assassin, and he is *really* deadly now. Shinobis will have to think carefully about their moves now to avoid dying that much sooner. *Front Roll Kick is now 600ms, and can be charged to a second stage at 1000ms. It is uninterruptible after 700ms. &gt;Makes forward roll way more rewarding to do, and isn't shut down by dodging early. *Charged Front Roll Kick now wallsplats. &gt;More mid-chain pressure, and makes the move actually useful. Also.. *You can now Front Roll Kick instead of 3 timed lights during Sickle Rain. &gt;Gives Shinobi options to work with his environment and punish positioning more. Stamina drain and such. Just another option instead of backflip if you want to get out of a situation during Sickle Rain. Let me know what you thought! I think this would be an interesting and needed change to this character. I worked really long on this, so please help it get to the front page ;w; Happy Pride month"
232,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,An Orochi rework where I don't do anything to his lights,0,bwstqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bwstqu/an_orochi_rework_where_i_dont_do_anything_to_his/,2019-06-05 05:23:50,"Hi everyone! I've been thinking about Orochi recently, and what can be done to improve them. I think the following changes will work. But first, a Tl;Dr. This rework will: - Expand on Orochi's neutral options slightly, making useful elements of their kit easier to reach - Add an unblockable attack after finisher heavies, which will be among the most flexible move of its type in the game - Make Storm Rush more useful offensively - Make Riptide Strike more useful defensively - Make Orochi's zone more offensively flexible - Make Hurricane Blast *slightly* more enticing Interested? Then read on... ##Current Problems and Goals ###Problems - 1v1 offense is one-dimensional and weak - Chain 400ms lights for 12 damage are Orochi's main offensive tool, and using them normally gives the opponent two opportunities to get a big damage parry - Storm Rush is Orochi's only other difficult attack to react to, but it can be defended against passively, and its rewards (17dmg and no follow-up pressure) are poor - Team mode play is somehow *worse* than in 1v1 - The 1v1 issues are compounded by external block's total effectiveness vs everything Orochi can do, and Orochi's poor hitboxes - Despite emphasising mobility, Orochi is noticably less flexible in this regard than; Nobushi, JJ, Shinobi, Tiandi, Shaolin, Shaman, and arguably more. That's at least a quarter of the roster than can outperform Orochi at what should be Orochi's defining gimmick ###Goals Whilst Orochi still has a few weaknesses that I did not mention (such as sub-meta T3 and T4 feats, and lower than average damage), I'd argue those could be healthy and balanced if these core concerns were fixed, so that's what I'll be addressing. - Straddle the oh-so thin line of maintains Orochi's fantasy and identity as a mobile counter-attacker whilst also giving them ways to force reactions to counter-attack - Improve the pressure from Orochi' chains to a consistently useable level - Give the opponent more/some reasons to try to interrupt, parry, or evade against an attacking Orochi - Improve the flexibility of Orochi's mobility, with improved dodge options, and better movement during some attacks - Give an Orochi player more/some reasons to use their cool gimmick attacks. Particularly Riptide Strike and Hurricane Blast, which are currently *very* situational at best ----- ##Changes ###Basic chains - Allow Orochi to soft-feint a neutral heavy into any heavy or light finisher. Soft-feints occur at the standard timing This substantially increases the possibility space an opponent has to analyse if they want to stop Orochi reaching the mid-chain. In addition to light, heavy, and heavy&gt;feint&gt;GB, Orochi can now access a top 400ms soft-feint light, and the heavy finisher (which will be useful for reasons explained later) with relatively low risk. - The zone attack can now be used in-chain. If, *and only if*, it is used in this context, it acts as a chain finisher heavy. Stamina cost of chain zone is 45 It's a 500ms 20dmg heavy attack, so it's nice to have such a thing in a chain, especially as an additional alternative to the existing heavy attacks. Whilst the high stamina cost of deploying the zone might be steeper than a heavy, it will give the opponent less time to consider a parry. This will be useful because a blocked heavy finisher will be a decent opportunity for the Orochi with a change explained later. ###New move: Tsunami - Unblockable side heavy attack for 30 damage - Animation is wide horizontal backhand slash [somewhat like the riposte you can perform against dogs in Sekiro](URL This move can be used from either side - Hitbox sweep akin to Shaolin's Astonishing Blossom (Qi Stance&gt;Side Heavy), although with a shorter hitbox radius to reflect the shorter weapon. The forward motion of Tsunami will be about 80% of that of Astonishing Blossom. - Can be used to cancel the recovery of any move classified as a ""heavy finisher"" - Attack timing is variable, between 700ms and 900ms (note that the attack is unblockable on *all timings*) - Can be hard-feinted or soft-feinted into any dodge. All cancel options follow standard rules for chargeable/variably timed attacks This move is doing a lot of the legwork in my attempt to make Orochi viable. In a 1v1 context, Orochi will devote a lot of effort to attempts to reach this move, and the opponent will be strongly incentivised to prevent this. This should result in many opponent attempts to stuff finisher heavies and zones with active defensive measures like parries and superior lights; giving Orochi more opportunities to counter-attack. Once the Orochi reaches Tsunami, they are rewarded with a powerful mix-up. Parrying and empty side dodges are very risky thanks to the variable timing, the unblockable status nullifies powerful block based defensive tools and option-selects, and the forward motion makes back-dodging fairly unsafe. As such, the most powerful defenses against this move are fast interrupts, dodge attacks, rolls, and big i-frame defensive tools like Hidden Stance. This mix-up gives Orochi rewarding tools to deal with all of these defenses, with feints into parry/deflect for dodge attacks and interrupts, and dodge cancel into Orochi's suite of dodge attack options for anything i-frame or spacing related. In team modes, this attack will be a huge target swap threat, with a scary hitbox and solid range. These combined with the unblockable status will incentivise opponents to pay a lot of attention to Orochi, so they might prevent Tsunami's use. It does, of course, also give him a tool vs external block, albeit one that's a little less accessible than most. ###Storm Rush changes - Increased top undodgeable damage to 20 - Normalise all stamina costs with those of standard heavies. Costs affected are hit (12 from 21), whiff (+9 from +30), feint (+9 from +20), and block (+18 remains unchanged) I've avoided making number changes for most of this post, as I feel like Orochi's problems are strictly capability related, and that poorly tuned values are somewhat incidental by comparison. However, Storm Rush's numbers make no fucking sense and I find that to be deeply frustating, so I've suggested something more coherent. - Storm Rush is now a chain starter on hit or block, with a short delay between impact and any chained attack to prevent stun-lock Storm Rush can now be used as fairly path into the fast chain lights, or the heavy finisher. Combined with the above stamina changes and earlier chain alterations, Orochi will now be able to chain Storm Rush into a zone, which would cost 92 stamina (74 in the event that Storm Rush isn't blocked); leaving just enough for a Tsunami mix-up. ###Riptide Strike changes - Riptide Strike can now chain on whiff - Riptide Strike can now be cancelled into a side or forward dodge. Dodge cancel occurs at 300ms into the move Riptide Strike was previously a slightly less useable dodge attack that did slightly more damage. This didn't really feel like an impactful addition to Orochi's kit, as there were few occassions to recommend using Riptide instead of Zephyr Slash, with its ability to chain even on whiff, faster time to impact, and shorter total GB vulnerability. Now Riptide Strike's lower useability also buys Orochi a little extra safety, and more mobility in team scenarios. ###Huricane Blast changes - Damage reduced to 40 - Added a hard-feint - Now classifies as a heavy finisher The move will now offer at least some threat regardless of how the opponent tries to counter it, as dodge attacks can be parried after a feint, and dodging into GB can be stuffed by the regular GB, or the new Tsunami recovery cancel option. This last option justifies the damage nerf, as the follow-up pressure is now enormous. The move will still be very situational, and top Orochi players will still probably only use it for the memes. However, at least this option serves as a fast and relatively protected (with the armour on Hurrican Blast) way to access Tsunami in team modes. ----- ## Conclusion Orochi now has a number of viable things to be doing in all modes. The point of power in this new kit (Tsunami) makes Orochi much stronger, but finding ways to get there will incentivise more reactive unless the opponent starts turtling, in the event of which Orochi has been given interesting options to mix up and avoid getting parried. Mobility is now *substantially* better, in a way that will really impact team mode performance, and the Tsunami mix-up provides a threat to anyone in its path, whether they are externally guarding or not. What do you all think?"
233,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Aramusha rework - As Miyamoto Musashi once said, ""get in their face""",195,bd254q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bd254q/aramusha_rework_as_miyamoto_musashi_once_said_get/,2019-04-14 22:12:08,"##Summary at the bottom ##The Goals * Give Aramusha openers though soft-feints, keeping in line with his identity * Give him a bash punish as well * Make Tempest less predictable; encourage mixups and prolonged use of the chain * Fix Deadly Feint being easily shut down by backdodges * Add new ways to use the moves currently locked behind Blade Blockade * Make Blade Blockade safer * Improve viability in team fights ## Misc changes * Locked walk speed increased * New move: Ring the bell (Alternate) Input: Forward dash + light. Acts as a command grab. Usable from 200ms (non-variable), 600ms animation. Has good forward tracking, but poor side tracking. A new way to access one of Aramusha's unique moves, and a key to fixing the Heavy Finisher mixup (discussed further below). Timing allows it to be used as an alternate heavy parry punish. Also works as an option in teamfights. In line with other CC move changes (Shaman's pounce, Demon's Embrace), if the opponent is hit during the animation Aramusha lets go of them. * New move: Crosswind A limited version of Rushing Wind (Alt) accessible from a side dodge. 700ms after 100ms of dodge. iframes from 100-300ms into the animation (ie at the normal timing for iframes). This version **lacks the soft-feints discussed later and is not feintable.** Counts as a chain starter. Attack comes from the same side as your dodge * A successful Push Back Kick counts as a chain starter. Allows Aramusha to throw a 400ms non-guaranteed light after landing PBK (see Tempest section). Gives the move some use when not near a wall. With the soft-feints and recovery cancels discussed later (see dash attacks and Blade Blockade sections), gives the move utility as an opener. ## Rushing Wind (forward dash attacks) Soft-feints will be added to Aramusha's forward dash attacks to turn them into low-risk, low-damaging openers. They are not designed to be a primary source of damage, but rather to grant access to Tempest. * All dash heavies can now be performed from 200ms-400ms into the dash * Top dash heavy can soft-feint into a 500ms light from either side * Side dash heavies can be soft-feinted into 500ms opposite side heavy or Push Back Kick. Similar to the OOL whiff followup, this soft-feint has forward tracking. * Top dash tracking on rolls and runners improved. (Give it a dose of whatever Valiant Breakthrough got) * Similar to his running attack, side Rushing Wind now has iframes from startup to 200ms Overall these options promote an active defense (dodging, parrying) rather than a passive one (blocking). A blocked heavy leads to a 400ms light (see Tempest section) and then Deadly Feints, so parrying these attacks is encouraged; however, Aramusha can catch parry attempts with one the softfeints or feint-GB. PBK adds an unreactable element to the side dash heavies, opportunity to take advantage of walls, and a bash for team fights. Next up, let's talk about fixing Aramusha's main offense, his iconic infinite combo: ## Tempest * Tempest is now **bidirectional** - meaning side-to-side (ie left-to-right) chain attacks are allowed * This means that *side-to-side no longer triggers a heavy finisher* * ""Whirlwind:"" - After any opener, chain starter (incl. dash attacks, Deadly Feints, landed Push Back Kick), or chained heavy, **the next light is 400ms.** * 500ms lights are all 15dmg; 400ms lights are all 12dmg, except Deadly Feints which are 15dmg * Side heavy opener is now 30dmg; chained heavies are all 28dmg * Tangent: GB stun increased to guarantee a side heavy Tempest needs to be made unpredictable be given 400ms lights while also balanced remaining relative to other infinite chains. Aramusha can now access 400ms lights in the same manner as Zerk and Shaolin, but his chain is kept bi-directional and somewhat low-damage as a tradeoff for not having to alternate lights and heavies. ## Heavy finishers (HF) and Deadly Feint (DF) * Heavy Finisher can **cancel into a forward dash** to utilize Ring the Bell Alt or dash attacks * Deadly feint lights are only 400ms if the HF was the 3rd hit in the chain or later (Recall, however, that after a DF the next chain light is 400ms) * HF damage is decreased to 37, and DF lights are 15dmg on all sides. Now that the HF is an actual mixup its damage must be lowered, because right now it hits *hard*. Additionally, now that Aramusha has a 400ms light right after a DF (see Tempest section), it is not necessary to have consecutive 400ms DFs to sustain his offense. The opponent is now given an opportunity to avoid dealing with successive DFs by blocking the followup light/parrying the heavy, but this will not be trivial. I feel that this limitation would make for more engaging offense than repeated HF mixups. ## Blade blockade &amp; followups Blade Blockade's problem is that it carries too much risk (900ms GB vulnerability total) for too little reward (only guaranteed attack is Ring the Bell). * Blade blockade's **recovery can be canceled with Twin Vipers or Push Back Kick.** (Recovery starts 500ms into the animation) * Aforementioned PBK changes apply * Twin Vipers and PBK do not have HA when used as a recovery cancel( HA works the same as currently if you block something) * Twin Vipers damage decreased to 33 to compensate for new ease of access * Fury Unleashed is now guaranteed, but its damage is decreased to 20 to compensate for this, for the new safety of BB, and for BB's ability to interrupt chained lights. * All heavies can be softfeinted into BB These changes make Blade Blockade an appropriately balanced risk-reward proposition while making it safe enough to be worth using. It is still vulnerable to feint-GB, but not on reaction thanks to the cancel to PBK; however, on a good read the kick can be dodged and punished by a GB. If the opponent does nothing, Aramusha can cancel into Twin Vipers for a formidable mixup. The ability to use Twin Vipers as a cancel gives Aramusha an unblockable for team fights and ganks. Its ease of access is kept balanced by its high GB vulnerability. It doesn't need to be an incredibly potent option because he has /Push Back Kick and Ring the Bell Alt. Heavy attacks already hard feint to BB extremely quickly. The softfeint streamlines this tech. If you're cheeky you can use this as a pseudo-recovery cancel to BB (for copious examples, check out Anime Expert's videos) The damage decreases may seem extreme to some, but recall that a successful hit also leads to significant chain pressure, unlike other fullblock counters ## New: Recovery cancel - ""Forward momentum"" * Can cancel recoveries on lights, heavies, and dash heavies with a *forward dash only* This is not a defensive option (i.e. Sifu's Poise or Nobushi's cancels); rather, it allows Aramusha to continue his offense against a retreating foe or to quickly switch targets in team fights with a dash attack. This is similar to the recovery cancel already present on a whiffed top heavy. ## Summary * Locked-on walk speed increased * New move: Ring the Bell (Alt). Forward dash + light. 200ms into dodge, 600ms animation, good forward tracking * New move: Crosswind. Side dodge heavy. 700ms after 100ms of dodge with iframes from 100-300ms into the animation. Like side Rushing Wind, but cannot hard feint or use soft-feints discussed later. Chain starter * On a successful Push Back Kick, can throw a 400ms non-guaranteed light from any direction * All forward dash attacks usable from 200-400ms * Top Rushing Wind soft-feintable into a 500ms light, either side * Side Rushing Wind soft-feintable into Push Back Kick or a 500ms opposite side heavy with forward tracking * Tempest: Now bidirectional; after a chain starter (incl. Deadly Feints, dash attacks, and landed PBK), opener, or chain heavy, next light is 400ms * Delay between attacks reverted * Heavy Finishers can now be soft-feinted into a forward dash - Ring the Bell Alt will catch backdodges * Deadly feints are only 400ms if the HF is at least the third hit in the chain * Deadly feint damage set to 15 all sides, HF damage to 37 * BB recovery is cancelable by Twin Vipers and Push Back Kick. Twin Vipers damage decreased to 33 * Fury Unleased is now guaranteed, 20 damage. * Heavies can softfeint into BB * Recoveries on lights, heavies, and dash heavies can be canceled by a forward dash With this rework, Aramusha would have sufficient neutral mixups - though by design not a strong source of damage - to access Tempest, which would now be a highly threatening combo due to 400ms lights, bidirectionality, and a proper unreactable mixup in the Heavy Finisher/Deadly feint. Furthermore, he would gain offense in team fights thanks to new ways to acces Ring the Bell, Twin Vipers, and Push Back Kick, as well as some defense for his low-health self with softfeints into Blade Blockade. His playstyle would be engaging and require constant thought both from the player and their opponent, making him a hero who isn't just good, but also fun to play and to fight."

So here's my attempt at improving his ""offense"" (as in, provoke a reaction from a turtle) so he can be a true counterattacker. &amp;#x200B; Allow his deflect options (Wind Gust and Hurricane blast) to be used mid chain by using input BACK+LIGHT/GB input. Wind gust alt is 500/600ms while Hurricane Blast alt is 900ms. \-They would deal 20 and 35 damage each and reward GB on successful dodge. \-Wind gust alt (inputted by BACK+GB) is a chain starter and can perform a followup light even if it whiffs. Storm rush left side has to be as fast as the right one, so the opponend has to make a read. (Other chars can force you to make a read (conq, warden, zerk etc.) so I don't see why Orochi shouldn't). Storm rush can now softfeint into dodges. \-Allow him to storm rush with a front dodge (FORWARD DODGE+HEAVY input) to allow him to open up an opponent faster, and to create slight OOS pressure. Side heavy finishers should be unblockable (and maybe 900ms instead of 800ms?) to make the opponent guess. More mixup potential. Also softfeintable into dodges. Also allow him to go into a riptide strike stance by using full block stance input in which he can use: \-Soft feinted dodges WITHOUT IFRAMES BUT INSTEAD 300ms/200ms DEFLECT FRAMES in case someone tries to attack you out of it so you can punish him. This would be his unique property/attribute that would fortify his identity as a counter-attacker. \-light riptide strike (current one, maybe sped up idk, light input) \-old riptide strike (using heavy input) which can be charged into an unblockable one. Heavy riptide strike can be softfeinted into left or right spinning slash 400ms lights (animation similar to zone attack) so the enemy has to react. Only top attack is a chain starter. \-Light riptide strike has no GB vulnerability. \-You can be guardbroken during the stance though. \-Stance can be used to cancel finisher/combo recoveries."
235,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,proposed concept for improvements on every for honor hero.,0,bdbpw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bdbpw9/proposed_concept_for_improvements_on_every_for/,2019-04-15 13:59:37,"alright this is gunna be a big one so brace yourselves... im a long time player of the game (since beta) and iv gotten pretty damn good.... I mained LB back in the olden days, and now im riding happy in GM on both xbox, and PC playing zerker, and warlord. so before I start out I wanna disclose that I understand there is a HUGE controversy over PC/console balance... and I agree, PC does offer better frame rates, and connections that are very nice to reactionary play; however in actual context, both PC and console follow the same basic reaction rules \[500ms attack =reactable\] \[delayed 400ms attacks =unreactable\] it applies to both, so if you have issues with 500ms lights on console its either a lack of skill on your part... or a connection issue. that being said im constructed this based on the opinion of my friends (SG the number 1 goki on console, pharoh the number 1 JJ on PC and console), my own opinion and in-game facts. &amp;#x200B; 1. warden. this boi is strong, top of the tiers in duels and still incredibly high up in 4v4... the reasoning for this is that his only pressuring mixup and opener (shoulder bash) is both unreactable for the enemy, and reactable for the warden (when charged) this makes charged shoulder bash a extremely safe mixup, and using uncharged and early feints in mixture created a reliable, safe and powerful opener that can be used evasively as well as aggressively. wardens in a viable place now but I would propose a slight nerf to the charged bash feint... the bash can only be feinted up too 900ms of the 1200ms charge up... and to give back some power after this nerf, make charged bash HA startup earlier in the animation. &amp;#x200B; 2. conqueror. another strong boi! but not because of a diverse and interesting KIT... NO, he has a really good bash and that's all that carries him and the only viable part of his KIT. his full-block is better than warlords but its still not as good as it should be, his zone is good minion clear, and a semi-safe option select if you only use it once in a million years... his attacks are average speed but literally a walk in the park to parry if you throw more than whats guaranteed.... his unblockable pressure is really bad but can be mixed up with a bash, or a full-block for 4v4/ OOS bait. conq needs a few changes these should do good- he needs a better full-block startup upon entering, a small speed up will do him well. his heavies NEED GB vulnerability, conq makes really good turtle play and using the bash for 13 damage chip and this isn't fun for anyone... giving the bash 700ms recovery upon wiff would be perfect, if you make a read on which mixup he does... you should be able to punish. if he receives a nerf to the bash he needs other pressuring mixups to prevent turtling, speeding up his chain top light to 400ms, and speeding same side chain lights to NORMAL SPEED (why are they 700ms!?), and giving him the option to chain into an unblockable charge heavy in-chain. &amp;#x200B; 3. lawbringer. he's getting a rework soon so ima leave this one aside for now. &amp;#x200B; 4. mr. ROMAN. lets be honest cent is trash, no opener ( kick so damn reactable ), no chain pressure, no unreactable mixups. kicks viability isn't there... im not even gunna propose speeding it up, instead increase the time cent can chain into a heavy after a missed kick heavily... meaning if the cent see's his kick miss, he can throw a heavy/charged heavy reading the opponents read. (working same as tiandi palm strike). he needs better chains, make the chain punch 500ms... the 2nd chain light 400ms, and make him be able to soft feint his heavy at unblockable charge phase. why cant he feint his zone!? make this a thing. give him the ability to chain into punch on a wiffed attack. pretty much it for cent boi. &amp;#x200B; 5. gladiator. really cool in every way.... but just not good. chain toe stab 'within a certain number of MS after an attack lands' should be 500ms. it ends chain so make it worth it. chain lights should be fucking 500ms at least, I would make tops 400ms but its not required. remove sucker punch parry punish.... its useless. make his dodge punches (700ms sides) 500-600ms forward. it doesn't guarantee anything but it should be less reactable than it is... his side dodge lights need to be 600ms at the least because they don't even get punish half the time... and maybe even offer him a dodge soft feint out of them. give him the ability to dodge out of the recovery on his skewer on wiff. make toe stab recovery 600ms (it has no variable timing so you'll still get punish) &amp;#x200B; reddit will slap my dick if I continue so ima leave this as a part one, please tell me what you think and ill make another part or not."

237,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Bleach_Medicine's Orochi Rework Suggestions (roughly one year after last rework),49,bgn2oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bgn2oz/bleach_medicines_orochi_rework_suggestions/,2019-04-24 09:07:19,"Hello everyone. As someone with roughly 1000 hours on Orochi, I wanted to revisit my past thoughts of the Orochi rework after playing and using them for almost a full year. I've been part of many discussions regarding what he could use and what he lacks as a character. This is going to be rather lengthy, but before we get into my collected idea of an Orochi rework, I just wanted to inform others of the current tiers this character is placed in depending on game mode along with an explanation of the issues he has in each one. **Duels is Orochi's best game mode.** With that said, he is placed at mid C tier in duels as of late April, 2019. *Having no neutral openers and Medium/High damage on punishes, Orochi is very reliant on good defense and reads to defeat his opponent, forcing him to be a 'counter-attacker'. There are other characters, like Lawbringer and Raider before rework, that better fit this role with higher damage punishes or the ability to punish characters that Orochi normally cannot, (ie. Raider against Black Prior's neutral bashes). Despite these Characters having weak offense, even these characters are more suitable as counters than Orochi.* *With Storm Rush, opponents hold their guard on the fastest side and reaction block all other sides. This means the 700 ms top undodgeable is nearly useless and is essentially parry bait, as is the left side of storm rush if your opponents have at least average reaction times. After blocking Storm Rush, the opponent can back dodge roll any other attacks safely. The opponent could even wait for you to go into Storm Rush, turn away, lock back onto nothing, and successfully block every attack in Orochi's kit. Storm Rush mostly allows this because of the distance it creates from the opponent, making it a unique situation where a character with fast combo lights absolutely cannot land an attack.* **In Brawls, he is placed in mid C tier.** Orochi cannot open up external guards and is largely dependant on their teammate to achieve a successful hit on the opponent. He has medium recovery and low damage on his quicker punishes. In 1vx situations, he has few tools to safely get damage and his best aoe tool, zone attack, has high recovery and is frequently dodged and guard broken. **In general 4v4 game modes, he is placed in D tier** *He is not able to contribute to ganks other than setting up for other. Having no unblockable openers, he is easily external guarded in fights, can quickly feed revenge, has no revenge pressure himself, struggles in gank situations and in 1v1 situations, he lacks the ability to eliminate players before another person arrives.* With all of these issues acknowledged along with reading up on several ideas that were explored in Reddit, this is what I have come up with: **NOTE: ALL ATTACK SPEEDS IN THIS LIST OF CHANGES DO NOT CONSIDER LATENCY (ie. Orochi opener lights are 500ms without latency, 433ms with latency involved. Combo 2nd Lights without Latency are 400ms, 333ms with latency.)** **Stamina: Increase Stamina to 140 from 120.** *Stamina management on Orochi is terrible. Feints are too costly, paired with stamina drain from whiffs, blocks, and parries. It seems practical for an assassin to have a decent stamina pool, given they don't have a static guard.* **Recovery Cancels: Orochi can dodge out of recovery from light openers, heavy openers, combo lights, and light/heavy finishers.** *Currently, he can dodge recover out of combo finishers, but these are too easy to anticipate alone. Having more recovery cancels also allows Orochi to bait attacks what would punish his recoveries to open up potential dodge attacks, deflects, or guard break opportunities. Recovery cancels would not apply on special attacks like Storm Rush, Lightning Strike, Zephyr Strike, or Riptide Strike.* **Riptide Strike (back dodge attack): decrease guardbreak vulnerability to 100ms and allow players to combo attacks from a whiffed Riptide.** *This move has increased damage in comparison to his other dodge attacks at the cost of having no undodgeable properties and a strict input window as to not be able to delay the input in reaction to guardbreaks. It is also still a slow attack, but it has specific applications.* **Zephyr Strike (side dodge attacks): Increase the attack speed to 500ms (from 600ms)** *I don't mind the 300 ms startup, and the i-frames that can be chained from the attack are great. I just think that this attack is much too easy to parry and deflect as it sits at the moment.* **Lightning Strike (forward dodge attack): Increase attack speed to 500ms.** *Again, this is another attack that seems too easy to parry or deflect, given it has undodgeable properties. Light and heavy combos unchanged. I think these combos pair well with dodge cancel changes. **New Deflect Option: Static Fist** By pressing your 'guard break' button after a deflect, you will initiate a powerful punch in the gut that stops hyper-armor attack chains and deals 15 damage paired with 80 stamina damage. This can be chained into a combo 2nd light or combo 2nd heavy. *Orochi has some good damage options on his deflects, but he doesn't have any options against characters that have hyper-armor, so he is forced to trade or let a well-earned deflect punish go in risk of trying to parry another attack. Deflects are inherently high-risk, and I think this option is needed to combat characters that force trades.* **Storm Rush:** Left and Right attacks should both be 400ms. *With this change, top undodgeable can stay the same speed and still be useful, as there are now two sides to try blocking. This will make this pseudo opener more difficult to react to and bait more interruption attempts.* Storm Rush on landing stuns the opponent like the old Storm Rush from before, guaranteeing an attack that is 500ms or quicker. *Old storm rush was good in team fight modes not only because of the damage from the initial attack landing, but mainly because the stun from storm rush allowed their teammates to attack the stunned player. This was an effective way for Orochi to gank with teammates, and bringing this back would make him more useful in 2v2 and 4v4 game modes.* **New Move: Typhoon Kick** By holding your 'guard-break' button from Storm Rush, your move turns into a 400ms kick that tracks back dodges but has partially weak side dodge tracking. This guarantees a special light input that deals 20 damage and is a move that stun locks enemies before activating revenge (ie. Shaolin's Qi stance kick into light attack). *When an Orochi goes for Storm Rush, a lot of things are put into consideration. There is a factor of risk from initiating a storm rush, which includes interruption attacks, hyper-armor trades, dodge attacks, crushing counters, all guard counters, bulwark stance, and back dodges with guard on top (static guard characters). WITHOUT this move, opponents can fully external guard EVERYTHING from Storm Rush, even in 1v1 situations, since you can go out of lock, adjust your camera, and lock onto nothing to keep your focus off of the Orochi attacker. This move should be implemented as to also force opponents to make reads to this attack. That is what makes an opener and opener.* **Storm Rush damage from left and right directions increased to 20 (from 17) and from top direction at 23 (from 17).** * Similar reasons discussed earlier. The risk/reward factor needs to be in favor of Orochi for there to be incentive in using this move for anything other than baiting for punishes, and that includes damage. *In short, for a rework to be successful, a character needs to be able to press buttons. You know, because pressing buttons is fun when you can do that.* Hopefully, you agree with some of these changes. I have put a lot of thought into this list of potential changes after playing Orochi for as long as I have. Please share this post with others and spread the discussion. Thank you for reading all the way through!"
238,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,In defense of Lawbringer: why his rework isn't as bad as people make it out to be,396,bheenp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bheenp/in_defense_of_lawbringer_why_his_rework_isnt_as/,2019-04-26 07:52:45,"As I'm sure everyone has noticed, people have been complaining left and right about the Lawbringer rework, saying that it wasn't good, that he got ""butchered,"" etc. While there are certainly problems with it, there are still many upsides to it that people don't seem to be talking about. **1. His mid-chain shove is now 500ms, making it unreactable.** Lawbringer's shove can now be done on whiff or block, confirms a light, and is now 500ms, which means it is *unreactable* and must be dodged on prediction. It should be obvious to everyone how having an unreactable bash in your kit is good; as long as he can punish the dodges with a light/heavy/gb, it'll be a great addition to his kit. **2. His unblockable heavies are easier to get to and their range has been increased, potentially eliminating the problem with walking/backdodging away.** Lb's unblockable heavies suffered from being easy to shut down and difficult to access, basically making them useless. In the patch notes, it was mentioned that their range had been increased, which could eliminate the problem of walking/backdodging away (of course, this is Ubi, so it very well may not work correctly). Not only that, but they're also easier to get to, which will help greatly. **3. Lawbringer is still great at ganking in 2s and 4s.** Long arm may have been nerfed, but it's still a useful ganking tool, and his running impale is still as strong as ever. As long as your ganking partner isn't a chimpanzee, his ganking potential is still very strong. **4. His 400ms top light combined with the guard switch changes may give him a decent feint game up close, and his side lights still have good utility.** Due to the new change to guard switching, which allows static guard heros to attack in different directions faster, Lb's new 400ms top light may actually give him a decent feint game, being able to feint his attacks into an unreactable top attack. Of course, this would only really work up close due to the light's short range, but it's still a good option. His side lights being 500ms and enhanced isn't a game changer, but it's still a good change. I've seen people say ""people will just parry them,"" but as long as you effectively mix them up with side heavies they should only be parryable on prediction. **5. His zone is now 700ms, giving him a usable zone parry option select.** His zone's speed got buffed to 700ms, which *should* mean it has low enough gb vulnerability that feint into guardbreak won't work on it. It's not neccessarily good compared to other, faster zone parries, but it's still a good tool to have. **6. He still has the potential for super high damage off a parry, and the buff to his zone followup makes him even stronger in group fights.** Lawbringer still has very high damage off his parries. His light and zone followups give a confirmed 20+ damage off a heavy parry, his top heavy followup still does really good damage and drains a decent amount of stamina due to the stun, and he can still get crazy damage off a heavy parry with his impale followup. Not only that, but his zone followup is now unblockable, making him much more powerful in groupfights and antiganks. Overall, the rework makes a lot of good changes that should make Lawbringer much more viable and fun. There are still some things that need changing (long arm is still ass in 1v1s), but I'd say he'll be a decent mid-tier character after the changes. That is, of course, if everything works the way it's supposed to (you always gotta take ubi-jank into consideration)."

JJ was a 4v4 powerhouse but he fell off easy in 1v1... and shaolin was the first 10/10 hero design since berserkers rework... &amp;#x200B; after the disappointing shugoki/valkarie changes that were improvements but missed the mark of 'viable' really far for shugoki and valk needed a simple 100ms speed increase to bring her up that last push. &amp;#x200B; and now we are blessed with what I consider the BEST hero release, and the 2 best reworks since berserkers way back... lets list off effectively what they did. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **1.Lawbringer.** *as my OG main and my personal favorite hero from a personality standpoint my hype was through the roof as was my fear.* 1. one of the biggest changes they made to LB, was the removal of block-shove... a requirement but technically a nerf to his already shameful KIT... 2. to compensate the removal of his only 'offense' they gave him a plethora of small quality of existence improvements that I consider pretty good. 3. adding the 400ms top light from neutral and 2nd in-chain, this gives him some speedy interrupt for some moves... it brings focus to the top and AWAY from the sides adding more viability to side lights, and this does increase the viability of his unlock 'impale/top light' mixup its not good enough to be abused but it is a trump card good enough to be used. 4. enhanced side-lights are his MAIN opening offense by the looks of it...neutral shove looks the same speed as it is now meaning it is NOT a viable opener... not a great means of offense in my opinion but his power lies in his chains now-a-days. 5. with a fix on his et-mortem unblockable making it not 'safe' on back dodge means he has pressure with it BIG pressure... and with enhanced side-lights, and shove guaranteeing the light-into unblockable this will be used more frequently. 6. shove on-block is removed but chain-shove WASNT... after any heavy (missed, blocked OR landed) he can access the 500ms chain back, guaranteeing a light and transferring into unblockable finisher. the 500ms bash to play with in-chain is to be respected, but it doesn't seem like there is a mixup to be used along with-it other than maybe, chain heavy/unblockable finisher (which will track, and punish a prediction dodge of the chain-shove). 7. chain starting on his parry punished 'especially light repost' means he will be able to play with these already pressuring chains while your stunned... solid but not amazing. *and that's about it for LB changes, solid and undeniably improvements to his prior self... but we'll have to wait and see the juicy details in-game before I make a full and final judgement on the rework...* &amp;#x200B; **2.raider.** *didn't really touch raider much in 1v1, played him for 45 reps in competitive 4v4... due to his damage, feats, cleave, and CC power. this was obviously mainly focused on improving 1v1 game so im not going to consider the 'crashing charge' nerf.* 1. pretty much what everyone expected was all raider's light attacks are 500ms... a positive but not nutty improvement. 2. his heavies received HA along with his zone attack, a MUCH NEEDED change and bringing his viability further up the ladder. 3. another expected change was the increase on the stunning tap attack... its 500ms now meaning it with its variable timing will be much better and if he lands one... his mixup of this becomes comparatively unreactable until said stun wears off. another good change. 4. a unexpected change was the change on zone attack side depending on its variant... an OK but not really an improvement. 5. the GB soft feint on his heavies is a godsend... raider had some HARD feint recovery meaning attempting even the medicore 'feint-GB' on an opponent would often bounce off if they had 200ms vulnerability heavies.... a good change but nothing drastic. 6. damage changes are a definite plus as I expect more heavies will be landing due to stunning taps speed increase and if they are already stunned... those punish numbers being higher is a positive change. *raider didn't need a drastic change, but these should most certainly bring him to viability... not S tier duels god... but a viable choice.* &amp;#x200B; **3. yato.** *when compared to black prior on a kit design standpoint this guy is the creampie pressuring but not obsurd mixups some bash timing to play with mid-chain, constant OOS unblockable pressure... and what appears to be a 400ms chain light that finishes but accessable any time.* 1. well 600ms chain heavies all carrying HA, that each and every one can be charged into unblockable pressure and mixed up accordingly, is nuthouse for parry timings and wears on opponent reaction fatigue. 2. what appears to be a 400ms chain light that does end the chain, but carries HA and is another addition to his parry time pressuring KIT. 3. a 600ms bash that restarts the chain and guarantees free damage if they get too focused on blocking and parrying and get hit. that can ALSO be charged into what appears to be a 1000ms sweep that would track bad dodges... and can ALSO be feinted early in the chargeup, not unreactable for an opponent im sure but another bit of pressure to be used. *a simple concept... but in practice it should be effective, variable timed bashes, feintable bashes, variable timing attacks... constant block focus, constant HA, and unblockable mixups we're looking at a pretty solid hero simple but effective...* &amp;#x200B; that's just my opinion... its not perfect but a step forward for the dev's and brings BIG hope for the future of this game. &amp;#x200B; the only thing that makes me upset about the update is that the new hero's KIT design.... IS EXACTLY WHAT SHUGOKI COULD HAVE BEEN.... but past reworks and releases are in the past.... and this underfunded team is making drastic improvements, I look forward to playing LAWBRINGER and the new hero live on may 2nd. &amp;#x200B; id love to hear all your opinions and complaints but as the title stated... the opinions of new or bad players is appreciated... but someone who complains about shugoki light spam isn't someone who should be trusted when it comes with in-game balance and hero construction. &amp;#x200B; thank you all!"

Heavy -&gt; Heavy Added Heavy -&gt; Heavy -&gt; Light * **This will help tremendously with his base mixups now that law wont be super predictable with his restricted chains he now has more options to mix people up these chains will help a ton in casual play but have less impact in high level play, but are a nice option when combined with whats next** * **while he didn't get a Light -&gt; Light combo directly he really doesn't need that type of chain to create his pressure** * **The addition of a heavy after the first heavy also means the followup light is no longer Easy parries anymore, the enemy will have to decide weather the followup light will be a light or heavy slowing down reaction times enough to make it serviceable in higher play , and alot better in casual play.** --- Light Attacks **Side Lights are no longer interrupted on Block** **Side Light Attack Opener Strikes are now 500ms (from 600ms)** * These two changes are really good, as laws side lights from neutral carry a similar enough animation, this will make it hard for people to tell if its going to be either a heavy or a light, and simply blocking those lights wont stop his chain pressure, letting him followup with a heavy, into the mind-games that they give access too (and since the side light is not interrupted on block you cant simply back-dodge the followup heavy anymore to avoid it. * In casual play this will really mess with players, and they will often make more mistakes , in higher level play since the startup animations are similar to the heavy , and simply blocking it wont stop his chains, this means you will be more encouraged to go for parries, this also means law can mix and match the side lights and heavies to create some neutral mind games * On a side note since the side lights aren't interrupted on block they also do 3 chip damage for the first and second side lights, and 4 for the finisher side lights its worth noting because chip does add up over time, even if its minimal. --- **Top Light Attack Opener Strike is now 400ms (from 500ms)** **Top Light Attack Opener Strike range is slightly reduced** **2nd Top Light Strike is now 400ms (from 500ms)** * The first top light will be an extremely useful counter move, using it to boop people on read out of alot of stuff, shaolin already does this and it helps his kit, it also forces people to block top in teamfights if they are locked to him opening them up to attacks from the side. * Reducing the range of it I'm curious to how it works but from what I seem to understand its to prevent it from sliding around the ground and it being too oppressive in team-fights/ganks if you hang a hair back to interrupt attacks from a safer range. * The second top light being 400 ms is a nice option, but I don't see it being that big of a deal when fighting 1v1 but in team fights or 1vx it could be a good counter-pressure tool to prevent people from trying to interrupt your chain, especially since he can target swap at any point to hit you , the notes don't mention that the range was nerfed so it will have decent tracking and I don't see it being parried often either. **Light Attack Finisher Strikes are now 500ms (from 700ms)** * this is a big buff for the number, but in a 1v1 this will be inferior to the unblock-able mixup in most situations, however if you do land the second top heavy this is a decent option because the blind from top heavy hides the animation/indicator for long enough that you will have to make a guess on what to do next unless you are prepared for him to light * This also will be good for team fighting as a means to hit somebody who wasn't expecting you, this will see limited use unless its recovery is low however so heres hoping it has a decent recovery so that it still has a use --- Heavy Attacks **All Heavy Finishers are now Unblockable. (We have done this by standardizing all chains to always end with the Unblockable option)** * This is really nice because if you land any shove ,it confirms the second light in a chain, allowing you to go right into the unblockable mixup --- **Side Heavy Finisher Strikes are now 900ms (they were 800 or 1100ms depending on the chains branchings you used to get to the finisher)** * This is a change I see alot of people misunderstand, the 800 ms heavies where the blockable side heavy in the HLH chain, so trading speed for giving the person a reason to risk parrying/dodging the move is good change in my opinion. * This also buffs the laws unblockable in general because all his old unblockables used to be 1100 ms, so you could dodge it as soon as you seen orange, and be safe from guardbreak after feint, this no longer works as the feint comes much sooner than before. * They also wont suffer from a god awefull 600 ms guardbreak vulnerability, meaning you cant dodge the second heavy and gb out of the followup **All Heavy Finishers have slightly increased forward movement** * This one stacked onto the speedbuff might make it so simply backdodging wont negate the mixups from feint(I hope), this will also help in team fights giving more range to the finisher to strike at unexpected angles with target swapping. --- Damage **Increased Top Light Finisher damage to 20 (from 15)** **Increased Side Light Finishers damage to 18 (from 15)** **Increased Top Heavy Finisher damage to 40 (from 35)** **Increased Side Heavy Finishers damage to 38 (from 30)** * These patchnotes are abit deceiving here, the unblockable finishers from the LHH chain are nerfed down (side specifically is the real nerf to 38 from 45) The extra speed makes up for the damage decrease, also the top heavy isnt as messed with and was in fact buffed as we will see later. * Blind justice was also 38 damage according to the stream demo they showed * His swift justice finisher was also buffed to 12 damage but not mentioned in the websites patch notes but we have seen it on live stream * Hhe finisher light damage is also not bad, the top will be good damage for interrupts on enemy team , and also goes well with the blind from top heavy beforehand giving it some use (especially after his oos parry punish) --- Swift Justice Finisher **Swift Justice Finisher is now available after landing any Top Heavy Finisher or Blind Justice** * this makes up for the damage loss with the top heavy finisher ,bumping it up to 52 damage, blind justice also got buffed to 50 damage 50 DAMAGE, that means law can 3 shot any class with only 3 light parries. * the shove changes also will create a small dynamic for more damage potential or taking confirmed damage and ending the chain there. this will largely depend on players playstyle and the context that he is in --- Long Arm **Can now be interrupted by other players** * this is good, this now means you have to time your punish in synch with laws longarm so that you both can get the damage in, this also means law ganks arent a death sentence --- Impaling Charge / Impaling Riposte **Can now be interrupted by other players** **Decreased Impaling Charge damage to 10 (from 15)** * this is also good, laws impaling charge is a very strong tool, it is able to catch rollers by unlock sprint attack, aswell as it also makes it tricky to run away from a law gank especially considering any wallsplat will confirm the longarm **Decreased Impaling Riposte damage to 10 (from 20)** * this change directly nerfs his max heavy parry punish to 40 damage with a wall, the damage confirm is way too high for simply a heavy parry still however * I am disappointing they didn't touch the stamina cost on block/parry that was simply way too high in my opinion and should have been brought down to a reasonable level. --- Shove **Shove now causes a normal Light Bump reaction** **Developer comments: This means that Shove, and Shove Mix Up guarantee a free Light Attack.** * this perhaps one of best things to give law, now that shove confirms the followup light, he will be able to go right into the unblockable finisher for immediate pressure * shove from dodges speed wasnt changed, however now that it does confirm a light this means law can punish bashes now , one of his biggest weaknesses was his difficulty doing so * The natural hyperarmor on dash shove also makes so that he can use it to hit trade some moves on read one example or in some cases just doing it one example of this i can think of is always doing dash shove on a shaolin qi stance mixup, if shaolin does a heavy to the side, he can trade 30 damage for 15 into the unblockable mixup, on the surface its a negative trade but the pressure his unblockable has can grant law alot of potential damage vs the fairly squishy shaolin . * stack this and its low recovery means law has a fiarly safe counterattacking option/trading option only offset by the fact that its slow so its a bad opener. * shove could have been spedup a little bit but the fact that it can punish bashes now makes it a strong tool for counterattack ,not so much for offense. --- Shove Mix Up ** Shove Mix Up (after a Heavy Attack Hit) can now be done after a Block or a Miss** **Shove Mix Up is now 500ms (from 300ms)** ** Shove Mix Up now has Super Armor during the Strike** * This is the meat of his rework, he loses on the mixup after shove and turning the shove itself into the mixup a 500 ms bash is hard for most everyone to dodge, especially with other options that the law can do, this also makes laws normal heavies a threat, meaning people will have to try to parry it, or risk the mixup. * The potential of these changes is what will make or break law in the rework, he will have alot of mixups not just because of the shove itself but because the way feints work aswell, meaning you can use the feint to top light work since you generally * whats interesting about the note is how they called it superarmor during the strike, the devs do use it with hypearmor alot so confusion is abound, however what really sparks my interest is because [it already had hypearmor in the current build](URL i have also used it to some effect in teamfights to prevent me from being inturrupted * if shove mixup truly does have superarmor , he can use it to trade with dodge into bash after a wiffed heavy like he will be able to do with dodge attacks (depending on the timing of the attacks i assume) this further increases the incentive to try to parry his heavies . --- Light Riposte **Now branches to 2nd Light Attack (as well as 2nd Heavy Attack as usual)** * this is a great change as it now takes advantage of the blind the light riposte has , meaning if he goes for the light, and you eat it or block the second one, you will be forced to go through the unblockable mixup itself * on top of this, if they only block the side light, they will eat 3 chip damage totaling up to 23 from a heavy parry (this is more than new make way for less stamina cost) --- Make Way **Is now Unblockable** **Reduced damage to 22 (from 25)** **Has increased Knockback **Hit Reaction caused is now Medium (was Heavy). This prevents Zone Attack into Guard Break from failing * a good all round buff with a minor nerf in damage, this will help his survival quite a bit aswell as allow him to give himself breathing room when getting ganked if he lands a parry, it also has next to zero recovery currently making it a safe parry option in teamfights aswell --- Zone Attack **Zone Attack Strike is now 700ms (from 900ms)** **Zone Attack now has a 200ms parry window (from 400ms)** **Hit Reaction caused is now Medium (was Heavy). This prevents Zone Attack into Guard Break from failing** * zone being 700 ms gives law a potential option select to beat feint to guardbreak, this really is a good mindgame tool. * this also helps his minion clear, aswell * now i didnt know the parry window for it was 400 ms, thats really dumb that it was so its good its fixed now * the hit reaction being abit smaller will counteract the knockback abit, the flow into guardbreak is just a quality of life update so i dont see it getting much use unless there is something else to it that the patch notes havent told us but i dobut it URL Out of lock lock attacks also all come from the right preventing a really dumb 50/50 keep away game, this isnt on the websites patch notes but on the Uplay patch notes ------- **FINAL NOTES** * Overall i think the rework will go alot better than the panic people have worked themselves into * the kit has good synergy with itself, on top of that laws oos game will be much better * his harsh judgement feat will now have good synergy with his kit as harsh judgement, also buffs laws shove stamina damage/ and longarms stamina damage on top of slowing stamina regeneration for a Tier 1 thats not bad , but minion healing will always outshine it unless they absolutely gut that feat * Longarm isnt 100% useless because it still would be confirmed after guardbreak for stamina damage despite this his longarm is just way too slow for normal neutrual play, however it still will be an great ganking tool. * Impaling charge aswell should of had its stamina cost when blocked reduced to a reasonable number, if the opponent parries it he will be put oos aswell, this is just too much stamina cost, i dont mind the high stamina cost on a successful impaling charge this does mean law cant spam it over and over in ganks and has a waiting period before he can do it again. * His max heavy parry punish with a wall is still too high, 40 damage will 3 shot most classes in the game especially combined with the pressure the heavy confirm gives law, potentially being more than his light parry punish thanks to the blind and the mixups working together * Law will still be a defensive powerhouse, thanks to his high hp aswell, and the added chain game will make him a very nasty duelist and potentially a good team fighter * Overall i think this rework will put law in a good place but it does depend on how good the shove mixup becomes i dont feel like law was gutted at all considering most of his kit was just outright buffed."
241,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,a better look at LB rework.,34,bihhuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bihhuj/a_better_look_at_lb_rework/,2019-04-29 09:27:42,"well the most common opinion of lawbringers new rework is ""its trash"". &amp;#x200B; this opinion is developed mostly by people with the sheep herd mentality just repeating what someone said before them... not saying this is the best rework since berserker's, but the point of a 'rework' is to improve upon the hero... and his rework HAS obviously done that. &amp;#x200B; none of us have had a chance to feel out his rework in-game yet but this is every single piece of change that the reveal shows us viewed in maticulous detail... seriously i no-life watched that frame by frame like 20 times... &amp;#x200B; first lets list off the big changes... 1. **new chains (heavy-heavy-heavy) and (heavy-heavy-light).** *alone these changes dont serve much purpose... but with the update every heavy finisher from LB is the ET MORTEM unblockable...these new chains will add more variety in methods to reach this unblockable pressure... aswell as more attacks to mix-in his new shove.* 2. **removal of block:shove and replacement of 500ms chain-shove (accessable after any heavy attack missed, blocked or hit.).** *removal of the best turtles tool in the game... replacement with a offensive mid-chain mixup tool that guarantees the follow-up light and fluently flows into ET MORTEM finisher mixup.* 3. **forward movement added to ET MORTEM unblockable.** *this change means that his unblockable pressure is NO LONGER 100% avoidable on back-dodge... this buffs him substantially now that access to his unblockable mixup is much much easier.* 4. **400ms top-light... and enhanced 500ms side lights (both chain AND neutral side-lights are enhanced).** *with the change to guard swap/attack delay for static guard heros... LB will be able to feint mixup similar to shaolin with equal efficiency... the 500ms side-lights which are enhanced in both CHAIN and neutral make for safe usage, less trutleability... and further ease of access to his pressuring chains and UNBLOCKABLE's.* 5. **neutral shove speed increase by 100ms.** *probably will still be MAD reactable but ok i guess... neutral shove isnt supposed to be a high pressure OPENING mixup...as a defensive hero LB will be using his neutral shove as a safety tool... increased HA startup make neutral shove a means of trading, and the move has 100ms GB vulnerability so its a safe option for dodging attacks with GB mixups.* 6. **LB can now continue his flow of chain on a missed shove.** *similar to valkarie, LB can fluently continue his chain on a missed shove... thats a 400ms top-light... 500ms enhanced side light... OR any direction of heavies that he can pressure you with EVEN if you dodge it successfully.* 7. **long arm speed is increased by 300ms** *it was technically nerfed for less gankability... and the 300ms speed increase leaves it at 700ms which is still reactable as night and day...however... this makes it easier to land in coordinated ganks and team fights. aswell as LONG arm having decreased recovery... i dont have exact frame stats, but it appears to be 800ms AT THE MAX (probably less) this means though from neutral LONGarm isnt gunna land, however it might not be punishable by GB.* 8. **ET MORTEM finisher is 100ms faster.** *this increase is for one thing... you can no-longer safely light attack him out of it with a 500ms light. (400ms attacks can safely).* 9. **increased damage, and guaranteed double tap on any top-heavy finisher.** *not much so say here, its just a quality of life thing.* 10. **make way zone parry punish.. is now unblockable and neutral zone is now 700ms.** *the change to the parry punish is simply to increase LB's anti-gank potential and crowd control... the neutral zone speed increase isn't a big deal or a drastic improvement... but this does mean it's a semi-reliable option select parry with only 100ms GB vulnerability.* 11. **light reposte now chains into a chain-light.** *with side-lights being enhanced this means one thing.... if he lands a heavy parry... he's preactically GUARANTEED access to his unblockable pressure due to stun, and safe side-lights in succession.* 12. **more range on heavies... less range on top-light.** *nothing huge but his heavy attacks have noticably MORE forward movement and tracking... and they nerfed the reach of the top-light slightly as its 400ms and if it had current range it could punish alot of hero's offense with high safety.* &amp;#x200B; and thats about it for the changes... &amp;#x200B; reviewing all of this and if you see anything that you may have missed what is your opinion on the rework from a visual standpoint? &amp;#x200B; we haven't seen it in practice and we haven't seen how all the animations and mixups look from an opponent perspective so the opinions now are only 50% of the knowledge... &amp;#x200B; if you take all these into consideration he has mixups now... he has anti-gank and crowd control...his CC isnt as strong as it is now... with all these changes LB has defensive option selects with neutral shove being slightly faster it means he wont have to trade with chain- followups if he dodges an attack... with its 100ms GB vulnerability this is a safe and unpunishable option select dodge for hard-feint AND soft feint mixups... &amp;#x200B; with having some defenive tools that are counterable but not highly, he is still lawbringer at heart... but with improved unblockable pressure, more chains, 400ms top light, enhanced side-lights, a 500ms chain bash accessable on any heavy conditioned (guaranteed on a landed unblockable), can continue chain pressure on a missed bash, lower stam costs, increased damage, guaranteed damage on shove, unblockable pressure after shove-light/heavy, and improved cleave and CROWD CONTROL.......... &amp;#x200B; LB also has offensive ability.... weather this is the S tier berserker level amazing god's glory rework that you wanted or NOT.... &amp;#x200B; these are without a doubt improvements to lawbringer, and without a doubt improvements for the devs... as this is a MASSIVE up-step from the disapointment that was shugoki's rework. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; this is a controvercial subject and i encourage discussion and opinions in the comments, i will respond to any questions, ideas, or crituique.

242,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,The fastest way to get For Honor closer to being fixed is to examine and re-evaluate a few key timings.,286,bjgozk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bjgozk/the_fastest_way_to_get_for_honor_closer_to_being/,2019-05-01 22:49:11,"In my opinion: ## No finisher attack should take a hero longer than 800ms to recover from, and many should be faster - 800ms grants the opponent a dodge&gt;GB, even on the latest possible dodge timing, hence this being a good rule for an *absolute maximum* - Too many heroes never use their finishers, despite them usually carrying theoretically cool mix-ups, because dodging is a great way to confirm a punish whilst avoiding many options, and hardfeint&gt;GB is often unreliable - Lower recovery finishers insensitivise opponents to use dodge attacks, which carry a better risk/reward ratio for the attacker ## Any cancelable attack slower than 700ms should have a variable hardfeint window, and many softfeints from long attacks also need variable activation windows - The 100ms GB vulnerability of 700ms heavies is a very strong advantage, and it often feels like the only way to make slower attacks as useable is to imbue then with special properties like armour or softfeints - A common problem, visibly demonstrated by the recent LB rework, is that back-dodging away from long animations will often space the player outside of the attacks range, whilst the attacker must wait to feint until it's too late to GB. This will help reduce instances of this frustration - It is too easy to interrupt theoretically fun and engaging tools, with Kensei's opener being the most visible example (at least to me). Allowing earlier softfeints allows Kensei to deal with this more effectively - Having less consistent feint points might make it harder for top players to react to feints, but this is only a hypothesis ## The input window for unlock roll should end at 200ms into the dodge - The defender must therefore decide whether they are dodging or rolling by the time their i-frames would come up from an empty dodge - This leaves a very tight reaction window for reliably avoiding damage from melee mix-ups like Shug's and Highlander's, that I do not believe anyone will be able to execute consistently against delayed softfeints - The option to roll from a feat smoothly from a locked state is left intact ----- This wouldn't fix the game completely, but I think duels at least would be immeasurably improved with these changes implemented. Thoughts?"
243,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Lawbringer Changes on Inspection,27,bk9fnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bk9fnu/lawbringer_changes_on_inspection/,2019-05-04 00:59:25," Lawbringer remains the Jack of all trades, and the master of none. The biggest change to Lawbringer is that he can arrive at his issues faster in combat now, while receiving little in the way to compensate. He may have more chain mixup potential, but accessing these mixups is as difficult as before. While the Lawbringer might be more combatativly potent than before, he is in a worse state. A situation made all the more frustrating when improvements that lawbringer needed, were given to other characters. The reasons Lawbringer was denied these changes or improvements was never really stated. What must be understood is that Lawbringer is by no means the best at anything he does. He is not the best at punishing parries, he is not the best at attacking, he is not the best at mixups. Ultimately Lawbringer is rather irrelevant in Year 3. What he has is a high health pool. Health that doesn't last long now that his defensive capabilities have been reduced. The changes done to Lawbringer sound good on paper, and in a fight they are good. However, this does not mean that Lawbringer benefits from them, or can use them as well as other cast members can. Lawbringer mechanically and by design is still not as effective as he was before. His drawbacks of stamina, and difficulty reaching his unblock/finishers remain fatal flaws in his design. All the while other heros have similar chains and movesets, but with tools to offset the flaws. Yet lawbringer does not. His offense remains functionally the same, only now his defense as been weakened. Lawbringer can choose to turtle and hide, or risk everything on the hope he can kill his opponent before his limited stamina kills him. Ultimately he has not been fixed as a hero in the game. Lawbringer remains a relic of the past, easily forgotten, and hopped to be forgotten by the developers. **Changes to shove** First and foremost, Shove on block needed to go. The only times I ever used Shove on block were to shut down light spamming opponents who effectively shut Lawbringer down by attacking. It needed to go, but Lawbringer should have recieved something in exchange. More on this later The biggest change to shove was making it a flat time across all uses, and the confirmed light after a shove. There is no more shove on hit. While shove on a miss is a welcome change, the lack of a fast shove on hit removes and sense of momentum Lawbringer had. He can no longer pressure opponents after a successful hit with a confirmed shove into mixup. Instead Lawbringer is now expected to continue to throw out naked attacks. Most of which are still parried quite easily. **Changes to lights and heavies and chains** Another welcome change to the Lawbringer's kit is the superior lights. While good on paper, and a 400ms top light might sound like an opener, it does little to help Lawbringer. Lawbringer has no light chains, so all superior lights do is allow Lawbringer to initiate his Heavy chain, or throw a heavy feint. Both of which are easily reactable. At worst, punishable Heavy attacks being faster is another good change. However these attacks remain easily parried, and mechanically do not differ from before. They have the same vulnerabilities they did when they were 800 and 700ms. Once again, another welcome change is Lawbringer's now Unblockable Heavy chain finishers, as well as the blind justice finishers. What remains a problem is is accessing these attacks, as well as landing them remains as difficult as before. In this there have been no changes. Lawbringer remains vulnerable. **Changes to CC elements** Inline with many other changes, Lawbringer received nerfs to his Impaling charge and Long Arm. While these changes are not bad, Lawbringer gained little from them. The damage increase to Impailing charge is good, but nothing about the move's drawbacks were touched on. Compared to Raider's Stampeede charge, impaling charge ( and impaling riposte) offers more drawbacks to Lawbringer than benifits. Stampede charge drains opponents stamina, and will send them into a stunned state if there is a wall impact. Impaling charge will render the Lawbringer with little under a third of his stamina remaining. Enough for a follow up attack, but then Lawbringer is useless in the fight for the next few seconds. If it is blocked Lawbringer cannot initiate an attack otehrwise he will go into the Out of Stamina State. If it is parried he enters OOS. Conversely Stampede charge offers little to no drawback for the raider. It presents him with a GB vulnerability if it is dodged, and the charge ends nearby. Arguably Raider benifits more from essentially the same move mechanically. Long arm is another move in the Lawbringer's kit that has little use to him. It is more dangerous to Lawbrinegr than any other character. While Shugoki's Demon's Embrace, Or Shaman's bite offer a similar mechanic, those characters reap a reward if landed properly. Shugoki regains health and stamina, and Shaman regains health. Lawbringer receives no benefit. He may land a side heavy, and potentially a top light. This will render Lawbringer low on Stamina as well. It's nerf is understandable, as it is a powerful tool in gang up situations. However it received nothing in compensation. Nor was it buffed as ubisoft stated they wanted to improve the weaker parts of a heroes kit rather than nerf strong tools. Ubisoft Nerfed the weakest tool in Lawbringer's kit, going against their own claims. **Stamina limitations** Since the beginning of the game, Lawbringer had a diminutive stamina pool. Lower than the average. While the pool itself might have been large, his move costs made it minuscule. Early renditions of the game almost required Lawbringer's use Stamina cost reduction gear stats. With the changes in his design, lawbringer is expected to throw out more attacks, with the same stamina costs, and pool. This forces Lawbringer OOS faster then before. If one of his reactable heavies is parried he is out even faster. This forces Lawbringer to become more defensive than before, as he is punished for sustaining the offensive. Lawbringer's will find themselves out of stamina more often in fights. With little tools to defend himself in this state, Lawbringer is in a worse state than he went into the changes. It is better for a Lawbringer player to remain defensive and not initiate any kind of attack untill it is guaranteed, gather a few hits, then resume a defensive stance. Moreso than in his previous design. Stamina was not addressed in his redesign and it remains his single most glaring flaw. With no OOS recovery mechanics. Lawbringer must balance pressing an offense, or remaining entirely defensive. He cannot sustain an offense like the developers thought they had designed him. It is more advantageous for the Lawbringer to wait for his confirmed light, and stop than to do anything else. **Initiating and openers** Lawbringer remains unable to pressure his opponents into a reaction. While Top Light may strike an unaware opponent, or a side light might land, the follow-up heavies are more risky. Feinting will only exacerbate his limited stamina pool, allowing two or three hits before Lawbringer must turtle up again. While defensive, he lacks any decent means to force a reaction. This has not changed from the previous build. After the first couple top lights, an opponent with situational awareness will simply block top, and negate Lawbringer's offense. It is possible for him to press with side lights, or a heavy feint mixup, but these still come with risk to Lawbringer. Other characters have certain traits or abilities to lessen these risks. e.g. The stunning ability of Raider's stunning tap, or Hitokiri's hyper armor. Lawbringer throws out his attacks with the hope they do not get parried. Any decent player will understand Lawbringer's limitations and see through any attempt to fient. Lawbringer simply cannot force a reaction the same way other heroes can without the use of a bash. **Hyper Armor arguments** The basis for Lawbringer requiring hyper armor has nothing to do with his physical character model. Lawbringer's need for HA comes from the ability to shut down his offense by attacking him. Lawbringer is meant to be a counter attacker. Originally he had shove on block to initiate his counter attacks. With this removed, Lawbringer stand entirely vulnerable to fast attacking foes. Hyper Armor on his heavy attacks would allow a means to stop or trade with an opponent. The argument that Lawbringer is not meant to trade is made less credible with the use of HA on shove. Here, Lawbringer is expected to trade with an opponent, it is the reason behind the move. What HA on his heavies, and heavy finishers would accomplish is forcing an opponents reaction, much in the way that HA on Hitokiri's heavy attacks is meant to force a reaction. As well if an opponent chose to try and shut lawbringer down with light attacks, they will land their damage, but not be successful. This changes the dynamic of his heavy attacks from simply attacks in his chains, to attacks that force an opponent to react to him, either by parries or dodges to avoid chip damage or trade damage. It will allow a greater range of mix-up potential for Lawbringer, as well as increased survivability in team-up situations, since his shove on hit was removed. With this simple addition it takes away the issues Shove on Block presented, while maintaining the spirit of what Lawbringer is. A counter-Attacker. **Comparison to other cast members** Lawbringer is not unique, nor is he the best at his intended role. Mechanically Lawbringer is inferior to his peers. He does not have the staying power to fight with heavies. He does not have the flexibility to shut down mix-up heroes. He doesn't have the defensive ability to outclass a Vanguard. Lawbringer was always a toolless toolbox. While his new design does grant him a few benefits, they were not where Lawbringer was having the most issues. His light attacks are the same speed as Jiang Jun's however he lacks the mixup of Jiang Jun's Lights into heavy unblockable, or Light into Light. He lacks Jiang Jun's stamina regeneration. While Lawbringer can now more regularly punish bash opening heroes. he does not debilitate like Black Prior and his Bulwark Stance. His heavies are more accessible, but they are not nearly guaranteed like Hitokiri's or Shugoki's with Hyper armor. **Humble suggestions** While the speed changes to his kit are welcome, they don't fix his problems. meerley put finer dressing on top of it. What should be proposed are the following: Hyper armor on Heavies and Heavy finishers. This will allows Labringers more vulnerable moves to at least trade, rather than be shut down, negating his access to Unblockables. Side Heavies given the undodgeable property. Combined with Hyper armor, it only give the options of take chip damage, or parry. Forcing a reaction that can be exploited with a feint into parry, or feint into mixup. Top Heavies have increased forward attack range, catching back dodges. With this change it will negate Lawbringer's weakness to back dodges, while remaining counterable, and feitnable. Tracking on Long Arm to catch side dodges. This will allow Long Arm to become viable as a mixup tool for Lawbringer. It is still weak against back dodges, but it no longer presents a risk to Lawbringer if missed, granting a free guard break. 400ms Shove on hit 500ms shove on miss. Remove damage from shove This will allow Lawbringer to pressure opponents while being offensive. While not making it a tool to add damage. &amp;#x200B; Lawbringer remains the Jack of all trades, and the master of none. The biggest change to Lawbringer is that he can arrive at his issues faster in combat now, while recieving little in the way to compensate. He may have more chain mixup potential, but accessing these mixups is as difficult as before. Lawbringer remains punishable, and difficult to play with. After playing him through 65 reps, I must say, I am having more trouble playing this character now than ever before. Lawbringer wasn't reworked, He was undone."
244,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"A standard, default offence",0,bkpgmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/bkpgmh/a_standard_default_offence/,2019-05-05 06:30:56,"So, one of the main problems with this game is the either too weak standard offence or too powerful defence, you can look at this either way. The offensive tools given to a hero by default are very underwhelming. What this post aims to do is present changes to the game that would (hopefully) give everyone a good- or at least passable - offence by default, since the only offence in this game comes from special moves or unique frame data that more often than not simply bypass the core mechanics of the art of battle system. This post aims to make the standard tools viable, I.e lights, heavies, guardbreaks. With that out the way, Ill get started. #guardbreak changes:  all heavy attacks now have a standard of 400ms guardbreak vulnerability- more on this later  all heroes can soft feint a heavy into guardbreak. Soft feints with the guardbreak input have been changed to backwards movement + guardbreak. #light and heavy attacks:  light attacks no longer bounce on block. All lights are no slower than 500ms. They can be faster, never slower.  chip damage adjusted: 5 damage on light attacks, 10 damage on heavy attacks. 3 chip damage on lights if the hero can chain to 400ms lights or is black prior. Chip damage can now kill.  increased stamina consumption for blocking  ALL HEAVY ATTACKS CAN BE CHARGED. This may sound absurd right now, but Ill explain. Not charged to the same extent as centurion, Shugoki, hitokiri, who can still charge with the same timings they have, but the heroes without it can charge heavies by a further 200ms, just enough to create a different parry window.  all heavy attacks will track a backdodge on light attack timing #why? The purpose of all these changes is, as you may have guessed, to pressure opponents into parrying attacks, because if they do not and just sit there, they will let the opponent chip away at them and they will lose stamina. These changes hopefully give everyone a hard-read based offence, which is much safer given the parry changes. Speaking of which:  parrying will no longer grant any guaranteed damage other than light chip damage. It functions purely as a way to stop the other persons attack and start your own. The current issue with parrying is that it incentivises you to try and parry with a reward, not punishment (other than unblockables) the problem here is that you can decide you dont want the reward, and you can just not try with no drawbacks. With these changes, you are much more likely to do something a bit more risky because it will result in taking damage, not dealing it for free. You *cannot* decide you dont want to parry and have no pernalties. #conclusion: Dont really know what to put here, but Ive presented myself formerly so far, so I figured I might as well. If you have any ideas/opinions/feedback, please let me know."

Currently, conq and bp have the exact same initiation and delayable timing for their respective shield bashes except for one simple difference. For conq there is a 100 ms timing which you can dodge both his instant startup and delayed bashes. For bp there is currently a 300 ms window to dodge both versions of his bash. If there are nerfing the recovery of his forward bash then THEY NEED TO COMPENSATE HIM by decreasing the window to dodge both variants of his shield bash to 100ms just like conq currently has. IF THEY DON'T it will completely fucking dumpster the characters offense. Onto the damage nerfs, all of them except chain heavy finisher are fine and completely reasonable. Onto the full-block changes, changing his fullblock exist recovery from 200 to 400 ms will completely kill the move's viability. They either need to not go through this change or give his full-block superior block and lower the gb vulnerability of his heavy unblockable down to 100 ms to compensate. If they don't then using fullblock will offer no advantage, be unsafe and just stop being useable altogether. Onto the bugs he has remaining that NEED to be fixed come tomorrow. To start he still has a 300 ms guard switch bug that is applied to himself, this was removed from every character in the game previously and for whatever retarded reason they brought it back. This also has the side effect of locking the opponents he hits with a light into a guaranteed followup bash if they failed to block and moved their guard afterwards. Onto his bulwark counter, currently, there are two bugs surrounding it, the first is that your followup unblockable swipe can get interrupted by colliding into or a near an object. I don't know why I would have to explain why having an otherwise guaranteed punish end up getting you punished isn't really healthy. The next bug is in relation to bashes after the swipe has finished its animation, first, there is a short window where prior's guard isn't available as he is getting up from his flip. This allows people who use proper spacing to completely punish his punish, intended to prevent him from being punished. Yea thanks ubi. Secondly, certain cc moves such as raiders charge, wardens bash and gladiators toe stab can all force you out bulwark clip after the sword swing has finished, guaranteeing free damage. At the end of the day regardless of how you feel about Black Prior, its clear these nerfs are knee jerk reactions to people complaining about him, nuking someone with the nerf stick and give 0 compensation isn't proper balance, its a child trying to shove triangle into a square slot, getting pissed it doesn't work and flipping the entire fucking table.."
246,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Addressing For Honors Broken Defensive Mechanics (From the perspective of a Duel/Brawl Player),0,b32b45,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/b32b45/addressing_for_honors_broken_defensive_mechanics/,2019-03-20 07:18:01,"**READ BOLD TEXT FOR GENERAL POINTS** I am currently Platinum 3 (soon to be Platinum 4) in ranked, and I mainly play Brawl/Duels. On a good day my reaction time is 190-200 milliseconds (ms), but generally speaking, it is around 210ms. This is what brings me to the topic of this post: I can consistently react and punish close to all 500ms Attacks and above, and if it wasnt for the Guardswitch priority over Dodge, I could most likely deal with all Bash Attacks currently present in the game. I am certainly not alone in this, especially not when I play ranked. Heres where an incredibly detrimental problem materialises; T**here is no incentive to attack.** With Shinobis slide tackle and Warlords Shield Bash being reactable now, the list of consistently unreactable Attacks has dwindled to essentially none. Ubisoft has tried dealing with the turtle meta by adding faster, safer, higher damage attacks, but in my eyes I just liken this to continuously putting plasters on a putrefying wound. The pinnacle of this terrible balancing is Black Prior, who up until recently had a completely unpunishable unparryable unblockable Bash (except for Raiders dodge guardbreak) that grants 20 dmg. This was changed to 17 dmg and supposedly also being punishable by 500ms dash Attacks, but the problem persists almost unaffected. People argue that these attacks are 50/50s and that you have to read, but seeing as Black Prior has an abundance of other moderately strong tools in his disposal, it becomes unrealistic to expect any player that isnt top 10% to punish the Bash. This balancing issue goes the other way around as well. If we consider 250-300ms to be the reaction time of an average gamer ([URL (note that this reaction time is referring to when you anticipate an action) , its not difficult to understand how frustrating it must be for the majority of the player population to deal with bash spam/400ms spam/500ms spam. Yes, theoretically the average gamer should be able to react within 333ms (real Bash time when accounting for lag and I-frame startup as Ive understood it), but this only works if the opponent can not do anything else but Bash, or you read your opponent to the extent that you can functionally predict the future. **In short; For Honors combat encounters for a large quantity of its player base (when playing against fast heroes) are reduced to pure guessing or spamming back, and for the &lt;233ms reaction time elite (and the occasional player who is amazing at reading), it all comes down to reacting to what your enemy does. And because of For Honors broken Defensive Mechanics, there is essentially no reason to not turtle up.** I have made this post to propose a number of ways to potentially solve this issue to some extent (or at the very least make the game more fun). **The general premise is to make normal attacks stronger, slower attacks more viable, and defense less favourable; making offense a more viable option, and not reducing it to a button mashing contest:** &amp;#x200B; **Guard Health - A replacement for Static/Reflex Guard:** Every character has a set amount of ""Guard Health"" that is consumed when blocking attacks and regenerates over time. When the Guard Health is reduced to 0, the character would enter a Guard Broken state, after which the guard would fully restore again. Heavier and slower characters would have higher Guard Health. This sustains the idea that Assassins should have it more difficult to block, but also replaces the general inconvenience that is Reflex Guard. This mechanic would punish turtling to a certain degree, and eventually force a response. This mechanic, however, would most likely never be executable in 1vX+1 situations, unless ganking is addressed on its own first. &amp;#x200B; **Changing Guard Breaks and their applicability:** Guard Breaks are too safe, but also manage to fail at what theyre supposed to do. Guard Breaks are supposed to punish dodge spam and feinting, lets make them actually do that. At this point, most heroes with dash attacks can simply iniate one if they think an enemy is going to Guard Break, again forcing the opponent to bunker down. As for feinting, the Guardbreak often just bounces off or it comes out too late, allowing the opponent to Counter-Guard Break. The changes proposed are; standardised Guard Break vulnerability frames, cranking it up to a degree where punishing feinting or dodges becomes an option (e.g. 200ms, 300ms) and significantly increase stamina loss when the player gets Counter-Guard Broken (e.g. 15 stamina points to initiate, 30 stamina points on Counter Guard Break). **Dynamic Parry Stun:** This one would perhaps be difficult to implement, but a way to make offense safer is to lower the risk of taking damage. While this can be solved by continuously making attacks faster until every hero in the roster has 400ms lights, I think there are several more interesting and creative approaches. Its already a shame that classes in For Honor essentially means nothing anymore as all attacks have the same speed, properties, etc. How about making slower, less safe attacks (especially light attacks) have a shorter parry stun window? (900ms stun for 400ms attacks/800ms stun for 500ms attacks/700ms stun for 600ms attacks) This alternative actually also becomes more attractive the more standardised the game becomes, if the develoers really want to move away from a class-based system. &amp;#x200B; **Nerf Backwalking and Unlock Roll:** A lot of the For Honors supposed ""mix-ups"" are directly countered by simply walking backwards or Unlock Rolling after dash. The only time an opponent somewhat opens up is when theyre out of stamina. Good luck making an opponent that only turtles go OOS. Backwalking should never be viable. However, regarding the Unlock Roll, I think it should remain an option but consume a lot more stamina. The issue with this approach is that the game is once again reduced to a small cast of unblockable unparryable mix-up spammers, not even slightly helping the weaker heroes. &amp;#x200B; **Exponential Chip Damage Growth:** This is considerably self-explanatory; Slower/Higher damage attacks deal more chip damage. This would make it less safe to block heavy attacks, forcing a reaction, and ultimately making Heavy Attacks more viable. &amp;#x200B; **Parry Nerf:** To me, the best solution to For Honors broken defense would be to assign parrying to a dedicated button. Pressing this button would make the player enter the Parry animation already present in the game. If the Parry whiffs, the player enters a short state of Guard Break vulnerability, not long enough to be Guardbroken on reaction, but on a read. When accompanied with something like Exponential Chip Damage Growth, the turtle is now forced to eventually act, rather than solely reacting to you (might still be possible but will be significantly more difficult). &amp;#x200B; **Sidenotes:** * 4v4s are left out since I have little experience in those gamemodes. * I think Reflex Guard is nothing but an annoyance, and should be removed from the game. * I genuinely want Classes to be a thing in For Honor and think the developers should experiment in ways to make this happen rather than standardising the entire roster to have 500ms lights and &lt;800ms heavies. &amp;#x200B; *Feel free to point out as many flaws as you want with these proposals. I would happily read-, and respond to them! What I have seen so far tells me that if there is enough discussion about an issue in this game, it will eventually be addressed by the developers. And to me, of course, For Honors defense is its most damaging fundamental flaw.* &amp;#x200B;"

He is entirely reactable, has no defensive tools (except for his heavy gb vulnerability) poor health and is highly punishable. Before I begin, I am not a centurion main (rep 5) dont have a whole lot of experience (rep 73) and am not a pro player. However, I have a few ideas for daddy derek Any feedback would be appreciated Chains and frame data: HLL chain HLH chain I think every hero should have at least 2 chain flexibility. (Poor lawbro) Frame data: 2nd light in chain buffed to 400ms (from 500), 14 damage Chain finisher light now 500ms, 15 damage. At the moment, there is no reason for cent to use lights over heavys, and with that light a weapon, 400ms lights dont seem unreasonable. Additionally, this would pressure opponents into parrying his variable timed heavys. Legion kick: Now 500ms, initiated 100-500ms into the dodge. Tracking equal to conqueror. A successful dodge always grants a guardbreak against centurion. Legion kick is pretty useless ATM, I hope we can all agree on that. Jab, eagles talons and quick throw: I have multiple ideas for these two, I would love to hear feedback. The global changes for jab is making it available from neutral (input: backwards and guardbreak, same as toe stab) All timings of jab will track a backdodge Charged jab can be cancelled or soft-feinted to eagles fury. (More on this later) uncharged can feint to eagles fury. Uncharged jab from neutral is 600ms Charged jab will track an early dodge, similar to wardens shoulder bash. Charged jab is 900ms Jab can be performed of light or heavy. Several ideas for quick throw and jab in chain: Idea 1: Jab in chain is now 500ms, meaning a need for buffered dodge. Quick throw can be performed from light or heavy. This makes quick throw act as a way of getting more damage on your opponent with a wall nearby (more on this later). Idea 2: Jab is 600ms in chain. Quick throw is always guaranteed and guarantees nothing (unless there is a ledge) This makes quick throw act as a tool to knock your opponent around. Idea 3 (my least favourite) Quick throw removed. Eagles fury: Eagles fury now 600ms Significant buff to tracking and range Eagles fury now acts as a roll catcher for the jab mix-up and general chase tool. Imperial might: Unblockable indicator now appears slightly late to prevent instantly knowing when heavy is charged or not. Can now be feinted and soft feinted into 400ms lights in the two opposing guards and dodge as well as GB. Damage reduced to 25 Will track a backdodge Imperial might is pretty useless ATM, I hope all agree. Punishes: You already know whats coming Eagles talons damage reduced to 20 from 25 Imperial might damage reduced to 25. This is still a high but now reasonable wallsplat punish. Parry counter removed. Can no longer throw from lions roar. Lions roar nerf is due to haymaker: cents now very strong OOS pressure should not be rewarded with 130 damage. I think I got everything. Again, any feedback would be appreciated. TL:DR: Jab can cancel to eagles fury (roll catcher) and has tracking buffs. Kick is faster and tracks better The punish nerfs you expected when clicking this 400ms chain lights and new chains. Thank you for reading "

Suggestions: Make bash after light not confirmed on guard switch delay. It should be dodge able on read and the guard switch bug makes this not possible Increase the recovery of all his bashes so that a dodge attack will connect (not sure about free GB?) Reduce damage of light finisher after bash to 15 damage Keep crushing counter the way it is or increase the damage of the first hit to 30 and make the bash non guaranteed. 20 damage cc is pretty bad if you just remove the follow-up bash. Add 100ms more GB vulnerability to leaving bulwark stance so that you can't leave on reaction to feints and not be punished Add some longer attack chains with any combo of heavy and light for 3-4 hits instead of just 2 Fix the OOS blocked light pressure bug for the love of God Increase front timing for bulwark slash by 100ms to make it harder to react to Increase damage of dash heavy to 25 Hoping these changes might make BP more fun to play as and more fair to play against.

Attack recovery cancel: So we all know nobushi can infinite chain all of her dodge attacks, my idea for this would be to allow her to dodge cancel the recovery of all of her neutral attacks (first and mid chain, maybe even finisher?) 2. Zone attack into heavy finisher: Essentialy the warden / shuggo job, keep the first hit of the zone but remove the second and instead allow it to chain into a heavy 3-A. A new ""pseudo 2nd"" 400ms r1: This one is weird to describe but I'll try my best to explain it; so the idea of this is to allow nobushi to throw a ""second"" 400ms r1, but it doesn't count as a second hit in the chain and also doesn't extend the chain at all (you also wouldn't be able to dodge out of the recovery of this attack). The idea behind this is so that if a nobushi throws an r1 as her second attack, the other player is forced to make a tri-directional read and if the r1 lands then she can chain it into an r2 or a 500ms r1 (which guarantees the third bleed r1 if I'm not mistaken?) This way nobushi still has access to the same second r2/ second r1 &gt; bleed r1, but she wouldn't gain the third guarenteed bleed r1 from a 400ms attack (thoughts on letting her kick from this ""pseudo 2nd r1""?) 3-B. Slight alteration of above: The same rule applies for the ""pseudo 2nd r1"" but instead make it deal low bleed damage for mix up potential with her second R2 and deal very minor regular damage (5 Reg, 10 bleed?) Since the purpose of this change would be purely to apply bleed not deal damage 4. If the changes improve her offense into making it viable then she would need GB vulnerability on her hidden stance Thoughts?"

Its variable timing doesn't allow for people to dodge on one timing like other bashes. But then the bigger issue is that the stamina regen pause is 2 seconds, which is slower than Conq's recovery to shield bash after a successful shield bash, which means that Conq can shield bash faster than the opponent can recover their stamina, which gives him incredibly powerful OOS pressure. What I'd suggest is that the shield bash no longer pauses stamina regen, the stamina cost goes up and to compensate a little bit, Conq's light damage is buffed to 15 from 13, essentially buffing the shield bash punish. This makes the bash less powerful by a slight amount. This doesn't solve all his issues: his zone and charging stance are still dangerously powerful option selects while his other tools are still underpowered or worthless(800ms chain bash?

They are the only 700ms dodge bashes right now, and yet they gaurantee no damage. Even the follow-up attacks are pathetically easy to deal with. Since LB's supposed to be a disabler and, what we've learned from Shugo's rework, we can make this into a proper disabling tool easily. Widen the dodge input on the forward and side dodges, speed up the shoves, speed up some of the follow-up attacks, and allow him to cancel the whiff recovery into a chain light or heavy.

Now here's what I propose: speed up the side bashes, allow him to cancel the recovery of the bashes with a chain light(which I believe should be 500ms, why tf is it still like this?), lower the stamina cost slightly, and allow him to use some of his unblockables if it lands like his toe stab or skewer. This will strengthen his mix-up potential and give his dodge bashes more use. &amp;#x200B; **Proposed:** \*Speed: 600ms on front dodge, *500ms on side dodge* Dodge input: 100-500ms on front dodge, 300-500ms on side dodge \*Stamina Cost: *20* Stamina Damage: 30, pauses stamina regen for 2 seconds \*Guaranteed Damage: No guaranteed damage, if it lands he can throw a chain heavy, *a toe stab, or a skewer* Special Properties: Stun \*Recovery: GB on dodge, can cancel recovery with chain heavy *or chain light* # Black Prior **Current:** Speed: 500ms, only front dodge Dodge input: 100-500ms on front dodge Stamina Cost: 15 Stamina Damage: 20, pauses stamina regen for 2 seconds Guaranteed Damage: 20 Special Properties: N/A Recovery: So low that not even dodge lights or heavies can punish it &amp;#x200B; This *should be* the staple example for how to balance a bash, except for one thing: its recovery. The recovery is so low that BP can block dodge lights and heavies(500-600ms) after a whiff, which should not happen **especially when it has such a high damage punish.** So the recovery should be nerfed to allow in dodge lights and heavies(again, the 500-600ms ones). This should also be done for his mid-chain bash as well. &amp;#x200B; **Proposed:** Speed: 500ms, only front dodge Dodge input: 100-500ms on front dodge Stamina Cost: 15 Stamina Damage: 20, pauses stamina regen for 2 seconds Guaranteed Damage: 20 Special Properties: N/A \*Recovery: faster dodge lights and heavies punish it # Warlord **Current:** Speed: 500ms, only front dodge Dodge input: 100-400ms on front dodge Stamina Cost: 15 Stamina Damage: 20 Guaranteed Damage: 12 Special Properties: N/A Recovery: GB on dodge &amp;#x200B; WL's headbutt has low damage, gives a GB on side dodge, dodgeable on one timing and low range. What I'd suggest is to buff the stab damage to 14, give it slightly more range, but then allow WL to cancel the whiff recovery with a neutral light or heavy. Since WL is a harasser he should be able to mess with opponents after the whiffed headbutt. And it isn't dangerously overpowered: (when compared to all the other changed bashes) its got the lowest guaranteed damage out of the lot, and is still dodgeable on one timing. So with the recovery changes and damage and range buff, it serves as a harasser tool and an okay opener. &amp;#x200B; **Proposed:** Speed: 500ms, only front dodge Dodge input: 100-400ms on front dodge Stamina Cost: 15 Stamina Damage: 20 \*Guaranteed Damage: *14* Special Properties: N/A \*Recovery: GB on dodge*, can cancel whiff recovery into a neutral heavy or neutral light* # Shinobi **Current:** Speed: 500ms on front dodge, 600ms on side dodge Dodge input: minimum of 600ms(combined double dodge input) maximum of 1100ms?

Now it's beyond reactable but is still hard to punish. What I'd suggest is to switch the super armor to I-frames(he's an assassin, right?), make the side dodge kicks faster, widen the dodge input(specifically the earlier part of the window), and maybe give the backflip more GB vulnerability(about 300ms from 100ms) OR just get rid of the ability to cancel the kick recovery into a backflip. &amp;#x200B; Proposed**:** \*Speed: *500ms on front and side dodge* \*Dodge input: minimum of *300ms*(combined double dodge input) maximum of 1100ms?

Pressing light attack while in this stance does a stunning strike with the bottom of the shaft, same animation as the light parry counter, always comes from the opposite side of where the axe head is (cant remember the animation rn), has *superarmor* after 100ms, 500ms total, 15dmg, chain starter Pressing heavy attack makes LB pull the axe head back for an unblockable finisher from the side, 900ms, has hyperarmor after 500ms, feintable, 35 dmg Back+GB does a 700ms long arm with *superarmor* after 400ms, catches backdodges My rationale for giving the long arm and light attack from this stance superarmor is that since they are active counters, and LB already risks GB from this stance, it seems fair that he should have a way to counter bash based offense with a read. Keep in mind there is a window of no HA or SA with all of these moves except shove, which keeps him from becoming pre-rework shugoki in this stance and allows some opportunity for offense from the opponent.

253,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha rework Idea,11,awfbk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/awfbk9/aramusha_rework_idea/,2019-03-02 18:34:48,"Been building up an opinion and Idea for him for a good while. Tried to make some old attempts to better connect him to his historical inspiration Miyamoto Musashi, but it's kinda hard to do based on his writings alone and his current state. This is my current hope, and I think final draft of what I think he should become. Please note Aramusha is an assassin heavy hybrid not a vanguard heavy like some people assume. this is easily seen from the for honor website, his speed, and his original description. I present my raw statements before opinions so people can formulate their own (opinions). I will present my reasoning at the end. 1: Rushing wind/RW alternate should start 100ms sooner during a forward dodge and Rushing wind and alternates (the side variants) should become 100ms faster and undodgeables. (yes a 200ms total speed buff to the RW) 2: reduce blade blockade recovery to 100ms (down from 400ms). Thus it would retain the 100ms startup, 400ms duration and 100ms recover for 600ms of gb vulnerability. 3: enable twin viper to soft feint into dodges. (enabling followup to back dodgers and rollers via a rushing wind undodgeable) 4: enable a small no dmg 10 or less stam bash on dodge attack that maybe (debatable) guarantees a light 5 damage (just to keep mild pressure) but acts as an interrupter and combo starter. Could be called Taiko Rhythm to connect to Musashi's inspiration from taiko drummers in his NiTen IchiRyu fighting style. Dodging the bash would guarantee nothing unless the opponent followed into a dodge attack because Ara flows into his combo making it a fair opener similar to gladiator's in nature. 5: and finally nerfs, slightly reduce a few of his heavy damages to compensate. HSB down to 37 (from 40) HSC down to 30 (from 33) HSC+(finisher) to 40 (down from 45) Rushing Wind Alternate (Forward dodge Side guard heavies that would now be undodgeable) down to 23 (from 25) to compensate for them having the undodgeable property. Random info (did you know Ara's GB has less followup attack time than most? makes sense for his kit but still weird) REASONING \#1 This would allow a hard feint to actually effectively enable use of rushing winds top Hyper Armor, and additionally would give us the ability to catch back dodgers with this tricky feint. Hyper armor would start 100 MS earlier via quicker movement into it from dodge, and total animation speed would be 700ms top 800ms for sides (the alternates) (instead of 900ms,1000ms the old version with dmg 25 of both options) this also works in tandem with change #3 \#2 I mean I could live without it, but it would just make it slightly less awful. I feel like when I whiff a BB right now I'm a turtle hiding in my shell who comes out with a dumb look on his face thinking ""durrrr no one hit me uhhh what do I do now?"" it would just make it more inline with other full blocks utility wise and would still be very punishble by guardbreak via a feint from the opponent. It would prevent some hard feint basic attacks tho which is the goal I had in mind. Honestly this ones up for debate tho. \#3 Twin viper is a useless unblockable from BB that is parry bait and easy to dodge. Allowing it to soft feint into dodge enable four options from it with my propositions. First dodge forward into top heavy for HA to weak trade (25 dmg) Second dodge forward into side heavy to catch dodgers but maybe get hit by a parry attempt, Third Side dodge into light bash to enable combo followup and mild stamina damage from proposition 4. Fourth option let it fly see if the unblockable connects. \#4 This bash would have some use as a mild opener, guaranteeing maybe minimal damage, but still opening an opponent to the rest of his kit effectively and safely bypassing combo starters. It would have wonderful interaction with any full blocks doing nothing punishing but disabling their punishes for a moment \#5 His dmg may be a bit over-tuned, especially for it's speed, but he is an assassin. With all these new buffs he absolutely needs some nerfs to dmg, especially his heavy side openers that deal 40 and his heavy side finish that dealt 45. Thank you for your time! "
254,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Four Things That Would Make Conqueror Flow Much Better,0,awkccx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/awkccx/four_things_that_would_make_conqueror_flow_much/,2019-03-03 04:58:34,"The following are three things that I feel would make Conquerors offense flow much better and be less centralized on just existing to make opponents want to attack the dude with 53 different option selects. 1. Enhanced chained lights. Weve seen from Shugoki that enhanced 500 ms lights are quite good for maintaining pressure and getting to mixups. Good in Duels for maintaining the initiative and chip damage, while good in 4s for target-swapping without being shut down by just a block. This also in general makes the light/heavy mixup much more viable as opponents will be more motivated to parry one to the lights to stop the initiative, meaning a well-read heavy will smack them. Lastly, this will indirectly, but significantly improve his Shield Bash follow-up, as, although it is very slow, the opponent would now have to play a similar secondary mind-game as Tiandis Palm Strike, except the chain will not stop if they opt out of it and just block top. 2. The ability to chain after a softfeint SB would improve the move substantially. Right now, it is only useful when used from the Charged Heavy or if your opponent is parry/dodge-hungry on your regular heavies. Being able to chain after it would allow it to have another use, even if the opponent is not going for parries/dodges, as, as mentioned before, the chain will not stop if they choose to opt out of the secondary mixup. 3. This one is a bit unorthodox, but this change could give life to a move that is normally quite difficult to access and use reliably. The ability to cancel attack recoveries by charging a heavy. I opt for this over allowing him to just charge a heavy mid-chain like Shugoki, as this would slow him to access the other options that he has access to while charging a heavy, such as the full-block, shield bash, etc, while still having the same effect, since you could throw the Charged Heavy immediately, if you want, essentially making it mid-chain. (For any of you wondering what the animation would look like, he would simply pull back his chain during the follow-through of his previous attack and start spinning it). 4. Reduce guardswitch time while charging a heavy to 200 ms. I understand that the devs dont want Conqueror to be completely safe while charging a heavy, but a 200 ms guardswitch time would make more sense. Currently, at 300 ms, 500 ms attacks from neutral only have a 133 ms reaction window (unreactable). If it was set to 200 ms, there would be a 233 ms reaction window, which would likely still be unreactable for most people, but much more reasonable and possible to do either on prediction or fast reaction. On a side note: Wouldnt simply making his heavies 800 ms from all directions so that he has 400 ms GB vulnerability on his heavies solve a lot of the option selects? GBs after a successful feint would theoretically catch his heavies, softfeint SB, and full-block. Add a recovery time to canceling his heavy charge manually, and would that not theoretically kill about half of his option selects?"

First of all, i know a lot of people say this already but i gonna try to do the most complete possible, Lights -500ms lights / I think all here agree, is just a basic thing -Light, Heavy chain. / Same here Now i suggest some fixes for things raider already have. -Gb vulnerability on heavys startup, fix that I can't say the amount of times i have been guardbroken trying to do a heavy. Chained zone being stopped / some chrs just do a light and stop your attack, some hyperarmor in his chain zone would be great. Ok now the interesting changes and adds for Raider -Stun tap/feint from any side. Doing a stun a tap is a free parry, even if you delay it, always up is easy predictable, make it something like the shaman feint. -Heavy punish on gb. The other vanguards get a side heavy why raider not? A half of your stamina for 28 dmg is just bad. Ok maybe 40 dmg is a bit high, but it can be the chain heavy (30 dmg) also it can be a combo starter. -Feints can be also chain heavies I say stun tap from any side, but this is gonna a be parried anyway so a really good way to catch them is feint the heavy into a chain heavy. Like kensei. The animation of the attacks would be similar. -Heavy after a stun tap or ""chain heavy feint"" doesn't finish the combo. Simple one, make him a real offense chr, large and deadly combos, like aramusha (joke) -Stamina buff With this changes raider can do a lot of mixes no? Well he need stamina, in other way all i say is not gonna work. -Something to catch the roll I think in something between warden running attack and warlord zone, people just roll away in anti gank scenarios so this can be a useful tool. And im' not sure with the next ones -Zone confirmed after gb run throw into a wall. Is hard, but it can be parried, make it confirmed. -Neutral top heavy can be charged, like the centurion heavies. Not dmg changes, just make it safe to use. -Hyper armor Not like zer, just a bit, only in some attack for possible trades.

Most notably gladiator/aramusha/centurion heavy, orochi top heavy, completely negating any ""attack feint into gb"" or ""unblockable soft feint into gb"" mixup. The standard gb vulnerability for most attacks is 300ms, completely vulnerable to any of the ""attack feint into gb"" mixup. Also zone attacks like conq zone or gladiator zone also have very low gb vulnerability, making them extremely safe option selects. &amp;#x200B; **Getting a heavy attack from a heavy parry** Both aramusha and centurion get a heavy attack from parrying a heavy. Now while the damage numbers might not be that interesting, since for example shaman can zone for 25dmg, same with berserker, he can zone for 24dmg after a heavy parry, these 2 characters mentioned can do the high damage punish at fraction of the stamina cost since they can heavy after a heavy parry. For characters who can zone for higher dmg after a heavy parry you have to take into consideration that you might go OOS if you do the higher dmg punish, while aramusha and centurion can get the high dmg with no absolutely no risk &amp;#x200B; Should gb vulnerability be standardized to 300ms for consistency? or should these characters retain their low gb vulnerability?

This is a rework for Orochi that will keep the characters current playstyle intact but make it much more effective. 1. 10dmg 400ms side lights from neutral. Orochis neutral lights are fairly easy to punish and make his/her neutral game pretty bad. This is a good way to give Orochi an opener without a bash. The 2nd and 3rd chain lights will remain the same. 2. Storm Rush left stance becomes a 600ms version of Wind Gust that does 15-20dmg. This does two things, it makes the undodgeable top stance of Storm Rush useful and turns it into a read between the two. Since Wind Gust initiates chains this will work as another great opener for Orochi. 3. Finisher Heavy Dodge cancel. Pair the aforementioned Storm Rush changes with this and Orochi can put immense pressure on the opponent even after a chain is over. 4. Storm Rush Dodge Cancel. Storm Rush still wont have hyper armor and the current hard canceling into dodge method is clunkier than it needs to be. 5. Forward and side dash light attacks become heavy dash attacks. As a counter attacker Orochis dodge attack punishes are way to risky for what damage they give. A slight nerf to the damage is fine if need be. 6. Remove GB vulnerability from the backstep light.

259,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A Shinobi Rework - Ninja Tricks for a Tricky Ninja,1,agy53e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/agy53e/a_shinobi_rework_ninja_tricks_for_a_tricky_ninja/,2019-01-18 01:13:03,"Shinobi is a problematic character. One of the [more hated characters in the game](URL it has often been said that shinobi's ranged design goes against the core concept of a medieval fighting game. Whilst I do not agree with this sentiment, Shinobi's current design promotes an [extremely irritating fighting style](URL of being extremely evasive, and relying on his unlocked slide tackle or the small subset of his moves that he can access without hitting an obscenely risky ranged heavy. Additionally, his kick and backflip both bizarrely have superarmour, and his backflip makes all his moves far too safe. Finally, in 4v4 modes, his ranged GB from offscreen is incredibly frustrating and unfair due to it's lack of indication. In this rework, I aim to improve the utility of his moveset in offence, normalize his overtuned damage, and address some of the most contentious and irritating parts of his playstyle. My intention is to make shinobi a potent character with a high skill floor, instead of being overly safe but toothless. Shinobi can still be evasive and harassing at range, but to do serious damage, he must get in close. This is probably one of my most extensive rework proposals, because almost all of Shinobi's kit needs serious adjustment - although as usual, there is only minimal animation work required. There are likely to be some areas where this rework misses the mark, as I am not hugely experienced with Shinobi, so I'd appreciate any feedback. I've included a summary at the start, and more detail in the body of the post itself. &amp;nbsp; ##Summary - Damage Nerfs: Lights: openers + finishers 13, double hit light 5; Heavy finishers: after heavy 30, after front roll 25, after ranged GB 20; Sickle rain 2x 1+2b, 1+8b; Light riposte 5+15b; Ranged Heavies openers: side 13, top 18; light after deflect 10b - Chain lights 400ms - Side heavy finishers undodgeable (front roll mix-up) - Top heavy finishers confirm sickle rain on block (pseudo-unblockable pressure) - Deflect has dodge properties, enemy attacks will not track it - Backflip: - Replaces normal back dodge when not OOS, still 12 stamina - Superarmour removed, has normal dodge i-frames + GB vulnerability - Cannot be used to cancel light finisher recovery - Ranged heavies/GB after backflip have starting range, not max range - Kicks: - Superarmour removed - Side double dodge kick 500ms - Front kick from single dodge after 200ms - Double dodge kicks confirm top ranged heavy, others confirm side ranged heavy or top on wallsplat - Forward roll kick confirms side ranged heavy (new mix-up w. Heavy finishers) - Ranged attacks: - Top ranged heavy opener 700ms - All ranged heavies can be feinted, to neutral or back to charging stance - Ranged heavies can chain on block (into second heavy or forward roll) - Parries pull shinobi forward for heavy parry punish - Countered ranged GB pulls shinobi forward for heavy parry punish - Ranged GB has external indicator (!) + does not ignore revenge GB immunity - Externally parried ranged heavies/countered ranged GBs still unbalance the shinobi - Cannot GB/CGB for 300ms after feinting the charging stance to reduce option select strength + double dodge mix-up - Slide tackle: - Recovery increased: grants GB on dodge, does not guarantee shinobi any damage (just allies) - No superarmour, doesn't prevent revenge activation - New moves: - Zone: replaced with long range 600ms, 20 damage attack using old minion clear animation. Chains to ranged heavy finisher or forward roll - Side dodge light: 500ms, 10+5 damage, uses animation of first 2 hits of old zone attack. 200-400ms into first side dodge, chains to light finishers or backflip. - Smoke Bomb: 500ms move, back + GB from neutral, hides Shinobi's guard for 300ms after animation ends, can make neutral lights harder to block. &amp;nbsp; ##Damage changes. Overall, Shinobi's damage is significantly overtuned. Mostly this is due to the guaranteed light second light doing a ludicrous 10 damage, but it is high in many other areas. Some of these nerfs will seem very severe, but hang on, and hopefully they will make sense in the context of the whole rework. - **Light opener 13 damage** (from 14). **Double-hit light 5 damage** (from 10). **Light finishers 13 damage** (from 14). - **Heavy finishers: After a ranged guard break, 20 damage** (from 35). **After a basic heavy, 30 damage** (from 35), **after a roll, 25 damage** (from 30). - **Sickle Rain: now 2x 1+2 bleed, 1+8 bleed for 15 total** (from 3x 2+4). - **Ranged heavies: Openers - Side 13 damage, top 18 damage**. Chained ranged heavy unchanged (25) - Deflect: Still automatically does 25 bleed damage. **Light after deflect does 10 extra bleed damage** (35 total), kick after deflect now only guarantees side ranged heavy for 13 extra damage (38 total), or top ranged heavy (43 total) on a wallsplat. - **Light riposte: 5 + 15 bleed for 20 total** (from 14 + 15 bleed) &amp;nbsp; ##Attack Chains. Shinobi has limited chains, but currently uses an even more limited subset of them. - Both opener and chained lights are reduced to 13 damage, and his guaranteed light is now only 5 damage. - **Chain lights are now 400ms**, so after an opener, the shinobi now has a choice between guaranteed low damage, or higher but non-guaranteed damage, (or neither and cancelling into the backflip, see later). &amp;nbsp; ##Backflip. Currently Shinobi's backflip makes all of his moves incredibly safe. This is because it has no GB vulnerability, and has superarmour, meaning that any attack into it leaves the opponent vulnerable to a ranged GB during their attack's recovery. This kind of safety is unhealthy for the game, and is reduced. - **Superarmour on the backflip is removed.** - **The backflip now replaces Shinobi's normal back dodge**, but now has the same properties as a dodge: it now has **GB vulnerability, and 200ms of i-frames**. In practice this means Shinobi's backflip is similar to other characters who can cancel attack recovery with a dodge (eg. Tiandi, Nobushi) - Backflip still costs 12 stamina, and can still be used to **cancel recoveries of attacks (hit or missed), except for the final hit of sickle rain, or the light finisher**. Back dodging when OOS uses the current back dodge animation. - The range of Shinobi's disengage roll is significantly decreased after a backflip, so his overall ability to create distance unlocking or double back dodging is not increased. - **Ranged heavies and GBs after a backflip no longer have maximum range**. Now they will only reach a short distance forward from the starting position of the backflip. This prevents the Shinobi using the backflip to keep at maximum range and still be threatening with ranged heavies. - Holding heavy after a backflip will go into the ranged charging stance. These changes make the backflip more accessible, but riskier for the Shinobi. With the backflip having the GB vulnerability of a normal dodge, and lacking superarmour, opponents will now be able to punish missed shinobi attacks with a GB or dodge attack if they are quick and correctly spaced. Moreover, being unable to *immediately* backflip after a light finisher will give the opponent a short opportunity to mount their own offence. However, the shinobi can now use the backflip from neutral into ranged heavy or GB as a sort of dodge attack like Orochi's storm rush, albeit with a high risk of being caught by feint to GB. The ability of the backflip to create range is somewhat mitigated by the increasing prevalence of good gap closing moves like warden's valiant charge, Nuxia's forward dodge light, etc, which can now be used against the backflip due to the removal of superarmour. Such moves are becoming more widespread with reworks and new characters, so Shinobis are no longer untouchable at range. &amp;nbsp; ##Ranged Heavies. Ranged heavies are at the core of Shinobi's moveset, but their uselessness in 1v1 scenarios prevents shinobi from utilizing most of his moveset. - Opener ranged side heavies now do 13 damage, top does 18 damage, slowed to 700ms - Chained ranged heavies still do 25 damage - **Having a ranged heavy parried no longer knocks the shinobi over. Instead he is pulled forward into a regular heavy parry punish**. This is not the case for externally parried ranged heavies, which still cause the Shinobi to be unbalanced, to balance their utility in team fights. - **Ranged heavies are no longer interrupted by blocking**, and shinobi can progress into his other moves from a ranged heavy even if it is blocked. This is partly why the damage is so low on his heavy openers, so they have very low chip damage. Superior blocks stop the heavy from chaining as usual. - **Ranged heavies can be feinted**. Feints either go **to neutral or back into the charging stance** (at the lowest charge level) by holding heavy whilst pressing feint. (This is already sort of possible for the second heavy, which can be feinted, but as well as allowing the first ranged heavy to be feinted, this also streamlines the input for re-entering the charging stance.) Animation-wise, the Shinobi would just pull the chain back before the Kama hits his opponent. - **Immediately after feinting out of charging stance, the Shinobi cannot GB or CGB for 300ms.** This prevents the charged heavy from being used to option select parry and still beat feint to GB. The charging heavy can still be used to option select by parrying on light timing and deflecting on heavy timing, but it now has some counter-play in feint to GB. This also removes the double dodge -&gt; charge heavy cancel -&gt; GB mix-up, which would be too powerful now that the double dodge kicks are 500ms. These changes should make the ranged heavies much more viable in 1v1 scenarios. A blocked heavy will allow shinobi to go into the gap closing forward roll, and they are no longer suicidal parry bait. Feinting a ranged heavy into a ranged GB or second ranged heavy will be able to catch some parry attempts, and dodging an attack with the backflip into a ranged heavy will be a viable counter-attack. &amp;nbsp; ##Ranged Guard Break. This move is currently extremely powerful in ganks and ledging when used from offscreen, but practically suicide to use in any other situation. It also has some strange properties which should be normalised. - Firstly, **the ranged GB needs an indicator when used externally**. Ideally, all GBs should get an external indicator, but it is even more imperative in the case of a ranged GB where there is no animation tell from the opponent next to you. If it is impossible to give all external GBs an indicator, then the ranged GB should at least have the same exclamation mark indicator as offscreen bashes have (as it can be dodged) - A **countered ranged GB now pulls the Shinobi towards the opponent for a heavy parry punish**, much like the ranged heavies. Likewise, it still unbalances the Shinobi if externally countered. - Ranged GBs **no longer go through revenge GB immunity**, as this gives them too much gank potential. Using a ranged GB from neutral will still be asking for a punish, but it can now be used in baiting a ranged heavy parry or after dodging an attack with the backflip - but not without some associated risk. Being punished when failing to bait a ranged heavy parry might seem harsh, but ranged heavies will be immune to many option select parries (due to being out of range of a zone for example), and considering the pressure a blocked ranged heavy will apply (see later) I feel this is warranted. &amp;nbsp; ##Kicks. These are currently good counter attacking tools, but too telegraphed to be particularly useful as openers. Their superarmour promotes trading which should not be Shinobi's focus. The forward roll kick is currently underutilized, and is now changed into a powerful mix up. - **Superarmour on all kicks is removed**, including forward roll kick. - **Stamina damage on all kicks reduced to 25**. - **Front kick (500ms) is now available from a single forward dodge**, after 200ms of dodge, making it a decent opener (not delayable to prevent it becoming a conq-style mix-up) - **Side kick sped up to 500ms** - **Kicks after a double dodge confirm a top ranged heavy (18 damage), but other kicks only confirm a side ranged heavy (13 damage) unless they wallsplat.** - The **forward roll kick now confirms a ranged side heavy** (top with a wallsplat). This means that the forward roll becomes a potent mix-up, as the kick has to be dodged on prediction due to its speed. However a misjudged early dodge will be hit by the heavy finisher after a roll, as this move has excellent tracking. As the forward roll is now much more accessible (after a blocked ranged heavy, or after the single dodge kick) **this mix-up will be Shinobi's new main offence.** &amp;nbsp; ##Heavy Finishers. Currently these are high damaging, but unremarkable on account of being easily blocked. To transform the front-roll kick/heavy into a powerful mix-up they need some extra changes: - **Damage reduction: After a ranged GB, 20; after a normal heavy, 30; after a front roll, 25.** - Sickle Rain is also reduced to 1+2 bleed for the first 2 hits, and 1+8 bleed for the final hit. Recovery of the Sickle Rain finisher cannot be cancelled with a backflip, so the Shinobi has to choose between guaranteed damage or continuing offence with an immediate backflip into ranged heavies, etc. - Sickle rain is now interrupted by an ally heavy, putting the opponent into reduced hit recovery (so it can guarantee a single ally heavy) - **Side heavy finishers are undodgeable.** They already have excellent tracking to catch pre-emptive side dodges of the front roll kick, but this merely cements that ability, and allows them to catch backdodges too. - **Top heavy finishers now guarantee Sickle Rain even if blocked** - becoming a ""pseudo-unblockable"". Ideally ""pseudo-unblockables"" would have a special indicator, but this is not 100% necessary. This makes the top heavy finisher much more threatening and requiring of a parry. It also gives Shinobi more group fight presence from his heavy chain. Animation-wise, the Shinobi would suddenly pull down on his opponent's weapon after they block the top heavy, bringing them to their knees to initiate the Sickle Rain light attacks. - (Alternatively, I considered adding a soft-feint into side light-light chain from the top heavy, like Aramusha, but I felt that the guaranteed Sickle Rain on block would be more interesting and fitting). &amp;nbsp; ##Deflect. This now has much more reasonable damage, but needs some extra changes for team fights: - Deflect now has dodge properties: **enemy ally attacks will not track the deflecting shinobi during the deflect**, and it has i-frames until the shinobi becomes visible. - Visually, the deflect uses a bit more smoke, to be a bit more believable. &amp;nbsp; ##New Moves: These moves aim to improve Shinobi's terrible zone, give a better ability to counter attack from a dodge, and create a flavourful pseudo-opener. - **Zone: ""Shadow Whip""**. Shinobi's current zone is replaced with an attack using the [animation of Shinobi's old minion-clearing heavy attack: spinning both kama around the body in a wide circle, then hitting the opponent to the front](URL This long range attack would be **600ms, 20 damage** (60 stamina as standard), in right guard, and would chain directly into the second ranged heavy, or a forward roll on hit or block. - **Side Dodge Light: ""Ghoul Slash""**. This new side dodge attack provides Shinobi with an improved way to counter-attack, less powerful but faster than the double dodge kick. This attack uses the same animation as the first 2 hits of the old zone attack (but mirrored when on the left side, so that the attack always comes from the direction of the dodge). It is a **500ms light attack available from 200 to 400ms into the side dodge, hitting twice for 10 + 5 damage**, and chaining into the light finishers (all 3 directions 400ms), or a backflip. - **Smoke Bomb: ""Shadow Jitsu""**. This pseudo-opener is probably the most outlandish idea in this rework, and is not essential for it to work - but I think it would be really cool. Used by pressing **Back + GB from neutral**, the Shinobi throws a small smoke bomb to the ground, creating a small cloud of reddish smoke (like the ""Shadow of Death"" execution) that **partially obscures the shinobi for a brief instant, and makes their guard widget invisible**. As Shinobi's light attack animations are quite subtle, this would make them significantly harder to block. **The smoke throwing animation has a 300ms start up, followed by a smoke cloud that hides the Shinobi's guard for 600ms. The move takes 500ms, so if the shinobi immediately light attacks, only the last 200ms of the attack indicator will be visible**. This means that the opponent will either have to risk blocking the Shinobi's attacks without an indicator, or take a pre-emptive action on reaction to the smoke, such as dodging, attacking to interrupt the shinobi, or so on. The Shinobi can GB or backflip/dodge attack on a read to punish those options, but if the opponent GBs on reaction to the smoke, this will beat those reads. Overall, I feel like it would be a fun and characterful, opener/mixup without being overly powerful. &amp;nbsp; ##Unlocked Moveset. Currently Shinobi's unlocked slide tackle is one of the strongest unlocked offenses, being unreactable and almost completely unpunishable. This is unhealthy for the game and is significantly nerfed. - **Recovery after a hit or missed slide tackle is significantly increased**. The move now **does not guarantee any attack from the shinobi**, removing its utility in 1v1s. It is also **punishable with GB if dodged**. - Slide tackle **no longer has superarmour**. - Slide tackle **no longer prevents revenge activation during the standing up animation** These changes leave slide tackle as a useful ganking/team fight tool, but irrelevant for duels. &amp;nbsp; Thanks for reading!

Feels like it is less than similar moves like Shoalin's kick or Conq's bash but I don't actually know that) and probably reduce the damage of Balor's might (or reduce stamina damage of the kick/grab, something along those lines so that the trade isn't always in HL's favor). &amp;#x200B; So basically what I'm asking is whether or not that would be a ""healthy"" way to add offense to HL's kit, or whether that would be too much, or perhaps if what I said just isn't possible to begin with."
262,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"From What We Know About The Black Prior, I Think In His Current Iteration He May Be The Strongest Duelist In The Game",1,ajj16w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ajj16w/from_what_we_know_about_the_black_prior_i_think/,2019-01-25 11:04:44,"Hey everyone, bit of a different post than usual but as I'm sure everyone knows, the Black Prior has been shown off today, and I am extremely excited but also a little nervous to how strong I think the character is going to be. When you deal with educational for honor content as much as I do, you can get fairly good at conceptualizing how different parts of a character's kit will interact with one another. Today, I'd just like to list off all of the offensive and defensive tools the character will have access to, and why the strength of these tools will place the character as the strongest duelist in the game. # Offensive Tools * His forward dodge shield bash is confirmed to be 500ms, with a delay window of 100-500ms. It also confirms 20 damage, giving the Black Prior effectively a stronger Conq SB from neutral (7 damage more, which is quite significant). Considering this character also has 500ms lights from all three directions, he already has better neutral pressure than Conq (this is not a bad thing, its just the damage I take issue with) * His zone is 700ms. This is obviously reactable, but what will be really strong about this is the fact it has a different animation from his forward shield bash. When you're trying to focus for the animation of the Black Prior's forward dodge to avoid the SB, the different animation of the zone will be able to catch you off guard, in addition to GB, light, etc. Again, it deals 20 damage, which is very high. On top of all of this, in the movelist it says that the regular shield bash and soft feint bash can only chain on hit, but not the zone. This means you can chain the zone on whiff, which would mean he can follow up with a 20 damage 500ms light from any direction or 40 damage undodgable heavy from any direction to stuff GB punish attempts. * His neutral heavies have a soft feint to another shield bash, which is 700ms. That isn't all too fast, but they provide one crucial perk to Black Prior's kit: safe heavies. Soft feints to bashes are the most effective way of shutting down most option selects, and in this case the Black Prior again just has a better version of Conq's bash. It deals more damage, and its faster so it will be interrupted in less cases. And of course, Black Prior can hardfeint his heavies, unlike Conq (I know I'm making a lot of comparisons to Conq but their kits just have that many similarities) * 500ms 15 damage neutral lights are nice (faster in two directions and deals 2 more damage than Conq's), 500ms 20 damage chained lights are very high (and effectively give very high damage on all of his bashes). * An unblockable softfeint out of full block provides additional neutral pressure, and since you can cancel the recovery of any neutral light or heavy, can also effectively be used in chain. * After a light attack, you can access the 500ms bash in chain. This grants the mixup of a 500ms 20 damage bash, 40 damage tri-directional undodgable heavies, tri-directional 20 damage 500ms lights, and the fullblock softfeint to unblockable. If you can't see the similarity already, let me point it out to you: its a better Qi stance. The heavies are undodgable from more directions and deal more damage, the lights are 500ms from more directions, you can access full block which is much better defense than Shaolin's superior block lights, etc. This is some seriously strong finisher pressure in addition to some very potent neutral pressure. Now, with all of that considered, I would rank his offense to be easily S tier (Warden, WL and possibly Zerk I think have better offense) while only just touching on aspects that provide safety to his offense (which we're about to get into). I'm a little disappointed to see so many similarities to other characters, but the mix of different tools and their own unique properties makes it stand out enough in my eyes. If I were to state one complaint about these tools, its that the damage is too high. Its pretty early for me to be crying for nerfs, but I'm willing to take the risk of being laughed at if he turns out to be totally balanced to state my opinion now that such a high damage number on the finisher light that effectively provides high damage to all of his bashes is overtuned and artificially provides stronger offense to a kit already comparable to the S tiers'. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, let's move along to the defensive tools, because we all know Thornbush loves his defensive tools (filthy Conq main amiright) # Defensive Tools * Full block doesn't give any reward without the counter, but has some quick start-up. This tool will be able to be used as a additional defensive tool against unreactable attacks such as PK dagger cancel or Zerk feinted lights, making the character more difficult to open up without punishing the attacker for attempting to do so (this is good game design btw). Being able to walk at a respectable speed while holding it up will also allow the Black Prior to put his all guard up and start back strafing to avoid getting caught with a GB. Having an attack out of full block is great too, since the unblockable will be able to be used on prediction to stuff GB attempts. * Bulwark flip obviously seems strong, but I'm not going to say too much about it just yet since it is a unique enough tool that I think it can only be judged fairly by playing with it. Looks pretty much like a blade blockade softfeint out of full block, with a pretty high damaging reward along with it. * You can cancel the recovery of your opening lights or heavies with full block (as mentioned in the offensive section to access your unblockable in chain). This provides additional safety to the Black Prior's offense to avoid dodge attacks, especially for his heavies in conjunction with the bash soft feint. * Superior block light attacks in all three directions that deal 20 damage, mixing these in with regular parry attempts and regular attempts softfeinted to the bash provides multiple parry options with limited mutually exclusive punishes. * Superior block forward dash heavy can be mixed between superior block top light to mix up parry timings, can only gives a heavy parry punish while confirming just as much damage (20) * 700ms bash as a zone option select. I am going to ASSUME that this doesn't have 100ms GB vulnerability like Glad (since that would be beyond absurd in context with the rest of his kit, even not in context), but this provides an additional option to parry with that can catch the enemy off guard, has its own exclusive requirements to punish, and can't be GB punished because it can chain. * In terms of punishes, we can expect the standard side heavy off GB, top heavy off light parry, etc. But what stands out to me is a 20 damage shield bash off heavy parry. It depends on the stamina cost and damage values of course, but punishes that deal stamina damage right after the initial stamina damage of the parry are always good. And of course, 20 damage is pretty respectable off a heavy parry in addition to the stamina damage. Between multiple parry options and respectably safe offense, Black Prior is also looking to be very potent defensively. Of course, everything will need to be fully tested once he is released, but from what I've seen he appears to have a very powerful kit. I won't be covering his feats as I haven't discussed any 4v4 implications, but I've heard they are quite deadly as well. If anyone would like to further discuss the character or hear more about my opinions, I'll be active in the comments. &amp;#x200B;"
263,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"An idea: Make HL's kick 800ms, make his toss a special command grab and get rid of its 400ms delay, switch the inputs, and reduce the OS heavy damage after a bash",1,ajs2pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ajs2pl/an_idea_make_hls_kick_800ms_make_his_toss_a/,2019-01-26 05:36:35,"*This is simply an idea that I thought of. It's unique in that it wasn't ever really introduced ever in this game, so bear with me.* There's an issue with HL: his kick mix-up is a complete noob stomper, while being worthless in high-level play since people just roll away. Well I have an idea that may fix both of those problems while keeping HL fun to play. &amp;#x200B; It goes like this: &amp;#x200B; **Fomorian** **Kick** * Slown down to 800ms from 700ms * Input is changed to Back + GB from GB * Soft-feint input time for toss is changed so that it happens 400ms before the kick lands instead of 300ms before This is to stop near reactive CGBs w/ the kick. &amp;#x200B; **Caber Toss** * Stays the same speed(or maybe sped up to 500ms) * Input is changed to GB from Back + GB * Delay from neutral and heavy soft-feint is removed *Important change:* Acts as a command grab, or a stronger GB. The vulnerability window for a command GB is wider than for a regular GB. Example is a 700ms attack, which has 100ms of GB vulnerability, would have an additional 200ms for a command GB, making the command GB vulnerability 300ms overall. The biggest difference is that Toss would be 500ms, can be countered like a GB, but can't be dodged or rolled out of, only CGB'd or bounced off if it hits beyond its extended GB vulnerability window. The toss would still throw the enemy to the ground and confirms a heavy. &amp;#x200B; **OS Heavy after Kick or Toss** * Damage is reduced by 35 from 40(only for after the kick and toss) Getting 40 damage off of a bash is too much, especially when HL has 400ms side dodge recovery. &amp;#x200B; These changes may be radical, so some feedback is necessary."
264,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Warlord Full Block Rework,1,ak7wif,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ak7wif/warlord_full_block_rework/,2019-01-27 13:23:38,"Warlord's coming update looks great and is full of changes that should've been made months ago, but notable made very few changes to fullblock aside from reduced penalties. This rework focuses entirely on his fullblock stance. Instead of giving him a single input as a reward for blocking attacks like conq he has a multitude of options, along with its current rapid deploy time (200 ms), in exchange for a low amount of guaranteed damage. &amp;#x200B; **Changes and Numbers:** (All of these are from full block) Side Heavy, 700 ms, 30 damage, unfeintable, uninterruptible with 200 ms startup, 300 ms gb vulnerablity, both sides Top heavy, 900 ms, 35 damage, soft feintable to gb, dodge, fullblock or nothing, unblockable Lights are standard neutral lights w/ sup. block, 500 ms, unblockable and damage boosted on successful block (After a successful block) light input, 500 ms, 13 damage, unblockable unparriable, guaranteed Heavy input, same as top heavy described above, opponent's hitstun ends 400 ms before attack lands, not guaranteed! (Changes to Full Block in general) Can cancel recoveries into full block Can dodge forward out of full block Externally blocked attacks cost no stamina to block (cooldown of 200 ms after target switch) Can zone from full block (also neutral zone should chain) All full block attacks and counters are chain starters &amp;#x200B; **Explanation:** I'll just go down the line and explain these one by one, starting with the new heavies. You may have noticed that his side heavies now have 300 ms of gb vulnerability, up from the previous 100, and are slightly slower. His lights will now be used to interrupt gb attempts. Instead, his heavies are a safe-ish way to trade with incoming hits thanks to their quick hyper armor start up. WL can now also attempt his superior block lights out of FB, rather than trade, but also risks a light parry. Top Heavy gives him an unblockable attack with multiple soft feints and can be used immediately after a block to force an opponents reaction, but is NEVER guaranteed. Make them reads baby. His only guaranteed counter is his simple stab, for 13 damage, but is now actually guaranteed. &amp;#x200B; Canceling his recoveries with full block would add a bit of depth to his play and also be a good way for him to get his trades and block lights in. Only allowing him to dodge forward gives him quick access to headbutt but still allows opponents to react to the dodge, as well as making him a bit more vulnerable to bashes. External blocks costing no stamina is something a bit iffy about so I'd like to hear input on that, along with zone. Allowing all his attacks to start chains means that he can initiate his own offense off of counters rather than being force to wait for opportunities to counter to get his damage in. &amp;#x200B; That's pretty much it feel free to call me casul scum shitting up the comp sub in the comments"
265,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Everything Wrong With Every Character,1,al3sjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/al3sjs/everything_wrong_with_every_character/,2019-01-30 06:40:21,"Long-winded post from a mid-high level player (I'd say I'm a high level player, but I am handicapped by lower FPS and latency issues at times). What I mean by ""wrong"" is more along the lines of ""What makes this character unfun to play as/against?"" While balance is certainly one of the biggest factors in this, it's not necessarily the only thing I like to think of when it comes to a champ. One-dimensional playstyles can put a character squarely in the middle of performance but make them extraordinarily boring, while things like being incredibly quick can be strong, but frustrating. Some of the things I'll list can be dealt with by some of the roster, but if it affects a decent portion of the roster, then it's probably a problem. This is also a mixture of duels/4v4 modes, as I play both and don't consider either one more important than the other. I'm sure one of these has been made, but I figure there's no harm in putting it in my own words and seeing what people think. Perhaps I'll even learn what popular opinion is and how wrong I actually am. &amp;#x200B; Let's start with the knights/Romans: &amp;#x200B; **Warden** \- I actually don't think there's much wrong with Warden except for one thing: the fact that he can cancel SB after the animation has gone off. This hasn't been an issue for me in most cases except against very practiced wardens, but when it *is* a problem, it's a major one. It effectively makes it impossible to guess correctly, since he can react to your reactions more often than not and punish accordingly (late-canceling SB into charge if you roll away, for example). There's a reason he's top-tier, and I'd say it's purely because of the late SB nonsense. Warden has virtually no issues with any champ and can deal with/adapt to almost any situation due to the versatility of SB. Otherwise, Warden is fairly average, with average light attacks and damage around the board. &amp;#x200B; **Conqueror:** What is there to say that hasn't already been said? An incredibly frustrating, 1-dimensional bash that just pokes you to death (even more quickly in 4s). One thing I often hear being said is that Conqueror has no tools outside of bash, but his quick lights and exceptional defensive tools (with one of the best option-selects in the game) make me think otherwise. Without bash, he certainly wouldn't be S-tier, but he wouldn't be a complete slouch either. &amp;#x200B; **Peacekeeper:** PK's main issue is how over-reliant she is on the insane speed of her zone. If a turtle chooses to, they can essentially negate your offense simply by having their guard in the right position. On the other hand, if the opponent isn't great or if they're playing a reflex guard character (Gladiator has it particularly bad), she can chew them up with how fast and overbearing her zone attack is. Or, at least, she *would* chew them up if her damage weren't so abysmal. Sometimes I like to count how many times I have to hit an opponent to kill them and compare it to how many times they have to hit me. The worst thing is playing in 4v4s with her, because god forbid someone has the Thick Blood feat. It's never worth fighting someone immune to bleed, and it's even worse that it happens to be Warden, who PK already struggles with. I'll be glad that she is receiving a damage buff in this upcoming patch, even if it's only a little bit, though it doesn't help much with dealing with turtles. &amp;#x200B; **Lawbringer:** The most viable strategy with LB is to simply sit and wait for your teammates to arrive, which is entirely possible and even likely considering how good he is at defense. Once they arrive, it becomes a matter of waiting until they can impale and Long Arm you. That being said - in a 1v1, you're useless, and without reliable teammates, you're semi-useless. Feats help, but only so much, especially after the nerfs. **Centurion**: Extraordinary wall-splat punishes, and a decently safe offense with variable timing on heavies, but otherwise suffers from the same issues as PK. A turtle can be insanely difficult to crack as Cent, and you can only rely on feats so much. His punch may as well only be allowed on a pin, since using it at any other time is just asking to be punished. If he were able to cancel punch, or follow up a whiffed punch with something, it would feel so much better, but would probably still get punished by dodge attacks. In ganks, he feeds revenge and contributes nothing except in very niche scenarios. If he didn't have a crazy punish game with walls, he'd probably be down with Aramusha and Shugoki. **Gladiator:** Fast, subtly animated lights, and a zone that is still somehow not changed are the only tools in Glad's arsenal that really matter. Toe stab is annoying, but fair in most cases, but zone attack mostly speaks for itself in how dumb it can be. Most Glads, thankfully, do not have a ""I have to win no matter what"" mentality, but if you do meet one, you'll pretty screwed unless you're playing particular champs that can deal with effectively (which is a minority on the roster). If it were up to me, the zone could stay as fast as it is, on the condition that it be punishable on block (AKA dodging the bash and blocking the hit) and also not be able to be canceled, so that using the zone is committing to it. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; On to Vikings: &amp;#x200B; **Raider:** Raider is polarizing for me. In 1v1s, I tend to see Raiders only turtle, which is annoying and frustrating, but I can't blame them due to how much parry bait their attacks are. In 4v4s, I hate Raiders, because Stampede Charge seems to be the only attack they know, and it effectively guarantees death if the enemy team is even a little coordinated and actually hits you while you're being knee'd in the face. Either way, it's extraordinarily boring and unfun. Raider, in my opinion, needs the Kensai treatment simply because numbers won't fix his issues. &amp;#x200B; **Warlord:** Somehow, Warlord always manages to be incredibly predictable, yet still frustrating. The predictability comes from his extremely limited kit, of course. However, the fact that he has constant, borderline unreactable pressure from headbutt, combined with decently fast and subtly animated light attacks, makes him annoying to fight against and boring to play as (in my opinion of course). His unlocked charge is something else entirely, but even without it, or against a player that takes care to not go OOS, he is still strong for annoyingly boring reasons. &amp;#x200B; **Berserker:** Sure, I can understand the idea of the hyper armor being a part of Zerk's kit - after all, the theme is to take hits and fight through them anyway. Y'know, like a crazy, berserk guy. Zerk's lights and feint-game are also incredibly annoying to deal with considering how quick they are, but with two small handaxes, I can't say it's out of the theme either. My main issue with Zerk is how quickly they can rack up damage, seeing as how they already have other tools that let them hit frequently and semi-safely. If their damage was toned down, I wouldn't mind losing to them because I would know that I'd have a decent number of opportunities to parry or at least block correctly. As it it, Zerk is the ultimate assassin killer since most assassins can't deal with his hyper armor very well, and he does very well against the rest of the roster as well. &amp;#x200B; **Valkyrie:** I consider Valk to be on the cusp of being balanced, if perhaps a bit flat. Her damage is mediocre, and her chains are fast but semi-predictable. With a slight damage buff, I honestly think she'd be pretty alright. She especially needs a buff on her heavies, which, as far as I can remember at the moment, are the weakest in the game (barring PK heavy w/o bleed). &amp;#x200B; **Highlander:** I consider HL to be on the opposite side of Valkyrie, with his damage being maybe a bit overtuned but otherwise being decently balanced. He has many ways to deal with others, but others also have many ways to deal with him (barring a portion of the roster of course). Nothing he has makes his 4v4s game any dumber than his 1v1 game - in fact, I think his 1v1 is actually stronger, but perhaps I'm wrong. Once again, my main issue is his insane damage, which means making a fairly easy-to-make mistake against him is way too punishing (which is a theme with many of the best champs, like Warden). If his offensive stance heavies were nerfed by even 5 damage, it would mean you'd be allowed at least one more mistake by most assassins. Another issue I have is with backstep light attacks in defensive stance, but I'm not entirely sure how to address it. It shuts down offensive pressure from some champs completely, while being kinda useless against others. I personally think backwards-moving attacks should be removed completely, from every champ, but that's just me I guess. In every other case besides HL, backstep-attacks usually just result in useless whiffs (you could argue Aramusha uses it to get into chains, but eh) &amp;#x200B; **Shaman:** My unpopular opinion is that Shaman is the gold standard of balance, alongside Kensai, with Kensai eeking out Shaman only barely in terms of balance (due to Shaman's bite). Shaman has a good, varied moveset, soft feints that are actually threatening but not impossible to deal with, damage that is not overbearing, but not mediocre, and a move that applies strong pressure, but requires some setup (with that setup not being impossibly difficult, but not easy against good players). If Shaman's bite didn't have such insane damage and swing on it (a 75 damage total swing is not ok no matter what move it is, in my opinion), I'd put her right on a pedestal with Kensai. In 4v4s, the bite does become extra bullshit because it's essentially instant death so long as your team isn't full of potatoes and they actually wait for you to bite first. I feel the damage should be toned down significantly (like the new Demon's Embrace, for example). Either that, or at least remove the heal or stamina regen so it's less overbearing. &amp;#x200B; Finally, on to the Samurai: &amp;#x200B; **Kensai:** As I've mentioned, Kensai is my gold standard of balance, with a perfect mix of options, damage, and utility. I can rarely think of a time when Kensai is ever useless in either 1v1s or 4v4s, and yet I almost never feel frustrated losing to one, knowing that it's usually of both my mistakes *and* their skill that caused me to die. Kensai is also an excellent gank-buster, an average ganker (maybe below-average, but not everyone can be amazing at everything), and a great duelist. When I think of Kensai, I think: *Fair* And fairness is one of the most important things when it comes to balance *and* fun. &amp;#x200B; **Shugoki:** In the same faction as one of the fairest champs in the game is this guy, my main, the Goki. I won't waste time talking about him since he's being reworked, and because everyone already knows the meme that is Shugoki. Hopefully 40 reps on him won't be a waste with this new rework. &amp;#x200B; **Orochi:** I feel like Orochi is so *close* to being that gold standard of balanced, but is still missing something. What that something is, I can't quite put my finger on. His light attacks are annoying, but I feel like are no less fair than many 33/33/33s in the game (and oftentimes less punishing on a failed read). His damage is fairly good, but not overbearing in my opinion. Perhaps it's the lack of an opener and his reliance on the swiftness of his lights that puts me off, but I am not experienced enough in Orochi to say for sure. &amp;#x200B; **Nobushi:** I am also really inexperienced with Nobushi, but I do know that fighting a good one is a hellish experience because it's like being turtled to death, except they're using Hidden Stance instead. 1v1 Nobushi is the best turtle in the game, and one of the most frustrating things to deal with if you're not playing the right champion (and sometimes even if you are). It's another one of those issues I feel like needs to be addressed from the ground up, because Nobushi's *other* options are simply not viable. She can't light or heavy out of neutral without expecting to get parried. In fact, she can't really do *anything* outside of Hidden Stance without expecting something bad to happen. In 4v4s, Nobushi is apparently better, but despite being labeled as one of the best 4v4 champs in the game, I am not quite sure I see it (besides being a decent team-fighter and a decent setup enabler for Shaman). &amp;#x200B; **Shinobi:** God. This champ is 1st on my personal list of ""Most annoying"" champs, despite him not necessarily being particularly good (worse than, say, Berserker, Conq, Warden, HL, Kensai, Shaman, Warlord, etc). Like Gladiator, he has the potential to really be one of those ""I have to win no matter what"" champs, in which case he can spam/threaten unlocked dash kick constantly with very little danger to himself (if they're a practiced asshole, at least). Shinobi is another champion that needs to be redesigned from the ground up, in my opinion, as his current moveset is horribly predictable but is made viable purely through extreme safety or pure swiftness. His damage is also overbearing, and while I know that the tradeoff is that he has the lowest healthpool in the game, it really ought to not be that way - he should have more health, but less damage, so that every fight isn't a matter of small mistakes swinging the entirety of the encounter. Finally, a personal (but legitimate, I think) gripe - in 4v4s, the new trend seems to be that crowd control moves (Shaman bite, Demon's Embrace, Caber Toss) can be interrupted by allies who are overzealous or dumb and hit you prematurely. Jiang Jun has a variant where the target of his choke takes significantly reduced damage. So, why is it that Shinobi's grab cannot be interrupted by allies? It is essentially Demon's Embrace, a guaranteed death sentence, but better, as it is ranged and difficult to see/hear when you're busy with other players (and even if you're aware, if they time it right, it doesn't matter). The same could be said about Raider's Stampede Charge and being a nearly guaranteed, uninterruptable death sentence in gank scenarios, but since Raider isn't as annoying in other aspects, I let it be. Ideally, all crowd control abilities of that sort would be standardized and interruptible by allies. Also, I realize my bias is showing in this one. Killing a Shinobi is one of the most satisfying things in this game, even if, overall, he's really not that great of a champ. &amp;#x200B; **Aramusha:** So, Aramusha is probably the most top-end/bottom-end champion in the game; he is near useless at the highest levels of play, and a complete noob-stomper when at the bottom. The recent change to his Deadly Feint was, in my opinion, a good thing, as it actually allows him to get some hits in when he manages to get his chain started (or rather, *if* he manages to get his chain started). However, he is hugely reliant on getting it started, which subsequently relies on your opponent not parrying your easily-parried heavies, or not blocking your easily-blocked lights. Additionally, disengaging from him when he *does* get it started is fairly easy, so it ends up not being as rewarding as it ought to be. Blade Blockade is a funny meme to use, but the activation is too slow and the timing is awfully strict, meaning you have to read your opponent like a book (in which case a simple parry might be better and easier, especially if it's a light). If the tools he has from Blade Blockade were available in other ways, he might actually be viable *and* stylish, but as it stands, he's one of the worst in the game with barely any viability in 4v4s or 1v1s. &amp;#x200B; And finally, the Wu Lin: &amp;#x200B; **Tiandi:** In my eyes, Tiandi is essentially Conqueror 2.0 (or 0.75, since he's not quite as good). At their core, they play similarly, with their bashes being the cornerstone of their power. Tiandi has the added benefit of having 400ms lights from neutral, and incredible i-frames on his dodge attack, though the guardbreak vulnerability on it means it's only useful vs. some champs. In any case, because Tiandi plays like a Conq mixed with some added light spam, it just adds up to another unfun hero. In 4v4s, I'd argue that Tiandi is even more overbearing than Conq due to his feats, which allow him an extreme amount of survivabililty and which can easily lead into multiple revenge-farming situations in gank scenarios (in which I believe Tiandi outperforms Conqueror due to the quickness and relative strength of his attacks, specifically his zone). &amp;#x200B; **Jiang Jun:** Besides his janky animations, I think Jiang is pretty weak even in 4v4 scenarios. In 1v1s, he relies purely on the jank of his animations to hit you, since his attacks are pretty average in speed (though the follow-up light *looks* like it's incredibly fast because of the nonsense animation). His finisher heavies can be option-selected pretty reliably, and outside of him parrying you and getting in some of his absurd damage (seriously, 28 damage - with another possible/probable 20 on follow-up light - is crazy for a heavy parry), he doesn't have much going on. I'm not entirely sure what I'd even want to do with him, since it kinda feels like he's got a decently fleshed out kit that just doesn't work that well. When/If he ever gets his animations made less wonky, he'll be significantly weaker I believe. In 4v4s, his feats are his saving grace, as they are absurdly powerful (the healing one specifically), and also on a relatively low cooldown (his fireworks being the main offender). On a side-note, Jiang is at a power level that I'm afraid the new Shugoki remake will be at - tolerable, not the worst, but ultimately kinda meh even if it is thematic. Hoping for a Goki that sits around the gold standard. &amp;#x200B; **Nuxia:** If you lag vs. Nuxia, you die, and if you have perfect latency, she can't do anything vs. you. That's the essence of Nuxia in 1v1s. Her traps are indeed useless if you have even a half-decent reaction time on good latency, while having even middling latency (or worse) drastically increases their power. She is the definition of a light-spam hero, even when compared to other heroes who were supposedly meant to be the light-spam champs (thinking of you, Aramusha). If she gets a chain of lights started, it can be incredibly annoying, even if the damage isn't particularly potent. In 4v4s her power is just... not fun. Not fun in ways that even the other, more gimmicky things can't quite contend with. Her traps in a gank situation are incredibly difficult to deal with unless you're really spectacular at the taunt tech, and even then they can open you up to other enemies if they time it correctly. If you choose to deal with her traps in other ways (light attack, dodging away, etc), it just inherently makes you unsafe in a way that you can't really compensate for. Her feats are also just annoying, due to how frequently they come up and how much they can affect a 1v1 *and* a team fight, *and* how effective they are minion clearing. When I say ""feats,"" I actually mean ""feat,"" as in her caltrops. Her Infection move is also pretty dumb, as it's essentially an undodgeable ""You're dead"" move without available healing, but since it's her ultimate I suppose it's not any worse than many other ultimates. &amp;#x200B; **Shaolin:** I used to think Shaolin was horribly broken, but upon further reflection, I do still think he's annoying, but not necessarily overpowered. While Qi stance applies a crazy amount of pressure, turtling even mildly can make it a chore to even get into Qi stance. Holding guard at top makes it so that he has to do his slower, more parry-bait lights on the side, and he has to bait you into *not* parrying his heavies in order for him to get into Qi stance (either that or deflect you). Once in Qi stance, he suddenly becomes a massive pain in the ass and very unfun to face, but not entirely unfair - he does have to make a decision quickly, and not every decision can end well for him depending on the caliber of his opponent (though, let's be honest, it's a lot harder for the opponent to make a correct decision than it is for the Shaolin). His feats are annoying, but not the worst of the game by far. People seem to get worked up over teleport kick, but it is, in my opinion, basically a better kunai/crossbow (but also worse sometimes depending on the context). Overall, I've come to accept that, even though I hate Shaolin personally, I don't think he's overpowered. Annoying? Yes. Enraging sometimes? Sure. But ultimately, I actually think he falls somewhere near Kensai in terms of balance, which is surprising to see myself type out. Still a wee bit too strong to be right at that gold standard, but not too far off. &amp;#x200B; **Side-note:** The Wu Lin voices are by far the most annoying, which makes them extra unfun. Even after having spent some time in China myself, I can't say I find the language to be particularly kind on the ears, and certainly not when it's being yelled at me. But that's neither here nor there I suppose. I hope if this game survives for the years to come that we'll have an Arabic/Middle Eastern faction of some sort purely for the language. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Anyway, I was bored, so here you go. Feel free to read if you're bored too. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR: I complain a lot and I can complain about basically every champion.** **Except Kensai. You're pretty alright.**"

I am mainly referring to his forward dash heavy, sprint attack and zone. His bash is another story Atm, forward dash heavy is a weak move. Its slow (600ms), has poor tracking and the damage is mediocre (20 i think). If it has better tracking and better range, enough to catch rolls, it would be much more useful. Kinda like warden dash heavy but less overtuned. I have had trouble catching rolls. Yeah it can be delayed, but the tracking is still poor so it's easy to avoid. His zone I still don't see the benefit of (700ms is slow). All I have managed to use it for is to intermingle it in with his regular bash to throw people off. It's tracking is pretty good but it also has 400ms GB vulnerability. As far as I have manged, it only has a light follow up. I have no idea how to fix it or what should be changed, but his standard bash is more stamina efficient and has the same follow up. In duels, people rarely use it. In 4s it feeds too much revenge and you will most likely get gbd. His sprint attack is rubbish. I have had it parried 99% of the time in dominion and was only successful in killing 1% HP players who are running away. Its tracking is fine but it needs to be faster. It's a 1000ms attack that isn't unblockable so it poses very little threat. His bash could use a slight damage nerf to 15 I think and its fine. If it will be made slower then it will be useless. The dodge timing isn't hard to nail down. I know a lot of people ask for a gb on dodge but I disagree. Warden's SB has 3 different versions so it's much more powerful than BP's bash. Conq's has much better tracking. Both of them warrant a GB on dodge. I definitely think that it needs to have a large enough recovery so that dodge attacks can catch it. There are plenty of posts discussing bash so I won't focus on it. What do you think?"

I've recently decided to get off my butt, put down my controller (I'm pretty sure the A button is broken anyway, damn GBs), and do some stats to help the community. There are a number of subjects commonly discussed here that might be contextualized by a survey. Recently (about 2 weeks ago), /u/LimbLegion made a [post](URL asking people what mechanics in the game are the most difficult for people to deal with. This got me thinking about overall game design and how this community might benefit from understanding which mechanics give different kinds of players the most trouble. After reading up on past posts on this topic, listening to competitive players' YouTube videos and Twitch streams, and doing some thinking, I've come up with a list of attack types on which I want to conduct the survey. **The attack types for the survey are to be evaluated as a person trying to predict or react to the attack.** Each one is tied to the hero that best exemplifies the mechanic. The survey will be structured as what is called a ""[Best-Worst Scaling](URL survey, which is also known in the USA as ""MaxDiff"". Rather than poll you on a ""Rank from best to worst"" or ""Choose how important this is from 1 to 5"", which tend to yield inconsistent results and cluster answers, BWS asks you to make trades. The survey will present a set of options to you and ask which options are the ""Most Difficult to Deal With"" and the ""Least Difficult to Deal With"". If the total number of options is around 20, the number of options in each question would be around 5. There would be around 20-30 questions depending on the number of options. Each time the options will shuffle and change. At the end of a BWS survey the analytics will show not just **what the community's ranking of the mechanics are, but what the relative difference in difficulty of the options are as well**. To ground the options to something beyond just the relative ranking scale, a followup question will follow each normal question and ask about the difficulty of all the options in a more traditional 1-3 selection. This method is called ""Anchored Best-Worst Scaling"". But I can't just rely on what I've thought up. As Johnny Five said, ""[MORE INPUT!](URL The most important part of preparing such a survey is to establish two things: 1. Have you thought about the mechanics listed before? 2. Do you know what each mechanic is within the game? If I have not thought about the mechanics before, I probably am not prepared to make trades on them. If I don't understand what the mechanic is, then I *definitely* am not prepared to make trades on them. So I thought it would be best to compile the list of mechanics that will be in my survey here. I will post the list of mechanics and how I define each of them, and I am asking you all to comment, suggesting mechanics or rephrasing them to be more clear. After a few days, I'll rewrite the list of mechanics based on your suggestions and make the survey, posting a public link for you all to access. **The survey will include questions about you as a player and a Redditor. This is to make sure we have real people results, so that we can tell you what players like you struggle against!** These questions will require a link to your account on Reddit or Twitch, as well as on [FHTracker.com](URL If you actually play For Honor, you should have an account there. Yes, getting these links is a pain, but I need to be able to verify that you are all actual human beings! If I cannot tie the data to a real person from these links I will have to discard your data. There will also be questions about your playtime, duels rank, and favorite heroes. Some of this data, if you don't know it offhand, is on For Honor Tracker. Here are the attack types I have so far: 1. 500ms Light attacks (Most heroes) 2. 800ms Heavy attacks (Most heroes) 3. GuardBreaks (Every hero) 4. 400ms Light attacks (Orochi, Berserker, Nuxia, etc.) 5. 100ms GuardBreak vulnerability on parry attempts (Gladiator) 6. Softfeintable Unblockable Heavy attacks (Kensei, Highlander, Berserker, etc.) 7. Feintable Unblockable Heavy attacks (Raider, Shaolin, Warden, etc.) 8. Unfeintable Unblockable Heavy attacks (Centurion, Shugoki) 9. Zone Option Select (Peacekeeper, Conqueror, Berserker, etc.) 10. Deflects (Berserker, Shinobi, Orochi, etc.) 11. Dodge attacks (Kensei, Tiandi, Jiang Jun, etc.) 12. Undodgeable Dodge attacks (Orochi, Berserker, Tiandi, etc.) 13. Softfeintable Dodge attacks (Tiandi, Jiang Jun) 14. Feintable Dodge attacks (Tiandi, Shaolin, Jiang Jun, etc.) 15. All-Block attacks (Conqueror, Warlord, Valkyrie, etc.) 16. Crushing Counters (Highlander, Shaolin, Warden, etc.) 17. Unreactable Bash attacks (Conqueror, Shaolin) 18. Reactable Bash attacks (Gladiator, Tiandi, Highlander) 19. Softfeintable Bash attacks (Tiandi, Highlander) 20. Feintable Bash attacks (Warden) 21. ""Grab"" Bash attacks (Shaman, Highlander, Shugoki) 22. Heavy Soft Feints to Bash (Valkyrie, Conqueror, Tiandi) 23. Heavy Soft Feints to GuardBreak (Peacekeeper, Kensei, Centurion, etc.) 24. Heavy Soft Feints to Light attack (Peacekeeper, Shaman, Jiang Jun, etc.) 25. Heavy Soft Feints to Dodge attack (Berserker, Kensei) 26. Target Switch attacks (Nobushi, Jiang Jun, Kensei, etc.) NOTE: This is just how difficult you find a specific attack is to react to. So Berserker's heavy feint lights are just 400ms light attacks. Tiandi's kick, which has multiple soft feint options, is placed in ""Softfeintable Bash attacks"". "

276,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Contesting the Belief That Warden Has a Losing Matchup with Conqueror,1,a75ezc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/a75ezc/contesting_the_belief_that_warden_has_a_losing/,2018-12-18 10:46:37,"TL;DR at the bottom, but if youre going to disagree with me, please read the whole post. I see a lot of comments and such on this sub where people are convinced that Conqueror beats Warden handily in a 1v1. However, there is usually no explanation to why this is the case, or the reasoning they do give is dubious at best. Most of the time, they will say uuuhh...he has a faster bash and I heard he has good option selects and thats about it. I do not at all see how that leads to Conqueror easily winning the matchup, if at all. To start things off, I want to address something that many people seem to overlook. Yes, it is true that Conqueror has multiple parry option selects and yes, they are very strong and the majority of what makes him a good defensive 1v1 hero. However, what people often seem to forget is that these are effective tools to compliment *parries* and thats it. The vast majority of Wardens offense (if considering optimal play) comes from his shoulder bash, which is a melee attack. Melee attacks obviously cannot be parried, so Conquerors option selects are useless. This means that the majority of what makes Conqueror a strong 1v1 hero is completely irrelevant in the matchup. The only time Warden would really attack that isnt following a shoulder bash would be a feinted bash into valiant breakthrough to catch rolls, but this attack cannot be feinted anyway, so there is no need for a parry option select. The rest of Conquerors kit (that has any reason to be used, aside from boredom) is his shield bash, and while this does see use in the matchup, I do not believe it leads to him winning it. Shield bash has two main purposes (not considering his superior block dodge because Warden doesnt throw attacks): the forward bash *can* be used offensively, and side dodge bash *can* be used defensively. However, neither of these options are as brainless and safe as the main sub would lead you to believe. First off, allow me to clarify how shield bash works mechanically. Conqueror has 600 ms dodge recovery for both forward and side dodges, and the shield bash itself is a 500 ms attack. On forward dodge, the bash can be initiated anywhere from 100-500 ms into the dodge, and 300-500 ms on side dodge. Offensively-speaking, the side dodge bash is strictly worse, so I will only be talking about the forward dodge bash. While it does have a large input window, there are only two timings that actually matter, when the opponent is considering dodging. When a Conqueror does a forward dash, there are four main outcomes: early bash (at 100 ms), fully delayed bash (at 500 ms), gb (at 600 ms, the end of his dodge recovery), or do nothing. If Conqueror successfully lands a bash, it guarantees a light attack for 13 damage. If he lands the gb, it confirms a side heavy for 25, top heavy on wallsplat for 33, or a charged top heavy on max range wallsplat for 44. As for responding to shield bash, there are a few options. Because the bash itself is 500 ms, dodging it will require a read from most players, although it is possible to be dodged on reaction if you are sharp enough. I mentioned earlier that there are only two relevant dodge timings. When the opponent sees a Conqueror forward dodge, they can side dodge right away to both avoid the early bash *as well as* cgb, in the event that the Conqueror did a forward dash into gb. If the player reads that Conqueror will do the delayed bash, they dodge later. The reason that these are the only two timings that matter is because the early dodge covers everything but the max delay bash, which is covered by the later dodge timing. As for punishing the shield bash, whenever it is dodged on prediction (making a correct read), you can gb the Conqueror for free. If you dodge the bash on reaction or barely dodge in time, the gb can be countered. If you want to be completely safe from shield bash, you can always dodge at the early timing and, if you see that Conqueror has gone for the delayed bash, you unlock roll. Obviously, the roll will not allow you to punish the delayed bash, but because the nerfs to unlock roll only affected gb vulnerability, using it *on reaction* to the delayed bash will work just as before. As for Warden, things are different. He has 300 ms recovery on forward dodge, to Conquerors 600. While Conquerors shield bash has a fixed speed and variable input window, Wardens shoulder bash has a (mostly) fixed input window, but can be charged for different lengths of time. Shoulder bash can also be initiated out of any dodge, including backwards. The fastest possible shoulder bash will hit 700 ms after activation (including both charge and travel time), and can be extended to a maximum of 1300 ms on a full charge. The minimum charge is referred to as level one, any charge between minimum and maximum is level two, and maximum charge is level three. Shoulder bash **can also be feinted** as late as 100 ms after movement has started, and is often followed up by gb or valiant breakthrough. On a successful level one or two bash, Warden confirms a double side light for 18 damage, and can flow into another shoulder bash charge. On a successful level three bash, Warden gets a top heavy for 40 damage. On gb, Warden gets a side heavy for 30, or a top heavy on wallsplat for 40. A successful valiant breakthrough does 20 damage. Similar to Conqueror, dodging shoulder bash is done on read (the combination of both a faster speed on the attack itself and the possibility of a feint means that dodging on reaction to the attack being released is effectively impossible). However, unlike Conqueror, there is no guaranteed way to simply avoid shoulder bash altogether. If the Warden reads that you are going to dodge early, it leads to another read for whether or not the opponent is going to roll. Valiant breakthrough will catch rolls quite effectively, but cannot be feinted and is an easy parry if baited. If a shoulder bash is successfully dodged, the opponent gets a gb, unless dodged very late. Now we get into the Conqueror vs. Warden matchup. Due to both heroes having a bash on dodge, the reads become a little bit different. Against shield bash, Warden can punish with a side or back dodge shoulder bash at appropriate dodge timings. Against shoulder bash, Conqueror can side dodge early to punish a level one bash, or quickly forward dodge bash to punish a level two or three bash. In effect, the matchup boils down to a read-based game of bashes punishing the opponents bashes, with the odd gb or valiant breakthrough sprinkled in. It is also worth noting that level three shoulder bash has substantially more range than level one or two, meaning that Warden can largely play outside of Conquerors reach. *Now,* I will get into why I do not believe Conqueror wins the matchup. Firstly, shoulder bash is Wardens strongest tool, and one he will use liberally in the matchup. Conquerors strongest tools are rendered useless again Wardens bash-based offense. In every one-to-one comparison, Warden gets more damage than Conqueror, aside from the case of a max range wallsplat from Conqueror. As the damage in the matchup nearly exclusively comes from landed bashes, the fact that Warden gets minimum 18 damage, with the possibility of 20 on valiant breakthrough or 40 on level three bash is very significant, especially when compared to Conquerors 13, as well as the fact that Warden also nearly always out-damages Conqueror on a successful gb. But what is arguably more important than the damage numbers is the fact that Warden can feint his bash, and Conqueror cannot. Considering the entire matchup is typically won and lost by baiting out a bash from your opponent that you can punish, this is a huge advantage. Warden has many more options to bait out a committed bash from Conqueror (for example, charge a shoulder bash to bait a shield bash, feint the shoulder bash and dodge the shield bash for a punish), and calling Wardens bluff is much more complex. Coupled with the fact that Warden can choose to roll away from all of Conquerors options, while Warden can catch Conquerors rolls with valiant breakthrough, the Conqueror is under much more pressure to make correct reads than the Warden, and the reads he has to make are more complex. If Warden gets the health lead, as long as the map is big enough, he can easily avoid all of Conquerors pressure and stall for time, if the match has a time limit. Conversely, Conqueror is always subject to Wardens pressure because there is no option to avoid all of Wardens options, not to mention that valiant breakthrough and Wardens sprint attack are good chasedown options, in the event that Conqueror tries to run away. This means that Warden can always come back against Conqueror with a string of good reads, plus he does not need as many to close the health gap because of his higher damage. The only thing Conqueror has over Warden is 10 extra health. TL;DR, I dont see how Conqueror has any advantage over Warden in their specific matchup. Warden has more damage, more options, more reach, constant pressure, chasedown tools, *and* gets to make full use of the best parts of his kit. All Conqueror has is 10 more health and a slightly better time hitting a sleeping Warden because his fastest bash hits 100 ms sooner."
277,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Revenge in its current iteration is heavily flawed and needs a rework from the ground up.,1,a7i96e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/a7i96e/revenge_in_its_current_iteration_is_heavily/,2018-12-19 13:46:02,"TL;DR Revenge gain changes to prevent gaining it in 1v1's or when out-numbering an opponent , changes to the revenge state to make it more consistent and a change to the over-shield to prevent opponents from turtling the revenge user to death. -- Revenge as a whole is a currently heavily flawed system needs to be reworked to make it's intended role as well as prevent abuse of the system itself.. Before we get into how to fix revenge I feel it's important to educate people on how the revenge system currently works to clear up any misunderstandings. * So what exactly does the revenge state do? Well I'm glad you asked , it: * Provides a 30% stack-able universal damage buff for duration. * Gives you a flat 120 over-shield that disappears after revenge duration ends. * On activation auto parries all attacks that can be parried causes enemies to fall down for 1600 ms. 100 ms activation time , you are locked in place for this 100 ms and can be gb'd you can counter gb it though , 900 ms of active frames , any action except movement can cancel this early after 200 ms have passed. * Completely cancels any current momentum on activation. * Provides the uninterruptible status to most moves (Does not get applied to your gb attempts). * Lasts 8 seconds * On activation allows the canceling of almost all recoveries. * Guarantees a guard break if activated immediately after you block your opponents heavy if it has 600 ms or move of block recovery. * On activation allows you to cancel your own gb attempt. * On activation cancels your parry animations granting you more ms to get a punish in. An example would be a zerk parrying a heavy then immediately activating revenge to cancel the parry animation to allow him to get a top heavy off it. * On activation allows you to cancel any gb attempt on you / some cc. * While active provides you with priority over enemy attacks , meaning you can attack or gb an opponent out of anything except another gb ignoring their normal vulnerability windows/recovery times. * While active grants gb immunity when preforming an attack/ while in recovery of your own moves. * While active grants characters using a charging or hold move super armor , meaning gb's will wiff , bashes wont stagger you , unblockable hits wont stagger you , regular hits won't stagger you. * While active causes all parries/throws and some melee attacks to knock enemies down for 1600 ms. _________________________________________________ * So thats what the revenge state currently does , how do you enter it? Well in order to enter the revenge state you have to accumulate enough revenge meter. The amount is different for each warrior and depends entirely on their base total health-pool. * So for example a warden with 130 hp requires 130 points of revenge to enter the revenge state. Where as a Shinobi with 110 health only needs 110 revenge points to enter the revenge state. * So then the obvious question then is how does one accumulate revenge points to add to their revenge meter? Well the answer is somewhat complicated and in order to address it we are going to explain how different types of attacks give different values. * To start any melee attack that doesn't have a set value of damage grants the target a flat 30 revenge to their revenge meter."

However, this also means that if you have revenge, you can react to guardbreaks with a heavy attack.

Since you are in revenge, this also means that you get a full revenge throw punish Characters like Centurion can get over one-hundred damage on reaction to being guardbroken.

279,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Tweaks to the Wu Lin Heroes - Marching Fix,1,9w5t9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9w5t9l/tweaks_to_the_wu_lin_heroes_marching_fix/,2018-11-12 04:51:05,"So, the Wu Lin Heroes have been out for almost a month now, and players have gotten to learn their movesets fairly well. Whilst the Wu Lin in general are well designed and have varied and powerful movesets, (leaving some of the older cast feeling almost obsolete), there are some significant flaws for most of them, which ought to be fixed. Now, before I get started, I want to address a criticism I got when last discussing the Wu Lin: suggesting fixes to the Wu Lin *by no means implies that I think they are a higher priority to fix than the older heroes.* The reason that I am suggesting tweaks to their movesets now, is that these are pretty minor tweaks that can hopefully be implemented on a short timescale, and having just been released, it might be possible to tweak their moves in a shorter bug fix, without having to wait however long for a full ""rework"". As Eric Pope has recently requested specific balance feedback, I feel that it is important to give feedback on these new heroes. There are several members of the older cast in *far greater need of balancing*, but the reworks those heroes require (Shugoki, LB, Cent, Warlord etc...) are far more in-depth and would require a lot more development and animation work. If you are interested in my suggestions for the older cast, feel free to check out my other rework proposals linked at the bottom of the post. As previously, I have put a summary at the start, and gone into more detail in the body of the post. I have not touched on the Wu Lin's Feats much as I have not had enough experience with them to suggest balance changes, although some of them (Soothing Mist, Slippery?, Teleportation?!) may have to be looked at. I have also included my Nuxia suggestions from my previous post for completeness. Also thanks to [Freeze](URL for his excellent framecheck videos, and many other community members for testing these characters and finding bugs and issues. &amp;nbsp; ## Summary **Jiang Jun:** - Damage nerfs: side light finishers 18, side heavy finishers 37, top heavy finisher 42, all zone variants 25 - +100ms delay between Choke and zone (prevents guaranteed zone after choke without buffered guard switch) - Forward dodge heavy: - HA after 400ms to counter interrupts - soft-feint to side light opener after 200ms, 15 damage, 500ms, counters early side dodge. - Unblockable heavy finishers: - improved tracking to prevent back-walking, - soft-feint to GB to catch back dodges - Zone out of Sifu's Poise has HA after 200ms - Dodge cancel Sifu's Poise after 400ms, recovery to attack 600ms - Possible change: Side dodge heavy cannot be hard feinted, but can be soft-feinted to Sifu's Poise - Improved tracking on second hit of running attack - Bugs: - Prevent some attacks hitting walls behind JJ - Fix animations to match attack speed - Increase parry window on OOS heavies like other characters - Fix hitbox for left side heavy finisher - Side heavies should be affected by superior block - like all other zone attacks should be too (relevant to multi-hit zones) **Tiandi:** - Side Dodge Heavies: - Have i-frames until feint timing, and for 100ms extra if unfeinted (ie. 800ms) to prevent interruption from chained attacks and on reaction, improve viability in team fights. - Either: 2 second stamina regen freeze on hard feinting - Or: Can no longer hard feint, add soft-feint to palm strike. - Dodge Lights; - Start from 200 to 500ms into dodge (up from 200 to 300ms) for better use to actually dodge attacks - Superior block starts immediately (earliest 200ms into dodge) to allow use on reaction - (Optional: Chain lights: sides 400ms 13 damage, top 15 damage, 500ms.) - Slight improvement on range/tracking of forward dodge heavy - Back dodge recovery standardised to 900ms - Bugs: - Fix unlocked guaranteed second light - Fix guard switch delay bug after attacks that come from a fixed direction (zone, dodge attacks) **Shaolin:** - Damage nerfs: Side triple lights 10 + 4 + 6 for 20 total. Undodgeable Qi stance side heavies 28 damage, light after sun kick 18 damage, unblockable after sun kick 33 damage, heavy finishers 33 damage. - Damage buffs: neutral and chain heavies 28 damage - Can delay side dodge heavy from 200 to 400ms into dodge - Side dodge heavy: - Either: chain starter, but cannot flow directly into Qi stance (can go into chained lights or heavies) - Or: Faster recovery into neutral attacks (as if chaining into them) - Can dodge out of Qi stance with a 100ms delay (less vulnerable to fast bashes) - Sun Kick Sweep confirms a heavy - Make feint to Qi stance an official part of his moveset - holding heavy after feinting any Qi stance heavy attack goes back into Qi stance. Now works if Qi stance was entered from a light attack or if guard is changed during feint. - Bugs: - Remove Qi stance flicker bug - Side dodge heavy has undodgeable blue weapon glow when it should be white - Side Qi Stance heavy has regular white weapon glow when it should be blue **Nuxia:** - Traps: - Recovery on a whiffed trap reduced from 700ms to 200ms, making them much safer. Unpunishable on reaction with a light attack, unless Nuxia has buffered her own light attack. Still punishable on a read with light attack or GB. - Traps also work if none of the opponent's guards are active blocking, or throwing an attack, preventing unlock/emote countering and requiring a reaction from assassins - Deflect follow-up is enhanced and can start chains on block - Zone is a 2 hit attack, 500ms 10 damage short range, 1000ms 20 damage long range, stamina cost 50. Would require no animation changes. - Heavy finishers move the opponent even if blocked, making the move much more threatening. - Top light finisher 500ms 17 damage, reducing reliance on 400ms lights - Side dodge attacks variable delay from 200 to 500ms into dodges - Forward dodge attack can come from any guard direction &amp;nbsp; ##Jiang Jun - Choke Me Harder Granddaddy If you browse the main For Honor subreddit, or turn on text chat in the game itself, you will no doubt see many players complaining about how brokenly powerful JJ is. Whilst he does have excellent Feats, and great damage values on reasonably fast and wide-sweeping attacks, that make him fearsome in team fights, he is fundamentally broken in a 1v1 scenario, [lacking any effective offence](URL In particular his forward dodge Heavy/Shin Kick mix-up and Unblockable Heavy Finishers can be completely avoided on a single dodge timing making them nigh-on useless if your opponent knows JJ's moveset. Additionally, his signature Sifu's Poise is lacklustre both defensively and offensively, except against certain attacks (for example Highlander's Kick/Toss mix-up). Without addressing these issues, JJ will quickly become irrelevant in 1v1 scenarios. Finally a lot of his animations are pretty janky, and cause damage before they visually impact, which is causing a lot of players difficulty, and ought to be fixed, as well as some very strange hit-boxes on some of his attacks. **Damage and Punishes** JJ's damage across his moveset is fairly (but not obscenely) high, making him a bit of a team-fight monster, and giving him some extremely high punishes. I am suggesting some minor damage nerfs, and changes to his punishes. - **Side Light Finishers 18 damage** (from 20) - **Side Heavy Finishers 37 damage** (from 40) - **Top Heavy Finisher 42 damage** (from 45) - **All zone variants 25 damage** (from 28) - Additional **100ms delay between his Dou Shi's Choke punish and a buffered Zone attack** to prevent him getting a [guaranteed zone on assassins and opponents who haven't buffered a guard switch](URL This removes his 33 damage heavy parry punish from choke to zone. - This brings his heavy parry punish to 25 from his zone, 10 from a choke into light, and 47 with a wall (choke into wall into shin kick into top heavy). **Forward Dodge Heavy - Mighty Sanction** This move was intended to be JJ's opener: equivalent to Kensei's opener top heavy with the Shin Kick being JJ's version of the pommel strike. Unfortunately, unlike Kensei's top heavy, all the options from JJ's Mighty Sanction can be dodged on the same early timing, also allowing you to counter guard break his feint to GB. The attack is also very slow - 1000ms after 233ms of dodge, but he has no answer to fast attack interruption like Kensei does with his dodge cancel. My suggestions are: - **Hyperarmour from 400ms into the attack** (633ms after the dodge starts) to prevent light attack interruption. Does not continue into the Shin Kick, so that can be interrupted on a read. - **Soft-feint into either side light openers, 15 damage, 500ms after 200ms of the attack.** This would give him an option to counter early side dodges, but be otherwise reactable. I considered allowing a soft-feint into zone, but this would do too much damage, cost too much stamina, and still be countered by static guard characters holding their guard to the left and early dodging. Alternatively, the move could be given very good side tracking to follow early dodges, but that would look strange and I feel that a light soft-feint is more interesting anyway. - **Slightly increase forward range on unfeinted attack**. Despite the large movement and huge size of his Guan Dao, Mighty Sanction does not actually have that large range, and should be improved slightly (~1m) to close gaps and catch rolls. **Unblockable Heavy Finishers** Whilst at first glance these moves could be threatening, they can easily be avoided by dodging and sometimes just walking backwards, and JJ's feint to GB would miss. The only option JJ has to defeat a reaction back dodge is to feint to forward dodge to shin kick, which uses up almost his entire stamina bar. I suggest: - **Slightly improved forward tracking** to prevent walking out of range - **A soft-feint to GB** with improved range to catch back dodges (GB soft-feints normally have more range than hard-feinting to GB for some reason) **Sifu's Poise** At first glance this may seem like an effective defensive tool, a ""Hidden Stance"" that also regenerates stamina, but in practice, Sifu's Poise often puts JJ in danger more often than not - it cannot be dodged out of, and has 800ms recovery during which he is completely vulnerable to GB or to any attack. His only offensive option out of Sifu is his Sifu's Swirl zone attack, which is 600ms and without HA, so JJ cannot use Sifu's Poise to dodge and punish any chainable attack. My suggestions are: - Add **hyperarmour to his Sifu's Swirl zone attack after 200ms**, to give him an effective way of punishing dodged attacks - **Allow dodge cancelling of Sifu's Poise after 400ms**. This would only be available from his regular Sifu's Poise, not his OOS version. Dodges out of Sifu's Poise cannot be cancelled into a second Sifu's Poise. - **Recovery to light or heavy attack out of Sifu's Poise reduced to 600ms**. This would give him some more options offensively out of Sifu's Poise - (I considered allowing a Shin Kick out of Sifu's Poise but decided that would be too powerful. If you think this would be a good idea, please give your opinion in a comment) **Side Dodge Heavy - Mighty Backslash** Many players consider a feintable side dodge attack to be overpowered, as they can not be punished if baited. Interestingly, these complaints mostly seem to concern Tiandi, despite JJ's side dodge heavy actually having decent i-frames, unlike Tiandi's. Personally I think the high GB vulnerability on his side dodge heavy makes up for how powerful feinting it can be, but I do have a suggestion to change this for JJ. I would be interested to hear the competitive community's feedback on this and Tiandi's feintable dodge attack too: - Optional: **Mighty Backslash can no longer be hard feinted, but can instead be cancelled into Sifu's Poise.** **Hitboxes, Tracking, Animation, and other Bugs** - Some of JJ's wide arcing attacks cover a large area, which can cause some issues in cramped locations. With his back against a wall, JJ's side heavies and zone attack often bounce off a wall that is off-screen behind the player, which can be very frustrating. This should be fixed so that **walls behind JJ do not prevent him from attacking**. - The tracking on his running attack is abysmal, particularly the second swing. This should be improved. - Many of his attacks hit and cause damage before they visually should, particularly his chained light attacks. This is confusing, and his animations need to be improved to more accurately reflect his attack speeds. - JJ's side heavies [work like zone attacks](URL which means they have a fixed stamina cost (regardless of parrying, missing etc) and ignore superior block. This allows JJ to avoid many superior block punishes. I am of the opinion that **all zones should be affected and interrupted by superior blocks**, and this would fix JJ's unusual ability to avoid some superior block counters (like Highlander's Crushing Counterstrike for instance) - The hitbox for his left side heavy finisher often phases through opponents. - The parry window on his OOS heavy attacks is not extended to 400ms as it is for all other character's OOS heavies, making them much more tricky to parry than expected. &amp;nbsp; ##Tiandi - ""Special"" Dodges Tiandi is undoubtedly a powerful hero, the only cast member to have access to both a safe, fast, bash in his palm strike, and easy-to-access multi-direction 400ms lights (partially due to being able to dodge cancel his recoveries). But unfortunately for a hero described as a ""Dodge Specialist"", his dodge attacks leave a huge amount to be desired. These suggestions aim to make his dodge attacks a greater focus of his kit, and potentially de-emphasise the light attack ""spam"" aspects of his moveset. **Side Dodge Heavies - Dragon Dodge** Both the most characteristic and disappointing of Tiandi's moves, when first revealed in the closed breach test, this move was incredibly powerful, useable both as a mix-up from neutral, an incredibly powerful defensive tool due to being feintable, and made Tiandi very slippery in group fights. Unfortunately the version we have in the release version of Marching Fire is a shadow of its former self. The Dragon Dodge itself now only has 300ms of i-frames (after 200ms of dodge) so can not be used from neutral, as it is trivial to interrupt, [with every character having an attack that can hit the Tiandi after the i-frames, but before the feint window](URL This also makes it nigh on useless in team fights, as any stray attacks will hit the Tiandi during slow start-up and large movement. Ironically it is not even particularly good as a defensive tool compared to many other dodge attacks: whilst it cannot be parried if baited, unlike other dodge attacks, its high GB vulnerability means it will be caught by feint to GB, and due to its slow speed and lack of i-frames, it gets hit by most chained light attacks, and sweeping attacks. Even where it supposedly shines defensively, against bashes, it is actually lacklustre compared to most other dodge attacks. Its slow speed means that many characters can recover after their bash to block it, unlike faster dodge attacks like Orochi's, Berzerker's, Shaman's, or Kensei's. The only bash against which it is better than the mentioned dodge attacks is Warden's, and even so, Warden can feint his bash into a zone and catch Tiandi before the feint window - so it is not even the most effective defence against Warden: Hidden Stance and Valk's fullblock backdash are both superior for example. Even vs Highlander's Kick-Toss mix-up, it is a worse dodge attack, as if you get stuck near a wall your movement may stop, and the grab will catch you. As the most characteristic of Tiandi's moves, Dragon Dodge simply must be buffed to be useful and given decent i-frames. Unfortunately with significant i-frames it may become far too powerful a defensive tool, and so my suggestions are: - **Improve the i-frames on Dragon Dodge significantly, at least up to the feint window (700ms) and an additional 100ms of i-frames for an unfeinted attack (800ms)**. This would allow it to avoid interruption from neutral, dodge chain attacks, and be usable in group fights - As this would make the Dragon Dodge very powerful defensively, I propose one of the following: - Either: **Dragon Dodge can no longer be hard feinted, only soft-feinted**. Also in addition to soft-feinting to dodge a **soft-feint to Palm Strike is added**. This is my preferred option. - Or: **Hard feinting Dragon Dodge costs an extra 10 stamina (32 total) and freezes stamina regen for 3 seconds**. This makes the feint cost similar to other powerful defensive tools like Hidden Stance, and ensures that it is not cheaper to hard feint into a second Dragon Dodge than it is to soft-feint into it (currently you can hard-feint to DD 5 time before running OOS, but only 3 times if you soft feint it.) **Light Dodge Attacks - Tiger Dodge** Tiandi's second type of dodge attack, the light attack Tiger Dodges, are also somewhat disappointing. Whilst in the closed test they were very powerful, being immune to GB and having a very generous superior block window, this is no longer the case. The superior block now has the slowest start-up of any superior block attack in the game, at 100ms start-up + 200ms of dodge, making it impossible to use on reaction to fast attacks, and even fail to counter early parry attempts soft-feinted from Dragon Dodge. Additionally, the lack of i-frames, poor delay window and negligible lateral motion means that it is very difficult to use Tiger Dodges to counter-attack bashes or any other attack for that matter. This leaves Tiger Dodges as predominantly an opener, where its undodgeable property makes it easier to parry than its 500ms speed might suggest, or to interrupt dodges on prediction. I suggest: - **Increase the delay window into a dodge from 200 to 500ms** (up from 200 to 300ms). This would make it significantly easier to use it to counter-attack with. - **Improve the start-up of the superior block frames by 100ms to start instantly** (ie. After 200ms of dodge). This should allow it to be used on reaction to faster attacks, and would be necessary to counter parry attempts if the ability to hard feint Dragon Dodge is removed. **Chain Lights - The ""400ms"" Vanguard** A large part of Tiandi's strength comes from his tri-directional 400ms lights. He is the only hero to have tri-directional 400ms lights and also a fast bash attack in the form of his palm strike. With improvement to his dodge attacks, this additional power may be a bit too much, so I am suggesting a couple of nerfs to his chain lights to de-emphasise them somewhat. This change is optional and I would appreciate hearing your opinions on this: - **Side Light Finishers, 400ms, 13 damage. Top Light Finisher, 500ms, 15 damage**. This is a small damage nerf to his 400ms lights, and would make blocking them a 50/50 instead of a 33/33/33. The small damage buff to his top light comes at the cost of slowing it to 500ms, but is not greater, as this is also a buff to Palm Strike. **Other Tweaks and Bug Fixes.** There are a few more tweaks I would like to see, and also various bug fixes: - **Increase range on forward dodge heavy slightly**. This attack is rather good, but sometimes falls short when it doesn't seem like it ought to. Improving its range slightly (~1m) would make it better for closing gaps and catching rolls. - **Decrease recovery after a whiffed Palm Strike to 600ms** for block (from 700ms) and dodge (from 1100ms?! Dodge specialist my arse...) - **Normalise backward dodge recovery to 900ms to block** (as standard) - Fix hitstun on [unlocked light so that a second light is not guaranteed.](URL (This may be fixed by slowing the top light to 500ms anyway) - Remove the guard switch delay after an attack that comes from a fixed direction (eg. Zone, dodge attack) as shown in [this thread](URL &amp;nbsp; ##Shaolin - Monkey Business With the introduction of Shaolin, we have ""beheld a miracle"" - a well designed new character, with a varied and interesting moveset, that doesn't entirely rely on a single overpowered tool like some of the recent reworks have. Shaolin is a character with a very high skill ceiling, and of all the Wu Lin is probably the best constructed. That being said, he has a couple of issues which would be useful to address to future-proof the character, and his damage is slightly too high in places and could be tweaked. These changes are intended to emphasise his flow slightly more. **Damage Changes** The damage on some of Shaolin's attacks are rather high, considering how fast some of them are. Conversely, his basic heavies deal an unusualy low amount of damage for their speed, with only poor Valkyrie having lower damage. (PK has 11 extra damage from deep gouge) - **Triple Side Lights: 10 + 4 + 6, for a total of 20 damage**. 24 damage on a neutral 500ms attack is too high, especially considering that he has a neutral 400ms attack too. - **Undodgeable Qi stance side heavies 28 damage** (from 30) - **Light after Sun Kick 18 damage** (from 20) - **Unblockable after sun kick 33 damage** (from 35) - **Heavy Finishers 33 damage** (from 35) - **Heavy Openers and Chain Heavies 28 damage** (from 25) **Side Dodge Attack** Shaolin's side dodge heavy can feel a bit odd for a character with so much flow to his moveset, as it does not chain or allow entry into Qi stance (although his deflect does). This was probably done to encourage a more aggressive playstyle rather than a counter-attacking style, but I feel that counter-attacking should not be as de-emphasised as it is at the moment. - Either: **Side dodge heavy counts as a chain starter**. It **cannot flow directly into Qi stance**, but it can chain into his tri-directional 400ms lights, or chain heavies, which can. - Or: **Reduce the recovery on blocking or hitting his dodge attack**, so that he can have faster access to his opener lights and heavies, essentially chaining into his openers. This is my preferred option. - Allow the **delay on his dodge attack to be variable from 200 to 400ms into dodge** (was static 300ms). - The side dodge attack has a blue glow as if it were undodgeable, and this should be changed to white as normal. **Qi Stance** Qi Stance is the crown jewel of Shaolin's moveset, giving him access to his very powerful Sun Kick mix-up, undodgeables, unblockables, and defence via superior block. During the closed test Shaolin was also able to dodge out of Qi Stance, as one would expect for a character described as ""highly mobile"". I feel that this should be reinstated, to allow him some defence against fast neutral bashes when in Qi Stance. In addition there are some Qi Stance techs that should be either removed or made an official part of his moveset. - Shaolin can now **dodge out of Qi Stance with a 100ms delay**. Currently, feinting Qi stance and then dodging feels very sluggish, and this should ameliorate that. - **Sun Kick Sweep: this move should confirm a heavy.** Currently Shaolin's punish on a sweep is his triple light, but after nerfing the damage of that, and considering the speed of the sweep, I feel that it should confirm a heavy. This can be achieved by lowering Shaolin's recovery after a successful sweep. - **Feinting back to Qi Stance should be an official part of his moveset, available from all Qi Stance heavies by holding heavy and pressing feint**. [There is currently a tech that allows Shaolin to feint a Qi Stance top heavy back into Qi Stance](URL by holding the heavy throughout the feint, if he entered Qi stance from a light attack, and didn't change his guard during the feint. This is an interesting tech, and should be allowed on all Qi Stance heavies by continuing to hold heavy after feinting, regardless of how he entered Qi Stance or and guard switch occurring during the feint. - Qi Stance flicker bug. [There is a bug allowing you to flicker an attack indicator before kicking in Qi Stance,](URL and this should be removed. - The side undodgeable heavy has a white weapon glow, and this should be changed to blue as is appropriate for undodgeable attacks. &amp;nbsp; ##Nuxia - Traps Aren't Gay?

280,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Balancing the Knights Without New Animations (Revision #1),1,9wspfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9wspfq/balancing_the_knights_without_new_animations/,2018-11-14 07:20:53,"So, this is the follow-up of my first post of the same topic: URL This post is the new revised version of the old one, based on feedback taken. Thank you to all who provided it. I will continue to take in feedback for these changes and posting the revisions each week until we feel that no more revisions are necessary. Once that is accomplished, the final draft will be posted the the main subreddit to grab attention. So please, if you have problems with the suggestions, TELL ME THEM. Dont just scroll past. Otherwise, Ill just assume people like them and stop revising. I especially ask for more feedback on Centurion and Gladiator. There was very little talk about them, so I couldnt think of revisions to make. But of course, post any revisions you find necessary. To those waiting for the Vikings: Those will likely come this Friday/Saturday. My plan for scheduling is to post revisions each Monday/Tuesday and post a new faction each Friday/Saturday. Its going to get pretty hectic for me if constant revisions are necessary, so dont be surprised if this changes to revisions on both Monday/Tuesday and Friday/Saturday. (That doesnt mean I am discouraging you from posting revisions, as it is highly unlikely that I will nail it on the first try). Anyways, back to topic. **Keep it civil down there.** Remember: All these changes are intended to not need any new animations whatsoever (this includes new chains and new softfeints). The maximum that will be done in regards to animations will be the removal of some of them (for broken mechanics). I will also state that these changes are intended to be both balanced and interesting/fun. If I wanted to make this the easiest it could be, Id just start slapping 500 ms bashes and 400 ms lights everywhere, as they are obviously viable tools. But, I am trying to keep to the theme of each hero and create more interesting ways for them to play offensively. ___ **Warden:** - Slow neutral top heavy to 1000 ms. - Adjust HA timing on Fully-Charged SB to activate once movement begins. - Slow uncharged SB to 800 ms. - Improve the tracking on the UB heavy finisher to catch early dodges better. *The intention of these changes are to give Warden a designated counter: Pokes. By nearly removing the HA on his SB and further slowing his minimum charge, opponents will be more capable of poking Warden out of his SB with variable timings. This forces the Warden to play with feints more often to attempt to bait and punish lights.* *By slowing his top heavy to 1000 ms, this also slows Wardens overall DPS by reducing his light parry punish and his Charged SB damage to his side heavy (30 damage).* *The UB heavy finisher buff is really the only thing that can be done to help it without animation changes.* ___ **Conqueror:** - Remove the delayability of SB. - Slow all heavies to 800 ms. - Apply the UB property to successful CC heavies. - Speed up the chained SB to 600 ms. - Apply enhanced property to chained lights. - Reduce charged heavy guardswitch time to 100 ms. - Apply HA property to softfeint SB. - Remove chained SBs ability to wallsplat. - Allow softfeint SB to wallsplat. - Reduce forward dodge recovery. *The idea of these changes are fairly obvious. Nerf Conquerors neutral SB to still be a decent opener, but not be nearly as oppressive as it currently is. As a counter-balance, buff up his other offensive tools to make them actually useful.* *Since Conqueror has an infinite chain where he can chain into whatever he wants (although his chained lights are only 500 ms), a 600 ms bash in the middle of that could be threatening (more heavies than lights would likely be used), encouraging Conquerors to use more than simply their neutral SB. The fact that the chained lights are now enhanced means that players will have to go for risky options such as as parries or dodges in order to stop the chain, allowing for more light/heavy mixup potential.* *The reduction of speed of his heavies eliminates the majority of his option selects, as his heavies would now have 400 ms GB vulnerability. Raw heavies, softfeint FB, and softfeint SB will now be beaten by feint &gt; GB.* *The removal of the chained SBs ability to wallsplat is as a counter-balance to its increase in speed, as it would otherwise become too strong of a pressure when against a wall. This ability was instead given to the softfeint SB, as it is much slower and will only land due to being baited.* *Some QoL changes were the reduction in forward dodge recovery (in order to make dodge + GB a viable mixup) and HA on his softfeint SB to beat most option selects.* ___ **Peacekeeper:** - Allow heavy on GB. - Increase neutral heavy damage to 25 damage. - Increase delayability window for chained lights. - Increase chip damage against bleeding enemies to 40%. - Adjust feint timing of the second part of zone attack to 400 ms before impact. *Chip damage from bleeding targets will provide more incentive for Peacekeepers to opt for bleed (over just being extra damage) and, most importantly, provides some threat to just blocking too many raw heavies while bleeding, thus improving the effectiveness of her mixup. It also allows Peacekeepers bleed to become even more effective when low on health, as chip damage can be lethal while bleeding.* *Adjusting the feint timing of the second part of her zone attack allows Peacekeeper to now have an option to deal with dodges, as, currently, a dodge can entirely negate the mixup.* *Simple QoL changes here. Peacekeepers damage on her heavies comes out to about average including bleeds, but prevents Peacekeeper from frequently getting executions. This damage buff will both improve Peacekeepers max punishes and allow her to execute on critical health. This change will have no effect on her optimal GB punishes (her triple stab will remain the optimal GB punish), solely knockdowns.* ___ **Lawbringer** (this was REALLY hard and is going to get a bit crazy, just hear me out): - Remove Shove-On-Block. - Increase stamina pool. - Apply UB property to all chained heavies (including finishers). - Apply HA on all heavy finishers. - Apply enhanced property (do not stagger on block) to all chained lights. - Speed up all chained lights (including finishers) to 500 ms. - Improve UB heavy tracking to catch backdodges. - Increase neutral Shove stagger to guarantee a light (only the neutral one). - Speed up neutral Shove to 600 ms. - Speed up Long Arm to 800 ms. - Slow down Impaling Riposte to only be guaranteed on light parries. - Improve GB tracking after a Shove to dominate whiffing. - Apply damage reduction to victims of Long Arm throughout the animation. - Apply HA to neutral zone attack. - Speed up zone attack to 700 ms. - Apply UB property to a zone attack after parry. *So yes, this one is a lot of changes. But all of them are still number and property changes. The idea is this: Lawbringers UB pressure in his chains will be his main opener. Without the ability to backdodge from his UBs and the fact that his LHH chain will have two UBs in a row, he should be able to apply respectable pressure on the opponent and force reactions.* *His enhanced lights (while they can still be parried) can still be used to access these UBs, and the fact that they are 500 ms means that delaying them can slightly help in preventing them from being parried. Theres nothing else that can be done with them without new chains or making them 400 ms (which does not fit Lawbringer well).* *The neutral Shove was given the ability to guarantee a light, while it was still kept as reactable. With its HA, Lawbringers can use it as a trading tool if they have a health advantage.* *The Shove after a heavy will allow him to still continue the same light/GB mixup or allow him to chain directly into an UB heavy.* *Long Arm was sped up just as a QoL feature and HA was applied to Lawbringers neutral zone to allow it to be a better option select (by trading with feint &gt; light). The zone attack was also made 700 ms (to have 100 ms GB vulnerability and, thus, make it a viable option select) and was given the UB property after a parry, in order to better increase its anti-ganking potential.* *The big nerf to Lawbringer was to his Impaling Riposte and his Long Arm after an Impaling Charge. His Impaling Riposte will no longer allow for such high damage off a heavy parry and the damage reduction will no longer allow him to essentially guarantee insta-kills off teammate GBs and parries. The duration of the animation and the fact that there is still no damage reduction while the enemy is on the ground still allows it to be a good ganking tool (just not off completely full health enemies).* Credit to u/vGinja for the following suggestions for Lawbringers zone attack: URL He wasnt a commenter on my previous post, I just saw his post and stole his zone attack ideas, so I thought Id credit him here. ___ **Centurion** (this ones also pretty crazy, but hear me out and, hopefully, when I put all the pieces together, it will make sense): - Speed up all chained lights to 500 ms. - Decrease side heavy damage to 20 damage (including neutral charged side heavy). - Slow top heavy to 700 ms. - Increase kick stagger time to guarantee a heavy. - Improve the tracking of Charged Jabs to catch early dodges (similar to Warden Charged SB). - Decrease Eagles Talon damage to 30 damage. - Adjust Charged Pin hitstun to no longer guarantee Charged Jab, and only guarantee regular Jab. - Speed up neutral fully-charged side heavy to 900 ms. - Increase the input window for the parry punish. - Adjust feint timing of UB Charged heavy to 400 ms before impact. *Centurion received some significant changes here. The general idea is to shift Centurions strength away from turtling for his ridiculous wallsplat punish and more towards aggressive, mixup-intensive combos.* *Decreasing his heavy damage further (putting him as the character with the least damaging heavies. Move over, Valkyrie) was as preparation for the other changes, to keep his punishes reasonable.* *His kick has not been made any less reactable (as it both would be lazy to make it another Warlord Headbutt, as well as it would be weird to see a kick that fast). Instead, it now guarantees a heavy, meaning, in Duels, it still serves as a poor opener, but if used after conditioning the opponent, catching the opponent by surprise after a feint, etc. it will deal decent damage and allow you to chain into the Jab mixup. This also can aid in his teamfight capabilities.* *His tracking on his Charged Jabs being improved will enable it to be an actual mixup and be his main opener. Uncharged Jabs would guarantee a light for 15 damage, while Charged Jabs would knockdown for the now only 30 damage Eagles Talon.* *To address his wallsplat punish, his Charged Pin no longer guarantees a Charged Jab, only a regular one. This should put his wallsplat punish down to 45 damage (30 from UB + 15 from light), which is strong but not as insane as it was before.* *His neutral side heavy being sped up allows it to be guaranteed on a light parry. This is to prevent him from having god awful light parry punishes and puts it at 35 damage (20 from charged heavy + 15 from light). However, the top heavy has been kept at 1000 ms in order for him to keep his 25 damage GB punish, while not having access to a 40 damage light parry punish.* *And finally, some QoL changes were to increase his chained light speed to 500 ms, increase the input window for his parry punish, and adjust the feint timing of his UB Charged Heavy to allow it to be used as an actual mixup and not just when guaranteed.* ___ **Gladiator:** - Remove ability to feint the zone attack. - Speed up all chained lights to 400 ms. - Allow his deflect to beat HA. - Reduce chained light damage to 11 damage. - Reduce all stamina costs associated with Skewer. *Gladiator was honestly much simpler than he seemed at first. He has most of the mixups he needs, but his most threatening one (his Skewer) simply uses up too much stamina to be viable (feelsRaiderman).* *400 ms lights are not unusual for assassins, but what makes these ones special to Gladiator is that he can chain many of them in a row (three 400 ms lights in a row), but they are difficult to access due to the fact that he cannot use a heavy to access them. He must use backwards lights, get a poke, get a heavy parry, etc. to access them. The reduction in damage is to prevent them from being too oppressive when combined with the consistent 20 damage he can land with his zone.* *And finally, his deflect beating HA should allow him to properly get his punish off deflects against characters like Berserker.* ___ So, thats all the Knights. Please leave your thoughts below. Again, this is a living document. Once I take in more feedback, I will readjust and post the second revision (as long as mods are OK with it). Please keep it civil and remember: We all want For Honor to be a balanced, fun game. None of us are here to actively hurt the game (hopefully). Just to tack on one more thing: I am in full support of just slapping on an extra 25 health for every character. With the direction of the game, a bit higher TTK could be helpful. 25 extra health is a good number to use as a little bump, but not too much so as to affect feats and a persons ability to stall in team modes. ___ **Possible Revisions** (based on feedback and personal thoughts) *Struckthrough text indicates original suggestion being changed by the revision.*"

It's a bit annoying for everyone involved. **Light Opener**: 500 MS, 18 dmg **Light Finisher**: 500 MS, hyper armor, 10 dmg, stuns, staggers back, can wallsplat (like Valkyrie side light finishers) **Heavy Opener (and charged heavy by extension)**: Hyper armor. Top attacks stun. Can be feinted or soft canceled into guard break with more flexible timing during the charge. If fully charged, recovery is the same as that of a normal finisher. Fully charged top attack deals 70 dmg. Also maybe cut down on the GB vulnerability. **Heavy Finisher**: Hyper armor. Same damage as openers; it's kind of weird that they currently deal less damage. **Zone Attack**: Hyper armor. **Headbutt**: Can be placed after the end of a chain or after an opener. 600 MS, can be dodged. Should remain a defensive zoning tool to try and keep you safe during attack recovery or while low on stamina or something. **Oni Charge**: Hyper armor. Knocks down as before. ***However***, Shugoki will get no guaranteed damage from knocking down an opponent. **Demon's Embrace**: Hyper armor. No longer damages Shugoki on whiff or saddles you with a ten year recovery time. Also remove the one shot. Always deals damage equal to 8 + 1/2 of Shugoki's missing health, then heals Shugoki for an amount equal to the damage dealt. **Demon Ball**: Hyper armor. 30 dmg, can initiate an execution. &amp;#x200B; ***Some new stuff that might be cool, if you're into that kind of thing.*** **Parry counter moves**: If you light attack out of a parry, Shugoki should straight up slap the guy in the face and swear at him in Japanese. That would be awesome. It would do the same stuff as a headbutt, but also 20 damage. A heavy attack out of a parry could be a feintable version of demon ball. **Stance**: Using the same input as full block or sifu stance, Shugoki could have a stance in which he drops his guard and gains GB vulnerability, gains hyper armor and bash immunity, as well as some damage reduction. He could feint heavy attacks and zone attacks with the stance, and do any of his normal attacks straight out of it. **Openers**: A fairly quick forward dash heavy might be nice. Nothing scarier than a 7 ft fat man running you down with a tree trunk, am I right? He could also have some kind of light attack soft cancel out of his charged heavy that stuns people with the pommel of his weapon or something. &amp;#x200B;"

Not even that, but when I do use the dodges sometimes they bug out and don't work (although that might be down to messed up key presses and button mashing). &amp;#x200B; Tiandi's dodge lights have been very hit and miss to my experience, with it very often failing to dodge even top attacks and being too slow to use on reaction as a Superior Block/Crushing Counterstrike counter to side stance attacks. And it doesn't dodge side attacks either. Yet it can consistently dodge Lawbringer's ""Shove on Block"" and when doing so behaves exactly the same as Orochi's dodge lights with the Tiandi spinning around the Lawbringer while hitting with the dodge light. This animation does not play when you use dodge light on most other moves, like normal lights and heavies. So far, the only consistent use I've found for the Tiger Dodge is as a soft-feint from a Dragon Dodge. Is there any other use for this move? Using it from neutral seems like a free light parry most of the time, and the side Tiger Dodges lack range anyway. &amp;#x200B; As for the Dragon Dodges, honestly they seem pretty terrible as far as defensive moves go. In fact, it seems more common to Dragon Dodge an enemy light only for the opponent to throw a second light and hit me out of the Dragon Dodge. The GB and attack vulnerability on Dragon Dodge startup is fair but it gets really annoying when you are hit out of an almost completed Dragon Dodge by a chain light, Kensei Heavy or a Raider Zone. Its like Dragon Dodge has no i-frames at all. Not only that, but if Dragon Dodge an attack most of the time the opponent can recover and guard against my attack before it hits. This move seems anything but consistent and the only time I even use it these days is to set up a Tiger Dodge soft-feint or using the forward dash heavy as an gap-closer and opener. Is there any other use for this move? The worst part is the times where an almost completed Dragon Dodge just soft-cancels with a normal side dodge. I don't even have to press any buttons; it just happens automatically and randomly and its has cost me several games already. &amp;#x200B; Can anyone help me make the most of Tiandi's dodges?

He also undertook a Q&amp;A answering some questions from the community, mostly from the megathread on the main subreddit. [They also said that Stefan would be returning in this week's Warrior's Den](URL and would again be answering questions from the community. I wanted to take this opportunity to compile a list of balance and fight system related questions from the Competitive Subreddit, some of might can hopefully be answered in this week's WD. Please post any questions you have and I'll add them to this post. Let's try and keep them specific, and try not to repeat questions that they addressed last week, although questions regarding last weeks answers are of course valid. I have no doubt that there will be too many for the devs to answer in a single Warrior's Den, but hopefully they will be able to give answers to some of the most popular questions. Please give feedback on my questions as well - I don't want to waste the devs' time with useless questions. Before diving in with the questions, I would like to express my gratitude that the developers are taking a more open approach communicating about balance with the community. I particularly appreciated Stefan coming on and answering questions from the community, and admire the way he was frank and realistic about issues facing the game. Considering how volatile the internet and gaming communities can be, it was courageous to give such a factual and reasoned rebuttal to complaints about ""light spam"". I really enjoyed seeing some in depth discussion about balance (and I'm looking forward to the Shugoki rework!). Thank you Stefan, Mr Pope for deft moderation, and the whole team for taking this more open approach, and continuing to support this fantastic game. I'll get the ball rolling with questions, as I have *quite a few*. I've put a summary at the bottom, as I do have a tendency to go on a bit: &amp;nbsp; **Firstly, in response to Stefan talking about improving offence across the cast by reducing reactability of light openers, and making feints more believable.** - ""Reducing Reactability"" sounds like a good way to improve offence, but **have the team considered other ways of reducing the effectiveness of defence - particularly blocking - that don't balance around reaction times?** For example some ideas that have been talked about in the community have been increasing chip damage on heavies, add stamina costs for blocking, or implementing some kind of move similar to ""throws"" in other fighting games, that deal a small amount of damage on an opponent who is only blocking (eg. Adding chip or stamina damage to guard breaks, even if countered). Balancing offence and defence around something other than pure reaction times might help reduce complaints from console players and those with slower reactions in general, and make ""reactability"" less of a problem. - Additionally, have you looked into removing the guard switch delay that prevents static guard characters from attacking for 200ms after a guard switch? This may improve static guard characters' offences considerably. &amp;nbsp; Whilst it may not fall exactly within the fight team's remit - **are you looking at improving the Fight UI in general?** - Improving players' abilities to chose a target in team fights would be a welcome change within this topic, but there are other issues with the fight UI in team fights that cause frustration and have balance implications. Issues such as attack indicators disappearing due to distant opponents' attacks or nearby feinted attacks, indicators oscillating sides if an opponent is behind you or moving around you, and so on. Additionally there are many areas where the fight UI could be improved: indicators for external guard breaks, some indication of whether an opponent is externally guarding against you, visual indication of guard break vulnerability, having an indication of opponents' revenge build-up, would all be hugely useful and welcomed improvements to the fight UI. &amp;nbsp; **Some questions about stamina in general:** - A while back there were some changes to stamina damaging attacks included in a patch that were later reverted. Is the team still working on a stamina overhaul, and what kind of changes can we expect? - Recently the stamina cost of feinting was changed to a flat 10 stamina - but soft-feints were not affected by this. **Will soft-feints get reduced/flat stamina costs soon as well?** - There are some really [unusual stamina costs on several attacks in the game](URL for example Orochi's Storm Rush, and Shugoki's heavy openers (they cost 22 to feint, but 33 if you hit with them?!) Are there any plans to look into these stamina oddities? How many of them are intended (for example the recent undocumented Shugoki stamina change)? - Currently the stamina cost of having an attack parried or blocked is dependant on the cost of the attack, which means that heavy attacks getting parried are far more penalised stamina-wise than light attacks. Some high stamina moves like Gladiator's Skewer or Raider's chained zone will put you out of stamina with a single parry, despite doing similar damage to other moves. With some parry counters (eg. Centurion, Gladiator, Jiang Jun) a single heavy parry will take almost all of your stamina bar - which heavily discourages offence. **Have you looked at changing the stamina penalties for attacks being parried/blocked/missed to flat values independent of attack stamina cost?** - A stamina issue, particularly with duels at high levels, is the ease at which a player can sprint away from their opponent and quickly regen all their stamina back. This can also be an issue in team modes, where faster characters can easily disengage and escape unfavourable fights. **Are there any plans to change stamina recovery after unlocking or whilst sprinting to address this issue?** &amp;nbsp; **Regarding zone attacks:** - Some zone attacks are 500ms and just as difficult (if not more so) to parry as a light attack, yet they all give heavy parry punishes (except Peacekeepers, which is also interrupted on block). Additionally they always cost a fixed amount of stamina, and can be used to ""option select"" parry. **Have you considered giving fast zone attacks a light parry punish to reward players for parrying these difficult to parry attacks?** This will be even more relevant if the ""reaction reduction"" changes are applied to zone attacks too. It seems bizarre that parrying a 600ms light with a guard switch delay is more rewarded than a 500ms zone without one. - Zone attacks are currently unaffected by superior blocks, which has some strange consequences, particularly with regard to multi-hit zone attacks (eg. Berserker's). This property means that counters based around superior block (such as Highlander's Crushing Counter, Warlord's full block) do not work consistently against mulit-hit zone attacks. This is rather unintuitive, **do you intend to make zone attacks affected by superior block?** - Relatedly, Jiang Jun's side heavies all count as zone attacks, in that they have fixed stamina costs and are unaffected by superior block. This allows JJ to Sifu Stance and avoid many superior block counters. Is this intentional, or an unforseen consequence of zone attack properties? Also, why do JJ's heavies have zone properties (ie. Fixed stamina cost) but Raider's chained zone attack does not? &amp;nbsp; **Concerning Guard Breaks:** - A while ago (season 5?) guard break range was normalised across the cast, but that does not reflect the in-game experience for many characters, particularly some of the slower ones. Characters like Aramusha and Jiang Jun cannot catch a backdodge from a heavy finisher by feinting to GB, whereas Berserker can, despite the attacks being the same speed. As far as I can tell, this is because locked-on walk speed contributes to *effective* GB range, which means that characters with slower locked-on walk speed miss GBs much more frequently. Is this assessment accurate? This is particularly noticeable for Shugoki, for example. **Are there any plans to alter GB range on a per character basis to compensate for different locked on speeds?** - Additionally GB tracking can seem really inconsistent sometimes - sometimes characters will slide around obstacles to GB you, other times they will whiff at very close range. Is there any explanation to why these unusual GBs happen? &amp;nbsp; **Concerning Reflex Guard:** - A common complaint seen on the For Honor subreddit is attacks seemingly ""phasing through"" a player's block - and this is particularly common for Reflex Guard characters, so much so that it is sometimes referred to as ""the reflex guard bug"" (although it can happen on static guard characters too). I feel like I have personally experienced it, and there are many gameplay clips showing it, although it can be hard to determine if it is a genuine bug or just players failing to block or parry. Having said that, some attacks seem to ""go through guards"" far more regularly, like Kensei's helmsplitter for instance. **Have you investigated this ""bug"" at all, and can you clarify if it is an actual bug or just players making mistakes? If it is a bug, has there been any progress made on fixing it?** If it is not a bug, can there be anything done to ameliorate the *feeling* amongst many players that it is a bug, for example adding a single blocking frame after a player has switched guards away, or at the start up of a parry? - In general reflex guard can feel very difficult to block multiple fast attacks, and newer players find this particularly the case. This is especially true if the first attack hits, and the second comes in the same direction, as the reflex guard resets to neutral, and guard direction needs to be inputted again, regardless of whether the attack was blocked or not. This can be difficult for newer players, and at a lower level encourages ""spam"" of light attacks in the same direction. It also makes defending against multiple opponents much harder as a reflex guard character. The game clearly teaches new players that reflex guard *decays over time*, but does not adequately explain that reflex guard ALSO *resets to neutral after every block or hit* - a property that is somewhat counter-intuitive. **Have you experimented with changing the behaviour of reflex guard to address this issue?** Perhaps allowing blocked attacks to refresh reflex guard, or allow a guard switch to be buffered during hitstun, to not penalise late blocking by eating the second attack. Or is this an issue which needs better tutorializing? &amp;nbsp; **Concerning Deflects:** - Another issue surrounding reflex guard characters is that of deflects. Despite their high rewards, in low to mid level play they are rarely seen, and in high level play they are less safe than parrying, being more vulnerable to feint to GB and so on. Part of the reason for this is that deflect frames are overridden by i-frames, which means that they are much harder to perform on side attacks than top attacks (only a 66ms window!). **Is the fact that i-frames take priority over deflect frames intentional, and if so what is the rationale for this? Have you considered changing it to make deflects more consistent to perform?** - A consequence of i-frames overriding deflect frames is that it is easier to deflect an undodgeable attack than a normal attack. This seems somewhat paradoxical, as it would seem that undodgeable attacks should beat dodges, not be more vulnerable to the special dodges of assassins. **Have you considered changing deflects so that they do not work on undodgeable attacks?** - Finally, deflects seem to be intended as a special kind of ""assassin-only parry"", but they do not work on unblockable attacks, despite ""deflecting"" an attack not ""blocking"" it - indeed, deflects do not stop light attacks from chaining. **Have you considered allowing deflects to work on unblockable attacks? If not, why?** &amp;nbsp; **Concerning Parry follow-ups:** - With the removal of GBs on parry, the input timings for some existing parry counters seem unnecessarily stringent. Compared to Jiang Jun's Choke, the input window for Warlord's, Centurion's, and Gladiator's parry counters are very tight. **Could the input windows of older characters' parry counters be normalised to reflect the removal of GB on parry, in line with JJ's?** &amp;nbsp; **Concerning special effects on attacks:** With the addition of the Wu Lin, you added a new mechanic in the form of Nuxia's Traps, but there are several existing mechanics on attacks that are fairly under-utilised. **Have you considered expanding any of these special properties in other character's reworks:** - **Enhanced Light Attacks**. Shugoki's light attacks allow him to chain even if blocked. Have you considered adding this property to some of the other slower light attacks in the game? - **Attacks that guarantee a follow-up attack on blocking them**. Several attacks in the game guarantee a follow-up attack if they are blocked but not parried. For example Nobushi's hidden stance heavies guarantee a kick if blocked. Is this kind of ""pseudo-unblockable"" property something we could see more of, perhaps with its own specific indicator? - **Attacks that beat hyperarmour**. Some grab attacks, like Berserker's deflect interrupt even uninterruptible (hyperarmoured) attacks. There are also some other attacks that pin an opponent, for example Gladiator's Skewer and Centurion's Charged Heavy. However these attacks do not beat an opponent's Uninterruptible attacks, despite appearing as if they should. Are attacks that beat hyperarmour something that might be expanded to other characters' moves? &amp;nbsp; **Concerning learning tools:** Whilst again, not necessarily the remit of the fight team, learning and training tools are relevant to educating the playerbase and helping players reach a better level of play where balance feedback is more reliable, so I think these questions are relevant: - The recent changes to learning resources in the game have been very welcome: the Training Arena, Heroes Tactics, co-op arena, an ""always exhausted"" option and so on are all great additions. Is development on these features continuing? In particular being able to train against multiple bots, and program specific sequences of moves to defend against are both highly requested changes. - Additionally, is there work ongoing to ensure that the tactics taught to players are accurate? (for example not telling players to GB after a parry...) &amp;nbsp; **Concerning the Wu Lin** **Are you planning on making any changes to any of the Wu Lin characters in upcoming patches, are you entirely happy with them, or are you waiting for more data before making any tweaks?** Because there are several issues that the community has brought up about the Wu Lin, that could be considered ""bugs"" in their movesets: - **Are you planning any tweaks to the damage values of the Wu Lin?** In particular Jiang Jun hits very hard for his speed, and so does Shaolin (except for his basic heavies which are rather low). - Almost all the **dodge attacks of the Wu Lin characters have fixed timings and cannot be delayed**. Is this intentional, and what is the rationale behind this? - **Tiandi** - are the **minimal i-frames on the side Dragon Dodge intended or a bug?** Currently it is trivial to interrupt Tiandi in a Dragon Dodge, often before the feint window (despite being vulnerable to GBs too). - The **superior block on his Tiger Dodges starts very late,** meaning that they can not be used to counter on reaction. Is this intended? (Additionally their delay window is tiny, so it is hard to use them to actually dodge attacks) - There are some obvious bugs in his moveset too: his unlocked second light is guaranteed, he has a guard switch delay after attacks that come from a fixed direction (eg zone), and the recovery on his back dodge is 300ms longer than normal. - **Jiang Jun** - Are you planning on ""fixing"" his offence in a 1v1 scenario? His forward dodge heavy mix-up can be completely avoided by an early side dodge, and his unblockable finishers + feinting to GB can be avoided by a back dodge. - JJ has a *very* high heavy parry punish - 33 damage with choke into zone, which is guaranteed against reflex guard characters. Is this intentional? - Last week you mentioned fixing his animations to sync better with his attacks. Are you also looking into fixing his hitboxes on attacks that hit walls behind him, and his left side finisher which misses more than his right side, fixing the overly short parry window on his OOS heavies, and making his side heavies affected by superior block (as mentioned regarding zone attacks earlier). -**Nuxia** - Last week you mentioned wanting her deflect to be punishable on a read, to compensate for its high damage. However, deflects themselves often require a read, and it only does 5 more damage than Orochi's despite that being guaranteed. **Would it be possible to allow her to chain lights even after a blocked deflect,** as a compromise (ie. Make it an enhanced light) - Last week you also mentioned not wanting to over-buff Nuxia's traps to be too powerful (which may cause complaints like Conq's bash). However the issue is less that they are not *powerful*, but more that they are *unsafe*, being able to be punished with a light attack on reaction. In the patch notes for Marching Fire, it was stated that the design intent was for them to not be punishable on reaction but on a read (hence chaining to a light attack after a miss). Unfortunately this is still the case, might it be possible to **make traps safer on reaction, for example by reducing their recovery to block?** - In Nuxia's zone attack animation, she links her swords and spins them twice around her head, hitting (or trapping) her opponent on the second swing - despite the first swing often clipping through her opponent at close range. Was her zone originally intended to be a 2 part zone (like Kensei's), and if so, why was it changed? Would you consider **changing it to a 2 part zone**, as having a 1000ms zone prevents her from option select parrying? - **Shaolin** - During the closed test, Shaolin could **dodge out of Qi stance**, but this was removed in the open test and Marching Fire release, leaving a Shaolin in Qi stance vulnerable to fast bashes. What was the rationale behind this change, and have you considered re-adding it? - Shaolin can currently feint his top heavy from Qi stance back into Qi stance in some scenarios. This is a cool, but presumably un-intended part of his moveset. Have you considered making it an official part of his moveset **allowing him to feint all his Qi stance heavies back into Qi stance consistently?** &amp;nbsp; **Concerning comments last week about Bot AI:** - Last week, Stefan said that work was ongoing to tweak the difficulty of bots in Arcade mode (despite Bot AI not being the fight team's responsibility). Whilst this is welcome, the main issue with fighting bots is not their difficulty, but how fun they are. Currently bots do not respond to feints, and react as well against 400ms chain lights as they do against 700ms chain lights. **Is there any work going into making bots more realistic, and fun, instead of just easier?** &amp;nbsp; **Finally concerning the pace of balance updates:** - What you said last week about not wanting the meta to jump around too much, and not wanting players to have to learn and unlearn constantly changing movesets is very reasonable. And as a community, we are glad to hear that there will be more focus on balancing now that Marching Fire is released. But is it possible to have slightly more frequent changes, that aren't at the ""too fast"" pace? Because the current rate of a couple of reworks and maybe a few other small changes every 2-3 months feels rather slow. We understand that it takes a lot of work to make whole reworks with new animations and so on, but **might it be possible to do more smaller changes to lacking heroes on a *slightly* more frequent basis? As a stop-gap until a more comprehensive rework can be done?** For example giving Warlord a Heavy-Heavy and Light-Light chain, improving tracking on Centurion's charged jab, or reducing recovery on Valk's sweep to not give a GB to an OOS opponent? These would mostly be number changes and small quality of life fixes, would avoid the issue of oscillating metas, but would give the community much more concrete evidence of balance work taking place. The Aramusha changes (though divisive) were welcome evidence of a more agile approach to balancing, as were season 5's Centurion changes, and I hope that continues. - **Similarly, wanting all characters to be able to attack before altering/nerfing the most powerful is reasonable in theory, but when that might take many seasons, it is a tough pill to swallow for many players.** Small changes to the most oppressive characters (like reducing/removing the stamina damage/freeze of Warden's and Conqueror's bashes on an OOS opponent for example) could be implemented quickly and comparatively easily, reversed in the future if necessary, would have minimal effect on the highest tier play, and would make the game much less frustrating at lower levels of play. Please consider some changes along these lines. - **However, there are some balance changes which really should be implemented *far* more quickly, as they are essentially bugs.** Taking over a year to add 100ms of GB vulnerability to Gladiator's zone (default for every other move in the game) gives a really bad impression. There are numerous well-documented bugs in characters that have been in the game across multiple patch cycles: Shugoki's headbutt applying its cost twice, Highlander leaving Offensive Form when dodging during a guard switch, Kensei's light attacks being able to ledge opponents, to name but a few. Smaller unambigous balance issues like back dodges avoiding Aramusha's heavy finishers, deadly feints *and* feint to GB, Warlord's superior block lights being blockable, and so on, should really be fixed ASAP, rather than waiting for big batches of changes. - Finally, **have you considered running a Public Test Server more regularly (constantly?) to test balance updates in the community?** Having an opt-in balancing server where you could test changes with the community could allow more rapid balancing changes without having to worry about oscillating power levels irritating the community. Additionally, you are likely to get better balancing data as the players who would want to beta test are probably the most dedicated and knowledgeable players &amp;nbsp; ##Summary: - Reducing reactability and improving offence globally is good. Have you considered reducing the effectiveness of blocking without depending on reaction speed? Eg. Blocking costs stamina, higher chip damage, GBs do low damage even if countered? Remove static guard switch attack delay? - Improving the fight UI? Improved targeting would be great, but there are other issues too: - Disappearing indicators, attacks switching sides - Visible opponent revenge bar, GB vulnerability, external GB indicator, external block indicator - Stamina - Progress on the stamina overhaul? - Flat stamina cost for soft-feints as well as hard feints? - Change stamina oddities? - Flat stamina cost for blocked/parried attacks? - Changes to prevent unlock sprinting to regen stamina? - Zone Attacks - Fast zones give light parry punish? - Zones affected by superior block? - Guard Breaks - GB range affected by movement speed? Improve range for slow characters? - GB tracking can be strange - why? Remove tracking around obstacles? - Reflex Guard - Is it bugged or not - with attacks going through guards sometimes? - Reflex guard decays with time, but also on block or hit. Change this somehow? - Deflects - Why do i-frames take priority? Can this be changed? - Make undogeable attacks beat deflects? - Make deflects work on unblockable attacks? - Parry counters - No GB on parry, so Jiang Jun choke input window much easier than Warlord's, Centurion's, and Gladiator's. Could this be normalised? - Special effects on attacks - More enhanced lights on slower characters? - More pseudo-unblockables with their own indicators? - Some attacks to beat hyperarmour? Eg. Glad Skewer? - Learning resources - New features like Arena, Tactics, etc are great, are they still being worked on? - Training against multiple bots? Programming specific move sequences? - Wu Lin - Are you happy with them, planning fixes soon, or will we have to wait a long time? - Tweaks to damage - lower on JJ and Shaolin? - Why are all Wu Lin dodge attacks fixed timing and not delayable? - Tiandi: Improve i-frames on dodge heavy? Improve superior block on dodge lights? - Jiang Jun: Fix offence? (Unblockables, forward dodge heavy all avoidable on one dodge timing?) Nerf 33 damage heavy parry punish? Side heavies affected by superior block? - Nuxia: Deflect requiring read is good, but needs some reward. Maybe chain even if blocked? Traps can be punished on reaction, reduce recovery? 2 part zone attack? - Shaolin: Dodge out of Qi stance? Feint to Qi stance? - Bot AI: - Issue isn't difficulty as much as how unrealistic bots are. Are there plans to make them react to feints/mix-ups, and give them more human-like reaction times? - Pace of Balance changes - Not wanting too fast changes, oscillating meta is reasonable, but changes could definitely be a bit faster without running into that problem - More frequent but smaller changes, quality of life buffs before big reworks would be very welcomed. Aramusha changes were a good start (if somewhat divisive) - Not wanting to nerf powerful characters until all characters can attack is unreasonable considering the pace of balance changes. Could small, reversible, nerfs be applied to the most oppressive moves in the meantime? (eg. Lower stamina damage/freeze of Warden, Conq bashes) - Moveset related ""bugs"" should be fixed *much faster* though. Over a year to add 100ms GB vulnerability to Gladiator's zone is far too slow - Have you considered running a beta testing server more often, to get faster feedback and testing of balancing changes? Thanks again to the dev team for opening up to community feedback + questions, and thanks for making it all the way through this huge list. I'm looking forward to the next Warrior's Den, and hope some of our questions will be answered there.

286,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Some Gladiator Rework Ideas,1,9z6p8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9z6p8s/some_gladiator_rework_ideas/,2018-11-22 06:57:26,"For starters, I'm going to be basing this off kensei's rework (the staple of ""good"" reworks so far) so there will be a lot of resemblance. And no, I don't think gladiator needs a rework more than any weaker heroes or that the need is particularly dire, but he still needs one. Don't worry, I'm not going to suggest any bashes that guarantee damage or anything else shallow like that. I wan't him to be strong and safe enough to be highly aggressive, but I don't want another conq. **Step 1: Neuter his stupid zone attack.** \-Remake it entirely and make it an extremely good minion clearing tool since glad sucks hard at clearing minions \- Hell, maybe even make it nearly useless against other players in 1v1s, like highlander or lawbringer zone **Now make his ACTUAL kit viable without that god-awful zone crutch** ***CURRENT STRENGTHS:*** \-Skewer can work as an opener against opponents without amazing reactions \-His low heavy guardbreak vulnerability is nice \-Okay range \-Pretty quick hard feints \-Toe stab, while wildly unsafe if reacted to, can be used from neutral, allowing it to punish opponents' dodge recoveries if timed correctly. It can also be used for hard feint mixups decently safely. ***Weaknesses:*** \-Highly telegraphed neutral lights, and absolutely useless 600 ms chained lights \-Sucker punch guarantees nothing, yet is slower and less safe than conq shield bash, warlord headbutt, and valk shield crush \-Toe stab is the same speed (600 ms) as valk leg sweep, which people call useless because of its reactability. Meanwhile, toe stab is just as punishable (guarbreak on dodge) and only does 10 damage. Its only uses whatsoever are catching dodges in recoveries or ending feint mixups. \-Side dodge sucker punches and dodge lights come out at a set timing, although I fondly remember the timing being variable back when glad was released, and that felt SO MUCH BETTER whereas the current fixed timing feels horrible and breaks glad's flow. ***Proposed changes:*** \-Okay hear me out here: Give gladiator's hard feints the same boosted speed to their followup attacks as berserker BUT don't give them hyper armor, and give them a much shorter window before the buff goes away after the feint, as zerk's ability to delay the hell out of his feint-lights is part of what makes him overtuned. *\*Sucker Punch:* \-Reduce recovery a bit so it can't be dodged and guardbroken on reaction \-Bring back variable timings to the side-dodge sucker punches \-Make FOWARD sucker punch 500 ms (same as conq shield bash) but don't worry, it wont be another conq shield bash \-Keep the current followup as is: It can only chain into a non-guaranteed chained heavy. Keep reading, as I'll explain why this is soon *\*Chained heavies:* \-Allow all chained heavies (not neutral, just CHAINED heavies, yaknow, the wide swinging ones) to be soft feinted into all manner of other heavies and lights, similar to kensei's top heavy feinting mechanics. \-Give these soft feint-attacks from the chained heavy crazy animations that are frighteningly hard to identify while stunned \-Allow all chained heavies to be soft feinted into a 500 ms sucker punch with a guarbreak input (which can only be chained back into the chained heavy anyway) ***Reasons:*** Currently gladiator (without his zone) has very few ways to deal damage, and none of them are at all safe. His best (neither of them are very good tho) options right now are to either do skewer mixups (decent, but same downfall as raider's zone as his only ""opener"" in that its reactable) or do sucker punch the opponent to stun them, then do some elaborate hard-feint mixup and hope they can't see what it is in time to block it. Gladiator can also hard feint into lights, heavies, or a toe stab, but all of these are not only reactable, but a focused opponent can quite easily differentiate between light and heavy animations THEN parry based on what they see due to how distinguishable glad's lights are at 500 ms. I find this playstyle, particularly the bash-stun mixup part, to be extremely fun and intense, but undertuned in its current state. This is because all of gladiators attacks are VERY telegraphed, and stunning the opponent is not enough to keep them from easily identifying and blocking or parrying said attacks. Bashes that guarantee damage are functional but boring, which is why I believe many people found valk's rework to be a functional buff, but a shallow change to playstyle. For these reasons, I think three things need to be buffed about gladiator: \-Hard feints \-His side dodge options as a nimble assasin \-Sucker punch as an ""opener"" **Potential other changes that I don't personally think are needed but could be cool:** \-Upgrade his reflex guard: I don't mind his current reflex guard as I feel it adds to his very well-implement feel as a jumpy, nimble glass cannon. I think reintroducing the option-select potential of his side dodges by giving him back variable timings on his side-sucker punch and light attacks would make up for him retaining his awful guard, and that the bad guard is part of his mantra as a strong and nimble but vulnerable fighter. \-Maybe increase the gb vulnerability on his neutral heavies?: Its a nice strength to have at the moment, but if all the changes listed above were applied, it probably isn't one he'd need. Also, its very annoying for any character to have super low gb-vulnerability on heavies like this for heroes that rely on soft-feints in guarbreak, such as cent, shaman, or peacekeeper. **Thoughts?** &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

They also discussed the data from the new State Of Balance post for Season 7, and compared that to the community tier-lists. I thought I would take this opportunity to summarise the answers given, maybe give a bit of response (italics), and leave a list of remaining questions that might be answered in future Warrior's Dens, because despite answering balance questions for 35 minutes, Stefan could not of course get through the whole list of questions. I'm only going to put the questions (both answered (bolded), unanswered, and those from the comments) here in very brief form, so as not to clog up this post with repeated information. For the full text of the questions, please [read the last post](URL Once again I'd like to thank Stefan and Eric for answering so many questions, and the rest of the team for being open and communicating with the community - I hope you will continue to do so in future. (And u/MrEricPope if you [do want to fly me to Montreal for a balance talk](URL I'd be more than happy to oblige! Call me! :P) Also thanks to everyone else who commented and provided questions - keep them coming people, I'm sure there'll be more Q&amp;As in the future. - **Revenge build up:** Revenge build up in 1v1 scenarios in team matches is another top priority. Sounds like they want 1v1 revenge to be removed almost entirely. - **Reducing reactability and improving offence:** Currently top priority - opener lights, and many mix-ups are too reactable. - **Moving to 33ms increments in attack speed, parry + feint windows?** Currently under development, and promising, but no specific news as of now. Will eventually be in the game. Might not be noticeable at slower attacks (600 to 566ms) but more important at attacks that are at the border of reaction speeds (500-466-433ms). Feint windows - looking at 366ms window with 166ms parry window (from 400 and 200) for example. Raider changes in the closed test were a general test case - not specifically to do with Raider. - Reducing the effectiveness of blocking without depending on reaction speed? Eg. Blocking costs stamina, higher chip damage, GBs do low damage even if countered? More soft-feints and mix-ups instead of faster attacks? **Unparriable attacks?** Not keen on adding unparriable attacks - unblockable melees like toe stabs do the same job. Chip damage is good , but then why add a new mechanic when bashes do the same job? Hints that Shugoki will be able to attack with his rework (with the implication that his attacks aren't ""super fast""). *Agree with Stefan here - unparriable attacks are a silly idea. Bit disappointed that nothing about the effectiveness of blocking has been discussed: even if heavy feints are less reactable, this will only be relevant for unblockables whilst blocking is still the safest option.* - Remove static guard switch attack delay? - Will ""Reaction Reduction"" work differently across the skill-spectrum, require ""skilful input"" (eg. Attacks after feints sped up), or be universal? - Improving the fight UI? - **Improved targeting:** Improving targeting with 3+ opponents is 3rd top priority, allowing better control and not just pinging back and forth between same 2 opponents - Disappearing indicators, attacks switching sides - Visible opponent revenge bar, GB vulnerability, external GB indicator, external block indicator - Stamina - **Progress on the stamina overhaul? (Eg. Tech test removal of stamina drain on some moves)** Stamina overhaul is still being worked on, but at a lower priority at the moment. OOS stamina damage is a ""pain point"" for regular players, so it's something they are still looking at changing. - Flat stamina cost for soft-feints as well as hard feints? - Change stamina oddities? - Flat stamina cost for blocked/parried attacks? - **Changes to prevent unlock sprinting to regen stamina?** Currently hard to keep an enemy in combat. OK if an opponent is 10m away in team modes, but rubbish if an opponent can disengage to escape mix-ups. Seems to prefer giving each character options to chase down, rather than global changes. - Zone Attacks - Fast zones give light parry punish? - Zones affected by superior block? - Guard Breaks - GB range affected by movement speed? Improve range for slow characters? - GB tracking can be strange - why? Remove tracking around obstacles? - Reflex Guard - Is it bugged or not - with attacks going through guards sometimes? - Reflex guard decays with time, but also on block or hit. Change this somehow? - Deflects - **Why do i-frames take priority? Can this be changed to make side deflects easier?** Something that they have been looking and discussing. Ran a test a while ago, that worked well in a single 1v1 scenario. Didn't work well with multiple players. Want to improve it, but lower priority. *Bit disappointed to hear this, as currently undodgeable attacks override i-frames, and deflecting those in multi-opponent settings seems to work fine. I wonder if this test was done before the ""mutli-deflect"" change was made. It seems like it wouldn't be too hard to implement, given the current state of deflects, but then again I don't know how the game is programmed.* - Make undogeable attacks beat deflects? - Make deflects work on unblockable attacks? - Parry counters - No GB on parry, so Jiang Jun choke input window much easier than Warlord's, Centurion's, and Gladiator's. Could this be normalised? - Ganks and crowd control moves - **Reducing the ""gank meta"" of powerful CC moves? Eg. Shaman bite, LB impale?** Shaman bite is being nerfed in the next patch - after 1 ally hit, you will be able to block subsequent attacks. So 80-90 damage instead of 130+. Shugoki's hug is being changed in a similar way. If this is successful on shaman's bite + hug, it may be rolled out to other CC moves (LB impale + Shinobi sickle rain mentioned). No indication of global damage reduction or revenge in CC, will be changed on a per-move basis. - Normalize damage reduction across CC moves? - Allow revenge activation when pinned in CC moves? - Special effects on attacks - More enhanced lights on slower characters? - More pseudo-unblockables with their own indicators? - Some attacks to beat hyperarmour? Eg. Glad Skewer? - Learning resources - New features like Arena, Tactics, etc are great, are they still being worked on? - Training against multiple bots? Programming specific move sequences? - Bot AI: - Issue isn't difficulty as much as how unrealistic bots are. Are there plans to make them react to feints/mix-ups, and give them more human-like reaction times? - Pace of Balance changes - Not wanting too fast changes, oscillating meta is reasonable, but changes could definitely be a bit faster without running into that problem - More frequent but smaller changes, quality of life buffs before big reworks would be very welcomed. Aramusha changes were a good start (if somewhat divisive). 500ms lights for everyone? - Not wanting to nerf powerful characters until all characters can attack is unreasonable considering the pace of balance changes. Could small, reversible, nerfs be applied to the most oppressive moves in the meantime? (eg. Lower stamina damage/freeze of Warden, Conq bashes) - Moveset related ""bugs"" should be fixed *much faster* though. Over a year to add 100ms GB vulnerability to Gladiator's zone is far too slow - **Have you considered running a beta testing server more often, to get faster feedback and testing of balancing changes?** This is something that many people on the team want to do - and in active discussion for 2019. Definitely not happening for the Shugoki rework, as Christmas gets in the way, but might be a more common occurrence in future. Running a test server is always a production question - not wanting to take resources away from other aspects of development and reduce efficiency and slow down teams. But it's something that a lot of the devs want to do more of. - **Max Punishes: They can change a lot from patch to patch, are they a conscious design decision?** Max punishes are now a more considered aspect than early in development. For the new characters (Wu Lin) light + heavy parry + GB punishes were specifically designed. Out of stamina punishes were looked at based off attack timings as a consequence of earlier design constraints, and subsequently altered if they were problematic. The reason max punishes can occasionally change without documentation/intention is that they are dependent on lots of variables that designers who aren't specifically in the fight team or don't know the combat system really in depth, might not be aware of. If some of these are changed (as a bug fix - for example, movement during an attack animation) it may have consequences on max punishes. But without all the designers aware of max punishes, it can be hard to tell QA department to test if they have changed. They are working on making this less a common occurrence. - **Feint Windows: Does anything other than gameplay determining when feint windows are?** Early in FH's development, ""best looking"" feint windows were prioritised. Example being Kensei's top heavy feint 600ms before landing. Currently most feints are standardised at 400ms before the impact. They are looking at making the window shorter to be more difficult to tell. - **Console vs PC, high level vs low level in balance data:** State of balance data is from consoles + PC combined. Internally they look at platform specific data, and data from all skill levels, from ""higher"" skill to overall. Whilst characters do fluctuate between platforms and skill levels, they don't see huge changes. An example of a big change was Season 3 Kensei - 30% win rate at top levels, but a ""noob stomper"" at low levels. Currently they do not see as big changes between skill levels and platforms. *This doesn't surprise me much - as long as input + display lag are accounted for, consoles and PC have similar balancing - unreactable attacks are unreactable on both platforms. The difference between 30fps and 60fps is 16ms at most, which for context, is half of what they are considering changing attacks by in the reaction reduction. As for why they don't see big changes across skill levels, this is likely because the way they measure win rates vs skill is [massively and fundamentally flawed](URL so it's not surprising that they don't get an accurate picture of changes across skill levels.* - Character specific matchmaking: - **Per Character questions:** Shugoki is priority no.1, followed by characters who can't initiate and sustain like lawbringer. Also nerfing of out of lock power of Shinobi + Warlord. - **Shaman:** Bite is being nerfed in the next patch - will only guarantee 1 ally heavy before putting opponent in reduced hitstun. - **Raider:** His light chain is bad, and acknowledges that his zone mix-up is lacking in duels. However he points out that Raider is really good in breach at the moment, and because there is a mode where he excels, is therefore a lower priority. They still want to get round to balancing him in duels eventually. - **Centurion:** Shugoki's charged heavies are being changed in his rework, if this turns out successful, could be similar changes made to Cent. - **Warlord:** Unlocked charge is the source of his power - and will get nerfed. Do not want an unlocked playstyle. They want to improve him to compensate for reduction in unlocked playstyle. - Adding 100ms activation to currently instant guard on Tiandi, Kensei and Conqueror dodges? - **Aramusha:** Why was guaranteed top light after side heavy removed instead of teaching players better? They decided that the guaranteed top light was not worth coming up with a new mechanic to properly communicate to new, confused players (eg. Different coloured or removed indicator), as whether or not the top light was ""guaranteed"" would be altered by external attackers or multiple attacks landing at the same time, etc. It seemed a better use of resources to simply make it no longer guaranteed, and buff the damage of the side heavy to compensate, than to tutorialise and implement a whole new mechanic. This would not be the case if the attack was like a guaranteed light from the same side (eg. Shinobi). Aramusha still has problems, but he'd rather not make new problems to solve by adding a new official mechanic. *I do agree with Stefan here, but I worry that the other uses of the ""guaranteed"" light other than raw damage might have been ignored, for example increased damage off a countered ally GB.* - Wu Lin - **Are you happy with them,** planning fixes soon, or will we have to wait a long time? Looks like they are doing well balance-wise. Data: Shaolin, Tiandi and Nuxia are ~54% win rate in plat+ duels. Expectation that these will drop over time as people learn their movesets. Jiang Jun is currently high win rate ~62%, which is a big discrepancy from tier list placement. Partially this could be due to his animation bugs, which will be fixed in the next patch (Title update). - **Tweaks to damage - lower on JJ and Shaolin?** Buffed damage on Wu Lin before launch, as it was too low in tests. They are going to wait a bit, see if the JJ animation bug fixes normalise the win rates before making any changes. - Why are all Wu Lin dodge attacks fixed timing and not delayable? - Tiandi: Improve i-frames on dodge heavy? Improve superior block on dodge lights? - Jiang Jun: Fix offence? (Unblockables, forward dodge heavy all avoidable on one dodge timing?) Nerf 33 damage heavy parry punish? Side heavies affected by superior block? - Nuxia: Deflect requiring read is good, but needs some reward. Maybe chain even if blocked? 2 part zone attack? **Traps can be punished on reaction, reduce recovery?** Reducing recovery would be one way of doing it, but it seems that Stefan prefers altering Traps along with ""reaction reduction"" of 33ms, etc - making them from a reaction to more of a read. This would end up being more of a guess - is it a heavy, feint, or a trap. Damage would have to be reduced if this is the case. *Personally, I'm not sure this is necessarily the best way to go: because guard removal on attack initiation/guard switch is instant, traps are effectively the equivalent of a 500ms attack, despite their 400ms speed. Even if feints become less reactable (eg. 400ms to 366ms) making parries more of a read, traps have a longer window to react to, becoming equivalent of a 466ms attack. This will be less reactable for many players, but still reactable - and punishable - at the highest levels.* - Shaolin: Dodge out of Qi stance? Feint to Qi stance? "

and to that I answer yes, warden is top 3 duelists, as well as low S tier in 4v4 modes. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; they will be giving warden some changes in the future, to make him use his shoulder less and his sword more and these changes are as follows: &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 1. removing his ability to feint the vortex. they will compensate him by giving hyper armor on the vortex when charged past 700-800ms; this will make vortex a unreactable 50/50 for both opponents, the warden takes a guess, and then you take a guess; making it risky for the user, and the opponent. this will make it a clutch choice rather than a mindless spam. &amp;#x200B; 2. hyper armor on his top heavy unblockable, with vortex not being a retardedly safe move, he will need to be able to use his unblockable pressure more safely, hyper armor on this will keep him from getting bitch slapped out of it every time its thrown. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 3. maybe a 400 ms top light, just a thought but 400ms attacks are a good thing for the game, shao-lin is strong but not too strong, his top light is good but its easy to block and just react to the sides, this little cherry on top would do only good things for warden, as well has making crushing counter bait a mind game because you cant react if he throws a heavy, or a light meaning he can try and bait your bait. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; these changes will make warden a bit more interesting, will make him flow a lot more smoothly, as well as making people using him creatively rather than using his basic bitch vortex chains, showing a skilled warden above shitty wardens; where as now garbage warden players, and seasoned pro's are almost indistinguishable. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; and now we examine another bashy boi conq: &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 1. can be used from neutral; showing it as a opener by design witch this on its own isn't a bad thing. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 2. like vortex, this can be used by dodging from any direction (except backwards) this means he can use it to deny countless, mixups out right, and be used evasively. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 3. it has a 200 ms dodge window, meaning dodging it is entirely prediction, then you see him dodge forward you have to guess weather hes gunna throw it at max speed, delay it, or GB its all guess. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 3. can be delayed by 200ms, this grants better dodge tracking, greater range; and makes him immune to GB punish on wiff to all heros except raider. &amp;#x200B; 4. this move costs almost 0 stamina, making it easily spammable, as conq has a very poorly designed KIT, his bash is all that hes ever going to need to use. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 5. it stops stamina regeneration, so once your out of stamina against a conq, you are going to 100% get 100-0 KO'D as you will never get your stamina back. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; once again seems overpowered yes? well once again you would be correct, conq is the best duelist in the game for his bash, and the developers are going to rework him yet again, NERFING THE BASH, BUFFING THE KIT. examples are as follows: &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 1. make shield bash from neutral cost MUCH MUCH more stamina; this will stop allowing it to be a crutch, and make it more of a tool. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 2. increase the recovery time on wiff, its hard to properly guess and dodge a conq bash, YOU SHOULD GET THAT PUNSIH 100% OF THE TIME IF YOU HAVE STAMINA TO SPEND. just simple facts. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 3. decrease the tracking of bash, it can be delayed, it has a narrow dodge window, so increasing that dodge window slightly, will make getting hit by it more of a ""my bad"" than a ""BULLSHIT"". &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; all these nerfs conqs gunna get some buffs don't worry: &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 4. zone attack, will be faster, cost less stamina, and can be canceled with a dodge. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 5. his light chain will be more threatening, increase the delay of the attacks, making throwing in a un-expected heavy to bait a early parry more viable. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 6. buff his damn full-block, its garbage with a 300ms startup, maybe a 200 ms startup would be nice. &amp;#x200B; 7. his chain bash, and bash soft feint are so reactable I can do it in my sleep, though the light follow up is a mind game witch is nice; though I vote to increase the speed of his chain bash, and remove his ability to light attack on wiff. &amp;#x200B; 8. ok his superior block heavies, are garbage; replacing them with superior block light attacks, will be actually viable as it will make a mind game for the opponent when attempting to bait you out. &amp;#x200B; notice how nice and juicy these changes sound, conq will ACTUALLY BE FUN TO PLAY? to play against and to play as. &amp;#x200B; and now we move to the last one warlord, this boi is so balanced (minus crashing charged if you spam it) its not even funny, and here is why anyone who says warlord (without crashing charge spam) is OP is wrong: &amp;#x200B; 1. his opener headbutt, is quick witch is good. &amp;#x200B; 2. his headbutt cant be delayed in anyway, its 1 timing making it reactable on orange if the opponent is ready to dodge. &amp;#x200B; 3. you always get the punish on dodge, unless you dodge at the last possible moment and your a lawbringer. &amp;#x200B; 4. headbutt only grants 12 damage, and if you get caught by the GB mixup, it deals only 25 damage, and very little chain pressure after that. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 5. headbutt costs a hefty amount of stamina if it isn't used sparingly; making it a bad time if you use it till your ass is empty of stam. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 6. headbutt is perfectly reactable, so this enforced you using it very creatively: feint a heavy into headbutt: double feint heavy into headbutt: full-block into headbutt exit: feint heavy into full-block headbutt exit. its all creative and only used by the best warlords attempting to enforce aggression and confusion onto their opponent. &amp;#x200B; I offered simple facts of all these 3 bash openers, and of all of them witch sounds more balanced and fair? you probably said warlords, and youde be right, its reliable, but reactable, its a tool, not a crutch. &amp;#x200B; yes warlord can headbutt you to death if your the worlds biggest turtle but headbutt isn't warlods strength. &amp;#x200B; but what is warlords biggest strength? well look at all his counter attack options I stated earlier, that makes baiting him out a mixup guessing game for the opponent. warlord thrives off a aggressive mixup heavy opponent... how to you beat someone whos best at beating your aggression? YOU TURTLE... and this works against every counter attacker except warlord and why is that? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; its because warlord has headbutt... its low damage but it will chip you down if you refuse to attack...and when you attack you enter a head-to-head against the current king of counter-attack and its your skill and reads against his and that is exactly what a for honor 1v1 should be. &amp;#x200B; his headbutt is no more than a tool to encourage your opponent to apply aggression so you can fight with your full potential. &amp;#x200B; its not mindless un-reactable bash spam &amp;#x200B; its not a free win if your OOS &amp;#x200B; its not un-punishable. &amp;#x200B; its balanced. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I would love to hear someone who disagrees with this but if you do im very interested to hear why. &amp;#x200B; share your thoughts and detailed opinions in the comments, but leave mindless undignified hate out of it. your just shaming yourself, and showing your own insolence with pointless ""republican"" style undescriptive hate."

294,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,The Aramusha nerf.,1,9nq8or,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9nq8or/the_aramusha_nerf/,2018-10-13 13:01:07,"I've decided to speak out on this since I'm one of the only few dedicated Aramusha mains out there, I've been playing him since his release so I figured my opinion is worth a little. Basically, ubisoft decided to nerf the second worst hero in the game. Considering that Shugoki's rework has been confirmed, soon to be THE worst hero in the game. I'm going to explain why: -Chianed top lights are now 500ms instead of 400ms. This means that they should literally never ever hit, if you are fighting an opponent that gets hit by this then you should be able to beat him with shugoki. It also got a damage buff, which doesn't matter because it should never hit. -Neutral side heavies no longer confirm top light, which means even with the damage buff they were slightly nerfed. However on the bright side he now deals more damage off wallsplat, (40 instead of 33) so this isn't a big deal. Also correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this also means that forward dodge side heavies will no longer confirm top light, whilst their damage is still 20, essentially making them even more garbage. -Side deadly feints damage has taken a massive hit since they no longer confirm top light, however this is compensated for by the fact that they are 400ms. However the increased speed makes no difference at high level play, and I will explain why. -It now takes 200ms instead of 100ms to chain into your next light attack, this is a big nerf when it comes to his backstep light mixups, the effectiveness of his target switching in team fights, and this adds on even more to my point that chained top lights should NEVER hit. -Nothing has been done about backdodge on reaction to heavy finisher. If you don't know what this is, essentially if you see Aramusha's heavy finisher, you can backdodge to avoid the feint to gb option, the soft feint into light option, or the heavy being thrown out, essentially completely negating the mixup. His forward dodge attacks are also too slow to punish this. So essentially, against any opponent who knows about this the 400ms soft feint buff is completely irrelevant. -No mention of his 1100ms backdodge recovery (worst in the game, and the only one longer than the rest), no mention of his abysmal Shugoki-esque walking speed while locked on, no compensation of any kind for his recent side dodge recovery nerf making him the most immobile character in the game due to having no dodge attacks. Yes even shugoki is more evasive than Aramusha now, because at least he has a normal back dodge recovery (yes, aramusha is the worst character in the game at dealing with bashes). -No mention of him having the most unsafe full block stance in the game: 100ms activation, 400ms duration, 500ms recovery, 1 second total GB vulnerability In comparison to conqueror's: 300ms startup, 200ms duration, can be cancelled into zone for 0ms gb vulnerability or forward dodge shield bash for 100ms gb vulnerability, making it 500ms or 600ms total GB vulnerability respectively. Warlord's: 200ms startup, 600ms recovery (only against GB, still allows him to dodge or block unlike aramusha). However the 600ms recovery can be cancelled with the dodge tracking heavy, making it 800ms or 200ms GB vulnerability respectively. Valkyrie can't even be guardbroken if you use the move at the correct timing, since she dodges out of range. I don't know the exact values, but I'm certain that her recovery is much smaller than 1 second. Overall, I'm impressed with Ubi's ability to actually make this character slightly worse, which I didn't really think would ever happen at this point. I'm taking a break from him, and I advise any other aramusha players out there to do so too, so that his pickrate stats can go down to below 1% and ubisoft is more inclined to buff him, since they seem to rely on data very heavily.

I think breach would have balanced out the ""turtle meta"" enough to have a nice balance between offense and defense. Due to the reworks while still having the main game mode being dominion, the reworks were too aggressive, which changes the general feel of the game to twitchy and too face paced. Also with the upcoming 300ms gb vulnerability frames, a lot more mix ups would be viable, and make some previous reworks not as neccessary. General Changes: Only feed revenge when successfully defended agaisnt said offense. (Only feed revenge when successfully block, parry, or dodge an attack as opposed to getting rewarded for taking damage) &amp;#x200B; Nerf unblockable damage. (there needs to be more incentive to using raw heavies) Rework damage mitigation on combos. &amp;#x200B; Warden changes: Continuing from pre-rework warden Change side lights to 500ms Unblockable chained heavy With 300ms gb vulnerability from unlock roll, shoulder bash will be viable &amp;#x200B; Conq changes: Remove guarenteed light from shield bash, use bash as an interrupt since its so fast. &amp;#x200B; Kensei changes: Change unbockable damage to 40 &amp;#x200B; Highlander changes: Change unblockable heavy damage to 35"

Examples are cents kick, shinobis ranged gb, warlord chained lights, aramusha, and the newest addition Nuxias traps. Nuxias traps are punishable on reaction with a light attack. Now you know. When people told the devs how shitty nuxias traps were they gave her less vulnerability after a missed one and buffed the damage to 30. This doesnt solve the core problem of these fools never landing. So what would I change about the traps? Well, I would speed them up by about 100ms. Flux could still react to them but it would be the pressure they wanted for most. Drop the damage back to where it was. If it is a guessing game then a 30 damage one is too high. Also no chaining after a whiff, they guess right, they get a guard break cookie. 30 damage is also a scary high amount of damage for newer players who dont know how to deal with it. Also make her deflect 37 damage and unblockable thanks hon. So to conclude. Nuxias traps are bad and an easy reaction with a light attack. Drop the damage to 22, cut the chaining after a whiff, and speed em up 100ms. This wouldnt solve her one dimensional kit but it would make her less lightspammy and more brainy.

New rules: * No attack can have 0ms GB vulnerability(counting Glad's zone) * If an attack is a light attack, it always has 100ms GB vulnerability * If an attack is a dodge attack, then the GB vulnerability of the dodge attack itself(not counting the dodge input window) cannot go over 300ms"
303,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Tiandi's Dragon Dodges have 300ms of iframes from attacks.,1,9qmlgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9qmlgf/tiandis_dragon_dodges_have_300ms_of_iframes_from/,2018-10-23 18:17:13,"After my side dodge light framecheck analysis, I decided to use the same methodology on analyzing Tiandi's Dragon Dodges, as I regularly seem to get hit out of them. I recorded some footage in the training arena and did a frame-by-frame analysis of it. The video I used is uploaded [here](URL The full frame check dataset is here: URL The results of this analysis is the following: * Tiandi's Dragon Dodges have between a 167ms and a 200ms dodge startup. Tiandi has iframes during this time against attacks. * Tiandi's Dragon Dodges have 300ms of iframes. I was hit out of DD at 333ms into the DD frames twice, so this is conclusive. * Tiandi's iframes extend at least to 267ms into DD. I presume 300ms is the last iframe, but getting this exactly is impossible as iframes have no indicator, and deciding when an attack ""should have landed"" is imperfect, as shown by the ""Warden zone attack time (ms)"" column. * Tiandi's DD gives either 467ms or 500ms of iframes, depending on how many dodge frames precede it. * Tiandi's feints were happening on 767ms and 800ms into DD, with the attack landing at 1100ms. This means that there is a 367ms to 400ms vulnerability window before DD can be feinted. **If the Tiandi dodges to a Warden's right, the Warden can zone on reaction and catch the Tiandi before they have a chance to feint.** **TL;DR: Tiandi's DD has at most 500ms of iframes (including the dodge part), with a 367ms to 400ms vulnerability window before being able to feint.**"
304,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,My Thoughts on the New Heroes,1,9qy1ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9qy1ky/my_thoughts_on_the_new_heroes/,2018-10-24 20:21:44,"The Wu Lin Thoughts Keep in mind that I'm not having troubles against these heroes these are just my thoughts on them so far after they released. Tiandi: Overall an easy hero to play both 1v1s and 4v4s anyone with a decent or even low amount of skill level can play this hero. He is too safe to play. If you miss the kick you can still CGB if you missed the palm strike go for a light or a heavy they also can't get a GB off of that. You did a light and they dodged your light and went for a GB go for a light you have 2 chainable lights. His dash attacks are safe as well if they mix it up at least on console. Both great in 1v1s and 4v4s. I'd say both S tier. You can get a GB on him if he goes for ballerina and as soon as you see that happening take advantage of it's GB vulnerability. To counter him it's all depending on reaction so as soon as you see that orange glowy palm you gotta dodge. Also another tip a tiandi knows how to mix up will most of the time feint their kick into a dash light. Don't fear of getting hit by the kick unless there's a ledge behind you. You can't unlock roll as well since they're undodgeable. If they missed the palm wait for a top light and parry it. He's great at OOS punish. Jiang Jun: Slow lights too predictable. Sifu stance into zone then UB heavy. He is not that good in 1v1s but he is super good in 4v4s. So in duels he is like B tier (close to A) in 4v4s his feats and his AoE damage makes him S tier. To counter him don't dodge while he's doing his side heavy into soft feint. To counter him Never dodge while in OOS. When he's OOS. GB him immediately after they're stamina is gone. Most of them goes for a back dodge into Sifu. They mostly do their zones after Sifu or when you're low HP. Nuxia: She has fast lights but as I said most of the time she'll become an Orochi 2.0 on consoles I've already seen people countering traps. To counter her emote, unlock, change guards or as soon as you see the orange glowing UB trap do a heavy doesn't matter which stance even at the stance she's doing the trap from. People like to go for dash lights most of the time to open up since her first light is 500ms. They'll probably dodge your attack and go for a dash attack. So parry that. She is A tier in duels also A tier in 4v4s. If you're OOS as soon as you see glowing unlock. Shaolin: He is by far the most balanced hero in all 4. I'm not saying this because I mained him. I don't defend my mains (Aramusha (rep10) is also my main and he sucks dick) His heavies' damage is low for a hybrid. Nobushi's top heavy deals 38 damage and stacks up with bleed as well it boosts your damage. Highlander's heavies are hit like a truck. Valkyrie sucks I mean she is unfinished so can't say much so overall against other hybrids his heavies deal like 25-30 damage which doesn't guarantees an exe or a kill if they're one bar with little more HP so it's like this (__ this one is a bar) (- this one is the 1/4 of the bar) so all the heroes gets an execution if they land a heavy if their opponent's health is __- not for shaolin though. He lefts his opponent with a little HP left. It's not much of a big deal but for a heavy it's kinda weak. Never dodge in OOS. They feint the top UB heavy when they go all the way up on the air if they kick you and then UB it comes fast but feint window is tight. So they'll have to feint it as soon as you see the glowing thing. If you see it and it's still coming at you, you know what to do already. Let's say in dominion you're running away from a gank or a shaolin while running away always look back while running so when you see him doing his teleport feat dodge it immediately doesn't matter when you dodge if you see him teleporting dodge it and then it counts as a Dodge. He can also lock onto you while behind walls only if he locked on you once when you're in open. He can do that for a short period of time like other heroes. Never dodge when he goes into Chi Stance they mostly will want a Crushing Counterstrike so go for a feint and parry their chi stance lights basically bait them. His Dodge attacks are slow as well. He's great at OOS punish. "
305,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,An idea for conqueror rebalancing,1,9rdq8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9rdq8v/an_idea_for_conqueror_rebalancing/,2018-10-26 07:00:15,"Conqueror is probably not talked about as much as he used to be, but I do think we still need to recognize Conquerors unhealthy playstyle and irrelevant kit. While I recognize that changes to reworked characters won't come for a while, I thought that I would post ideas that I have to fix conquerors playstyle. This is also my first post like this, so forgive me if I overlook some things First we need to define the issues conqueror has. His largest in my opinion issue is that for a conqueror to be aggressive they really are only able to use one move. This is a boring playstyle to fight as or against and also can create lopsided matchups. My biggest focus here will be to reduce his reliance on his shieldbash and to increase the potency of his other offensive tools. So to start off, I want to change conquerors shieldbash. * Conqueror can now only initiate a forward dash shieldbash from 300-500ms into his dodge Obviously this is a pretty heavy handed start to my idea. This takes away a lot of the viability of shieldbash as Conquerors opener. The idea here is to, like his side dodge bashes, transform it into more of a defensive tool. Hopefully my other changes will help compensate for the loss of this move * Increase the speed of shieldbash mixup from 800ms to 500ms. The idea here is to make give this move legitimate mixup potential. After a blocked heavy attack, the opponent will have to make a read on a properly delayed shieldbash mixup instead of simply reacting. This will give conqueror pressure in his chains and give the opponent a reason to attempt to parry conqueror * Increase the speed of shield uppercut from 800ms to 700ms This move is already in a decent spot to catch parries, and now that the opponent actually has an incentive to parry will be even stronger. The change here is just to make this move catch parry attempts more consistently; on characters like Centurion the heavy will occssionally connect before the bash * Increase the forward tracking on shield uppercut This change is to insure that you cannot simply backdodge to avoid conqueror entirely * Remove the added guardswitch delay to the charged flail This is self explanatory. Right now, the charged flail gimps Conquerors defense way too much to be reliable as an offensive tool. This is to fix that * Increase the range on the charged flail This is so that conqueror can safely charge from outside of guardrbeak range. Again, this is just to make this a more reliable tool for conqueror to open with * Remove the stamina drain on the charged flail As it is right now your opponent can simply stay slightly out of range and wait for your stamina to drain. This change is so that the opponent can't simply choose to walk away from his charged flail * Added a 500ms guardrbeak vulnerability upon cancelling a charge This change is to limit Conquerors defensive options. Conqueror already has a variety of options from his low GB vulnerability on heavy, zone attack, fullblock, and superior block dodges. His ability to safely attempt to parry nearly every attack can lead to unhealthy matchups * Increase conqueror light attack damage from 13 to 15 This is so that conqueror actually gets a decent reward for successfully landing a shieldbash mixup or shield uppercut. By removing the reliability of Conquerors shieldbash I hope that this damage won't be very oppressive And I believe that about covers it. This clearly will make conqueror weaker, but I hope that the momentum of his chains and newfound viability in the charged flail will allow him to be aggressive in a more interesting way while maintaining viability. Again, the goal of this rebalancing is to add more pressure on Conquerors chains and to make his charged flail a better tool to open people up with. If I did miss or overlook anything do of course point it out and let me know "
306,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A Warlord Rework - From Ledgelord to GitGudmundyr.,1,9ro8h2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9ro8h2/a_warlord_rework_from_ledgelord_to_gitgudmundyr/,2018-10-27 07:16:53,"Early in For Honor's life, Warlord was one of the strongest characters, but after some significant nerfs, and the loss of guaranteed GBs after a parry, [he is a shadow of his former self](URL However, he still consistently tops the 1v1 tier list, mostly due to the power of his unlocked crashing charge. Personally, I feel like relying on unlocked movesets goes against the core design of the Art of Battle system, and would rather not have characters rely on unlocked moves in 1v1 scenarios. In this rework, I aim to give Warlord some much needed quality of life improvements and flow to his moveset, add utility to his fullblock stance, and remove his reliance on unlocked play by allowing him to use a version of his crashing charge mixup from his locked on moveset. Additionally a few of these changes would boost his abilities in team modes where he is somewhat lacklustre as well. The changes in this rework are balanced around some of the general changes in my [""Big List of Small Tweaks"" post](URL in particular, the normalization of parry stamina costs to 50 stamina damage on all parries (except zones). As usual I have attempted to minimise the animation work needed, and all the new moves in this rework use existing animations. &amp;nbsp; ##Attack Chains and Quality of Life Improvements Unlike many Warlord rework proposals, I do not want to buff his damage significantly, instead focusing on his flow and mix-ups. Warlord's identity as a ""harrasser"" and his large health pool make higher damage unsuitable, and with the improvements suggested here, additional damage buffs could make him overpowered. - **New chains.** Warlord has extremely limited chains, which are overly limiting. A **Light -&gt; Light** chain (""Northern Winds"") and **Heavy -&gt; Heavy** chain (""Allfather's Fury"") are added so that he has the full complement of 2 hit chains. - **Basic lights.** WL's basic lights have superior block, but rarely function properly. They now become **unblockable on superior block**, which boosts their **damage to 27 in top guard and 23 on the sides**. The top 600ms light also gains the **enhanced property**, allowing Warlord to chain attacks from it even if blocked. - **Basic Heavies**. The hyperarmour on these start too late to be reliably used for trading, so now it begins after 500ms into the top heavy, and 600ms into the side heavies. Their damage is also improved slightly to **27 on the top, and 33 on the sides**. - **Chained Lights**. Currently these are parry bait, being the only attacks available after a heavy. The H-&gt;H chain ameliorates this somewhat but they still need improvement. The **top light is sped up to 500ms**, and the **side lights gain HA immediately**, for better trading than the chain heavies. - **Chain Heavies.** Warlord's Headsplitter Leap is already a [pseudo-unblockable]() in that it confirms a headbutt to light poke if blocked (like Nobushi's HS heavies) A version of this is added to the chain heavies to make them more threatening and requiring a parry to avoid all damage - these attacks now **confirm a headbutt into light poke if blocked**. If the heavies land successfully, they can still be followed up immediately with a headbutt, but it is not guaranteed and has a small window to be dodged, as the Warlord has slightly longer recovery on landing the heavy than having it blocked. This would in practice allow a pretty good mind-game after a landed heavy: prediction dodge the headbutt but risk a delayed GB or undodgeable zone. (Note: I would like it if all pseudo-unblockables had their own indicator and an official name (eg. ""Momentum Attack"" and an icon of a white shield with an arrow through it), but even lacking that I think they are good for the game). - **Zone Attack**. This zone is already pretty good, but now also counts as a **chain starter** allowing easier access to his chain heavies. It is also **undodgeable** like Board and Blade (but if this is considered too powerful, this property can be removed). - **Headsplitter Leap**. As mentioned, this forward dodge heavy is a ""pseudo-unblockable"" in that confirms a headbutt on block. Unfortunately it is very easy to parry, and therefore not particularly useful. So now it is **feintable after 500ms**. It also now counts as a **chain starter** to allow the Warlord access to his finishers if he prefers. - **Shield Counter**. Now does **25 stamina damage and the combo light does 17 damage** and is a **chain starter**. (Note that all parries do 50 stamina damage see ""Massive Tweak List"") &amp;nbsp; ##Full Block Stance Warlord's full block stance has numerous drawbacks compared to other FBS, despite having a good start up time. These changes aim to give it more utility to start up an offence, as well as have better counter-attacking capacity. - **Stamina Use**. FBS still costs 15 stamina to start up, and does not allow stamina regen for its duration, but **no longer freezes stamina regen after leaving FBS**. Additionally the stamina cost of blocking attacks in FBS is reduced to the same values as Conqueror. - Warlord can now **cancel a dodge into FBS after 200 - 400ms of dodge**. FBS start-up from a dodge is 300ms. As Warlord is one of the very few characters without a dodge attack, being able to use his FBS stance from a dodge gives him a variety of counter-attacking options from a dodge, at the cost of being vulnerable to feint to GB. He will now be able to punish dodged bashes (as all characters should be able to imo). - **New move: Light attack from FBS**. This move, ""Shield Poke"" is a light attack option out of FBS, essentially the same as his old Block and Stab but available without having blocked an attack. It is **400ms, does 12 damage, hits from the right guard and has superior block throughout in the left guard**. It also counts as a **chain starter**. - **Block and Stab**: This is the second guaranteed punish (other than headbutt) from a blocked attack in FBS. It is now **24 damage and unblockable**. It also counts as a **chain starter**. Whilst slightly lower damage than Conq's FBS punish, and not being able to execute, Warlord's FBS has a faster start up, and he has the ability to feint attacks, so I feel it is balanced. - **Board and Blade**: This higher damaging, undodgeable, executing, attack is not always guaranteed on a FBS block, but this is balanced by it's more useful offensive ability due to the addition of ""Shield Poke"" and the ability to dodge cancel into FBS. Additionally it is given **400ms GB vulnerability during its start up**, so it cannot be used to stop a GB attempt. Shield Poke performs that function now. - **Crashing Charge Alternate:** This is the offensive move that should maintain Warlord's viability in duels, without relying on unlocked play. It is used by **holding GB in FBS**, and is explained in more detail below. &amp;nbsp; ##Crashing Charge Mix-up The aim of these changes are to convert Warlord's viability from his unlocked crashing charge mix-up into locked on play, utilising the main combat system. - Firstly **Unlocked Crashing Charge start up speed is now 600ms**. It also requires a couple of meters of forward motion before it can be used, similar to Raider's Stampeding Charge. This change is to reduce its power in 1v1 scenarios significantly, whilst still being useful in group fights. - Instead of unlocked play, Warlord can now access **Crashing Charge Alternate**. This is performed by **holding GB in FBS**. Warlord's shield glows with the unblockable symbol and he holds it up and starts charging forwards. He will charge forward as long as the GB button is held (up to a maximum range of several meters), and on hit it has the **same effect as the normal crashing charge** - ie. Knockdown on OOS, can be held with GB for extra range, can wallsplat/ledge etc. He also has **superior block on his top guard during the charge**, although this ends 400ms before impact or 100ms after a hard/soft feint input. - The move has **100ms start up** (GB vulnerable) and the earliest it can hit is **+400ms at close range** (ie 500ms total). At any point after the 100ms startup, the move can be **cancelled into a variety of moves**: **hard feint** to neutral, **soft feint to GB** by releasing and tapping GB, **soft feint to FBS** with a reduced 100ms start up, and **soft feint to Headsplitter Leap** with heavy input. **All of these feints occur 500ms after the input**, meaning that both defending against and using the mix-up offensively require reads. Therefore the earliest that any of the soft-feint options can occur is after 600ms. - Whiff recovery on this move is equivalent to warden's shoulder bash, granting a GB on successful dodge. Cancelling the move costs 10 stamina on top of the stamina cost of the soft-feint option. &amp;nbsp; ##Feats - **Auto Revive.** If you are the last player alive, your team is breaking, and you have this feat active, the match doesn't end until your auto-revive procs (or you are ledged/executed/match times out, etc). &amp;nbsp; ##TL/DR: - Heavy -&gt; Heavy, Light -&gt; Light chain added - Basic lights unblockable on superior block, 23 damage sides, 27 damage top, top light enhanced - Basic heavies HA starts 100ms earlier, top 27 damage, sides 33 damage. - Chain light top 500ms, sides have HA immediately - Chain heavies guarantee a headbutt + light if blocked. Headbutt is dodgeable if heavies land. - Zone attack undodgeable + chain starter - Headsplitter Leap feintable, chain starter - Shield Counter does 25 stamina damage, follow up light does 17 damage, chain starter - Full Block Stance: no longer freezes stamina regen after exiting - Can cancel dodge into FBS after 200 - 400ms of dodge, with 300ms startup - Unlocked Crashing Charge is 600ms, needs a few meters sprinting before activation - FBS + light is ""Shield poke"" 12 damage, 400ms, chain starter, hits right guard, superior block left guard - Block + Stab, 24 damage, unblockable, chain starter - Board + Blade, 400ms GB vulnerability - FBS + Hold GB is Crashing Charge Alternate, same effects as unlocked version - 100ms start-up, Warlord charges forward, superior block top - Earliest close range hit is 500ms - Can hard feint or soft feint into GB, FBS, Headsplitter Leap - Feints occur 500ms after input so reads required for both offense and defence. Earliest is 600ms. - Match doesn't end until after Auto Revive activates. - New alternate chain finisher: Back + GB, UB melee, 900ms, 24 damage, costs 30 stamina, cancel to dodge or BB at 500ms - Rocksteady has 7 second cooldown &amp;nbsp; **My other reworks:** - [A Massive List of Small Balance Tweaks](URL (Smaller character tweaks are in here too) - [Shugoki - Hugs for everyone!](URL - [Raider - REEEWORRRRK!!!](URL - [Nobushi - Pokey Pokey Bleed-Rework Club](URL - [Highlander - Rework Ma Class!](URL - [Centurion - Roman PUNCH](URL - [Aramusha - Cool Ronins](URL - [Lawbringer - Bringing Justice](URL (needs a second pass, coming soon) - [Faction War Update](URL (I know it's not a focus of this sub, but thought I'd add it for completeness.) - [Revamping Bot AI](URL (Also included for completeness) Only Shinobi and the LB update left.

307,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Generic Re-Rework Suggestion for Orochi,1,9s5gwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9s5gwe/generic_rerework_suggestion_for_orochi/,2018-10-29 05:32:42,"**Introduction:** Yes, there are several other characters that need attention way more than Orochi, but he still could use some tweaks to make him more than just a lightspam bot. Speaking of spam, with the release of the Wu Lin, Orochi identity is somewhat deluded. Nuxia has better light-spam than he does ( she deals less damage with her lights but she has tri-directional 400ms lights for all chained lights.) and Tiandi has the same ""Dodgespecialist"" theme like Roach but does it in a more interesting way ( softfeintable dodgeattacks with Variants with hyperarmor and superiour block). That doesn't mean Orochi is worse than them, especially Nuxia, but there just aren't many reasons to pick Orochi over other quick Characters like Berserker or Shaolin due to his lack of offensive potential besides unreactable lights, especially in 4v4. &amp;#x200B; Goal of the Rework: Keep Orochis identity of being a swift Assassin with great counterattack options and fluid gameplay while giving him more ways to get damage in outside of lights and turtling. Additionaly he needs something that helps him do something in ganks so he doesn't get completely shut down trough external blocking. &amp;#x200B; **Light/Heavy changes:** * All chained lights slowed down to 500ms * Similar to Nuxia, Orochi can combo any light or Heavy in a 3- chain, removing his current 2-hit chains. * Chained Side heavy damage increased from 30&gt;35 * Side heavies have increased lateral range Reasoning: The slowed down lights seems drastic at first, but it will make more sense later. The chain changes gives Orochi the most flexibility in his chains possible and will fit well with the following changes. Lastly the heavy changes are just there to improve Orochis otherwise underwhelming minionkilling, especially against Pikemen in Breach. &amp;#x200B; **New overly weebish passive: Whistling Winds** * After any Heavy or Stormrush ( doesn'tmatter if whiff/blocked/hit) Orochis next attack in the chain is 100ms faster * Orochi can replace any light/heavy in his chain with ~~i'll try spinning that's a good trick~~ any dodgeattack, Riptide Strike or Stormrush * If these attacks are used as chain finishers, they start a new chain. Reasoning: The first change compensates for the lightspeed nerfs. For PC players this doesn't change much as Orochis already use heavies and Stormrush to get into their 400ms lights but for console players this should reduce the salt from the ever dreaded ""lightspam"". The dodgeattack: Electric Boogaloo change sounds and looks dumb as no sane individual will use 3 consecutive dodgeattacks (unless you're Tiandi) but with some juicy Stormrush and Riptide Striek changes it will all make sense. &amp;#x200B; **Riptide Strike change:** * After landing Riptide Strike you can perfom the confirmed second top light like with regular top lights. Reasoning: currently Riptide Strike isn't really worth using over the other dodgeattacks because it can't be delayed, has huge gb vulnerability and confirms a easy light parry punish for your opponent if baited out. Instead of eliminating these weaknesses, it now deals more damage and leads straight into your chain finisher. &amp;#x200B; **Stormrush changes:** * You can switch targets during the first half of dashing towards your opponent. * If Stormrush is used as a chain finisher Orochi prepares a powerfull *unblockable* thrust attack instead of the regular slash * Stab is 500ms, must be dodged similar to Toestab and deals 35 damage. * Has poor lateral tracking, but catches any backdodge, hiddenstance or sifupoise because you know, orochi is running directly at them. Enemy gets easy gb on succesfull dodge. * If Orochi lands the Stab he holds the opponent in place for a short while ( works on enemies in revenge mode) similar to glads skewer, however it doesn't apply bleed nor can Orochi throw the opponent. Orochi can cancel the holdening^(TM) with a regular feint. * still can be softfeinted with the top undodgeable attack (starting a new chain) or hard feinted. * orochi releases his opponent if he or the enemy takes damage. * Enemy does **not** gain damage reduction while orochi is violating his/her intestines. Reasoning: This is the obligatory unblockable that Orochi needs for 4v4. I locked the unblockable behind Stormrush being a chain finisher, otherwise you could just spam Stormrush from neutral for never ending fifteh/fifteh spam. This way Orochi has to use the rest of his kit to access the unblockable compared to warden/conq. The Skewer effect allows Orochi to set up his opponents for top heavies, stampede charge, impaling charge etc. To ensure the move isn't to ridiculous and ends up as shaman bite 2.0 without requiring bleed, Orochi immediately releases his target when he/they get hit. &amp;#x200B; **Conclusion:** With all these changes Orochi will be by far the most mobile character in the game which goes well with his theme, who can dodge out of harms way during any point of his aggresion, which is balanced out by half of his counterattacks giving the enemy potential light parry punishes and he can't feint his dodgeattacks unlike his chinese cousins. Like current Orochi the new one has access to fast lights to slowly whittle down his opponent, but now he actually has to use that thing called ""heavy attack"" to access them. Last but not least, the new unblockable finally allows orochi to join ganks and hold his enemies in place so the 3 wardens in your team can go full ""GoN tOp HeAvY"". &amp;#x200B; So yeah, lemme know what you think of Rework post #Nr. 7418264. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"
308,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Rough buff ideas for Tiandi/Nuxia,1,9sroir,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9sroir/rough_buff_ideas_for_tiandinuxia/,2018-10-31 07:22:48,I know it's mega early as the heros JUST became available for the people who don't have marching fire. But I wanted to get these ideas out there to get feedback. So when enough time has passed I might have a more refined take on addressing the heros a month or 2 down the line. So with Nuxia the point of these changes are to make her more viable at a high tier duel level: ~Zone in combo is now 800ms (down from 1000ms) and is now a chain starter. ~Either heavies become 700ms (down from 800ms) or given a GB vulnerability of a 700ms attack. ~Traps now in addition to grabbing what it currently does will also grab any heavy attack in the direction of her trap during the trap animation. ~Buff deflect one of two ways. Either give the light the enhanced light property OR let her also do a heavy finisher off of deflect that can be turned into a trap. So the point of the zone changes really are to help the point of adding a zone into her combo. It's too slow atm to be used in combo as a mix up. and it ends her combo automatically even if it lands. Everything else in her kit lets her chain so why not her zone in combo as well? Speeding it up to possibly be the same speed as her heavies would help it be a mix up. Making her heavies 700ms would make them less parry bait and also avoid the feint into GB on reaction issue that attacks that are 800ms or slower have. But the primary goal here really just is to let her heavies be able to be thrown more often as I believe its a big part of her kit. Hence why I suggested changing it's vulnerability. The trap change doesn't address lighting on reaction or unlocking/emoting into an attack. But it does address both option selecting her traps (as zones are considered heavy attacks according to the UI) and people purposely mistiming their parry attempt to hit the person mid trap. Which imo is the biggest problem currently with traps. Finally with her deflect I would find it to be incredibly boring if they nerfed the damage and let it be guaranteed. I'd rather it have options. Hence the heavy finisher. Since the finisher itself would be fairly useful due to it's unique property. And being able to turn it into a trap means some mix ups are possible. I decided to leave the enhanced light option as it's own thing. Because While it would fit her kit it might push her to be even more light spam related. Now onto Tiandi: ~Dragon dodge either gets 500ms I frames or the attack is shortened by 100ms to be 1000ms. ~Tiger dodge superior block frames either become instant. Or they get moved onto the attack itself. ~Tiandi can now dodge cancel kick recovery. Tiandi's dragon dodge is good at dodging bash mix ups and thrust attacks. but is too slow to actually punish them with the raw dodge attack. Hence speeding it up by 100ms. But I can understand why some people are not in favor of making everything faster as a solution. Which is why I gave the I frames suggestion. As this will help Tiandi be able to deal with dodging in combo attacks. But at the consequence of people spamming the move a lot more. Alternatively we could make tiger dodge better to cover up dragon dodge's weaknesses. However if we make it instant that means on reaction he can dodge into attacks. It wouldn't be much of a problem in duels as it's baitable. But it would be borderline broken in group fight situations. If we move the SB frames to his attack instead it's both baitable and carries a realistic risk for just buffer spamming it. But again at the cost of people spamming the move more than they already do. Finally I really wish kick was something of a threat for duel purposes. And letting him be able to cancel the recovery would allow him to actually get more consistent punishes. But it would become spammed in 4's. Which is where the move is meant to be used anyway. Just wish dragon dodge was actually threatening in duels. And one way to do that would be to make kick a threat. So yeah. These are just rough ideas. Overall I find Nuxia to be an interesting hero that has tons of potential. But she needs quite a bit of polish for her kit's concept to actually shine. And I really love Tiandi just due to his kit flow. But it's a bit annoying how clunky his kit feels.

For those that ignore or doubt it, Soul Calibur 6 is a fighting game in a medieval setting (and not some character creation software, though the Create-a-soul system is really powerful). After having played a few hours and thought about it, I believe I can present you a decent comparaison between the two. &amp;#x200B; # Standard Inputs |Moves|Soul Calibur 6|For Honor| |:-|:-|:-| |Standard Attacks|Horizontal Attacks (A)|Heavy Attacks (Heavy Input)| ||Vertical Attacks (B)|Light Attacks (Light Input)| ||Kick Attacks (K)|| |Standard Defense : Defense that usually won't allow for a Punish.|Guard (G), Low Guard (G+Down) : Attack have three main types : High, Middle, Low. Guard counters High and Middle attacks while losing to Lows, Low Guard counts|Block (Function differently according to characters, require specific input to change direction.)| |Technical Defense : Defense that switch the momentum of the fight to your advantages|Guard Impact (G+Forward) : Similar to Parry, with two Key differences : you can attempt a Guard Impact after suffering one yourself, and the vulnerability of the victim depends on the timing of the Guard Impact. |Parry (Heavy Input)| |||Dodge (Dodge Input + Movement Input)| ||Reversal Edge (B+K) : While hold, it is functionnaly a Full Block Stance.

This was a huge buff to most of the cast, as it meant that you couldn't dodge roll out of every mix-up in the game, but I feel that Raider has benefited the most from this change. For a while now, Raider has been considered by most to be C-tier in 1v1s, and with good reason. Up until now, he has had no way of opening up a decent opponent. His zone was beaten by side dodging the zone and stunning tap soft feint and rolling on reaction to a feint into gb, and the rest of his attacks are just too slow to ever hit someone. However, now that dodge rolling has gb vulnerability during the startup, his unblockable zone can no longer be nullified by rolls. His zone certainly isn't the best opener in the game, but it's certainly usable, and that alone puts him MILES over the other C-tier heros, who are completely incapable of opening someone up. Combined with his super high damage off of throws, and his ability to guardbreak and counter guardbreak during dodges, I feel that Raider is now strong enough to be moved up a tier on the duel tier list."

Especially when you're ganking. As you know, heroes in revenge have their GB vulnerability on heavy startups removed. But that only counts for normal GBs. Centurion's Quick Throw (GB after light hit) ignores revenge GB invulnerability. So if an enemy in revenge is attacking a teammate, go for a Quick Throw. If the enemy is in a light chain, he can continue. If he throws a heavy or zone he'll get caught and you can cutscene them. My favourite situation is when a revenged Raider is attacking teammate. They are often throwing out a lot of heavy and zone attacks and therefore will get caught by a Quick Throw."

Rolling out of GBs, running all over the place, running attack abuse(So much), and etc. There were some efforts to try and alleviate these problems, but they were still bypassed. The purpose of these changes are to kill off bad play and abusive play for good play, all to make high level play more balanced and fun. # # 1) ALL Running Attacks Require at Least 8-10 Meters of Running Before You Can Initiate Them *This is the one of the worst problems in high level play: Players constantly abusing their fast bashes for easy damage. It doesn't help that some running moves only require you to run 2 inches to activate them. With this, running attacks will become much harder to abuse.* # # 2) Stamina Does Not Regenerate if You Are Sprinting *This is to make sprinting less rewarding when you use it to escape. If a player is at 10% stamina, all they have to do is unlock and run to regenerate stamina. And even if you do stop them, they will already have regenerated all of their stamina. (Running regenerating stamina? Really?) With this, escape running is much less rewarding.* # # 3) Rolling Now Has 100ms GB Vulnerability *This isn't one of the worst problems in high level play: This is the worst problem. Nothing should be able to counter a GB other than a GB. With this, rolling now has actual risk in duels.* # # 4) Unlock Rolling is Now Removed *This, compounded with the 0ms GB vulnerability, is what makes rolling bull. With this, not only can you use it to counter a GB, but also to flawlessly counter some bash mix-ups. There is no other choice but to remove this.* # # 5) When Locking, There's a 1000ms Window Where You Cannot Parry *This is to also make unlock running less rewarding. Right now, if you try to counter an opponent who's running with a running attack or a dodge attack, they can immediately lock-on and parry you, punishing you for actually trying to counter cowardice. This makes all running attacks that aren't bashes near useless. This fixes that.* # # 6) The Stamina Punishment For Running is Increased to 1.2-1.5 Times it's Original Punishment *Running is still somewhat of a problem(get damage off of your opponent once and avoid them for the rest of the match, and you win) and so this punishment system was put in place to stop that. The problem is that a player can still lock onto you, even while the punishment takes place, and they'll escape without going OOS(still somewhere near 10-20% of their stamina), then run all over again. This makes it so that avoiding punishment is near impossible to avoid the punishment. This will teach everyone that bad play will not be rewarded.* &amp;#x200B; All of these changes should get rid of bad or toxic play, and make high level play skillful. &amp;#x200B;"
315,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Imagine a Lawdaddy Rework with Me,0,9i14el,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9i14el/imagine_a_lawdaddy_rework_with_me/,2018-09-23 02:49:29,"(I severely apologize, but I was forced to transfer this to mobile, because Reddit wont let me log in to browser; so bear with the formatting, pls) ALRIGHT BOYZ- I know what youre saying. Another Lawbringer rework? This pleb is just gonna tell me the same biased, overpowered crap every other rework-er does! And doesnt he know that if they even are reworking him, theyve already shot any extra animations- rendering all these well-thought rework articles moot and otherwise useless??? Well, JOKES ON YOU cuz I dont really care about that noise. Ive just had these ideas clawing at the inside of my brain for months now, and Im LETTIN THESE DEMONS OUT, SON. BTW, IF ANYONE BELIEVES THIS IS OVER-TUNING OR HAS INPUT/CRITICISM, I WELCOME IT. I AM FULLY AWARE THAT I MIGHT BE BIASED AND WILL OWN UP TO BAD BALANCING. Now that my disclaimer outburst is over- Ill actually begin my article. This is not a rework. This is an overhaul. And, while Im not a REP 60 LAWGOD, I have repped him to 34 almost exclusively in duels (I did achieve GM~3000 or so in ranked PS4 if anyone cares, but honestly, I didnt dare bring out LB much in that broken gamemode), and would like to believe I know my stuff when it comes to LB. Also, I dont believe I am alone in believing that the Lawbringer is in dire need of an overhaul, but in case I am- my reasonings are very simply as follows: (skip these paragraphs if you couldnt care less about reason) The Law is inherently turtle-y built around one VERY sensitive move- Shove. I say that Shove is sensitive because, if given any kind of buffs- the move becomes rather over-tuned; yet in contrast, if the move is given any kind of nerfs- it is rendered nigh useless. Example: if Shove was given a guaranteed light, an opponent would take 15 damage EVERY TIME they attacked, regardless; yet if any follow-up light could be blocked- the Law can now do nothing to effectively defend himself except feed revenge. Removing shove on block, while a popular option, is not a good fix in and of itself either. Reason being that without shove on block- one of the most defensive characters in the game now has the least defensive capabilities in the game (every assassin has a decent option select [charge heavy or zone] for parry attempts, heavies have full-block/HA, 2 out of 3 Vanguards have OS zones and Raider has dodge GBs, Cent has charge heavy OS, HL has offensive stance OS and great dodges, Nobu has HS, Valk has Shield Tackle OS, Musha has zone OS and full-block). This can be addressed however if hes given another powerful defensive tool in its stead (or in addition, you tell me). As for offense, the Law is lacking in the sense that he has no opener, nor does he have a decent amount of viable options to continue a combo (if he can even get one started). I mean, seriously, all he can do after a shove is either light, heavy, or GB (Long-arm if youre suicidal). Most people will simply dodge on indicator, negating GB mixup; and more experienced players will delay a dodge attack on heavy reaction to punish all outcomes- given they dont hard read you and parry the heavy. On top of this (and this is a problem for many OG heroes), his rewards for getting through his clunky, slow, and lengthy combos is either an 8-900ms heavy, one of the worst unblockables in the game (slow, telegraphed, literally can parry by sound alone, has horrible tracking), or my favorite- a 700MS LIGHT FOR NO EXTRA DAMAGE. All of this is not okay, especially with these new/reworked characters thrown in the mix. If you happen to disagree with me that the Law needs an overhaul after that, I really dont know what else to say other than play him yourself and see. Sure, his parry punishes are great for damage (stamina intensive albeit); but he has no safe parry attempts and is completely at the mercy of base game mechanics except for a cheesy, cancerous shove on block gimmick. Parry punishes cannot, or rather should not, carry a moveset to viability in competitive scenarios. Conceptually, Ive always perceived the Lawbringer to be a hulking wall of muscle and steel, as I believe most people do; however, two specific attributes come to mind: Might, and Control. Its pretty apparent how I came to those attributes, as he is a 66 giant covered in what seems to be nearly 1 thick steel plate armor; and he doesnt squat into a ready stance or hunches over his weapon- he stands tall like a tower, as if hes already directing the fight. Of course, what I see in the Law and what he actually is game, however, is vastly different. The only way my boi seems to excel is in 4v4 ganking exclusively, which should not be characteristic of a heavy character such as he. My goal with this overhaul in a 1v1 perspective would be to give him more tools for actual mixups (soft feints, combo options, etc.), but no guaranteed cheese damage. I believe he was intended to play mind games and work for his damage, and I aim to give him many hard-hitting, but punishable mixups in order to do so. Form a 4v4 perspective, I aim to change his role from a Thomas the Train-esque, pancake-flippin gank-er to a team anchor better suited for holding his own in 1vX than running around YEET-ing people off cliffs. REWORK SECTION The Lawbringer General: Stamina increase to 140 Blind Justice is guaranteed on heavy instead of Impaling Riposte Various damage changes (See Attack Values) Neutral shoves no longer start chains Shove on block costs 40 stamina and pauses stam regen for 2 sec Long Arm, Impale, and Verdict (see New Moves) CCs are all interruptible on hit Considering Ive raised costs on various signature moves for the Law, a stam cap raise is warranted in this case to avoid perpetual exhaustion. Impale is no longer guaranteed on Heavy Parry, and has less distance carried. This will not change damage output however, because I replaced Impaling Riposte with a equally damaging Blind Justice (Which I believe should have been his heavy punish from the start). The vulnerability window on Neutral Shove (Dodge and on Block) still guarantees a dodgeable light, but now it is a neutral light; this was done to prevent instantaneous unblockable pressure (See Trait #6). Shove on Block is still here, folks- it just costs over a  of your stamina and longer chains at all, but it does knock your opponent back (think shugoki headbutt). The next point is my ganking nerf overall. Long Arm, Impale, and the new Verdict all release the opponent if they receive any damage from your allies, but still give your opponent revenge. This will severely limit the Laws ability to gank and will instead change his optimal teamfighting strategy to be more focused on saving teammates getting gangbanged rather than setting up big combos. Traits: Directional heavies block in the two remaining stances during the attack. Normal heavies can be soft feinted into Apprehend with an opposite dodge input All heavies can be soft feinted into Long Arm with a GB input Shove can be charged by holding GB input to predictively catch early dodges Long Arm of the Law starts chains Chain heavies can be charged into Ad Mortem heavies #1 is a major change meant to solidify his new role as team anchor. The block property would start 400ms into the attack, and is immediately canceled if you feint. The block functions the same as OoS defense, so it will not interrupt lights or heavies; and as an added measure, any attacks blocked do not contribute to revenge- to prevent target swap revenge gain. #2-3 have soft feint windows from 100ms till the parry window (see New Moves for specific details) and Long Arm is no longer accessible from neutral. #4 is in compensation for the increased speed of normal dodge shove; it yields no extra opponent vulnerability window, it is just there to attempt to catch early dodgers. #5 pairs with #6 for anti-ganking or OoS pressure options. It should also be known that Long Arm does not guarantee Ad Mortem heavies, but can chain into them. #6 is a semi-charge function for all chain heavies to turn into Ad Mortem heavies (this does not make them variable parry timings, it simply turns it into another attack)- this means that any combo could have an Ad Mortem heavy or none at all, to give more utility in using Book, Chapter, Verse. Comboes: Book, Chapter, Verse- L,H,L*L Swift Justice- H,L,H*L Judge, Jury, Executioner- L,H,H*L Order Through Force- H,H,H*L There is only one new combo in the list, and it has been added to eliminate the atrocious predictability of the Swift Justice combo. There is no Light&gt;Light combo (with the exception of combos finishers) because I do not believe it is indicative of the Law nor is it necessary. Yes, if a you land a light, it can only be followed up with a heavy, but that is not the problem. The problem is that any heavy could only be followed by a light- rendering his combos to be parry bait. The new combo (along with Trait #6) resolves that issue. The second change I implemented is adding the previously incredibly specific and unwieldy Top Swift Justice Finisher to the end of every Non-Ad Mortem combo (See Attack Values for specific details). New Moves: Apprehend- The Lawbringer- mid-heavy attack- will extend the axehead past the opponent, hooking them behind the neck, and swinging them the direction of the initial heavy. This is exclusively a soft feint for all non-Ad mortem heavies (Neutral, Chain, or Finisher) and functions as a sort of unblockable quick throw. This move displaces your opponent the same distance as a normal throw and can wallsplat, but requires skill to guarantee an extra heavy. For instance, if you quickthrow directly into a wall- you will only have enough time for a light attack; whereas if you space yourself so that they wallsplat as soon as you recover- you can get the extra heavy. (See attack values for specific details) Verdict- The Lawbringer strides forward and thrusts a free hand towards his opponents throat; and, upon grabbing his victim, lifts them off the ground- declaring, Vos iudicatus est- (You have been judged-) as he turns and slams their body on the ground behind him. As the victim reels from the force, and works back up to their knees, the Lawbringer turns the poleaxe hammer-side and readies a blow- REUS (GUILTY) as he strikes the victim across the jaw with enough force to send their body flying backwards (think Long Shot execution). This is obviously going to be his be all, end all move- and- I THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE JIANG JUN WAS A THING, OKAY?? The move consists of two parts- the stamina drain (chokeslam part) and the knockback damage (the actual hit), and is completely interruptible at all stages of the attack. (See Attack Values for specific details) Make Way- This is the unused Zone animation the devs have been refusing to implement since the start of the game. It is a 360 degree melee attack with HA, reduced cost and decent knockback in order to give the Law some breathing room in the midst of an Xv1. It should be noted that the knockback affects teammates as well- so it must be used with discretion. (See Attack Values for specific details) Attack Values: Heavies- Opener- T 1000ms,stun,40dmg,12cost; S 1000ms,40dmg,12cost Chain- 700ms,40dmg,12cost Finisher- 600ms,40dmg,12cost Lights- Opener- T 500ms,stun,15dmg,6cost;S 500ms,en.,15dmg,6cost Chain- 500ms,15dmg,6cost Finisher- 500ms,15dmg,6cost Special- Light combo- 200ms,stun,knockback,5dmg,6cost Verdict- 600ms,70stamdmg,melee,knockdown,60dmg,20+20cost Ad Mortem- 1100ms,50dmg,unblockable,36cost Zone- 600ms, 20dmg,60cost Make Way- 900ms,25dmg,melee,knockdown,HA,30cost Shove- 500-900ms,melee,HA,knockback,15-25cost,20-40stdmg Long Arm of the Law- 700ms,HA,knockdown,12cost,40stmdmg Apprehend- 500ms,wallsplat,melee,12cost,20stmdmg Impale- 300ms,10dmg,wallsplat,50cost Heavies are no longer guaranteed on GB. With the damage increases, new mixups, and actually blocking while attacking- 40 guaranteed damage on GB would be too much. Additionally, slower neutral heavies allow longer soft feint windows for more effective mind games, which is the direction I want him to go. Chain heavies are now considerably faster with the exact same properties to add pressure and reward you for getting further in the chain. Lights are now uniform with the exception that now neutral top light stuns while side lights are enhanced. Light combo is the exact same as the old Swift Justice Finisher, but is now available at the end of all combos for a little bit of extra damage; however, while it does stun, it is a situational spacing tool (also think shugoki headbutt), blocking you from continuing pressure. Verdict is replacing the Long Arm from neutral, as it is accessed by Bck+GB input, and it chains from any chain shove (pressing shove after a landed heavy). Verdict is punishable by GB on dodge, but is still an incredibly powerful move especially for the speed; and should provide LB enough tools for strong OoS pressure. Ad Mortem heavies now deal 50dmg, but are tripled in cost to prevent spamming and to provide risk in light of the new stamina cap. They manually end chains. Zone has been sped up to be at least functional in a fight, and if performed after a parry- turns into Make Way. Make Way does a little more damage, is unparryable, and has HA to boot. It is guaranteed on heavy parry as well. Shove has undergone a quite a few changes as well. Dodge shove has been sped up to 500ms as early as 300ms into any dodge, and can also be charged to catch preemptive dodges for extra cost (this is signified by the Law taking another step and does not reward any extra damage, only being able to catch opponents). Only charged shove is punishable by GB on dodge. Combo shoves still start chains normally, which allows the Law to issue immense unblockable pressure upon successive hits. All shoves now have to wait 500ms in order to GB normally, and instead chain into Long Arm (normal GB input) or Verdict (Bck+GB input). The Long Arm of the Law (BEKFEST pancake flip) finally has HA and increased tracking, but can no longer be accessed from neutral. The increased tracking is akin to Conqs shield uppercut and the recovery on whiff has been halved to 700ms from 1400ms (so it is still punishable by GB, but you can not be OoS, dash forward, then GB anymore). Apprehend shares the soft feint window with Long Arm in order to vary dodge timings. Apprehend is safe on whiff recovery but doubles cost on whiff. Impale will begrudgingly take some nerfs. It deals 10dmg now (although the increased heavy damage compensates), only travels half as far, and is only guaranteed on light parry. Any successful impale can be interrupted by any damage at any point along the journey, so as to limit the TACTICAL LAWBRINGER- INCOMING strategy to saving teammates in trouble almost exclusively. However, it only drains 50 stamina as opposed to 74 now. Conclusion Yes, the new Lawbringer is a hard-hitter. A very hard-hitter. I figured if Conqueror will never live up to it, at least the biggest non-Shugoki character ought to. However, in light of his substantial damage output- I believe that his moveset is proportionately punishable (if not, then, again, I implore you to tell me). In a 1v1 perspective, I did not give him any guaranteed damage, only the tools to ramp up his mixup game. There is a reactable counter to every mixup, but there is also a tool at the Laws disposal for most situations. The new block-during-heavy implementation is very powerful; but also discourages feinting, as that will forfeit the block property- netting potential easy parries. The same applies for 4v4. It will require good discernation of when to use which tool in what situation in order to be effective- and not simply feed opponent revenge/ruin gank setups (which is pretty much what hell do now). I do not believe full teams of Lawbringers will be synergistic, nor will Lawbringer with X hero gank teams be very beneficial- given the fact that his slow opener heavies wont allow him to capitalize on many ganks effectively (except for maybe Shugo hug, but youre already dead if that catches you in 4v4). This overhaul is pretty unique in my opinion, and I really wish that- while VERY improbable- all heroes get reworks/overhauls that give them specific, unique roles in game. It would contribute to overall health of the game as well as make it harder to know EVERY counter to EVERY move of EVERY character like most of us do now. Thats all Folks! (Whew!-) P.S. I didnt address his problematic feats in this, but feel free to give your ideas about feats/any changes you might have! Deuces. "
316,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Attempting to bring Centurion in line with the rest of the cast,17,9i8wri,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9i8wri/attempting_to_bring_centurion_in_line_with_the/,2018-09-24 00:51:43,"Greetings fair Ladies and Gents, &amp;#x200B; Today I'm going to have a try at tweaking Centurion, according to what's considered meta/balanced today. &amp;#x200B; First thing's first, about myself a little. I've played For Honor since it released. I've been a Warden main since day 1(occasionally playing pre-rework kensei and pre-rework conq too) and as you can see, slogged through what people call 'Dark days of For Honor' that was Season 2 Shadow and Might. How does this tie in all of the Cent talk? Well, I've had my share of Centurion shenanigans back in those days, even dueling people like Bandanaa(Finalist Cent on that one ubi hosted tourney, I'm sure everyone knows who that great lad is at this point) &amp;#x200B; Anyhow, I thought to myself some time back when I had free time: ""Whatever happened to Cent through all this time?"" and I realized I kinda miss the **INCREDIBILIS** shout from 50 meters away when playing. You see, I never played this guy actively, he wasn't my cup of tea, but I still to this day find his design amusing. &amp;#x200B; So, shall we begin a little journey down the short red line that are rework/re-balances? Here we go. &amp;#x200B; The goals of this post are: * Centurion, at his core, was meant to be a bully. A harasser fighter who excelled at dueling isolated people and teamfight by wreaking havoc amidst the enemy line with stuns/pins/jabs and kicks. I want to keep that character identity above all else. &amp;#x200B; * I want to give him more options, to make him stand up to the current standard of characters and have him compete with the current hero roster that is being used. &amp;#x200B; * Still leave the character as an Angery Italian boi who will fuck you up if you let yourself make too many mistakes. &amp;#x200B; # Throughout the post I shall explain every decision I've made on my part and why I think it would favor Centurion in ways it would. &amp;#x200B; Okay, first and foremost. Cent was from release to now, always been 1 thing. A noobstomper. He dispatches new players in a heartbeat but at high level, he doesn't have much going for him besides variably timed heavies. &amp;#x200B; 1. I suggest he gets reverted back to his release-self. Back when he had all that stuff at launch(besides Wallsplat combo, nobody likes wallsplat combo, that was an unintuitive side-effect of heavy&gt;jab chaining against a wall for a longer stun). Now that people have(mostly) gotten used to his tricks, this wouldn't cause that much of an issue. 2. Improve and keep his current tools(like light&gt;heavy combo). &amp;#x200B; Now, what do I mean by improving his current tools? Exactly what I mean. Without adding any new moves, this character can become a good unit, because his kit already has everything it needs to be what he is supposed to be, it's just that it's very underwhelming. &amp;#x200B; 1. Legion Kick - Straight forward unblockable. Guarantees a light attack. Stuns opponent for brief period of time(this thing stunned back in the day before it was removed, beat me if I know why it was removed because it wasn't even that bad to begin with). This moves' only problem is the fact that it is slow. Dodge+kick takes more than 700ms in total, which is in this meta very weak. It is reactable to even by the worst of players in this game. * Speed up the kick. Dodge links into kick at 100ms and the kick itself is 400ms. Drains a little more stamina. &amp;#x200B; * Elaboration/Explanation: This change speeds up the kick itself by 200ms and allows 'dodge to kick' link to happen exactly 100ms into the dodge, no more or less. &amp;#x200B; * The pros of this change is that the Legion Kick itself becomes usable at higher levels. &amp;#x200B; * The Cons of this: It still comes with its drawbacks like usual(The kick itself links from dodge, meaning that 100ms from dodge + 400ms kick makes the move itself 500ms and it is still locked timing(unlike Conq shieldbash that can be initiated anywhere between 100-500ms into a forward dodge) &amp;#x200B; * One other thing I would like to give this move is the Tiandi Palm Strike treatment, meaning that missing the Kick will not allow Centurion to chain into a light/Heavy(I think this is a thing already actually) or actually delay his guard coming back up for a brief bit.The goal of this change is make Centurion punishable for missing it. The guard would come back up 600ms from the end of the kick, allowing a light attack to land on Centurion after a dodged Legion Kick. However, Centurion would still be immune to guardbreak while his guard is not up, preventing the missed kick from being punished by a heavy instead. &amp;#x200B; 2. Charged Heavy Cancel now affects Imperial Might and Centurion's Zone Attack. * As most of you know, Centurion's ability to soft-feint his heavies into guardbreak is one of the only good sides of him. This makes his already variable timed heavies almost incredibly risky to parry, because the soft-feint allows you to catch the opponent heavy start-up vulnerability for a guaranteed GB.This change makes his soft-feint to GB even more deadly, allowing him to chain his Imperial Might to GB(this is already in the game, I will expand later on it in the next paragraph) * Second part of this paragraph is about Zone Attack soft-feint. This would essentially allow Centurion to soft-feint his 3rd strike from the zone into a GB. Why not 2nd you ask? I'll elaborate it in the paragraph after next one. &amp;#x200B; 3.Imperial Might hard-feint and soft-feint timings now match the regular feint/parry timing. * Now, Centurion's Imperial might(charged finisher unblockable) has a number of problem in itself:The soft-feint. The ability can be soft-feinted ONLY before the unblockable symbol APPEARS. What this means is that he cannot force a reaction from an opponent. Nobody is going to react that early, they are going to wait for you to soft-feint it to GB and if that doesn't happen, then they are going to wait for you to go to unblockable, then go for the parry. By moving the soft-feint timing to match the hard-feint(and parry timing, meaning 400ms before the attack hits) then opponent will be forced to react to the unblockable while still being in the risk to be guardbroken by the softfeint GB. &amp;#x200B; * This creates a read/predict based reaction and allows Centurion's charged heavy/GB soft-feint to land more often. It gives Centurion a mindgame, an offense and more importantly, it brings you closer to that mix-up intensive playstyle fighter you are supposed to be. &amp;#x200B; 4.Legion Kick now acts as a chain starter, replacing the first hit of the 3-hit Zone attack. * Legion kick was an opener to cent, it was never a TRUE chain starter. What I mean by this is that it could chain into light/heavy, but every time you kicked, your zone would start from 1st hit, risking your 2nd/3rd hit to get parried, because it's unfeintable. * This change would allow him to safely kick and go straight into 2nd hit of zone, allowing him to flow into his 3rd hit(which as explained in paragraph 2, can be soft-feinted into GB) and once again, allowing his pressure to continue and keep enemies on their toes. * This change also gives cent a stronger punish on kick(18 damage from 2nd zone hit instead of light; \*\*explained in the next paragraph\*\*) which is still acceptable in the current meta, because there are heroes like warden/highlander who get 40 damage from a neutral mix-up. * This will not make kick into light useless, it will just have a better trade-off. Again, will elaborate in one of the next paragraphs. &amp;#x200B; 5. Zone attack now causes 300ms stagger on hit/block. Damage changed for hits to 25/18/30 per zone strike. &amp;#x200B; \* This change may seem stupid, but keep in mind the Centurion's hits on zone in milliseconds are 600/600/700ms respectively. \* What this means is that when you use your zone attack out of neutral, enemy that gets hit or blocks it, gets staggered for 300ms, making his 2nd hit safe if the 1st wasn't parried(much like berserker) and again, allowing him to flow into his 3rd strike for soft-feint mindgames. \* The damage from kick being changed is the result of the kick guaranteeing a 2nd hit on zone. This makes his Kick&gt;Zone(2nd hit)&gt;Zone(3rd hit) combo not incredibly punishing to the enemy if they get hit. This problem could be addressed by allowing the kick to stun just long enough to get a light in(because light is 500ms and zone is 600ms) but I think he should keep this combo for the sake of pressure and gameplay personally. &amp;#x200B; 6. New Chain: L&gt;H&gt;L (Eagle's Cry) , Chain finisher Light is now 400ms(only the 3rd light), the light finisher now deals 12 damage; His first and second light still remain 500ms and deal same damage(nothing changed here) &amp;#x200B; * This change allows centurion to choose his offense, either go for the unblockable heavy mix-up or stick with quick low damaging light. This again, allows for more options on Centurion's end. Nothing major, just mix-up potential, trying to bring that harasser playstyle ever closer to our dear Italian boy. &amp;#x200B; 7. Imperial Might now has hyperarmor in the last 500ms of the move. &amp;#x200B; * Simple change that allows Centurion to continue pressuring opponent without danger of being interrupted mid-charge of Imperial Might. &amp;#x200B; 8. Eagle's Fury Alternate(Guard Mode) now has better tracking, allowing Centurion to catch rolling opponents; Eagle's Fury Alternate now links from dodge at 100ms and is now 500ms. * In a meta that is so prevalent with rolling to forcefully shut down your opponents mix-ups, this move is a must. * The timing speed up on it is to ensure the move will hit after the opponent rolls. Otherwise the Kensei fiasco is going to happen, meaning the opponent guard comes back up before the attack hits and it gets blocked(why isn't that fixed yet?). &amp;#x200B; 9 Lion's Roar now drains more stamina-per-strike and deals 5 damage-per-hit innately. &amp;#x200B; * Again, this makes the GB more frightening. * Naturally, this also makes Quick Throw GB after a light attack more threatening. &amp;#x200B; 10. Stamina draining abilities no longer consume enemy stamina when they are OOS, rather just pause it for 300ms. * Don't want you to stay OOS forever now, do we? &amp;#x200B; **Conclusion:** This Centurion enforces the role of his original design. A brutal bully Vanguard/Assassin hybrid hero. A harasser that keeps pressuring you as long as he is near you. &amp;#x200B; **Pros(after update):** * Quick access to unblockable bash * Dangerous unblockable finisher that forces opponent to react. * Decent damage guaranteed off a bash. * Actually viable zone attack. * Roll-catching ability * Strong mind games with new soft-feints. * Better stamina harasser * Mixups: He can use the kick for mixups, but can choose to go for a zone(18 damage) and continue his offense with 3rd strike...or he can light after kick and go into another 400ms light for quick poke(12 damage) His options are a little more open now thanks to 'Eagle's Cry' combo &amp;#x200B; Be sure to give your opinion, this is a discussion post after all. &amp;#x200B; Cheers!"
317,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Orochi Rework - From Spammer to Warrior,0,9ib1v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9ib1v9/orochi_rework_from_spammer_to_warrior/,2018-09-24 05:19:04," Currently, Orochi is on-par with Shinobi for being the most annoying character to play against. He has no openers(400ms lights are not openers, even if delayed) and so he hinges on his 400ms lights, which will not save you against high level players. So he's essentially a noob stomper in low level play, and a turtle in high level play. You know when a character design is terrible if this happens. So here's a proposition: Get rid of some of his chain 400ms lights in favor of on UB, some soft-feints and some useful dodge moves. Edit: I know that there are other characters that need a rework more than Orochi, this is just simply to try and make him more fun to fight against and as, and make him more viable. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Chains * 2nd side lights are now 500ms * 2nd side lights now deal 15 damage *This will be made up later. It essentially made him nothing but a complete spammer on console, while barely affecting PC. This is the worst of both worlds, and so it should be gone.* # New Move: Erosion Slash *Seeing that he's not in a favorable position, Orochi ducks and glides his blade across his opponent's mid section, slicing his opponent while also moving behind his opponent.* Classifies as a soft-feint Input: Heavy(Mid-animation) + light Input time: 400ms into the side heavy, 300ms into the top heavy Guard Side: Comes out on the opposite side of the Orochi's side heavy; comes out from either the left or right guard if from a top heavy Speed: 400ms for side heavies, 500ms for top heavies Damage: 12 if from side heavy, 15 if from top heavy Property: I-frames(Evasion tool), Chain-starter *Orochi is supposed to be agile and a counter-attacker, and while he does both of those things, he's not effective at it. This is meant as two things: an evasion move and a counter-attack move. Both things tapping to his agility and his counter-attacking ability.* # New Move: Erosion Carve *Seeing that he's not in a favorable position, Orochi ducks and drives his blade deep into his opponent's mid section, dealing severe damage to his opponent while also moving behind his opponent.* Classifies as a soft-feint Input: Heavy(Mid-animation) + heavy Input time: 400ms into the side heavy, 300ms into the top heavy Guard Side: Comes out on the opposite side of the Orochi's side heavy; comes out from either the left or right guard if from a top heavy Speed: 600ms from all heavies Damage: 25 Property: I-frames(Evasion tool), Chain-starter *This is the second choice of the erosion move, meant for more damage. It's intention is to punish those who try to punish Erosion Slash. We do not want another mix-up situation that gives no pressure(Raider's regular heavy/Stunning tap mixup, Ara's Deadly feint mixup)* # Zone * Orochi is now able to chain after using Zone *Out of all the OG assassin heroes, Orochi's seems to be the most disappointing. And while it's true that you can parry Berzerker's zone after blocking a hit, at least he can continue chaining. With this, he can continue adding pressure.* # Dodge Input Timings * Side and forward dodge light input changes to 100-400ms from 200-500ms Back dodge input changes to: * Riptide Strike: 100ms instead of 300ms * Storm Rush: 100-200ms instead of 300ms *These will make sense later.* # Riptide Strike * (From before) Dodge input is changed to 100ms from 300ms * Damage is nerfed to 17 damage * Can continue into chains on whiff * Given I-frames 100ms into the move *Now that Riptide Strike is the same as the rest of his dodge lights, it's only fair that it get's the same treatment for GB vulnerability(Still can't react to GB with this) and chaining. The I-frames are to still make it like a dodge attack where it still dodges any attack.* # Storm Rush * (From before) Dodge input is changed to 100-200ms from 300ms * While in the sitting position, Orochi can dodge forwards or to the sides * While running in Storm Rush but before the (Storm Rush)attack, Orochi can dodge to the sides *These changes fix many things: Storm Rush's weird and clunky input that fails to activate Storm Rush, the inability to counter dodge attacks and bashes while sitting, and the fact that Orochi can be light attacked out of SR. These changes solve that.* **New Move: Torrent Push(Bash) OR Tsunami Crash(UB melee attack)** **Torrent Push** *As Orochi's about to attack with Storm Rush, he swings his leg to the opponent's face, stunning the opponent long enough to get a slash in, then continuing the chain* Input: SR, GB button(You probably need to hold it) Input time: Same as the other Storm Rush attacks Guard Side: No guard direction Speed: 400ms Damage: 17 Property: Unblockable, Chain-starter ***OR*** **Tsunami Crash** *As Orochi's about to attack with Storm Rush, he takes his Katana and uses it to pierce his opponent's mid-section, then pulls it out to continue his attacking.* Input: SR, no guard direction(IE, let your guard go to the middle) Input time: Same as the other Storm Rush attacks Guard Side: No guard direction Speed: 400ms Damage: 17 Property: Unblockable, Chain-starter *Both of these are not getting added to him, only one. This serves as his opener, giving SR much more pressure.(Although the speeds of the other sides will perhaps need a nerf in compensation, perhaps the fastest one(500ms on the right) being nerfed down to the speed of the left SR attack(600ms))* # New Mechanic(Whirlwind Momentum) *When in his combos, Orochi can use the momentum to move much faster around his opponent, attacking and moving around much easier.* How to activate it: From the recovery of chain finishers, dodging from the sitting position of SR, dodging while running in SR Changes: Dodge light attacks are faster, at 500ms(even Riptide Strike), deal 20 damage, and are enhanced *This mechanic focuses on what the devs intended for Orochi(Specifically for his dodging out of his chain finisher recovery) and gives him a way to use his dodge attacks to continue fighting in anti-ganks and duels.(Although it may not be enough, I don't think giving him the ability to soft-feint a momentum charged dodge light into ANOTHER momentum charged dodge light would be very well balanced(Also, that would rip-off Tiandi))* # Hurricane Blast * Orochi can now execute with Hurricane Blast * Orochi can now continue into his chains even if Hurricane Blast misses * Optional: Speed up Hurricane Blast to 800ms *The ability to execute alone will give more incentive to Orochis to use Hurricane Blast, but the ability to chain after a whiffed HB was taken away for no good reason.(Deflecting is a high-risk/high-reward thing, so why punish me with a heavy for trying to maximize my punish when a deflect is hard to get?)* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Conclusion Orochi isn't meant to be a character with lightning fast 400ms moves to spam. He's meant more for countering and moving around his opponent with ease. And with this, Orochi's will finally have a way to open characters, have soft-feints to mix-up attacks, and have dodge attacks that are much more useful and don't get parried everytime. tl;dr: Less spam, more skill."

One of my favorites is becoming viable. But after a few days of having fun, I realized something: this rework made him boring. His only viable options boil down to one thing: combo lights. His improvements essentially boil down to those 400ms lights. And aside from the added combos, the Storm Rush and Riptide Strike improvements, that was it. Just a speed-up and some added flexibility. That's essentially the whole rework. Considering the significant improvements and depth that was given to Kensei in his rework, this just seems ***lazy***. Right now(in my opinion), he doesn't feel like he has his own playstyle. He's boring to fight as, and annoying to fight against. I want to fix that. I want him to become his own character; one where he dances around his opponent with ease and punishes them when attempting to attack. So here's a proposition: Get rid of some of his chain 400ms lights in favor of on UB, some soft-feints and some useful dodge moves. *I know that there are other characters that need a rework more than Orochi, this is just simply to try and make him more fun to fight against and as, and make him more viable.* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Chains * 2nd side lights are now 500ms * 2nd side lights now deal 15 damage *The first of many changes. His 400ms chain lights have act much in the same way of PK's chain lights, but they shouldn't. I say that because compared to PK, Orochi's chains are infinitely more flexible, allowing him to be far more unpredictable and tricky. So 400ms chain side lights are not needed, as they would just encourage Orochi players to just delay them until they become near impossible to even block. I am, however, keeping his top chain lights and finishers 400ms, as it does make sense that since he has his top light combo, he should have some special properties(or in this case, a speed-up) to complement his skill with his top guard.* # New Move: Erosion Slash *Seeing that he's not in a favorable position, Orochi ducks and glides his blade across his opponent's mid section, slicing his opponent while also moving behind his opponent.* Classifies as a soft-feint Input: Heavy(Mid-animation) + light Input time: 400ms into the side heavy, 300ms into the top heavy Guard Side: Comes out on the opposite side of the Orochi's side heavy; comes out from either the left or right guard if from a top heavy Speed: 400ms if used from side heavies, 500ms if used from a top heavy Hard-feintability: None Damage: 12 if from a side heavy, 15 if from a top heavy Property: I-frames(Evasion tool), Chain-starter *Orochi is supposed to be agile and a counter-attacker, and while he does both of those things, he's not effective at it.

Both offer significant mix-up potential, and a way to open up turtles.* # New Mechanic(Whirlwind Momentum) *When in his combos, Orochi can use the momentum to move much faster around his opponent, attacking and moving around much easier.* How to activate it: From the recovery of chain finishers, dodging from the sitting position of SR, dodging while running in SR Changes: Dodge light attacks are faster, at 500ms(even Riptide Strike), deal 20 damage, and are enhanced ***OR*** Changes: Dodge lights deal 20 damage, are enhanced, and can be soft-feinted(400ms before hitting, of course) into a dodge) *This mechanic focuses on what the devs intended for Orochi(Specifically for his dodging out of his chain finisher recovery) and gives him a way to use his dodge attacks to continue fighting in anti-ganks and duels.(Although it may not be enough, I don't think giving him the ability to soft-feint a momentum charged dodge light into ANOTHER momentum charged dodge light would be very well balanced(Also, that would rip-off Tiandi))* # Hurricane Blast * Orochi can now execute with Hurricane Blast * Orochi can now continue into his chains even if Hurricane Blast misses *The ability to execute alone will give more incentive to Orochis to use Hurricane Blast, but the ability to chain after a whiffed HB was taken away for no good reason, so now, it's back.* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Conclusion Orochi shouldn't be another character with lightning fast 400ms moves to spam.

320,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Thornbush's Lawbringer Rework,43,9j81il,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9j81il/thornbushs_lawbringer_rework/,2018-09-27 10:17:07,"\*\*Note that this is a very long post, but I wanted the chance to really go in depth and explain my ideas and reasoning behind them. If you just want to see the ideas and ignore the reasoning, skip the paragraphs and just check the points.\*\* &amp;#x200B; This post is going to be a bit of a break from the usual informative posts I make on this sub, and it's also something I've been meaning to work on for a while but just haven't gotten around to it. I have more of my standard videos aimed more for educating newer players planned, but with my university semester having started I'm just having difficulty to find time to make them. I'll try to get at least two of these kinds of videos out before Marching Fire releases since I'll have plenty of content to make off of that patch (optimal longarm punishes and option selects on the new heroes come to mind), but no promises since that will depend on my course load between now and October. I also want to make a Lawbringer 4v4 guide that goes extremely in depth on the character and how I play him at a top competitive level, but since that will require a lot more time as well as scheduling with my usual recording partners, I have no ETA on that. &amp;#x200B; Before I get into my ideas, I want to quickly go over a bit of background on me as a player, as I think that it is important to show you have credibility and experience before recommending any balancing changes. In game my player name is Thornbushi, and I am a competitive Lawbringer player in 4v4 and I also play Conq in duels at a high level. I am on a competitive 4v4 team trying to break into the tournament scene, and those that have scrimed with me typically regard me as one of the best Lawbringer players currently in the game. I used to play exclusively duel with Lawbringer from launch to season 3, and occasionally still play him in duel for the fun of it, or as a Highlander counter. &amp;#x200B; Now with updates and introductions out of the way, in my competitive opinion this is how I would rework Lawbringer. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Changes To Shove and Shove Mixups\*\* &amp;#x200B; As it stands, dodge shove is useless as it is much too slow to ever land offensively and doesn't guarantee damage to punish defensively, shove on block is a toxic mechanic that rewards defensive play, and shove mixups on the whole reward pitiful damage considering the complexity of the mindgames around it. If you're fighting someone with a single stimulus reaction of under 233ms, shove mixups are also negated entirely by backdash on red indicator, making it unusable against certain top competitive players. &amp;#x200B; \*Dodge Shove\* &amp;#x200B; \-Speed increased from 700ms to 600ms &amp;#x200B; \-Earliest shove can be initiated from forward dodge reduced from 300ms to 100ms &amp;#x200B; \-Dodge shove now guarantees a light attack (Note: this only applies to the dodge version of shove) &amp;#x200B; These changes are to turn dodge shove into an actual offensive tool as well as allowing it to actually punish bashes. By reducing the dodge start-up time to 100ms, dodge shove can then have a strong delay window between 100ms and 400ms, not dissimilar to that of Conq shield bash. This in conjunction with the speed increase to 600ms would turn LB forward dash into an actual mixup between buffered shove / delayed shove / dash forward GB / dash forward neutral. I'm sure this idea will be compared as a slower and therefore weaker version of shield bash, however, shove has the significant properties of hyperamor and extremely low recovery (cannot be GB punished on reaction and can't be punished by slower dodge attacks such as Kensei's). I think this will give shove and shield bash mixups their own identities separate from one another, with shield bash performing better offensively with a faster speed, and shove performing better defensively with HA and low recovery for added safety and guaranteeing more damage for punishes. Guaranteeing a light attack is self explanatory. &amp;#x200B; \*Shove on Block\* &amp;#x200B; \-Shove on block is removed entirely &amp;#x200B; There is no way to change this mechanic without it still being unhealthy, irritating and boring. The reward for blocking an attack in for honor is avoiding damage, and for such an easy task as blocking that should absolutely be the maximum reward from blocking. Shove on block rewards blocking further than just avoiding damage, and because of that does not belong in the game. &amp;#x200B; \*New Mechanic: Shove on Blocked Heavy\* &amp;#x200B; \-Whenever one of Lawbringer's heavies are blocked, a shove is guaranteed (Note: the guaranteed shove will have the properties of shove after heavy rather than dodge shove, meaning a light attack is dodgable and not guaranteed) &amp;#x200B; As a replacement for the removal of shove on block and the defensive properties that came with it, shove on blocked heavy is an excellent new offensive tool that I think is crucial to turning LB into an interesting and viable character. This would provide immediate neutral pressure from LB's heavies while also not being unreasonably oppressive since they will only link into a shove mixup rather than guaranteeing damage. This would also vastly improve LB's teamfighting and 2v2 performance by no longer allowing LB to be reliably external blocked. Shove on blocked heavy would also act as strong OOS pressure that would force reads and continue to chain into itself when punishing bad reads. &amp;#x200B; \*Shove Mixups\* &amp;#x200B; \- Chained top light speed increased from 500ms to 400ms &amp;#x200B; Having a 400ms top chained light would give LB an unreactable option to actually attack players that can backdash shove mixups on reaction (as previously mentioned), as well as have one light that cannot be deflected on reaction. Top light is easier to deflect than side lights, so I think its reasonable that the light most susceptible to deflects is also the fastest of the three. &amp;#x200B; \-New move: Dodge impale; 600ms undodgable impale initiated at the earliest 300ms into a forward dodge dealing 15 damage. Lower stamina cost on hit and block compared to the current iteration of impale (don't have the exact numbers on hand, we'll say a 25% reduction?) &amp;#x200B; As it currently stands, its possible to catch rolls during shove mixups by unlocking, sprinting and doing the impale running attack. This however can only be done on hard read and requires unlocking to pull off, which breaks the flow of the fight with unlock play. Dodge impale with its undodgable property would be implemented as LB's dedicated roll catching move. It would still only be usable on hard read, but removing the requirement of unlocking would give much better flow to shove mixups. Reducing the stamina cost is also important for it to be usable, because as it stands you're likely to send yourself OOS when trying to punish rolls with impale. &amp;#x200B; \-Improvement to guardbreak tracking after feint during shove mixups &amp;#x200B; \-Increase in range on chained heavies to catch backdashes during shove mixups &amp;#x200B; Improvements to GB tracking after feint and heavy range to catch backdashes would be important quality of life improvements to shove mixups, removing the frustrating case of GB whiffs and making backdash cover less options after shove. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Changes to Impale\*\* &amp;#x200B; \-Dedicated impale after parry removed &amp;#x200B; With the implementation of dodge impale, two of the most complained about aspects of LB can be removed entirely. Without impale after parry, LB can no longer get his 50 damage heavy parry punish, which I think is important to make him a healthy character. 50 damage off of any heavy parry is pretty absurd and the only reason LB has it currently is because its all he has, and should be removed when he is given an actual kit. Note that with my suggested speeds on dodge impale, you can still get a guaranteed impale off of light parry (light parry stun is 900ms, dodge impale is 600ms + 300ms of dodge). This way LB can still have the highest light parry punish in the game while heavily reducing his overtuned heavy parry punish. &amp;#x200B; \-Running attack impale removed &amp;#x200B; In 4v4, running impale is one of the strongest moves in the game and is a big reason on why LB is picked in most competitive 4v4 comps. With 300ms start-up, it can be used as an interrupt tool, a recovery punishing tool, and a ganking/CC tool. It can feel very oppressive when fighting near a LB with the threat of impale, and it isn't an engaging playstyle when playing LB to be hovering unlocked near enemies looking for recoveries to punish. With dodge impale being added, I feel it is reasonable to remove running impale entirely to encourage locked on play which is more engaging for the LB player, and make fighting near LBs feel more interactive for enemy players. His ganking abilities wouldn't be impacted with dodge impale still being guaranteed off of an ally GB, allowing LB to still have the role of strong ganker, but also with much healthier teamfighting. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Changes to Chains\*\* &amp;#x200B; \-New chain added: Heavy, Heavy, Heavy (Unblockable) &amp;#x200B; \-New chain added: Heavy, Heavy, Light &amp;#x200B; LB's chains currently follow a pattern of alternating between light and heavy, with the exception of the judge, jury and executioner chain. The fundamental issue with this pattern is you always know which attack will come next; after a heavy a red indicator will always be a light for example, making for an easy parry. By implementing these two new chains, LB's will follow a new pattern of any combination lights and heavies in a three hit chain, but you can never do two light attacks in a row. This will resolve the issue of predictability, while also giving his chains their own identity rather than just giving him the ""Kensei treatment"". I like the concept of LB being oriented around his heavy attacks with his lights only complimenting his heavies rather than his lights being his predominant form of offence like say Orochi, and this pattern would help enforce that. &amp;#x200B; \-Neutral, chained, and blockable finisher side heavies are given hyperarmor starting 400ms into the animation &amp;#x200B; \-Neutral, chained, and blockable finisher top heavies are given hyperarmor starting 500ms into the animation &amp;#x200B; \-Unblockable chain finisher heavies are given hyperarmor starting starting 400ms into the animation &amp;#x200B; As a counterattacker, LB currently has shove on block and his high parry punishes to fill that identity. With the reduction of his parry punishes and the removal of shove on block, hyperarmor heavies would be the best mechanic to add into LB's kit to still fulfill that identity while also being more proactive with his counterattacking rather than playing defensively and waiting on mistakes from your opponent. HA starting 400/500ms into the animation I think is a reasonable point when comparing to Highlander/Warlord who's HA usually activates too late to be significant and to Kensei's finisher HA which activates extremely quickly. &amp;#x200B; \-Increase of forward range/tracking on unblockable heavy finishers &amp;#x200B; I previously suggested a change is to allow heavies to track backdashes during shove mixups, however, better forward tracking is also an important change for LB's unblockable finisher. As it stands, the unblockable finisher is almost entirely negated by a single backdash, as it will put the enemy out of feint GB range. Improving the tracking/range to be similar to that of Raider zone would let the finisher actually function as a mixup. &amp;#x200B; \-Neutral top heavy damage increased from 30 to 35 &amp;#x200B; \-Chained side heavy damage increased from 30 to 35 &amp;#x200B; \-Chained top heavy damage increased from 30 to 40 &amp;#x200B; \-Blockable heavy finishers damage increased from 30 to 40 &amp;#x200B; LB's heavy damages have always been undertuned considering how slow they are and their lack of softfeints (not to say I want softfeints on LB, I don't think they fit into his kit), and some flat damage increases are to change that. With an increased neutral top heavy damage, there will actually be a reason to go for wallsplats as LB other than just the benefit of the blinding effect. This increase will also offset the decrease to dodge impale damage (impale after parry is usually 20, dodge impale I suggested 15), so that his light parry punish will go unchanged. With higher damage values on top heavies and side heavies staying the same or with a more marginal increase, I don't think these are unreasonable or overtuned damage values while still being very threatening in both 1v1 and teamfights. &amp;#x200B; \-All blockable heavy finishers guarantee the swift justice finisher on hit &amp;#x200B; \-All blockable heavy finishers guarantee the swift justice finisher on block &amp;#x200B; Swift justice finisher (the light stun similar to light riposte) is currently only guaranteed off of the blockable top heavy finisher, and considering the difficulty of getting that deep into LB's chain I think it should be guaranteed off of side heavies as well. Having the swift justice finisher also guaranteed when any of the blockable finisher heavies are blocked would also introduce an new mindgame that I think is more interesting than just making them unblockable. Deciding between going for a guaranteed shove off of the heavy block and continuing the chain or going for 10 guaranteed damage with the blind effect would give more options to LB's offence and make him even more threatening to external blockers in teamfights. &amp;#x200B; \-Neutral side light speed increase from 600ms to 500ms &amp;#x200B; \-Chained side light damage increased from 15 to 20 &amp;#x200B; \-Chained top light speed increased from 500ms to 400ms (previously mentioned) &amp;#x200B; \-Side light finisher speed increased from 700ms to 400ms &amp;#x200B; \-Top light finisher speed increased from 700ms to 500ms &amp;#x200B; \-Top light finisher damage increased from 15 to 20 &amp;#x200B; Going through each change one by one, 500ms neutral side lights is a no brainer. There's no point in bothering to implement some gimmicky special property to these lights, there's also no reason for them not to be 500ms. For the chained lights, increasing the side light damage to 20 increases dodge shove's guaranteed damage from 15 to 20, allowing LB to better punish bashes. This is also to reward using the more reactable side lights during shove mixups over the unreactable 400ms top light. As for the finisher lights, increasing the side light speed to 400ms might be controversial to some players since typically lights this speed are on assassins, however it is the best way for finisher lights to actually see some use. A 500ms finisher light would be consistently parried since the only alternative for a finisher is a glowing orange unblockable heavy, who's color distinguishes itself from the light attack. With only the sides at 400ms, tri-directional 400ms lights will remain as an assassin only mechanic, so I don't think this would take from their identity. Top light finisher being 500ms should appropriately be higher damage than the faster sides at 20 damage instead of 15 on sides. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Other Changes\*\* &amp;#x200B; \-Make way damage increased to 30 &amp;#x200B; \-When parrying multiple opponents at once, make way is guaranteed against every enemy that was parried &amp;#x200B; With the removal of impale as a heavy parry punish, I would still like LB to have the highest damaging heavy parry in the game, just not by as wide of a margin. Make way dealing 30 damage would be tied to highest with Shinobi, which I think is fair considering the high stamina cost. This should also make the decision between make way and light riposte more difficult, with one costing more stamina but dealing more damage, and the other dealing less damage but blinding and chaining into what is now a much more threatening chained heavy. My second point for make way I didn't give a specific ""how"" on how it will be guaranteed on every parried enemy, but I think that lies entirely in Ubi's hands. A hitbox improvement would be fine, or getting the advanced video make way animation and having it function similar to light riposte just with multiple enemies would also work, but it doesn't really matter how it is implemented so long that LB will consistently get his reward for his parry on every enemy. &amp;#x200B; \-Zone attack speed increased from 900ms to 700ms &amp;#x200B; \-Zone attack now has hyperarmor starting 300ms into the animation &amp;#x200B; \-Zone attack damage increased from 20 to 25 &amp;#x200B; LB zone is currently only used for mid clear, being much too slow and dealing much too little damage to ever be worth using in a teamfight or in 1v1. These changes as so it can be used in a wider variety of scenarios, without becoming a core tool to his offence like Gladiator or PK zone. Increasing the speed to 700ms would decrease the GB vulnerability on the zone to 100ms, which would allow it to finally be used as an option select for parries. LB has always struggled with having high parry damage without having safe parries; having multiple option selects is much stronger than having high parry damage. Allowing LB zone to be used as an option select would be a major improvement to his counterattacking abilities, without being overly oppressive due to it sitting at the 700ms mark, making for a very easy parry if baited. Adding hyperarmor as well will allow it to trade with certain softfeints, and its a unique property that zone attacks don't currently have in the game. Finally, the damage increase is simply so the zone deals more appropriate damage for its speed, and so minions in Breach can be cleared with two hits rather than three. &amp;#x200B; \-Longarm stamina damage increased from 40 to 60 &amp;#x200B; \-Longarm can no longer be accessed off of a GB &amp;#x200B; Longarm is one of those moves where it's always going to be primarily a 4v4 tool, but I'd like it to have some degree of use in a 1v1 environment as well. Increasing the stamina damage to 60 will allow it to be used on a wall punish, and introduce a decision of either going for the higher damaging top heavy or dealing high stamina damage with longarm. It can also be used off of light parry, so it can send an enemy OOS if they weren't at max stamina to begin with, at the cost of losing out on guaranteed damage. The removal of getting longarm off of GB is a extension of the stamina damage increase, as it would make for an overtuned GB punish. Its removal is also a minor nerf to LB's ganks, with one less way to land a longarm without an ally's set up. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; With these changes, I am confident that Lawbringer would be a much more powerful and healthier in 1v1, and with a vastly improved playstyle in 4v4. Note that I did not recommend any changes to feats, as bombs were nerfed in the Marching Fire open test and that might be enough to balance them out already. If anyone has any questions, ideas, or needs clarification, I look forward to discussing further in the comments."

Im not a tournament level player, but I am GM top 20 (PC). Ive limited experience playing as and against Shinobi, Orochi and Aramusha, so I wont touch on those. I FIRMLY believe I could do a better job at balancing this game than the current development team. Heres a small list of changes that I think would positively impact the meta. Zone attack given its own input (LB/L1 on controllers pick any button on PC). Removes all forms of zone attack option selects from the game. Warden: back dodge can no longer initiate shoulder bash. Shoulder bash can no longer be feinted after the running animation starts. Shoulder bash can no longer be feinted past the end of level 2. Conqueror: Shield bash can no longer be initiated 100ms + into forward dodge. Peacekeeper: dagger cancel is omni-directional. Back dodge can initiate the same attack as forward dodge. Lawbringer: Long arm has full hyper armour from start up and soft feints to GB. Heavy chain finishers now begin after one attack. Eg: shove -&gt; light -&gt; heavy chain finisher (unblockable). Or top light -&gt; heavy chain finisher. Shove can be initiated from back dodge and cancels the recovery of back dodge. Shove sped up to 500 MS, recovery increased by 100 MS and shove on block removed. Centurion: chip damage on heavies increased to 6. Kick can be initiated out of side dodge. Gladiator: zone attack can no longer be feinted, added soft feint to GB and toe stab from skewer. Raider: zone attack now has less GB vulnerability, chain heavies have hyper armour. Warlord: increase start up on crashing charge. Head-but light is now a chain starter. Berserker: leave as is Valkyrie: leave as is, potentially more damage on her heavies. Highlander: stamina drains (slowly) whilst in OS. Or reduce damage from OS heavy. Shaman: pounce now breaks upon taking 30+ external damage Kensie: leave as is Shugoki: heavy soft feint to GB added. Hyper armour properly regenerates whilst not taking damage. GB range increased. Orochi: confront an Orochi expert Nobushi: kick can feint into sidewinder Aramusha: theres nothing really salvageable, would need a full rework Shinobi: confront a Shinobi expert "
322,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha Rework,15,9k9bkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9k9bkl/aramusha_rework/,2018-10-01 05:44:11,"So I wrote up an Aramusha rework before. But uh, it was pretty shit. A lot of it was really gimmicky and didn't change much of why Aramusha is so bad. This rework will adapt a few of those ideas while introducing some new ones. **Add 100ms extra delayability to all chained attacks.** One of the biggest things I've noticed while playing Aramusha for the past year is that the input window on his chained attacks seems very inconsistent when trying to delay attacks very late. This often results in throwing a buffered attack after the window has passed. By increasing the length of the window to something like what Kensei or Berserker have currently, it would provide a boon to Aramusha by making his delays more consistent. **Deadly Feint reworked. Speed and damage of the sides/top are switched.** 400ms attacks are becoming the standard. Whether you agree with it or not, it's clearly a path the game is following since every single reworked character has gotten 400ms attacks in some way or another. Aramusha is definitely on the bottom end of these 400ms attacks though. His Deadly Feint from the top is currently 400ms, but it's very easy to counter because his other options are reactable. The thing with Deadly Feint on Aramusha is that the tops and the sides differ. The top version is faster but does less damage, and the side versions are slower but do more damage. It feels like it's reversed. So to help with a very core issue of Aramusha's design, the side versions are now 400ms and do 12 damage, and the top version is 500ms and does 20 damage. This way, he always has at least one 400ms Deadly Feint no matter what side he does a chain finisher heavy from. **Ring the Bell is now inputted like Gladiator's Toe Stab, accessible from neutral or confirmed on side heavy hit, chain finisher block.** Even with the changes above, much of Aramusha's offense would be shut down by just simply blocking or parrying the initial attack. A 500ms melee grab from neutral is enough to make people jumpy, which in turn helps to indirectly make his normal attacks a little bit more effective. To make it a bit more balanced, the move should have at least 100ms, if not 200ms of GB vulnerability on startup. **Chain finisher heavy speed increased by 100ms.** Aramusha's chain finisher heavies are pretty slow. This is just to speed them up a bit. **New Chain Finisher Light** Whenever I looked at Aramusha's kit, I always thought that his chaining was the whole core of the design. While it's very integral to it, I've realized the much more important thing is his chain finishers. A very large issue with Aramusha's offense is that a lot of it can be avoided by simply blocking, especially because of the side switch with his infinite chain. This makes him very predictable mid-chain even with Deadly Feints. Giving him a chain finisher light helps to keep people wary of a late delayed light from same side they were just attacked from. This light is 500ms, 15 damage, and has the enhanced property. On block, it confirms a Ring the Bell just like his chain finisher heavy. **Aramusha gains a new side dash attack: Squall Step** One of the tools Aramusha is lacking in his kit is a form of a side dodge attack. These are becoming universally necessary to a character's kit and Aramusha is no exception. Aramusha's side dodge attack is a double hit attack that can be activated 100ms into the dodge. The first hit is a 500ms, 10 damage light that has enhanced property, meaning it doesn't bounce off of blocks. The followup hit is a 300ms, 5 damage heavy that initiates his chains. Think of this as a toned down Berserker zone on dodge. If the first hit connects, the second is guaranteed, if the first hit is blocked, the second is unsafe, etc. **Aramusha can now use his Push Back Kick on blocked heavies, confirmed on blocked chain finisher heavies. Push Back Kick can be cancelled on hit into any action.** Aramusha has a lot of tools that are strictly tied to Blade Blockade. While in the past I didn't like the idea of giving him easier access to them, I've had a lot more experience playing Aramusha and I realized his Blade Blockade is incredibly flawed as it is. Many of the tools are very situational and it's ultimately better to use the ones that guarantee damage rather than take the risk of wasting what's a very difficult to achieve Blade Blockade. Kick would help him immensely outside of Blade Blockade, since it would give him more positioning focus and also help him with his now relatively low damage. The kick itself would be 500ms, just like Ring the Bell, however I feel it should be guardbreak punishable on dodge to compensate for such a strong 1v1 and 4v4 tool. A big problem with Push Back Kick, however, is that it doesn't function like other melee bashes in the game. Unlike many other melee attacks that cancel their hit recoveries into other attacks, Push Back Kick and Ring the Bell both lock Aramusha in place until the attack is finished. This makes them very lackluster in both a 1v1 and a 4v4 setting. Ring the Bell I feel is in a good spot now with the change I proposed, and with a bit of a faster animation and less recovery it would be a good asset. Push Back Kick as it stands now wouldn't be all that much to write home about when it hits because his options are limited by how fast his opponent recovers in relation to how slowly Aramusha recovers. To help with this problem, I wanted to incorporate an idea from my initial rework I liked. **Aramusha's side variant of his forward dodge attacks can be charged up to 1000ms, activates 100ms into dash.** A part of Aramusha's game that's ultimately not very useful is his forward dodge attacks. The side versions are very slow for a dash attack and all versions are easy to block. By allowing him to charge them, he can increase their damage up to a maximum of 25 damage and vary their speeds. This has been shown to help a great deal with a character like Centurion, whose heavies are difficult to parry because of their variable timing. At max charge, the attack will become an unblockable. Yes, the dreaded unblockable. If you remember my really shitty rework from a few months back, the title was ""Not just melees and unblockables"". While I think he necessarily shouldn't have many of them from a design standpoint, it's vital to make his offense actually threatening, something he sorely lacks and needs. An unblockable is all well and good, but like in the case of someone like Shugoki or Centurion, if the unblockable is too slow and doesn't cancel into anything, there's not much reason to use it at all. So to shore this up, I wanted to take another idea from my previous rework idea. **Aramusha can cancel any chain finisher into Blade Blockade.** This was a part of my initial rework that I liked a bit, but in hindsight it wouldn't change all that much. Cancelling into a high recovery full block parry that doesn't cancel into anything on whiff is a pretty shit move. It leaves him vulnerable for a large amount of time and the risk isn't worth it for what little Blade Blockade offers. So I wanted to make a slight change to Blade Blockade to make it a little less shit, but not completely overpowered by making it recover faster or something. **Blade Blockade can be charged for up to 1000ms after the initial activation.** Probably the biggest issue with Blade Blockade is that it's a parry that doesn't work on unblockables and leaves you very open if it's whiffed. To change it without making it unbalanced, Blade Blockade can now be charged up. This will help him a lot more in a 4v4 scenario than a 1v1 scenario, since denying powerful tools like Nobushi or Kensei's zone for a short period is very potent. Another thing I was very against in the past was giving him the moves from Blade Blockade without actually getting a block, and I still am. However one of his former Blade Blockade moves isn't a Blade Blockade move anymore. **Blade Blockade at any point in the charge can be cancelled into Ring the Bell.** This change would make Blade Blockade threatening enough to force a reaction, but not so powerful that he gets great reward from it. Ring the Bell, which is the same 500ms, 10 damage melee grab I mentioned above, is the ideal move to have from a charged Blade Blockade since it deals little damage and is still punishable if read correctly. This move would ultimately still be punishable, but it gives him an option from Blade Blockade to keep this defense strong for a moment without making it too powerful. Blade Blockade would still be susceptible to guardbreaks, and Ring the Bell will have 200ms guardbreak vulnerability. This way, it can't be used on reaction to guardbreaks but can be done on prediction to beat them. Now with all of those Blade Blockade changes, it's got to be a good move now, right? Well, a big thing I haven't mentioned until now is that the rewards Aramusha gets on Blade Blockade are very bad in comparison to his parries. However, now that certain utility moves have been shifted away, Blade Blockade can be made into a genuine offensive opening in both 1v1 and 4v4. **New Blade Blockade move: Rushing Wind** For those of you that are perceptive, Rushing Wind is a name already used for his dash attacks. This version of Rushing Wind, however, will help him in not only viability, but more importantly, his aesthetics. This move replaces Twin Vipers with a classic Samurai movie attack where he rushes through his opponent. This attack is confirmed on any blocked attack and deals 25 damage. The better part, however, is that the recovery can immediately be cancelled into a dodge, and more importantly, another dodge attack. This mirrors his sprinting attack he has now, but it makes it actually useful. This makes Aramusha a real threat in a teamfight scenario, allowing him to reposition himself behind the other team and then immediately begin charging his unblockable Rushing Wind. **New Blade Blockade move: Coiled Viper** The attack most would consider the best in Aramusha's current Blade Blockade is Twin Vipers. It functions nearly identically to his normal side heavy finisher mixup, but the finisher is an empowered version with an unblockable property. While this attack is cool, I think it could be made into a tool that helps him more in both 1v1 and 4v4. This move is done by doing top heavy from Blade Blockade, which will charge an unblockable for 400ms. After the charge, Aramusha rushes forward and slashes in a very wide arc with a 35 damage unblockable. This tool would be very strong at ""breaking ranks"" in teamfights, forcing your opponent to dodge out of the way. **New Blade Blockade move: Daredevil Reversal** Does anyone else remember that ""Aramusha"" actually means ""Daredevil""? I just remembered that recently. It confused me because Aramusha doesn't really have anything that stands out as daring or devilish. When used, Aramusha will smash his knee into the opponent's head, stunning and knocking them backward while also dealing 10 damage. If they hit a wall or another player, they'll get wallsplatted like normal, but if they're OOS they'll fall to the ground. The recovery would be a bit slower than his kick, however a wall splat will confirm an uncharged Rushing Wind and an OOS knockdown will confirm a side heavy. **Final changes: HP increased to 130, Stamina increased to 150, Blade Blockade moves can be target swapped, Rock Steady replaced.** These are all just changes to supplement his other changes. Blade Blockade being able to be target swapped will help him immensely in teamfights. Rock Steady would be replaced by a Tier 2 feat that allows him to gain 10 armor on successful Blade Blockade triggers. My original idea of this feat in my first rework was to give him HP and stamina back, but I think armor is a better choice and it works better as a Tier 2. So that's about it. Feel free to ask questions about anything I might not have clarified well."
323,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,An Aramusha Rework - Miyamoto Musashi eat your heart out!,1,9khm33,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9khm33/an_aramusha_rework_miyamoto_musashi_eat_your/,2018-10-02 02:02:11,"Despite his apparent 50% winrate (lol) Aramusha is a hero who is in [desperate need of balancing attention](URL At lower skill levels, Aramusha is both popular and powerful - [being probably the most ""weeb-ish"" hero](URL other than Shinobi, and having an infinite chain which is very powerful against players who have yet to learn to block, and pretty good vs assassins which struggle to block due to reflex guard. However at higher levels he starts very much to fall behind, only having some slight use for high burst damage on CC'd opponents. His weaknesses however, are profound, as his infinite chain is easily stopped by blocking on the top guard, his blade blockade is very risky having very long GB vulnerability and all his best moves are locked behind it, he lacks an opener, and has terrible mobility despite his official description laughably including [""very good dodges""](URL In team fights he brings very little to the table, being shut down by exterior block, on top of his low range and long recoveries. In this rework I am to improve his viability in these areas, whilst not increasing his ""noob stomping"" ability and potentially even reducing it. &amp;nbsp; ##Infinite Chain and Deadly Feints Aramusha's infinite chain having to alternate between top and sides is a unique mechanic and part of his identity, despite it being one of his main weaknesses. Rather than removing that restriction altogether, I aim to give him more options from his top heavy to compensate. - **All deadly feints and combo lights are 400ms. Deadly feints do 14 damage, combo lights do 11 damage.** - Basic and combo top heavy speed reduced to 700ms, both do 25 damage. - **Side deadly feints are available from any top heavy** (400ms before impact as usual) - Side deadly feints and heavies no longer guarantee a top light (with misleading indicators). - New **Light attack finishers: 500ms, 17 damage,** performed with a side light after any side attack, or a top light after any top attack - **Heavy finishers: can be soft-feinted into Push Back Kick** (500ms) with GB input, and can be **cancelled with a dodge**, both at normal feint timing. - **All heavies can also be cancelled into Blade Blockade**. (BB) - The third consecutive light attack (not including deadly feints) will always be a light attack finisher. - The third consecutive unfeinted heavy attack will always be a heavy attack finisher. The results of these changes are that Aramusha can use his top heavy as an opener into his side deadly feints. I felt that this was more characteristic than giving him a bash opener. With the addition of a light finisher, the restriction on his attack direction is reduced, at the cost of ending his chain. The slight reduction on his chain damage, removal of guaranteed top lights with misleading indicators, and the limit of 3 unfeinted attacks of a single type in a row are intended to make him less oppressive at low skill levels, and the addition of dodge cancelling and the kick soft-feint make his heavy finishers more versatile. &amp;nbsp; ##""Good Dodges"" Despite ""Good Dodges"" being in Aramusha's summary on the FH website, with side dodge normalisation Aramusha actually has amongst the worst dodges in the game, which compound his very slow locked-on speed. These changes should make that description accurate and give him such much needed mobility. - **Back dodge recovery normalised to 800ms** - **Can cancel front and side dodges with GB** (like raider), which allows him to dodge around more safely to compensate for his slow locked on walk speed. - **Forward side guard dodge attacks are now undodgeable**, with improved range for roll catching. Can also be **soft-feinted into deadly feints and BB**. Can start 100ms into dodge (from 300ms) - Forward top dodge heavy can be soft-feinted into BB. - **New Side Dodge Heavy:** ""Typhoon Gust"". This side dodge attack is like a more extreme version of the forward side dodge - and can also be feinted. Big sidestep then a diagonal dash attack that puts Ara significantly behind opponent, if it hits or is blocked. If feinted he is left to the side. Can soft-feint into BB. **25 damage, 700ms after 100ms of dodge, feint at 300ms** (as usual). Does not chain and has a long recovery. With these changes, Aramusha will be more mobile, able to punish bashes, and will be able to use his forward side dodge attacks into deadly feints as a long range opener. His side dodge heavy will be a potent counter-attacking and defensive tool due to being feintable, and to compensate, it cannot start chains. Also should look ""anime as fuck"" which will probably appeal to Aramusha players. &amp;nbsp; ##Counter Attacking and Blade Blockade Many of Aramusha's best moves are locked behind Blade Blockade, which is unfortunately extremely risky, having a very long GB vulnerable recovery. These changes aim to make Blade Blockade slightly less risky, and allow his BB follow-ups to be used for different counter-attacks. - **Can cancel recovery of chain finishers with BB.** - Can cancel BB with a dodge after 300ms of starting it - **GB vulnerable recovery reduced to 100ms,** giving a total GB vulnerability of 600ms down from 1000ms. (100 startup, 400 active, 100 recovery). - **All heavies, dodge heavies and zone can be soft-feinted into BB** at the normal feint timing. (except Fury Unleashed) - **All BB follow-up attacks can be done after a parry or a GB.** (Ring the Bell, Push Back Kick, Fury Unleashed and Twin Vipers), and automatically target external attackers on parry or BB block. - **Twin vipers speed increased to 900ms** (light parry punish, 40 damage) - **Fury unleashed damage decreased to 25** (heavy parry and GB punish) These changes should improve BB's utility as an alternative parry, and the soft-feint to BB from a heavy becomes an option select of sorts against some mix-ups. Allowing the BB follow-up attacks from a GB and parry mean that his punishes remain similar damage despite the speed nerf to his top heavies and removal of guaranteed top lights after a side heavy. Additionally, Twin Vipers after a heavy parry to OOS will provide excellent pressure. &amp;nbsp; ##Team Fighting This new move will improve Aramusha's team fighting ability, as well as potentially be a useful mixup in a 1v1 scenario. It is a characterful move, as it uses both of his swords from opposite directions. - **New move: Alternate Chain finisher, back + GB input, Dragon Twinstrike.** Aramusha holds his swords crossed in front of him, takes a lunging step foward and uncrosses his swords in a powerful uppercut. - **Unblockable melee move that does 24 direct damage.** - **900ms, costs 30 stamina**, cannot chain, has a long GB vulnerable recovery, that cannot be cancelled with BB. - Can **soft-feint into BB or a forward dodge at 500ms**, after step forward. This will give Aramusha much more external block pressure, as well as being a potent mix-up in its own right. It would be possible to do after a whiffed backstep light attack, for example, due to its good forward range. An opponent has 3 options: dodge or dodge attack, risk being caught by the undodgeable forward side dodge attack; attack to interrupt, risk being BB countered; GB on read to beat the BB and forward dodge option, but risk the move being unfeinted. In a team fight, as well as the unblockable direct damage, the hitstun will be able to confirm ally damage, like Gladiator's toe stab can. &amp;nbsp; ##Feats - **Rocksteady:** This feat is too powerful at the moment, and instead becomes a **passive with a cooldown once activated**, similar to Warden's Thick Blood. Once a throw, wallsplat, or knockdown is resisted, a 7 second cooldown starts before it becomes active again. &amp;nbsp; ##TL/DR: - All deadly feints 400ms, 14 damage. - All combo lights 400ms, 11 damage. Top lights not guaranteed after side heavies or deadly feints - Top heavy opener and combo are 700ms 25 damage - All top heavies can soft-feint to side deadly feints - Light attack finishers, 500ms, 17 damage. Same rules as heavy finishers (side after side, top after top) - Heavy finishers can be soft-feinted to Push Back Kick and dodge. - Third consecutive light or unfeinted heavy is a light or heavy finisher. - All heavies, dodge heavies and zone can be cancelled into BB (except Fury Unleased) - Can cancel forward and side dodges with GB, back dodge recovery 800ms - Forward side dodge heavies undodgeable, improved range, soft-feint to deadly feints - New side dodge heavy, 700ms (after 100ms dodge), 25 damage, cannot chain, feintable + soft-feint to BB. - BB can be cancelled with a dodge after 300ms, recovery reduced to 100ms (total GB vulnerability 600ms), can be used to cancel finisher recovery. - All BB follow up attacks also available after GB or Parry, as well as target swapped - Twin Vipers 900ms (light parry) - Fury Unleased 25 damage (heavy parry + GB) - New alternate chain finisher: Back + GB, UB melee, 900ms, 24 damage, costs 30 stamina, cancel to dodge or BB at 500ms - Rocksteady has 7 second cooldown &amp;nbsp; **My other reworks:** - [A Massive List of Small Balance Tweaks](URL (Smaller character tweaks are in here too) - [Shugoki - Hugs for everyone!](URL - [Raider - REEEWORRRRK!!!](URL - [Nobushi - Pokey Pokey Bleed-Rework Club](URL - [Highlander - Rework Ma Class!](URL - [Centurion - Roman PUNCH](URL - [Lawbringer - Bringing Justice](URL (needs a second pass, coming soon) - [Faction War Update](URL (I know it's not a focus of this sub, but thought I'd add it for completeness.) - [Revamping Bot AI](URL (Also included for completeness) Just Warlord, Shinobi, and the LB update left to go!

324,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Shinobi fair Nerfs/buffs. Please support.,1,9kwtvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9kwtvi/shinobi_fair_nerfsbuffs_please_support/,2018-10-03 11:46:16,"To highlight all the main nerfs for you haters out there: Damage nerf, slide tackle nerf, Range GB nerf. But all of this would easily make him the worst hero in the game and leave him with no viability. So hear me out. These other buffs are necessary. Just to note, I am a rep 60 Shinobi on PC and play in the top .01% of players. I am a credible source. 1. **DAMAGE.** Damage values should change to 17+5=22 for the double light, and 30+5=35 for the heavy light chain. As opposed to the current 24 for lights, and 40 for the heavy lights. The confirmed lights should drop from 10 to 5 damage, and the first light should raise from 14 to 17 to compensate a little and put them on par with orochi's double light. But he should still have relatively high damage, that's his role as a glass cannon. 2. **A light heavy chain**. This will give him an alternative option to the confirmed light and trade the confirmed light damage for a chained sickle rain heavy and mix-up potential to keep his light chain going. Light feint light, feint light, feint heavy, etc. As long as he feints the second attack and doesn't take the confirmed hit, he should be able to continue his chain. Maybe implement soft feints on this second heavy in the chain. The second heavy should also have increased speed to allow for a better OOS punish (#11). 3. **SINGLE DODGE CHAINS.** ***\* Most important change fundamentally.*** Heavy, light attack, and kick chains on a single dodge. This is important to fully allowing shinobi to use his mobility and he is too weak on his dodge attacks, which are all interrupted by guard-break, are easily baited and are slowed and taxed by stamina by double dodge. The purpose of the double dodge should be to throw off the timing and instigate a mistimed reaction, not to tax his stamina and speed and make all his counters ineffective and telegraphed. He needs single dodge chains. 4. **Ranged GB Nerf.** No Sickle rain after a ranged GB, instead, just a regular heavy light chain for 35. (Edit: instead of the 35 heavy light, I think the ranged GB should just gurantee a single heavy that does 40 damage, designed to execute low health players.) The sickle rain after ranged GB is cheesy because it allows for an instant kill and is sadly his optimal play right now, and out of his character. It does nothing for shinobi's renown to get the assist, and is a cheap kill on the enemy. Not sickle rain is currently around 52 damage and provides a one shot. A 40 damage heavy with no CC is a good and generous replacement. 5. **Ranged Attack Punish**. Instead of falling to the ground on ranged parries, he should be pulled in (on his feet) for a confirmed light attack punish from any range. This will make his range irrelevant when countering. He's the only character than eats top heavies and can be insta killed for getting a heavy attack parried. This is way too harsh. So confirm a punish at ANY range, in exchange for a less extreme punish. He will be less safe in terms of being punished more often, but also not as extremely punished. It's a change for the better of both worlds and will make ranged fighting less annoying, but also fair. This ranged parry change of staying on your feet would also justify his terrible recovery and free guard break from blocking his ranged heavies, which I think should actually stay to get a better punish on ranged attacks that are used too close. So confirmed light from parrying at any range, and free GB for blocking at close range. And he can still fall to the ground on the ranged guard break counter, that should stay the same. This will also give him an incentive to use his ranged kit even when people are paying attention, right now the risk is too high and ranged attacks are useless in 1v1 situations. This will also give the opponent more of a sense of control, they can now ledge with parry from farther distance if there is a ledge between you and he will always have a confirmed punish. Imagine parrying, getting revenge and the shinobi is pulled right to you from any distance with no escape. If you parry him OOS which happens a lot, he won't be able to roll away form a warden vortex etc. The situations where you parry and he's still safe 50 feet away, that needs to go, and being instantly killed for a heavy attack needs to go. Better for both worlds, ranged parries=stays on his feet, but pulled all the way in. 6. **Accidental Deflects**. You shouldn't get punished if it's on accident. I agree with making his deflect only do damage after an input of kick or light attack and make it in line with the rest of the heroes. I think his deflect should work as if he's out of stamina and it does nothing. But then only launches after a light attack or kick input and is safe with i-frames until after the input is complete. 7. **Deflect i-frames Needed**. His deflect is heavily tracked, it needs i-frames (invincibility frames). For the 700ms duration of the deflect, heavy attacks from other players will do a 180 degree turn and hit you on the other side of your teleport. So accidental deflects can be annoying for both parties. The deflect should be safe with i-frames up until the point where you input an attack. After a deflect, the i-frames should end after the light attack and allow you to recover instantly from the light to defend. These i-frames should make up for duration of the animation. You shouldn't be more vulnerable on a shinobi's deflect than Pk's deflect for example. She can punish and instantly recover because it is fast. Her punish is 500ms compared to his 700+ms. His deflect should be more elusive as an escape and punishing tool. 8. **THE BACK FLIP.** The idea here is to exchange a GB punish for i-frame or a hidden stance property. My suggestion is to allow a window in the startup of the back flip where shinobi can be guard-broke, but exchange that punish for a hidden stance property on the flip. So you can GB the startup, but external attacks will whiff. The key to this is that you should be able to punish the kick, if shinobi makes a mistake. The back-flip should be vulnerable to guard-break from startup until the moment shinobi's hands hit the ground on his flip. This way if they GB late, they can still be punished, but still get an opportunity to punish the dodge. This will make him more punishable in a 1v1 setting, but make him more elusive in group fights and the back-flip should be his safe retreat in group fights and not get tracked by external attacks. I think when his hands touch the ground is the perfect moment to end the GB punish window. 9. **ZONE ATTACK**. Another big one. HIS ZONE. It's absolute trash and the worst zone in the game next to centurion. For the love of god please allow him to cancel his zone. It's a free parry and you take more damage than you dish out. This one is a no-brainier, but very important. 10. **Soft Feints?** Consider adding soft feints into his kit somewhere, but I don't see it as necessary. Maybe add a soft feint GB with the zone cancel or on his heavies. He doesn't need any light soft feints imo, but I wouldn't complain if he got some. 11. **Out Of Stamina** **Punish.** Compare shinobi to orochi who get's 70 damage on OOS punish and revenge throws. Shinobi gets the current 40 damage no matter what, suggesting to nerfing it to 35. Whether it's a GB, OOS or revenge throw, wall splat, it's all 40 damage. I think shinobi should get 2 heavies on his OOS punish to confirm this. So 30+35=65 plus maybe the sickle rain follow up, or not, idk. Shinobi should be able to capitalize on stamina punishes. This is something that needs to change especially if shinobi gets a damage nerf. Shinobi's first heavy should stay the same speed, but his second heavy should be sped up. This will give him more options to get into sickle rain if a light/heavy chain is added and add more speed to his second chain heavies and when he rolls in for an attack, which would be really good as this move is often interrupted. 12. **The Kick**. 500ms is a good speed for the kick. Side kick should be 500ms like the forward. The overall double dodge kick is just too slow. It's a bad counter tool. It's a bad opener. And it's bad trading tool. It can do all of these things, but is inefficient in everyone of them. He should have the option of kicking on a single dodge or a double dodge, the startup of the kick itself is react-able, so shinobi can dodge as many times as he wants and not truly force you to move. The point here to to be able to use your mobility to change up the timing of your attack and instigate the enemy to mistime a dodge. Shinobi already has this aspect but he has to either double dodge or quad dodge kick to throw off the timing. It would just streamline this aspect and make the kick better as an opener and a countering tool by making the overall move faster and less anticipated. The side dodge kick would basically become as effective of a counter as wardens shoulder bash but with more timing options. So there's a couple ways this could play out. Punishing the kick on prevention or punishing it after dodging the kick or playing it safe. Also the delay window for the kick should be slightly increased. Kick recovery should stay exactly the same. 13. **Un-dodge-able heavies**. Shinobi's first heavy should be undodgable, as well as his heavy after a chained roll. These heavies are specifically only useful when trying to catch people dodging and predicting their dodge, but it doesn't always track and hit like it should. Not to mention they still have time to dodge and then block or parry the heavy. It would also fix another big issue for shinobi, he cannot catch anyone trying to run away. Everyone can outrun his ranged attacks even when he runs up right behind them, by the time you charge or throw a ranged attack, they are out of range. It's extremely hard for him to catch anyone because he doesn't have a running attack besides the slide, which is hard to do on someone running away and drains all his stamina. An undodgable heavy after a double dodge should be his way of catching people trying to run away. Especially because he has no running attack. Also adding a running heavy attack would be nice as well, but it doesn't change the need for this property on his heavies as this is how they function, but not as consistently as they should. If he doesn't get this property I think they should at least speed up his heavies that way they can't dodge and block so you are at least rewarded for your read. 14. **Slide tackle nerf.** Slide tackle tracking should be slightly nerfed. I didn't really ever use slide tack because of it's high stamina cost and clunky trigger with double sprint, but it's actually really strong. For example, I previously thought that duel was Shinobi's worst game mode because his range was not a factor and everything he has is react-able. But I was wrong. Slide tackle is 3-400ms startup, and even if you try to dodge on reaction it will track you, you have to pre dodge it or try to interrupt it, this sets Shinobi up to cancel it and react, maybe GB the pre dodge or parry the light they throw trying to interrupt it. You do have to sprint slightly longer to trigger it than with WL's or raider's charge. But it is still a very effective tool. Depending on the map it puts Shinobi in low S or A tier in duels, just to put some perspective on how broken this move is, if you decide not to abuse and use it, Shinobi will instantly drop to C tier in duels. I just have to say, I don't want to play like this. I would rather Shinobi have viability in his actual kit and not resort to unlock running like warlord. So, nerf slide tackles tracking, and stick to these other rework changes. It's not an ideal play-style, but this does make shinobi less of a priority and about on the same level of warlord but a lot less damage and ledging potential, it also doesn't provide an OOS punish like WL's bash, but it is an opener that actually works. Another thing to note is that it does revenge lock until after your first hit, so it's good for ganking and will allow your teammates to get heavies in before they can revenge. 15. **Penetration.** His sickle rain heavy needs a new property called Hyper armor penetration. I think Cent needs this on his pins as well. Beserker is really strong, and there's really no way for characters like shinobi or cent to address him without losing damage on trades. If we time a certain attack well it should penetrate his hyper armor and stop him in his tracks. For shinobi, I think his second heavy should have a hyper armor penetration property, as well as his heavy after a chain roll. 16. **Lights**. Consider speeding up his lights. The only reason I say this is that he has no speed advantage against someone like warden who also has 500ms lights. But I think asking for 400ms lights is too much. I think 450ms would be a good speed to start with. All I want is if me and warden attack at the exact same time, I should be hitting first. Also consider 0-50ms GB vulnerability on light attacks as well, as opposed to the current 100ms. **The conclusion.** Shinobi will be less annoying to fight, punishable at any range and on back-flips. But now he will have more incentive to use his ranged kit. The whole basis of shinobi's play style is in and out ranged and mobile ability. But his ranged attacks are shut down and his mobility is easily interrupted on dodge attacks. His ranged and dodge attacks are supposed to be his biggest strengths but they are his biggest weaknesses instead. These will change that. Make shinobi punished more often, but punished less extremely at the same time. Give him a healthy risk reward that allows him to use his kit and allows the opponent to punish reasonably. I am defensive about shinobi, he's my main and he's weak overall and has never been in an OP spot other than maybe the first 2 weeks of launch. I hope to get some support on the positive changes here so I can actually justify a damage nerf. Single dodge chains, and less extreme parry punishes are huge for shinobi and his overall health. He is also getting a lot of nerfs from stamina and revenge stats being removed and all of his feats being nerfed into the ground as well. With all the ways to get guaranteed damage in the game, shinobi can no long survive long enough to get revenge or be of an use in a fight. This is based of my experience in the 2 breach tests. It was really bad for Shinobi. I think after marching fire there's no doubt in my mind Shinobi will be C tier in 4v4 modes. And he will continuously become more of a priority as the game evolves. Thoughts? "
325,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha Rework: The viability was within you all along...,1,9lf1g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9lf1g4/aramusha_rework_the_viability_was_within_you_all/,2018-10-05 05:26:09,"Cutting straight to the chase here... ## Purpose of the Rework Aramusha is one of the heroes with the biggest gulf between design intent and gameplay reality. To illustrate this point, I will briefly review design queues I ascertained from Ubisoft's resources, and then compare them with the perceived reality we all share. Design Brief|Identity|Strengths|Weaknesses :--|:--|:--|:-- Intention|A close-up harassment oriented mix-up machine, in the guise of a heavy/vanguard hybrid. He has a high skill ceiling, as denoted by his *""Hard""* difficulty label|Broad range of attack speeds for unpredictable, rhythmic mix-ups. A plethora of defensive options, as he is a heavy, with *""Very Good Dodges""* and *""Very Good Special Block Move""*.|Aramusha's *insane* defensive abilities are balanced by assassin-level health, and his chains have a pattern to stop the 400ms light from being too devestating. Reality|Aramusha is usually mistaken for an assassin, as he plays like a clumsier Orochi. He would be considered *Easy* by the community if he weren't so ineffective, as very little can be done to distinguish one's level of skill when playing this hero.|Nothing Aramusha does is strictly *great*; the best he can do is *decent*. Decent zone, decent parries, 100ms GB vulnerability on heavies.|His mix-ups are predictable (often reactable). His dodges are actually *worse* than average, with the same 600ms side dodges that everyone else gets, but with no range and no further options; he has no way of punishing many bashes as a consequence. Finally, all his cool moves are locked behind a counter move that locks him in for 1000ms of GB vulnerability. The goals behind this rework will be as follows: - Increase skill ceiling, allowing good 'musha players to really express themselves with the hero - Improve his defensive capabilities to allow him to deal with good bash offenses, and to anchor his team a little better in such modes - Improve flexibility of his moveset, for a more dynamic and expressive experience, and greater offensive power - Maintain his current identity by borrowing as little as possible from other heroes; nobody wants him to just be Orochi with a cool hat, or a weebier Conqueror Let's get to it, then! ## The Rework # Dash attacks - Both versions of Rushing Wind can be accessed from 200ms into the forward dash (from 300ms), until 500ms - Lateral distance covered by Rushing Wind (Alternate) increased substantially - Forward fracking on both moves nominally improved - Rushing Wind (Alternate) gets i-frames from 100ms into the attack Aramusha can now access hyper-armour or i-frames at 300ms into his dash, or almost immediately when mid-chain (more on that in a moment). His increased movement for both options (but now particularly the alternate) make these moves more appropriate for team fighting. Target swaps with chained Rushing Wind (Alternate) in particular should be very useful now. # New Chain/Feint options - A new offensive version of Blade Blockade (more about that later) can now cancel the recovery of any light or heavy - Rushing Wind and Rushing Wind (Alternate) are now available during chains - Rushing Wind chains from top light as a *top heavy* input, replacing the heavy finisher after this attack - Rushing Wind (Alternate) chains from a side light as a *same side heavy* input, with *opposite side heavy* still accessing the finisher - Available as a soft-feint from any heavy finisher as a *top heavy* or *side heavy* input respectively - The defensive version of Blade Blockade is available as a soft-feint from either heavy finisher - A special version of Ring the Bell is available from the top heavy finisher as a *top light* input The Offensive Blade Blockade provides a number of additional options for Aramusha mid-chain, if he is prepared to invest the time and stamina. This new move also makes blocking the finishers more risky, as the immense block-stun gives Aramusha time to prepare a new mix-up. Access to the dash attacks mid-chain allows the Aramusha an escape to another target if he plans ahead. Interrupting Aramusha's finishers will be a risk now, as he has a low, and high commitment answer to those, with Rushing Wind and BB respectively. A fast command grab soft-feint from the top heavy finisher balances out it's lack of a 400ms light to feint to. # Blade Blockade There are now two versions of Blade Blockade - Defensive Blade Blockade - Used from neutral, or as a soft-feint from the finishers - Options available on successful block are same as current - Recovery can now be cancelled with a dodge - Offensive Blade Blockade - Used to cancel the recoveries of attacks - Options available on successful block are same as current - Recovery can be cancelled with; Dodge, Offensive Ring the Bell (explained shortly), Push Back Kick, Fury Unleashed, and Twin Vipers Timings for the two Blade Blockade variants are as follows: Version|Start-up|Min Active|Max Active|Recovery :--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: Defensive|100|400|700|500 Offensive|100|200|500|200 **Ring the Bell now has two versions** - Defensive Ring the Bell - Used after a successful block with Blade Blockade - Now takes a direction input, and throws the opponent accordingly - Wallsplats, although the knockback range remains low - Offensive Ring the Bell - Is still 400ms - Available as a soft-feint from top heavy finisher, or a recovery cancel for Offensive Blade Blockade - Lateral tracking comparable to Gladiator's Toe Stab - Very poor forward tracking Defensive Blade Blockade will be used similarly to it's current state. The flexible active frames will improve the tools's ability to block variably timed attacks, and dodge cancelling the recovery will improve the moves safety when used outside of GB range. Offensive Blade Blockade allows Aramusha to mix his opponent up with very powerful options whilst mid-chain. This will be most effective if Aramusha can stun the opponent with a heavy first, as he will be close enough to apply pressure from any of his options. # Miscellaneous - Recovery on all non-interrupted lights, and all non-interrupted non-finisher heavies, increased by 200ms - Added 5hp; Aramusha now matches Kensei for 125hp The recovery increase allows Aramusha to mix up his timings, making his single 400ms light a little more difficult to punish. It will also allow him to time his new chained dodge attacks more precisely, to maximise the value from i-frames or hyper armour. The HP increase is more symbolic than anything else, but I don't believe it unbalances the hero. ## The Result After this rework, some key things change about the Aramusha playstyle. # Offense Aramusha's 1v1 offense will now revolve around three core positions of power: - Zone Attack; despite the inclusion of useful tools, this attack will likely remain fairly useful, as Aramusha's most accessible mix-up - Throwing a heavy with the hopes of it landing or getting blocked; this will enable him safe and easy access to Offensive Blade Blockade (and its wealth of powerful options) at close range - The heavy finishers; these can be accessed within their effective range more safely than Offense Blade Blockade, and now provide better mix-up potential. There is meaningful risk to blocking these moves now, as mentioned above with Offense Blade Blockade as a possible follow-up In team fights, Aramusha will enjoy several benefits from this rework: - External blocking Aramusha is no longer a big shut-down; a single blocked heavy gives him access to several strong options that ignore guard, including big unblockable pressure, and fast CC, with opportunity for ally damage contributions - New access to versatile mobility options mid-chain will allow Aramusha to target-swap very effectively, perhaps also providing a little chase-down, if needed - The more flexible timings for Defensive Blade Blockade allows him to counter opponents with sweeping hitboxes like Kensei or Nobushi more effectively # Defense Aramusha used to be a fairly effective turtle with his 500ms dodges, before those were removed. Now, Aramusha has an above average defence, with more flexible options, and now being more meaningfully equipped to deal with the meta threat of bashes. - When faced with a neutral bash oriented playstyle, backward side lights into Rushing Wind (Alternate) becomes a strong defense, as the light can strike an early basher, and the i-framed attack will be available for a brief period thereafter, in the event of a delayed/charged/soft-feinted bash. This defense is safer than a regular dodge attack, if timed correctly, but would be more difficult to successfully use in a real match; thus balancing the option - Blade Blockade is now safer, with its flexible timing. Dodge cancellation also improves its usefulness, when employed outside of GB range # Counters When facing this Aramusha, there are still a few match-up-agnostic measures you can take to increase your chances of victory: - Control the spacing; Aramusha's range is still fairly poor, and although he has good tools for advancing, doing so still puts the defender at an advantage, as is the For Honor way - Prioritise dodging or parrying his heavies over blocking them, as an opponent is block-stun is now good news for Aramusha ----- Well, what do you all think?"
326,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Here are some of my Shugoki tips and tricks so you can give him another whirl or improve your gameplay. He's somewhat complex and does have mindgames.,61,96uerm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/96uerm/here_are_some_of_my_shugoki_tips_and_tricks_so/,2018-08-13 12:01:58,"Comment down if you didn't know one of these :) 1. Learn to abuse your Hyperarmor and take risks with it. Its a powerful tool and is Shugoki's sole saving grace alongside his Demon's Embrace. It gives Shugoki the options other character's don't have and not alot of players including some of the good ones are aware of Shugoki's potential because he's not picked/explored alot and it'll usually allow you to ""cheap-shot"" someone. 2. As a Shugoki if you get parried then you will not lose your Hyperarmor. Depending on certain character's parry punish they will be vulnerable to a guaranteed GB from you so I recommend knowing HP/Dmg values and standing near a wall and throw out a parry-able attack if you want to take the risk. If I recall correctly, Lawbringer's Light Parry punish is an unblockable top heavy which leaves him vulnerable and same for Kensei's Top Heavy Unblockable after a Light Parry. 3. Learn your opponents pattern and playstyle. The easiest example is someone standing a distance to throw attacks but most of the time he's up close then he attempts to GB. Learn to react to a GB animation and then throw out a Light Attack into headbutt. Easier said than done but you will shut down any potential offense and keep your Hyperarmor. If they are trying to deflect you then throw out heavy feints and tap them with a GB or Light although it might not be guaranteed based on timing. 3. Learn to GB during your opponents Recovery. For Heavies you need to take the hit directly and then GB them. For Unblockable bash/opener that can't be parried like Conqueror's Shieldbash it follows the same example as Heavies although some Unblockable's have quick followup attacks that you will have to Block/Parry or time your GB earlier than usual. For Light attacks you will have to GB about the same time you see the animation/flicker appears. Its a highly rewarding thing to achieve. 4. You can Demon Embrace minions. 1st you Lock-on when there are no players, 2nd you input a heavy then softfeint into Demon's Embrace. Its a big window of vulnerability and if you were at low hp then minions around you might kill you but its quite noteworthy. 5. You can faint your chained 2nd heavy. Yes. Apparently some Shugoki's don't do this. You can whiff the 1st Light/Heavy then go into the chained 2nd heavy. Combined with Point #2 if they didn't parry your Light then you can followup with a Heavy into a Feint and then GB and pray to goddess luck they fell for it. Try to delay it a bit longer as well to trick someone into trying to Parry. It won't work alot but it does keep your opponent on their toes and they might slip up when you do something outside of your pattern. 6. Shugoki's Zone attack which is a 2-hit side swipe with good tracking and you can only feint the 2nd swing. Its mostly useful against Out of Stamina opponents who back away from you. If they parried the 1st swing then you just sit back and recovery your stamina. If they blocked the 1st swing then you will continue into the 2nd swing and you should delay it just enough to trick them into trying to Parry it and then you cancel and Parry their slow attack. The Zone attack can also be used up close to bait someone into thinking you threw a Light attack based on the animation but its a bit slower to mess with their parry/deflect timing. 7. If you're on the Offensive/Defensive and losing then you're doing something wrong and might need to adjust your timing on attack/feints or play a little differently. You wouldn't want to be predictable now would you with your already lacking moveset options :L 8. If you lose your Hyperarmor but still have stamina then you can dodge roll obviously or take the high road and stay on the offensive when your opponent is taking this opportunity to try and kill you before you get your Hyperarmor back. Good times when you GB a Warden on the startup of his Shoulderbash simply because he got lucky removing your Hyperarmor or backward light attack a Highlander going for a Kick/Toss mixup to cheese your fatness. If you can deal with their unblockable bash/opener for that brief moment without Hyperarmor then you shut them down. 9. If you're Out of Stamina and no Hyperarmor then you should accept your impending demise. On the other hand if your opponent lacks an unblockable bash/opener then they'll most likely try to run up to you to GB and push you down into their max punish. You can throw out a Light and watch as your slow attack makes their GB attempt bounce off and they take a hit to the face. Muahahahaha. 10. Assassin keeps dodge attacking you? If you have Hyperarmor then go for a charged heavy which will track their dodge attack and out-trade them if they reacted early otherwise you should just cancel it. You can also go for a light/heavy into a 2nd heavy preferably from Top since Shugoki's side heavies swing a little to high and dodge attack animations lower the character's hitboxes assuming the visual animations match up."
327,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Yet another move idea for orochi,5,9731xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9731xt/yet_another_move_idea_for_orochi/,2018-08-14 08:56:05,"First off, I realise orochi has no priority for buffs right now, as he is already """"""reworked"""""", but i was thinking about this move for a while now and think it would suit him really well. **Iai stance** Activated by holding back on analog stick (or mouse), same as all-block for conqueror. Orochi does as step forward, gets closer with his body to the ground and holds sword similarly as he did when you did left storm rush with pre-rework orochi. Similarly as hidden stance, grants i-frames on activation, albeit only for 300ms and can be guardbroken, to prevent it from being used as a free out of jail card like hidden stance. This would allow it to be an effective counter-attacking tool, adding to his moniker of 'counter-attacker'. From this stance orochi would have access to two moves (they can only be done after 400ms into the stance): 1. Hilt bash. By pressing guardbreak, he would do a 500 bash with hilt of his katana, hitting the belly of his opponent. Does stun and chains into guaranteed chained light. Start-up has 0ms gb vulnerability. Enough recovery on whiff to guarantee gb for the opponent on dodge. 2. A sword draw. By pressing heavy, orochi does a slash from left with his sword. 500ms, undodgeable, does 20 damage, can execute, chains into other attacks, cannot be feinted. The purpose of this move is to counter-attack high-recovery moves that are i-framed through and to punish prediction dodges to the hilt bash. The stance cannot be held. If you choose to not do either move, orochi gets back to neutral 600ms after the activation. Can be cancelled by a dodge 400ms after activation. The purpose of this stance would we to work both as a counter-attack and an effective opener. Could help in 4v4 as well, as orochi would have at least one melee to threaten external blocking opponents with. Tell me your thoughts :)"
328,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Blasphemy to Some, but Shaman Could Use a Little Love",1,9740kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9740kj/blasphemy_to_some_but_shaman_could_use_a_little/,2018-08-14 11:07:33,"**==Introduction:** **Why Shaman Needs Tuning==** While plenty of players would just as soon see Shaman removed from the game, if were being honest with ourselves, shes like a half-trick pony. She ganks to live and lives to gank, and thats about it. Sure, shes better than plenty of low-tier heroes, but that doesnt mean she can hold a candle to the rest of A and S-tier in any context outside of coordinated ganks (and we ARE NOT balancing the game around random matchmaking without communication). Shaman is the product of the developers listening to the screaming masses of mid and low-tier players and then gimping her to pacify them. She's not bad, but she could be so much more. I propose some changes to do what the developers tried to do with Nobushi: even her out to make her a strong character in all areas of play, without being oppressive or underperforming in places. **==New Moves and Properties==**  New property: After a successful heavy attack (including dash heavies), press/hold guardbreak to fast flow into Predators Hunger/Mercy. Shaman is all about flowing her moves into each other, and this adds a potentially safer way to do so, as the hitstun of the heavy prevents an immediate light attack from interrupting the fast flow. The cat stance of the startup (where Shaman rests while guardbreak is being held) provides enough time for the attack to not be guaranteed, as the opponent will recover during this time. At this point, the Shaman is susceptible to a quick light attack, but this is beaten by hard feint into parry/deflect on read, and the move can be dodged as normal (the hitstun of Shamans heavies may need to be adjusted in order to achieve the desired outcome; it would need testing).  New move - Predators Grasp: After a successful parry or guardbreak, press backwards + heavy. Shaman hooks the opponents knee with the underside of her axe head, draining 25 stamina. Shaman then slashes the opponent with her dagger (guaranteed), dealing 5 physical damage and 15 bleed damage, draining at 1 damage per second. Finally, Shaman follows with a top stance heavy that has the properties of her left unblockable heavy (40 damage, 1100ms, unblockable, can soft feint into dodge or guardbreak, or be hard feinted, and allows for the bleed stab afterwards). The slash applies heavy hitstun, so the opponent cannot simply light attack the Shaman out of the heavy. Shamans parry and guardbreak damages suck, plain and simple. Getting the start of a zone off a heavy parry is something, but its a lot of stamina for a mediocre reward. Opting to do the bleed stab off a light parry or guardbreak is pitiful damage on its own. The new parry counter remedies this, while still allowing Shaman to access her blood trance. Shaman is still perfectly capable of doing any of her existing punishes, if you so desire.  New property: Blood trance is now active while Shaman herself is bleeding, while still being active when her target is bleeding. Blood trance no longer activates via fire damage (this may have been fixed already). While in blood trance (bleeding or locked onto a bleeding opponent), Shamans eyes and health bar glow (to keep things fair and look cool). Blood trance is the core identity of Shaman; she is supposed to be a reckless predator who goes cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs when she smells blood, and it seems odd that she would discriminate whose blood sets her off. This also allows the real Shaman to be active more often, and couples with the following new move. As far as I know, we dont currently have any issues with target-swapped bites landing on non-bleeding opponents, so this shouldnt result in any weird interactions.  New move  Sacrifice: From neutral, press backwards + guardbreak. Shaman cuts her own hand with her dagger, inflicting 10 bleed damage, draining at 1 damage per second (800ms). This is another way for Shaman to enter her blood trance, while of course sacrificing your own health. It only leaves blood trance active for 10 seconds, so the pressure is on to make it worthwhile. The move also takes a lengthy 800ms with no armor and cannot be feinted or counter-guardbreak, so attempting to use it unsafely will lead to free damage for the opponent. Ally guardbreak into bleed stab is already in the game, so this wont make her especially more powerful as a ganker, as entering blood trance was never really a problem in gank situations.  New property: while in blood trance, all of Shamans attacks (light and heavy; not zone, guardbreak, or melee attacks) are sped up by 50ms. I know, this breaks the rule of 100ms increments by which For Honor abides (low key, Zerker already breaks this with his deflect, thanks freeze). A 50ms speed increase *shouldnt* make her lights completely unreactable, but will put the pressure on the opponent just that little bit more while Shaman is at her most powerful, and works with her identity as a character. As it is only a 50ms increase, hopefully the developers would be able to simply speed up the existing animations a touch, instead of having to make new ones.  New move  Gnash: During a successful Predators Mercy, press guardbreak (before the bite damage is applied). Shaman tears into the target and deals 20 physical damage and 10 bleed damage, draining at 1 damage per second, and does not heal at all, while also not consuming the targets remaining bleed like a normal Predators Mercy, and applies the stun effect (dizzy, like Raiders stunning tap. The new bleed damage stacks and ignores the normal bleed cap. This move is a gamble, risking the guaranteed damage and healing from Predators Mercy to prolong blood trance and potentially land more damage overall. Gnash is affected by the revenge change to Predator's Mercy (in the next section).  New property: Predators Hunger/Mercy and Wild Cats Rage can now be soft feinted into themselves as well as each other. While not a huge change, the look at her weapons strategy will be less damning, especially when used in tandem with one of the rebalances below. **==Rebalances==**  Buff: Shamans healing on successful strikes while in blood trance now heal 4 HP on a light (4 + 4 on double light) and 12 HP on a heavy (up from whatever the hell it was before). Her healing on successful strikes right now is worthless. Were it not for the green flashes, most people probably wouldnt even notice that she heals at all. Getting a decent amount of healing from things that arent her bite make blood trance move versatile.  Nerf: Predators Mercy now deals 35 damage (down from 50) and heals 15 HP (down from 20). Targets are able to activate revenge 200ms after the damage is inflicted (down from an eternity). Shaman is *the* ganker in 4v4 because her bite leaves the target helpless for such a long time. Ally guardbreak setup is just a part of the game, so making the bite harder to land would only serve to needlessly nerf her in other aspects of the game. With these changes, bite is still a strong CC option, but requires more precise timing from Shamans teammates and no longer allows for two heavies if the target gets revenge.  Buff: Wild Cats Rage (top stance) and Wild Cats Pounce (sprinting attack) gain the undodgeable property and roll-catch. Both of these moves are relatively useless, as there is really no reason to make Wild Cats Rage 200ms slower than it could be, just to use a different stance. Wild Cats Pounce is a decent chasedown tool, and undodgeable amplifies that. Right now, nearly everything Shaman does gives an un-counterable guardbreak after being dodged. This, along with the next buff, will help mitigate that.  Nerf: Shamans health set at 110 HP (down from 120). With the more potent healing in blood trance, an HP reduction will help offset this, so she does not become too difficult to take down. This puts her on par with Shinobi as the lowest health heroes in the game, although not by a drastic amount.  Buff: Shamans chain heavies from right and top stance are now 700ms (down from 800). As we all know, 700ms is the upper limit for attacks that have 100ms of guardbreak vulnerability on startup. This, alongside the undodgeable property on top stance Wild Cats Rage, help mitigate the just dodge and guardbreak strategy against her. **==Feats==**  Rush is replaced with Bounty Hunter. Please, just do it already.  Flesh Wound is replaced with a new unique feat Finish Strong: *Passive:* *as health decreases, so does stamina cost.* Like Hard to Kill, cost reductions come in at 25% intervals of max HP, with a 20% stamina cost reduction applied at each interval. Flesh Wound is pretty useless, and this new feat, while not the most powerful tier 2 feat out there, compliments her balls out playstyle and, alongside Bounty Hunter, provides an alternative to double traps.  Hand Axe is replaced with Slip Through. A selfish feat, but Hand Axe doesnt really work in practice as well as it does on paper. In ganks, an ally can help you apply bleed, 1v1 fights arent especially relevant, and in team fights, you will rarely get a bite off without being interrupted, so Slip Through can provide a reliable damage increase, especially since all of Shamans team fighting comes from dash attacks.  Nail Bomb is replaced with Fear Itself. While Nail Bomb is great when it works, it deals a lot of friendly fire, is awkward to use mid-fight, and is completely undone by Second Wind. While lacking Sharpen Blades, Fear Itself is still a very powerful feat for team fights, allowing Shaman to bring more to the table in that department, and still can stack with Fury if Shaman decides to run that over Second Wind. **==Final Thoughts==** Shaman is the character that, when I first saw her in the S4 trailer, I had been waiting to play all long. Im not that into Samurai and sure Warden is pretty slick, but her aesthetic is just too cool to not play, at least for me. With the potency of the reworked heroes and upcoming Marching Fire death machines, alongside copious whining, Shaman has slipped down to where she barely holds her head above water (ganking aside). As I stated at the beginning, she is not a weak hero by any means, but with the power creep thats happening, simply being not weak isnt good enough. Youll notice that the majority of my proposed changes deal with blood trance, and thats because blood trance is where her identity really lies. Many of the heroes in this game have an identity crisis; they may all look different, but a lot of it boils down to 400ms lights, fast melee attacks that require a read (or dodge-roll lololol) to avoid, or abuse of armor. Shamans only 400ms attack is her top bleed, and I did not make many changes to her Predators Hunger because these arent the point of her character. I also didn't increase her neutral damage at all. She is supposed to get into her blood trance by whatever means possible, and then capitalize on her opponents fear of the bite to land damage from a variety of sources and heal herself before returning to neutral. These were just some things I dreamt up while bored at work and are definitely open to tweaks and changes, but if you are one of those people who say you had me at removed from the game, then please keep it to yourself, or take a serious look at her current state. Thanks for reading!"
329,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A Nobushi Rework - Pokey Pokey Bleed-Rework Club!,88,978em9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/978em9/a_nobushi_rework_pokey_pokey_bleedrework_club/,2018-08-14 23:35:35,"You don't hear many complaints about Nobushi, mostly because she is so [shy](URL and [modest](URL but she is not in the [best of states balance-wise](URL currently. Now that Warden is top-tier, it's only fair that [Nobushi gets some buffs to join him](URL Nobushi is a great defensive hero with her Hidden Stance, but suffers from a lack of offensive options without using a huge amount of stamina. In this rework, I aim to give separate costs to the defensive and offensive uses of Hidden Stance to allow her to use HS much more liberally as an offensive tool, in addition to improving her attack flow. Also I would like to give her some improved counter-attacking options to represent her ""versatile retreats"" identity. ## Hidden Stance Changes. Hidden Stance is widely considered ""the best defensive tool in the game"" as it has the same i-frames as a dodge, but without the same guard-break vulnerability. It also has many attacking options available from it for effective counter attacks. However, this defensive capacity comes at an enormous stamina cost - 24 stamina to use and a freeze on stamina regeneration for 5 seconds! This stamina cost is rather high for defensive use, and almost completely hamstrings HS's use offensively. So in this rework I suggest giving these two uses different costs. - **Hidden Stance now costs 15 stamina and does not freeze stamina.** This allows much more liberal use for offensive purposes, feinting, recovery cancels and so on. - However, **if an attack is dodged with Hidden Stance, an additional 10 stamina is used, and stamina regen is frozen for 3.5 seconds.** To indicate that the HS has been used to dodge an attack, the Nobushi could twist slightly, moving her leg slightly up a bit more. - **The extra stamina cost also applies if a GB is countered whilst in HS, or if another HS is performed within 2 seconds without an attack in between.** This prevents a defensive player from spamming HS, and compensates for HS's ability to CGB. - Also, **the speed of HS recovery cancels is improved to be the same as dodging**. (Eg. Currently Sidewinder Form recovery is cancelled much sooner with a dodge than HS) ## Offensive Improvements. These revolve around improving her attack flow and speeding up a few of her attacks. - **Light Attacks**. The **basic top light and all chain side lights are 500ms.** Improved forward tracking on light attack openers to increase her range (because despite her supposed long-range identity, she actually has fairly average reach). Chain light **double hit finishers now do 6+15 bleed**, down from 6+20. - **Hidden Stance Light Attacks**. The first **light attack from HS is now 400ms**. Damage is still 8. This will give Nobushi a stronger opener, but it is telegraphed by HS so it is not overly powerful. - **New chain**, ""Centipede's Bites"": **Heavy -&gt; Light -&gt; Light**. - **Sidewinder Form**, side dodge + heavy speed improved to **500ms after 100ms of dodge, but damage reduced to 20.** This allows it to land after a heavy parry, and to be used more aggressively. Additionally now starts chains, which cancels recovery. Additionally the damage reduction slightly reduces her power in Brawls, where she is a bit overtuned. - **Cobra Strike** Forward dodge + light can attack from **any guard direction** instead of just top. **Top guard speed now 500ms.** - **New move**, ""Scorpion Sting"": **forward dodge +heavy**. A quick chop from top guard, **500ms after 100ms of dodge, 20 damage, starts chains**. Good forward tracking to catch rolls. - **Zone attack**. First hit of zone attack is **undodgeable**. Second hit **can come from any guard** (using a light attack soft-feint). ## ""Versatile Retreats"". These changes are to improve Nobushi's counter-attacking ability, to reflect her versatile retreats identity. - **Cobra strike** side dodge + light can now be used **up to 500ms into a dodge**. - **New move**, ""Tarantula Pounce"": **back dodge + light**. Similar use to Orochi's riptide strike, Nobushi dodges backwards then dashes forwards to stab with the same animation as cobra strike. **Top guard, 700ms, (after 200ms of dodge) 6 damage + 20 bleed**. - **Swift Recoil**. The **back dodge after blocking costs 15 stamina** down from 35. Can transition into Cobra Strike with light attack or Scorpion Sting with heavy attack. Swift Recoil can now also be used after any landed attack or blocked heavy. ## Feats. - **Arrow Strike**. This is a fairly useless feat despite its high damage, due to its tiny AoE. Now called ""Arrow Volley"" it now **functions like the first volley of Arrow Storm**, hitting in a line in front of the Nobushi, doing **25 damage. The feat has a 180 second cooldown**. The idea is to play into her identity as a ""zoner"", as this will force opponents to disengage, and gives her some more space, potentially to revive an ally. It would be very good at clearing minions too, but this is balanced by its slow cooldown. ## TL/DR: - Hidden Stance, default cost 15 stamina, costs 25 + 3.5 second regen freeze if used to dodge attack, CGB, or spammed. - All light openers and chain sides are 500ms - Double hit light finisher 6+15 bleed - HS lights are 400ms - New chain H-L-L - Forward dodge light attacks from any guard, top 500ms. - Side dodge heavy 500ms, 20 damage, starts chains - New forward dodge heavy, 500ms, 20 dmg, starts chains - Zone attack first hit is undodgeable, second hit from any guard - Side dodge light can be delayed to 500ms into a dodge - New back dodge light, 700ms, 6+20 bleed, top guard - Back dodge on block costs 15 stamina, can be also done after any attack, chained into forward dodge heavy or forward dodge light **My other reworks:** - [Shugoki - Hugs for everyone!](URL - [Raider - REEEWORRRRK](URL - [Lawbringer - Bringing Justice](URL (needs a second pass, coming soon) - [Faction War Update](URL (I know it's not a focus of this sub, but thought I'd add it for completeness.) Next up, Highlander! Also coming - a bunch of smaller hero tweaks, general balance stuff, game mode tweaks, and other reworks (Centurion + Shinobi).

330,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Another raider rework thread. on to S tier a la warden style,0,97idnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/97idnc/another_raider_rework_thread_on_to_s_tier_a_la/,2018-08-15 23:48:13,To preface this with 3 simple positive changes they turned warden from the scrub he was to an S tier hero 1. top UB heavy 2. improved tracking on SB 3. running dash heavy what these changes did was keep warden true to his play style. adaptable and straight forward. relying still more on his primary mixup tool his shoulder bash yes there are more changes than just those 3 but its either in the normal or negative realm. So can i suggest these 3 simple changes to turn raider to S tier. i would like raider to still rely more on his primary mixup tool which is the stunning tap 1. stunning tap animation changed to his top light finisher. the tap is now 400ms. 2. special Heavies and zone must now be hard feinted into the stunning tap and no longer soft feinted. But the heavies can be hard cancelled anytime from the start of the swing animation till the last 300ms of the attack. After a hard cancelled heavy top light must be input to throw a stunning tap. to compensate for this his special heavy and zone have the same start up time time and GB vulnerability SB has. the tap will have improved tracking so people who dodge on special heavy or zone timing early will be tracked by a later cancel into stunning tap. people who attempt to dodge late will be tracked by an early cancel 3. normal heavies can now be soft feinted at 400ms into stampede charge with super armor. the animation for special heavies and normal heavies can be a simple blue hew on the heavy to allow the opponent to differentiate. input wise it will work like gladiator skewer. However special heavies can be used from neutral what do you guys think.

332,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A Massive List of Small Balance Tweaks.,235,98bnic,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/98bnic/a_massive_list_of_small_balance_tweaks/,2018-08-18 23:24:27,"For Honor tends to do its balancing in slow cycles of big changes, with only a few heroes getting ""reworked"" every few months. However, I feel like the game could benefit from more regular, smaller patches, and I hope some of these changes might make it into weekly patch notes in the future. These changes are intended as small tweaks to characters who don't need extensive ""reworks"" to be balanced, as well as changes that I feel will benefit balance for all heroes. There are also some tweaks/fixes to team modes at the end of the post, which hopefully will rebalance team modes away from CC moves a small amount. This is a long post with no TL/DR, as the points are fairly compact to begin with. I'm very happy to ""tweak the tweaks"" in this list with community input, and maybe this thread could be something we can collectively encourage the Devs to implement. ## All Heroes These changes are small tweaks and fixes, less dramatic than the season 5 parry changes for the most part, and are designed to work within the current design paradigm without changing the feel of the game overly much. The final point about stamina costs is optional, and would be a much greater change, but is included here for the sake of discussion. Feel free to skip over it if you aren't interested. The other changes I feel are necessary for the health of the game. - **Parry stamina costs**. All parries, light or heavy, **cost opponent 50 extra stamina**. (Zones still do not cost extra stamina on parry). Reasoning is as follows: - It doesn't make sense that light attacks, which are harder to parry, are less punished stamina-wise. - This also makes heavies slightly less risky, so hopefully they will see more use. - Parry counters that do extra stamina damage will become more useful/less broken on heavy attacks (eg. Centurion). - Because parry stamina costs are currently based on attack stamina cost, there are many attacks which have bizarre stamina costs on parry - for example Orochi light finishers give a 14 stamina parry punish, Raider's Fury costs 210 stamina on parry, Celtic curse has different costs if soft-feinted etc... The proposed change will fix these outliers. - **Fast zones. ** - The first hit of all 500ms (or faster) zones gives a light parry punish (no stamina cost on parry). - Any subsequent hits of multi-hit zones give a heavy parry punish, regardless of speed. (Unless otherwise noted) - This is because fast zones are difficult to parry (more so than normal lights), but there is very little incentive to try, as the damage rewarded is minimal, there is no stamina reward, and most of the time, zones do not chain and therefore do not need to be stopped as much. The only reason currently to risk parrying a fast zone is if the opponent goes OOS throwing it, which good opponents mostly do not, and this change doesn't affect anyway. - **Reflex Guard**. Can now buffer a guard switch during hitstun/blockstun. Also applies to any other action that static guard characters can also buffer (dodge, attack, etc) - **Static Guard**. - Remove 200ms delay on attacking/GB after a guard switch. This will allow static guard heroes better attack from neutral, and improve ability to feint into different guard attacks. (If deemed too much of a buff it could instead be reduced to 100ms) - Remove instant second guard switch (Static Guard Bug) - **Rolling.** - Ability to convert a dodge into a roll by unlocking removed. Dodge will complete as normal when unlocking. - Rolls given 100ms GB vulnerability at startup. - **Guardbreaks.** - Guard-breaks are inconsistent across the cast because movement speed affects their range. Characters with slower locked on speed should have greater GB range to compensate for that, and make GBs consistent. - Reduce GBs ability to track around obstacles. - **Deflects.** - Deflect frames now take priority over i-frames for normal attacks. This should make side deflects much more consistent. - Deflects can no-longer be performed on undodgeable attacks (because that doesn't make much sense). - **(Optional Stamina Cost Rebalancing)** - This is an optional change, far more sweeping than the points above, designed to rebalance the game to give defence and attack similar costs. The intention is to reward a player for taking the initiative, to encourage offensive play, and to make blocking costlier. The changes should encourage parrying in more situations, which would make feinting more effective. However, implementing this system would likely require significant changes to character stamina values, and is far more work than the rest of the changes mentioned here. - Blocking an attack now costs the same amount of stamina as throwing the attack that was blocked. (Eg. 6 stamina to block a light attack) - Having an attack blocked costs an additional 6 stamina. (eg. 12 stamina to have a light attack blocked) - Feinting a normal attack costs 6 extra stamina - Parrying still costs no stamina - Being parried costs 50 stamina as mentioned, but may have to be decreased - Dodging costs 6 stamina, but whiffed attacks do not cost extra stamina - When OOS, blocking and dodging do not cost extra stamina, but chip damage from heavies is doubled, and light attacks also do chip damage. - It is likely that stamina pools for all characters will need increasing significantly, and stamina damage from bashes, stamina regen rates, and stamina costs in general, will need to be altered to accommodate this change. &amp;nbsp; ## Individual Heroes. Most of these characters are fairly well balanced and only need small tweaks. A general theme is to improve roll catching (with removal of dodge-roll, these tweaks are only necessary to catch unlock rolls or double back-dodge rolls), nerf over-powered moves, and improve team fighting ability in characters which are shut down by external blocking. Heroes that are not included generally need more extensive reworks in my opinion. **Kensei** Improve his more useless moves, but otherwise is well balanced - **Nature's Wrath**. Give undodgeable property, and better tracking to catch rolls - **Chain side lights**. Now 500ms to improve soft-feints and chain capacity. (Basic side lights have excellent tracking to compensate for slower speed, top lights do higher damage) - **Feats:** Unblockable lasts 30 seconds and has 180s cooldown. (Conflicting info - this may already be the case). Chilling stare cooldown increased to 120s. **Orochi** Aim mostly to improve his team fighting capacity. With fixed stamina costs and removal of the guard-switch bug, Storm Rush should be able to function as a decent opener. - **Storm Rush**. Fix stamina costs (12 on hit, 18 on block, 30 to feint). Allow target switching in SR stance. Soft-feint into jumping kick with GB, 500ms, 24 stamina, 50 stamina damage. Similar animation to forward throw, staggers and pushes opponent back several meters, can wallsplat/ledge/unbalance if OOS. Long recovery, so only confirms forward dash light on wallsplat/unbalance, otherwise confirms only confirms ally damage (a heavy). - **Riptide strike**. Reduce GB vulnerability window in line with normal dodge attacks. - **Forward dodge light**. Improve tracking to catch rolls. - **Feats.** Kiai now only stuns/blinds. It no longer prevents stamina regen for such a long time, still interrupts attacks. If an attack is interrupted the opponent is dealt 50 stamina damage (like a parry). Applies to Shinobi as well. **Conqueror** Shield Bash needs a bit of a nerf to be less oppressive. Small buffs to the rest of his attacking moveset to compensate. No changes to his strong defensive moves, because he is intended to be a defensive hero. - **Shield Bash**. Now occurs between 100ms and 300ms into forward dodge (same as WL Headbutt), still between 300ms and 500ms into side dodge. Costs 15 stamina. - **Full Block Stance**. Startup 300ms as before. - **Shield Uppercut, Shield Bash mix-up**. Now 600ms and 700ms respectively. Improve shield uppercut tracking to catch mis-timed side dodges. (SB mix-up is not considerably faster, because of the possibility to chain it infinitely after any punish) - **Charged Heavy**. Blocking a normal light attack no longer stops heavy from charging. Blocking a heavy or enhanced light does. Guard switch delay is 200ms (up from 300), and walking speed is normal. Still cancelled by dodging and being hit. - **Feats:** Shield basher does 5 damage per hit. Conq's great neutral shield bash makes this feat overly oppressive, compared to other heroes with Haymaker. **Gladiator** Make zone less safe, improve lights and defence. These minor changes may not be sufficient, and Glad may need a more extensive rework to compensate for the nerf to his zone, particularly with regards to Sucker Punch + Counter Jab. - **Reflex guard**. Duration 800ms. - **Zone**. Cannot be feinted, costs 80 stamina total, gives light parry punish. Stamina damage down to 15. Still a powerful interruption tool (with GB invulnerability) but much riskier if missed. - **Chain lights**. Either 500ms and 14 damage, or 400ms and 11 damage. 2nd light, sides 400ms. 3rd light, top 400ms. 4th light, all 500ms. - **Sucker Punch, Counter Jab + Bamboozle**. Idea from u/Dawson9705. Can chain into Skewer or guaranteed Fuscina Ictus (OOS version not guaranteed). Bamboozle has the same properties as Sucker punch now (ie. Does stamina damage, chains into heavies, skewer, toe stab etc) **Peacekeeper** Aim to buff damage slightly, and make it easier to execute. I would also like to give her a knee stab move like Glad's Fuscina Ictus to improve her team fight ability, but her synergy with Shaman might make such a move too dangerous. Hopefully nerfs to Shaman's bite and buffs to revenge will compensate for that. - **Zone**. First hit damage is lowered to 13 - **Bleed followup**. Damage now 1 + 7 bleed - **Heavy Attack damage**. Dodge 18, basic 25, chain 30 (12 stamina). - Possible new move: **Knee Stab**. A low lunging stab to the knee. Back + GB, 600ms unblockable melee move. Does 5 damage. Does 10 additional Bleed damage if opponent is already bleeding. Vulnerable to GB on dodge. **Berserker** Berserker needs a small nerf, and reducing his defense slightly seems appropriate - **Reflex guard**. Duration 700ms. Makes him a bit more vulnerable in group fights to compensate for his HA chains, and a bit less powerful vs other assassins. - **Zone**. Does 4 x 5 damage for 20 total. Backwards zone does 7 + 6 + 7 for 20 total damage. Slightly reduces his gank damage. **Shaman** Overall a rather balanced hero, with the exception of her ganking. With changes to revenge + CC, she should be less potent in that situation, but her bite and a few other moves could still be worth looking at. - **Predator's Mercy**. The bite now does 30 damage + 10 heal if the bleed on the opponent was applied by another character. - **Predator's Hunger**. Hitting a predator's hunger no longer bounces the shaman backwards so far if the opponent was moving forward. Attacks after a successful bash have improved forward tracking to hit even with slight bounce off the opponent. - **Chain Lights**. Non-double hit lights are 400ms, in line with other reworked assassins. Damage reduced to 13. - **Zone.** Second part gives a heavy parry punish. **Warden** Shift power from shoulder to sword, keep simple moveset. - **Valiant breakthrough**. Now a stabbing animation (currently it looks a bit odd) - **Shoulder bash**. Overall too powerful currently. Slightly reduced range on uncharged, slightly reduced roll tracking on charged (that's what valiant breakthrough is for), slow down charged to take 400ms to hit (1400ms total) Right now it is too hard to dodge even when you predict it successfully. HA during charging starts later - light attack interruption and dodge attacks are countered by feinting and parrying, so HA is not as necessary. - **Top heavy unblockable.** Speed up to 900ms to reduce light attack interrupts, and allow feint to GB to actually catch early dodges. - Add **Heavy -&gt; Light -&gt; Heavy chain**. ""Ashfeld's Resolve"". - **Chain top light**. Speed now 400ms, damage 13. After crushing counter 300ms (to be actually guaranteed). - **Feats**: Conqueror feat also improves capture time in Tribute. Applies to other heroes with that feat. **Valkyrie** Adds back some of her mix-up potential and ganking ability. Reduce ability of Shield Tackle to turtle indefinitely. - **Sweep**. Input Back + GB to allow GB mix-up (in order to keep it a ""bash"" rather than a heavy attack). Able to be delayed 300ms (up from 200ms). Recovery reduced so as not to be GB from OOS opponent. It should be in line with other high-damage confirming bashes (eg. Warden charged shoulder, HL Kick, etc...) - **GB range and feint to GB**. Improve this to stop GBs whiffing all the time. Could be fixed under the general GB changes. - **Shield Crush Alternate**. Can be performed after a blocked or landed heavy. Does not guarantee anything, but like LB shove, a subsequent light attack is unable to be blocked or parried. Due to her 400ms chain light, this is a less reactable mix-up than LB shove. (If it guaranteed a light, Valk heavies would be too dangerous on block). - **Shield Tackle**. This move has lost a lot of its character, but still manages to be very problematic, as there is no counterplay to a Valkyrie just sitting in the full-block stance. This attempts to make the move less safe for stalling, but better for counter-attacking and ganking. - Has superior block top during bash so harder to interrupt. - Can cancel the charge into a forward dodge attack with light attack. - Charged can soft-feint into heavy tackle version by pressing GB in the first 200ms of charge. Heavy Tackle has weightier animation and knocks opponent down, and does 50 stamina damage. Has very long recovery though, so does not confirm damage for the Valk. Valuable ganking tool. - Shield Tackle now freezes stamina regen for 3.5 seconds. (As good defensively as Hidden Stance, so should have similar costs) Additionally, after sitting in FBS for 1 second, stamina starts to drain at a rate of 20 per second. Feinting it still costs 30 stamina. This should prevent a Valk from overusing Shield Tackle as a defensive move, or using it to stall a fight boringly. - **Side Dodge attacks**. Can be started between 200ms and 500ms of dodge. (after 100ms would make them the fastest dodge attacks in the game) Variable timing makes them harder to parry. &amp;nbsp; ## Team Modes Team fight modes are at the core of For Honor's appeal, but have some significant issues. These general changes should improve some of the more frustrating aspects of team fights, and hopefully tone down ganking a small amount. Also some tweaks to Tribute to make it more exciting. - **Fight UI.** - Fix disappearing indicators, especially due to distant attacks that will not hit. To indicate which attack will hit first, make that indicator brighter or have a secondary glow on it. - Distant attack indicators: the way that these are calculated needs to be looked at. If the attack is out of range, and will still be out of range even if the characters move towards each other before the attack connects, then no indicator should be shown. - Give external GBs an indicator. It can be smaller than the locked on indicator, but there should be some indicator - Change enemy block widget to show that a character is externally guarding against you/is not locked onto you. Potentially this could be some kind of full block indicator, and/or a transparent shield in the centre of the widget. - Max-range attacks: if an attack will move forward into hitting range, then its parry indicator must be shown, and the attack must be parriable, even if it is out of range at the normal parry window. This is most typically a problem on HL's OS unblockable heavies, but is true of any attack in theory. Alternatively, these moves could be changed so that the forward motion occurs more at the start of the move than the end, but a more general solution would be preferable. - **Revenge:** - Autoparry now no longer cancelled by changing guard or switching target. Attacking/dodging/GB etc still cancel it. - Allow revenge activation within CC moves, knocking down opponents upon activation. To compensate, CC moves only increase revenge meter upon completion/damage application, although damage from allies during the CC will increase revenge as per usual. - Revenge gain is capped at 80% of the meter per opponent. This means in a 1v1 situation, you will not be able to activate revenge. However, if another opponent shows up, either during the fight, or after it, whilst you still have revenge build up in the meter, you will be able to activate it. The Revenge Attacks feat bypasses this limit, as does an opponent using an active feat on you (eg. Kiai, Pugno Mortis, etc) - Show an indicator of opponent revenge meter. Either a 3rd bar under stamina, or a slow filling of the attacker/defender icon with colour. - (Possible change: Opponents killed by a player in revenge cannot be revived. Revenge damage boost reduced to 20% to compensate) - **Revives:** - Default revive health is still 50% - This is increased by 10% per opponent you were outnumbered by. ie.1v2 = 60%, 1v4 = 80%, 2v4 = 70%, etc. This is to balance out the increased likelihood of being executed in a gank. - **Tribute.** This mode needs revitalizing, as currently it is severely under-played. - Steel and experience gain equal to dominion, as tribute matches often last as long as dominion matches - Respawn score penalty now based on current score, or score at death, whichever is lowest. This means if you are killed defending your offerings, and your opponents take them all, you will have a lowered respawn time. However, if your team gains an offering whilst you are dead, you will not have an increased respawn time. - **Minions and Captains added**. - Each team has a single captain NPC who guards the offering areas. If killed he respawns in 30 seconds and moves back to the offering area. If out of combat, his health slowly regenerates (like the tier 4 feat). - Groups of minions are scattered around the map, in 4 groups of 5, which respawn occasionally. The number of minions per side is displayed next to the team icons. If at any point the number of enemy minions is reduced to 0, your team gains an extra captain who spawns to defend the offerings. He will respawn on a 30 second timer, but only if the number of enemy minions is 0 again. - A similar change could be made to Dominion, with 1 captain per side in the main lane + an extra one depending on which team holds the minion zone. &amp;nbsp; Thank you very much for making it all the way through this post, I would very much appreciate your feedback!

334,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,The Shinobi Rework to End All Shinobi Reworks,9,98hwnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/98hwnl/the_shinobi_rework_to_end_all_shinobi_reworks/,2018-08-19 14:57:01,"I've been maining Shinobi on and off since season 2, and over the last few months finally decided to declare him as my full-on main. I've put roughly 500 hours into the game total (most of which is duel) on both PC and console combined. There's been a lot of discussion on Shinobi as of late, and it seems that everyone is giving their thoughts on his current state in the meta, ways to make him more fun to fight against, etc. So I thought why not throw my two cents in? Anyways, onto the changes I propose # BASE CHANGES * *Health decreased from 110 to 90* \- This will revert Shinobi to being more of a glass cannon. It will also decrease his overall survivability due to the safe nature of his moveset. The nerf will make sense with the other changes taken into consideration. * *Stamina increased from135 to 150* \- Again, meant to allow Shinobi to play more aggressive, and will prompt a less passive playstyle. * Decreased *range of back unlock roll* \- Back roll can negate a lot of mixups, and Shinobi's is by far the best since it has the longest range. * *Reflex guard duration decreased from 800ms to 700ms* \- A very minor nerf # BASIC MOVESET CHANGES * *New chain, LLH* \- This allows Shinobi to follow up two light attacks (whether double light or not) with a 700ms heavy finisher. This heavy finisher also allows the sickle rain follow up. * *New chain, HLH* \- This change allows the player to apply increased pressure even after a landed heavy-light combo. * *Light attack opener damage decreased from 14 to 10* \- This will make the guaranteed light combo a total of 20 damage, down from 24. The non-guaranteed light attack still remains at 500ms and 14 damage, meaning that you can risk losing the free 10 damage in exchange for the original 14 damage back. This change also slightly nerfs Shinobi's parry riposte. Lowering it from 14 damage plus 15 bleed, to 10 damage plus 15 bleed. * *Heavy attack opener speed increased from 900ms to 700ms, damage decreased from 30 to 25* \- Shinobi's heavy attacks are relatively useless from neutral, this should give a little more incentive to throw them out. Also, the damage has been lowered to decrease the total damage of the heavy to guaranteed-light combo (was 40, now 35.) * *Top heavy finisher is now a 1100ms unblockable attack, damage increased from 35 to 40* \- A modified version of the sickle rain heavy finisher. Can be hard feinted, or soft feinted into a dodge. This keeps it in line with something like Shaman or Warden's unblockable finishers. Does not allow the sickle rain bleed follow-up. Large amount of recovery frames on whiff. **Can still be used after a front roll, meaning that you can now punish opponents who prematurely dodge the front roll kick,** therefore hitting them with the top heavy. * *Sprint attack stamina cost increased from 50 to 65 when successfully landed, and 79 to 90 when whiffed. Tracking slightly reduced* \- With Shinobi's stamina increased and the inclusion of new chains, he can apply a lot more pressure after a landed light attack. This change will ensure that Shinobi doesn't become a vortex/guardbreak mixup hero like warlord or raider. # ZONE ATTACK CHANGES * *Third hit of zone attack speed decreased from 600ms to 900ms, can now be feinted* * *Zone attack can now be soft feinted after second hit into a 500ms top light attack for 10 bleed damage* * *First hit of zone attack stamina cost increased from 17 to 23* * *Second hit of zone attack stamina cost increased from 17 to 23* * *Third hit of zone attack stamina cost increased from 21 to 25* * 5*00ms bleed attack costs 27 stamina, and is performed around the same time the third hit of the zone would come out, finishes chain* All of these changes attempt to make Shinobi's zone more like Peacekeeper's. The stamina changes are made to ensure it isn't spammed too much with Shinobi's increased stamina pool, and also to ensure it is sparingly used. The soft feint bleed attack is 500ms whereas Peacekeeper's is 400ms. This is to make sure it is less prediction based and can be reacted to, since Shinobi already has a wide array of other moves. # RANGED ATTACK CHANGES * *Ranged heavy opener speed increased from 600ms to 500ms, uncharged and charged ranges both reduced* \- This will give greater incentive to throw them from neutral or after a backflip, but the range nerf ensures that if parried the opponent can always follow up with decent damage, and also that the Shinobi doesn't spam ranged attacks the entire match. * *Ranged heavy finisher speed increased from 800ms to 700ms* \- A small buff to a relatively underused move. Can still be feinted. * R*anged attack after front roll kick is now considered a heavy chain finisher* \- Makes sure that Shinobi doesn't infinitely spam the backflip kick/heavy finisher mixup, while also keeping the speed of the ranged heavy after front roll kick at 700ms * *Shinobi can no longer counter guardbreak while charging a ranged attack* \- This change is mainly here to unsure that people don't hold charge for extended periods of time, or after missing something like a double dodge kick. * *Ranged guardbreak can no longer be dodged* \- Shinobi's ranged guardbreak has very little uses aside from punishing a really bad whiff, this should allow it to punish opponents who try to prematurely dodge the double dash kick, among other things. This also puts it in line with how a normal guardbreak works. * *Front roll kick can now wallsplat* \- A quality of life change. Shinobi already gets a ranged heavy when an opponent is front roll kicked into a wall, this is more of a graphical change for consistency sake # EXTENDED MOVESET CHANGES (DOUBLE DODGE KICK, BACKFLIP, ETC.) * *Side double dodge kick speed increased from 600ms to 500ms, hyperarmor now active from 300ms to 500ms (was 400ms to 600ms)* \- This is a small change made to keep both directions of double dodge kick consistent in their speed, and to more easily punish attacks with short recovery. * ***Backflip now has 200ms of guardbreak vulnerability during startup*** \- This one kinda speaks for itself, if the opponent backflips after a missed kick or heavy finisher, you should be able to actually punish them for it. However, if the Shinobi throws a ranged heavy instead of backflipping they may be able to hit you during your guardbreak attempt, to keep that in mind. This is a change Shinobi desperately needed, and it should make the rest of his kit far more enticing to use. * *Ranged heavy after missed kick remains 600ms (not 500)* \- This will ensure that you can still parry and punish Shinobi's that use the ranged heavy after a missed kick * *Deflect kick guarantees ranged heavy regardless of guard stance* \- As of right now, the kick after deflect only guarantees the ranged heavy if your attack comes from a different direction your opponent last attacked in. This is because of guard switch delay. The change of 600ms ranged heavies to 500ms ranged heavies should fix this issue, but it is still worth mentioning. * *Double dodge light attack now has unblockable property* \- This will reduce the incentive to prematurely dodge the kick, making it slightly more intimidating from neutral despite its now unsafe nature # FINAL THOUGHTS My whole idea with this rework was to remove what made Shinobi so boring and annoying to fight, while also keeping him fun and exciting to play. Shinobi is the fastest and most mobile hero in the game, while also having some of the highest damage potential of the whole cast. I feel like it would be better to go all in on the ""glass cannon"" or ""fragile speedster"" archetype over this hodgepodge of overtuned damage and extremely safe attacks. All these changes should give Shinobi far more incentive to attack and get up close with the opponent, while also retaining his mobile counter-attacker play style. So yeah, thats just about everything. I spent about 2 hours working on this thing, so I'd really appreciate any feedback or criticism. Thank you all so much!"

But if you just switch guard, seems like the GB will go through. Tested with warden, goki, and lb. See small video below URL I first feint top to GB and I eat the heavy. Then I feint to the side(just to change his guard). Then I try the same top heavy feint to GB and it goes through. Is this just a AI issue or something? "
336,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Quality of life changes to make the game more sense,0,99if4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/99if4p/quality_of_life_changes_to_make_the_game_more/,2018-08-23 09:48:49,"First, I would like to say that realistic gameplay is not fun and impossible to achieve, but there should be a bare minimum of common sense in games, that try to imitate real life technics. **Unlock roll/Roll:** The most annoying and anti fun move in the game in my opinion. Roll should only be a disengage tool when you are overwhelmed, not a spammable answer to every mixup in the game. Unlock roll should simply be removed or given gb vulnerability. Changes to the roll: \-Costs 100 stamina, but wont put you out of stamina \-Stops stamina regeneration for 5 sec **Highlander:** I am rep 25 with Highlander, and i think his offensive stance doesn't force you enough to be more offensive. You can just chill and turtle with your 400 ms side dodges, it is more like a power up stance, since his defensive stance is just weak in every aspect. You can exit and enter offensive stance whenever you like without being punished. Changes to Highlander: \-Increased entering OS from neutral recovery to 300ms. \-Increased exiting OS from neutral recovery to 300ms. \-OS now drains 3 stamina every second while not attacking or dodging, at 1 stamina you are forced out of OS. \-In OS Dodging costs 10 stamina. \-Every attack in OS costs 30% less stamina. \-In OS the first hit you take will do 15% more damage. \-DS light attacks do 20 damage(they are way too easy to parry and do way lower dmg for its stamina cost and speed) \-DS side heavies are now 700 ms(so he can land a side heavy after a GB like every other hero) \-Chained DS light attack is 500 ms(It is slower than his chained heavy at 700 ms) Offensive stance now have risks but still rewards you for being offensive and you wont feel completely useless in defensive stance. **Berserker:** I am not really experienced with the Zerk, and i kind of get that he is a maniac who doesnt care about getting hit hence the hyper armor but he just looks stupid without any armor as an assassins tanking heavies like they are nothing. I think getting increased dmg while attacking (in HA) would make more sense and encourage taking risks for the opponent. I think 20% percent increase would be fair so he can still trade heavies for lights, **Kensei:** Kensei's side dodge attack is way overtuned he just dances around you with so much iframes it's just silly. You dont even need to dodge on the correct side and can be delayed very late into the dodge making it basicly ""cancellable"". It's only punish is a parry and it counts as a heavy attack while it counters heavy attacks, light attacks, GB attempts, bashes, kicks, grabs etc... The delay of dash attacks are pretty core to kensei's kit so changing that would take away from its identity but making it a light attack again and reducing the iframes would be way more fair. \-Swift strike now counts as a light attack \-The earliest and latest activation now has the same amount of iframes The number changes are really just a wild guess they would need indepth gameplay testing. &amp;#x200B;"
337,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Three changes to Gladiator that decreases his zone effectiveness and boosts his 4v4 potential,12,9awc92,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9awc92/three_changes_to_gladiator_that_decreases_his/,2018-08-28 15:44:06,"# 1) Zone Attack Is Reversed(And give it GB vulnerability) Right now, it's a 600ms bash into a heavy. This make's it way too safe. People thought that Glad shouldn't be able to feint the move, but I don't think that this is the right move. Instead, make it into a 600ms heavy into a bash that can act as a chain starter like Glad's Sucker Punch. Oh, and it should have(at least) 100ms GB vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; # 2) Chain Lights Are Sped Up To 500ms From 600ms I can understand 600ms lights(maybe not on an assassin, but still), but it shouldn't be a thing for lights to be *slower* than the opener light. Now supposedly, the problem with giving Glad 500ms chain lights was that it would be near impossible to react to either the chain light or the toe stab - this was when guard switch recovery affected dodges - but now that that's gone, the lights might as well be sped up. &amp;#x200B; # 3) Reflex Guard Duration Is Increased To 800ms From 500ms 1000ms guard duration was nearly unnoticeable. 800ms was tighter, but still tolerable, making it the near perfect reflex guard duration(in my opinion). And then there's Glad's 500ms guard duration, which is certainly difficult in a 1v1, but absolutely impossible in an anti-gank or a 4v4. This change should help him in 4v4s. "
338,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"A minor defence of turtling for SOME heroes, with a secondary complaint about feints in general.",63,9b3upz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9b3upz/a_minor_defence_of_turtling_for_some_heroes_with/,2018-08-29 09:13:18,"I've gotten back into the game quite hard since I originally stopped playing back in S3, with a little bit of play in S4... Naturally the game has changed a lot and the meta along with it. I almost exclusively play Nobushi and have no intention of changing mains, even when Marching Fire releases. &amp;#x200B; So, playing as Nobushi, one thing you learn very quickly, is that at high levels of play, your aggressive options go from bad to absolutely unusable... So naturally, the way to play Nobushi is defensive, Hidden stances, dodges and feints to then punish the recovery time of your opponent. This leads to being called a turtle fairly frequently, but my question always is... What do you expect me to do? Throw lights and heavies for you to parry all day... Kick for you to dodge and then guard break me/parry my cobra strike? &amp;#x200B; This isn't Nobushi exclusive either, Lawbringer and Shugoki are in the same boat, every breath you take, every move you make, every guard you break, every step you take, they will counter you... So we have no excuse but to play heavily defensive because we are simply too easy to punish... We are waiting for your mistakes... Do I wish this was different? Of course I do, but this is the characters only real option. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Against some classes, it is possible to feint out attacks and use mind games to get in the occasional hit on your terms... But this leads me to my complaint about feints... Or better put... Why do some heroes get a free pass on being feinted against? I understand that vulnerability frames are a thing, but if you reacted to a heavy attack and tried to parry it as though it was a light attack, get feinted, you should be vulnerable to a guard break... &amp;#x200B; Heroes such as Centurion, Gladiator, Aramusha and Conqueror off the top of my head, all get a free pass at being guard broken because of the wind up on their heavies being so short, giving them a huge defensive advantage because they can let their parry attempts fly and get a heavy hit in if they tried to GB, or even cancel them if we then try to counter parry and get their own guard break. &amp;#x200B; Feinting and punishing a parry attempt should be a universal possibility against all heroes because as I stated: if you try to parry a heavy attack as though it was a light attack, you should be punished for doing so... because against the vast majority of heavy attacks, had you tried that and they didn't feint, you wouldn't have parried anyway. But against these quick heavy heroes, they trade hits at best and hit first at worst."
339,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Gladiator rework,4,9bo7t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9bo7t7/gladiator_rework/,2018-08-31 08:49:36,"Gladiator rework I understand that most people dont think gladiator needs a rework because of his zone attack, but if someone is good a countering it or a gladiator isn't using it, the rest of his kit is lacking compared to other characters. And i do agree there are many characters that need reworks before gladiator, i still wanted to post my suggestions. The focus of this rework is to improve the existing kit of gladiator without having to add many new moves. Help keep the identity of major stamina control, attack consistency, and large mix up potential. And to prevent gladiator from becoming to similar to other characters which is why i think he shouldn't have a bash that guarantees a light. Also this was designed with the wu lin meta in mind This took about a month of work and discussion to make. #Zone attack#  Given 100ms of guardbreak vulnerability during startup  Unfaintable  Switch zone attacks around, heavy then bash that acts as counter punch, can follow up with unblockable heavy. #Deflect#  Duration of when skewer can be inputed from deflect is increased by 200ms. ""Currently the skewer is difficult to startup on time even when you know you are about to deflect. #Reflex guard# changed to 800ms (from 500ms) #Sprint attack#  Bamboozle gets increased tracking  Bamboozle does 80 stamina drain (from 0) Maybe bug?  Acts as chain starter ""Currently when an opponent dodges the first attack, bamboozle would still miss even if it started after the dodge."" #Skewer# ""Currently skewer is very seldom used in 1v1s and is very easily parried or avoided""  800 ms (from 900)  Uninterruptible  On skewer land deals 10 damage (from 2) then deals bleed. (~33 from full bleed duration)  Can no longer dodge cancel out of skewer after it lands.  Can soft faint into dodges up-to 400 ms from start.  If parried takes 84 stamina (from 140)  Skewer cannot be back dodged or rolled away from. #Chains#  All lights normalized to 500ms (The first light was but any in a chain were 600 making them easy to parry.)  All heavies normalized to 700 ms ""This is to help make chains a bit more threatening and to cooperate with the sucker punch changes"" #Sucker punch#  Sucker punch acts as a chain starter and can be immediately followed up by skewer. (Cannot be followed up by lights however.)  Sucker punch heavy attack becomes undodgeable./Or make it unblockable instead.  Sucker punch now costs 10 stamina on hit, (from 24) deals 40 stamina damage (from 30)  Costs 25 stamina on miss (from 42) ""currently most players just dodge to get out of the heavy making it a very weak attack, players can still block and parry."" #Counter jab#  Counter jab heavy becomes unblockable, can still be parried  If the attack that was parried was a light, the counter punch heavy is guaranteed.  Deals 40 stamina damage (from 30) ""Currently there is no reason to ever use it as it guarantees less than doing a neutral light, this way is still doesn't guarantee anything unless its a light parry but will become a valuable option. Created with the help of u/DrFrankendoodle u/The_Filthy_Spaniard And Crackus34 (xbox) #Rejected ideas# Here are some ideas I've had or suggestions i got but were rejected in favor of something else.

340,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A Highlander Rework - REWORK MA CLASS!,17,9bv8x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9bv8x8/a_highlander_rework_rework_ma_class/,2018-09-01 02:48:16,"Highlander is an [interesting case at the moment](URL being extremely effective against some characters in the game (notably Conqueror) but does very badly against others such as Kensei and Berserker. From what we have seen of the Wu Lin characters, he will have very bad match-ups with them as well (particularly Tiandi and Shaolin). Additionally he has some very polarizing moves, with his much-maligned kick/toss mixup, and his offensive form dodge recovery. In general, his defensive form is very weak, and his offensive form is perhaps too strong, although this does fit well with his theme. In this rework I will try and address these issues, and attempt to encourage a playstyle based around transitioning in and out of offensive form as appropriate, instead of being toothless in defensive form and overpowered turtling when in offensive form. Of note is that these changes are somewhat balanced around some of the general changes in my [""Big List of Small Tweaks""](URL post, in particular, the normalization of parry stamina costs. The reduction of the stamina cost of being parried means that HL's strength when the opponent is OOS is less powerful overall, as HL lacks tools to force his opponent OOS, compared to much of the cast. &amp;nbsp; ##Defensive form changes. The intention of these changes is to improve defensive form's openers and most useless moves. The focus is on improving HL's ability to trade in DF, and giving a side dodge attack to counter bashes. Additionally, more ways to enter offensive stance have been added. - **New Chain:** Highland Thunder **Heavy -&gt; Light -&gt; Heavy**. This is to allow some mixup after a basic heavy or Celtic Curse. - **Basic Light Attacks**. Currently HL's defensive lights are pretty awful from neutral, with their only uses being to backstep attack and fast flow to OS, and to crushing counter baited attacks. The first change is that **opener side lights are 500ms**, to give at least a couple of faster light attacks. Secondly, **opener top light damage increased to 18 and gain enhanced property.** This is both to give HL a better heavy parry and GB punish, and to make just blocking this 600ms attack insufficient to stop HL continuing chains or fast flowing to OS. - **Chain Light Attacks.** These 700ms attacks are hardly ever worth using at the moment. I propose giving them **the enhanced property and speeding them up: sides 600ms, and top 500ms but 15 damage**. The purpose of these attacks is for trading (their HA starts instantly) and then fast-flowing into OS (chain heavies cannot fast flow), or fast-flowing even if blocked. I am open to making them all 500ms, but their damage would have to be reduced, which makes them less functional for trading. - **Basic Heavy Attacks**. These are some of the slowest heavy attacks in the game, and whilst their damage is good, their HA starts too late to be particularly useful. They now have **hyperarmour from 500ms into the attack**, for better trading. Additionally they can be **soft-feinted at 400ms into an offensive stance light attack** with light + heavy input. This removes the HA and results in the HL being in OS if the heavy input is held. **Top heavy can soft-feint into any side OS light, whereas side heavies can only soft-feint into a same side or top OS light.** OS lights from a different side guard are 500ms to allow for the side-swapping animation. For example, from a top heavy, side OS lights are 500ms, but the top is 400ms. - **Chain Heavies.** These are pretty good attacks, being 600ms, high damage and with HA, but suffer from having a very long recovery. However a long recovery is probably necessary to balance them, so rather than allowing them to fast flow into OS at the same speed as normal attacks, instead their recovery can be cancelled with a normal (500ms) transition into OS. This should give them a bit more flow whilst still having a significant GB vulnerable recovery. - **Celtic Curse.** This is a good move in general, but does suffer from all the options being reactable. Now it can also be **soft-feinted into an offensive form light attack from any guard at 400ms**. Like basic top heavy soft-feint, the side OS lights are 500ms, and the top is 400ms. Can also now be **hard feinted at the usual timing**. Forward tracking slightly improved to catch rolls. - **Celtic Curse Alternate**. This is a new move with the same animation as the celtic curse side heavy soft-feint. It is a **700ms side dodge + heavy attack, after 100ms of dodge, doing 25 damage for 12 stamina.** This move is 700ms to accommodate some start-up animation, and has **200ms of i-frames after which it has HA.** The intention is to give HL in DF a powerful defensive tool in the form of a side dodge attack, which can be used to counter bashes and unblockables. - **Zone attack.** HL's zone attack is great for clearing minions but otherwise pretty useless. To give it more utility it gains the **undodgeable property on its first two hits**, and becomes **unblockable on the last hit**. It also gains **hyperarmour after 500ms**. Timing on the attack is now **800ms -&gt; 600ms -&gt; 900ms.** The third hit can be hard feinted, or after hitting can fast flow into OS. The zone attack can also be cancelled after the first or second hit into a chain top heavy by pressing heavy, into a chain top light by pressing light, or fast flow into OS with holding heavy. The stamina use is changed to 30 + 10 + 20. - **Running attack**. Gains **hyperarmour after 500ms**. Additionally it can be cancelled into any chain heavy after the first hit by pressing heavy, a chain light by pressing light, or fast flow into OS with holding heavy. After the second hit, the HL can continue into chain heavies or fast flow into OS. The second hit can be hard feinted as usual. - **Better Fast flow into OS from parries and guard breaks**. After landing a GB, holding heavy will fast flow into OS in 200ms. Additionally the window after a parry that it is possible to fast flow into OS is extended slightly. This will enable landing an OS heavy from a light parry without holding down the parry input heavy. From a GB or heavy parry, the only guaranteed offensive form attack would be an OS light, but it would allow maintaining pressure in OS, without being immediately counter-attacked during the fast flow into OS after a DF light attack. &amp;nbsp; ## Offensive Stance changes. The aims of these changes are to de-emphasise the kick/toss mixup, and dodge turtling, whilst reducing HL's vulnerability to dodge attacks, improve the utility of OS light attacks, and make it easier to cancel OS. Offensive Stance still has HL's best moves, and opponents should aim to force him back into DF to avoid harm. - **Dodges**. The 400ms side dodge recovery in OS is central to HL's power and is his only defensive measure in OS. However, constantly dodging and excessive turtling in OS is a problematic playstyle that should not be encouraged. To this end, **dodges in OS now cost 12 stamina and side dodges also freeze stamina regeneration for 1.5 seconds**. This should prevent spamming OS dodges without completely hamstringing offensive stance. The stamina freeze is removed on entering Defensive Form. The exact numbers for stamina drain and freeze could definitely be tweaked, but the Additionally, the bug where guard switching during a dodge causes you to exit offensive stance should be fixed. - **Formorian Kick and Caber Toss**. HL's kick/toss mixup is often complained about, and is a cause of much misery. Whilst it does afford HL excellent OOS pressure where it is a true 50/50, it is a problematic move because it is very powerful against (the weaker) half of the cast, and completely useless against the other half, being completely negated by all side dodge attacks. Most characters can beat it with a backstep light attack (except LB and Warlord) but doing so is considerably more difficult than using a dodge attack. - To reduce HL's vulnerability to dodge attacks, both **Formorian Kick and Caber Toss can now be hard feinted to Defensive Form: kick after 300ms and caber after 200ms**. (To clarify, hard feinting cannot be done after a soft-feint). They are also GB vulnerable for 100ms, to prevent the kick being used as easily to protect from GBs in OS. - The window for a **Kick to Caber Grab soft-feint is moved to 300ms**, instead of 400ms. This would make the mix-up *slightly* more reactable (giving a 400ms window on the kick to react after the soft-feint window, which would require a 233ms reaction time.) Most players will still have to make a read to dodge correctly, but this timing will feel slightly more fair regardless. - To reduce the frustration of the ""50/50"" landing an **uncharged Caber Toss (Caber Grab) now puts the opponent into a guard-broken state**, similar to landing a skewer with Gladiator (ie. Cannot be CGBd). The animation would progress to the grab, and then transition into the GB state, and has slightly reduced forward tracking. This reduces the punishment for guessing incorrectly and dodging early to 18 damage unless you are near a wall or OOS (since HL lacks tools to force an opponent OOS, having good OOS pressure is not so problematic). After landing a Caber Grab, the HL can choose between higher damage from his DF top light, or lower damage whilst maintaining pressure in OS with an OS light attack. **The input delay for a neutral Caber Toss is reduced to 300ms from 400ms.** - In addition, **Caber Toss can now be charged by holding GB**. This version of Caber Toss **throws the opponent down as it currently does, but takes 1100ms, and has manual tracking,** where the HL has to move in the direction of his opponent. This manual tracking would have good forward range if that direction is chosen, and would catch rolls. The input would be back + GB, then hold GB and move in the desired direction. This essentially creates the opposite mixup to the kick/toss where dodging early has the greater punishment, and allows the HL to punish predictable players who always dodge early. Using the charged Caber Toss from the kick soft-feint will allow opponents who side dodged on the kick timing to recover and also dodge the grab. An appropriately targeted charged Caber Toss would however, catch rolls. - **Light Attacks.** OS light attacks are very fast, but short ranged and use an enormous amount of stamina compared to their damage. To give them more emphasis, their **stamina cost is reduced from 27 to 12**. Additionally the top OS light is sped up to 400ms and now stuns the opponent (no stamina damage though). - **Balor's Might.** One of the biggest complaints about HL currently is that it only takes 3 mistakes to kill most of the cast. Whilst the changes here should address that somewhat, 40 damage is still rather high. On the other hand, high damage is central to the fantasy of a playing a Scotsman with giant sword, so his attacks should still do a lot of damage. As a compromise, **Balor's Might now does 38 damage**, so HL can no longer kill a 120hp hero in 3 hits, but still feels like he hits hard. The soft-feint to OS light is parriable on the same timing as the normal Balor's might, so to make it useful, **top BM can now be soft-feinted to any guard OS light, and side BM can be soft-feinted to a top or same side OS light.** The speed of the OS lights are the same as for the DF soft-feint. Recovery of BM can still be cancelled with an OS dodge, but the GB vulnerability of the left side BM is normalized to 400ms, the same as top and right side BM. - **Offensive Stance cancelling.** To encourage a playstyle based around switching into and out of offensive stance, the **stamina cost of cancelling OS is halved to 6 stamina**. This does not apply to cancelling the start-up of OS, which is used to option select parry. The cost of cancelling during the start-up of OS is 18 stamina, to balance out the power of this option select. Additionally, the **HL's guard can be switched during the 200ms OS cancel**, making crushing counter slightly easier to use on baited attacks. &amp;nbsp; **Feats.** Fix the sound cue not playing at the impact location of Spear Storm. &amp;nbsp; ## TL/DR: - Defensive form improved, changes to Offensive Stance to reduce turtling and de-emphasise kick/toss mixup - DF side lights 500ms, top light 18 damage, enhanced - Chain lights enhanced, 600ms side, top 500ms, 15 damage. - Hyperarmour improved on DF heavies, added to zone and running attack - DF basic heavies and celtic curse soft-feint to OS lights - Side dodge heavy attack, 25 damage, 700ms, HA - Zone attack undodgeable first 2 hits, last hit unblockable, 60 stamina total - Zone and running attack cancel into chain heavies, lights, OS - GB fast flow into OS, parry fast flow easier. - OS dodges cost 12 stamina and side dodges freeze stamina regen for 1.5s - Kick: hard feint to DF at 300ms, soft-feint is at 300ms - Caber Toss: hard feint at 200ms, uncharged gives GB, charged is 1000ms, throws down but has manual tracking. - OS lights all 400ms costs 12 stamina, top stuns - Balor's Might does 38 damage, OS light soft-feint from other guards - Cancelling OS costs 6 stamina, allows guard-switch during cancel &amp;nbsp; **My other reworks:** - [A Massive List of Small Balance Tweaks](URL - [Shugoki - Hugs for everyone!](URL - [Raider - REEEWORRRRK!!!](URL - [Nobushi - Pokey Pokey Bleed-Rework Club](URL - [Lawbringer - Bringing Justice](URL (needs a second pass, coming soon) - [Faction War Update](URL (I know it's not a focus of this sub, but thought I'd add it for completeness.)

From what I can tell, his basic gameplay revolves around charging and feinting heavies into other options. Unlike some other characters, Raider and Cent specifically, his heavies don't have soft feint options. You can soft feint an uncharged heavy to demon's embrace (and maybe a charged? I haven't gotten it to work) but DE is a very unreliable move that can, in some cases, just be side walked out of. So let's fix it! Bigger Shug would be able to soft feint his heavies into GB like Cent. This would offset his vulnerability to gb while charging and, since he loses his armor on a CGB, wouldn't be too powerful. Bigger Shug also has a light, light chain; keeping him in line with the new design philosphies. Bigger Shug now has a new move, Yokai Crush. While charging a heavy, pressing light attack will cause the big boy to belly bump (on a top heavy) or hip check (on a side heavy) his opponent. This does no damage, is a 500ms Unblockable and has no followup but drains the same amount of stamina from the opponent as a headbutt and restores his HA if it lands. These should change Goki into a big ol' stamina bully without changing his core gameplay focus. Getting your opponent out of stam to force a bad parry will be your goal."

(works at all levels of play)",164,9exjfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/9exjfh/a_comprehensive_guide_to_beating_shugoki_the/,2018-09-11 23:27:10," Someone asked how to deal with Shugoki on either this sub or main, i posted a very long comment there and decided i might as well copy/paste it and post it as a guide after some minor edits. Never lose to a Shugoki again with this one simple step: **Get up close** Shugoki is almost defenseless when you facehug him. Shugoki's HA goes down when someone gb's him (even when he cgb's) so Shugo players try to interrupt gb's with lights when possible gb's are basically unreactable though in that scenario thanks to the 100ms of gb vulnerability on Shugoki lights. *Shugoki players don't react to the gb's themselves; they react to your predictable movement when you are going into a gb* Facehugging a Shugoki makes your gb's basically unreactable so Shugoki will have 2 options: 1. Losing HA. 2. Throwing lights on prediction. In scenario 1 you have made Shugoki useless, he now has an hp pool that's effectively Kensei level (so barely above an assassin) and he has THE WORST kit in the game both offensively and defensively. In scenario 2 he is throwing out random lights, and those lights are 600ms, which makes them easy to parry if you bait them out, also since he has static guard he cannot switch guard and throw the attack, he will have a delay after guard switch before he can attack. If you parry his light he eats a light parry punish and loses HA. If Parrying 600ms lights is not your strong suit you can block the light and still somewhat reliabky remove his HA; Shugoki he can only chain a heavy, and they usually don't bc it's pretty bad; if he doesn't immediately throw the followup heavy you can get a guaranteed gb attempt (he can cgb but not interrupt), if he does throw the chained heavy you can get a gb attempt after blocking that. Both of these options are a bit risky, but if you can't parry 600ms lights this is a viable alternative; you will get the gb's to land the first couple of times and then after that he will at some point start throwing the followup heavies, though often feinted into gb (to create distance). Another reason to face hug Shugoki is his variable timing heavy; Shugoki's heavies are slow, but his variable timing means he can release a heavy in just 500ms (faster than his light) so Shugoki's can throw lots of delayed feints and as soon as you go for a move they can release the heavy, which will then land in 500ms. If you are facehugging them they cannot do this safely because they have gb vulnerability for the entire charging part of the heavy. Shugoki is without a doubt worse than Aramusha, his only benefit is that he requires a specific strategy to defeat, and that most people do not properly understand, or just don't bother remembering, the Shugoki matchup; most people stay at a distance instead of facehugging him. Which is probably the worst thing you can do because it means that 1: you cannot parry his lights, because they cannot reach you, and 2: you make yourself predictable, giving him better odds of predicting, your gb attempts and making it less risky to just wait for a gb attempt too. The easiest, and most effective way to deal with Shugoki is to get right up in his face and then turtle; throw some feints, throw some gb's and then attack when HA is down or punish those lights that he's forced to throw if he doesn't want his HA gone.

An exception was made due to the nature of the post and the punishes/tech shown. Certain situations shown were tested and confirmed with OP by one of the mods. Please note that not everything shown here has been tested on live players, so there is the potential that certain punishes for certain heroes in certain situations may not function as shown when performed on live opponents. OP has tested to the best of his ability. Here i'll leave registered everything i could gather about Revenge, it's activation and their ""interactions"" with other stuff. Keep in mind that there are probably still some other stuff to discover and register, but i'll be happy to update this list at any time. GLOSSARY ReAct = Revenge Activation RevAP = Revenge Auto-Parry HA = Hyper Armor (allows you to not be interrupted by a normal Attack during the time its active) SA = Super Armor (allows you to not be interrupted by both a normal or Melee-like Attack, also doesnt have a cap to how much attacks u can take before automatically losing the armor, during the time its active) HB = Headbutt (can be from either Shugoki or Warlord) ZA = Zone Attack GENERAL  When doing any offensive action in Revenge mode, you gain SA and GB immunity (when feinting as well tho). Except when performing a GB, in this case u will only have HA. In both cases it kicks off instantly after ur move or attack starts. Which also basically means that u can react to GBs, and bashes, with attacks of ur own. Apparently only attacks not that slow (&lt;900ms) will land after the GB whiff from ur opponent (when reacting to the GB), but after super-armoring a bash things get inconsistent, since it depends on the bash hit recovery. URL  In Revenge every GB u do has priority over attacks, ignoring their normal vulnerability windows, meaning it'll interrupt any type of move at any point in their animation. At least will do so 100ms before it hits you if it's a bash. URL  When doing any ""charging"" or ""holding"" movement in revenge, u have SA and are immune to GB (if opponent tries to GB it simply whiffs in the air), but that doesn't work with Stances that only requires you to hold the Guard Stick down. GB immunity and SA starts instantly after the charging input is registered and the move is initiated. [ Videos on each char that has it ]  Revenge activation has GB immunity during the time in which you have ""auto-parry"" enabled: URL Which lasts for 800ms and has 100ms of startup, also ure vulnerable when ure within that tiny window (GBs will connect, but u can counter them without wasting ur revenge, and normal attacks will hit u and not interrupt the ReAct itself, even tho u wont enter in Auto-Parry stance, thus activating revenge in the worst possible situation).  This ""auto-parry stance"" can be canceled only after 100ms into it (after the initial 100ms of startup, meaning its 200ms from ReAct to X move being performed), with any type of action (GB, dodge, unlock, any attack, parry etc.), making so that in some situations, in addition to other times where you understand the situation and see that the Revenge should be kept, it can actually be better to not activate it at all in situations where the recovery is basically non-existent already (like after LBs throws). [ Take all other videos as proof ]  Revenge Activation can act, basically, like a ""recovery canceler"". This includes every type of recovery, like: 1. After an attack (every type of attack, so includes bashes as well) hits/gets blocked/whiffs; URL | URL 2. After initiating a dodge (the dodge animation itself is completely canceled in this case, at any point after input); URL 3.After parrying. Basically the real stagger shows to be 1200ms for Heavy parry and 1500ms for Light parry, which means that minus 200ms of startup and so u end up with 1000ms for Heavy parry and 1300ms for Light parry. The way this works is that, while practically saying, Heavy and Light parry sttagers are effectively 600ms and 900ms respectively, this number is counted just after we (the one who parried) isnt doing the parry animation anymore, but if u use ReAct to cut that animation, which lasts for a total of 600ms after the instant at which the parry happened, u end up seeing the real parries stagger; URL 4. After being parried; URL 5. After throwing an opponent; URL 6. After getting thrown by an opponent; URL 7. After blocking an attack... Guarantees GB against attacks that have 600ms or more of block recovery, but against 600ms of recovery the ReAct must be nearly instant, if not actually instant, which makes it rather inconsistent and unpractical in an actual fight (examples of attacks with 600ms of block recovery: Nobus Side Heavies, Conqs Heavies, PKs Heavies). Attacks with less block recovery than that are kinda rare, some examples would be Valks neutral Heavies, Kensei neutral Top Heavy, Glads Heavies, Cents Heavy openers and WLs neutral Heavies; URL 8. After getting hit by an attack (any type). When doing this against non-melee attacks it can work the same way as when blocking them and so u can cut the hit recovery and get guaranteed GBs (hit and block recoveries are the same); 9. After having your Guard Break be countered (doesnt really have any use outside of preventing stupid ledge deaths); URL 10. After initiating a GB (the GB animation itself is completely canceled in this scenario); URL 11. After being guard broken. This instance creates a nice mindgame where ure kinda forced, or more like induced, to either activate revenge or not based on what ur opponent will do, cause if he continues with his attack u want to activate it, but if he faints his attack u will have wasted your RevAP and so, on the other hand if he faints and u dont activate revenge he will have missed a punish and u would have remained at the advantage with revenge being ready to be activated (which is very threatening, especially considering that it does not decay overtime if ure in combat). URL 12. When being CCd with attacks like DE, Long Arm,Caber Toss and so on, Revenge will only be able to be activated after you've already hit the ground, but it still cuts all the on-ground and wake-up animations. URL  After any faint, while ure in Revenge, u gain some type of weird superior-block, that looks more like a deflect on Zerk, that kick offs instantly after the faint has ended and apparently lasts for only 100ms, cant say for sure tho, it is indeed inconsistent, but anyway it exists and also confirms GB when u block an attack with it. Tho im a bit confused about it, cause it isnt exactly Superior Block since ur enemys attack simply continues through (if its a Heavy, since Lights bounce off as usual), but u arent affected by any sort of blocking stagger, so idk what it is, just know that it exists and what it can do for u. URL | URL  No ""offensive move"", specifically, can be canceled mid animation (except for GBs), only their recoveries.  Now heres some other small things to take into consideration: Shugo is anti-revenge, or anti-SA actually, which means that his hug and his HB completely ignore ur SA, which u gained from Revenge mode. It simply interrupts u no matter what ure doing, but of course u can dodge it or GB Shugo before he hugs u, in the HB case, it ignores ur GB too URL ; Shinobis Ranged Heavy after Kick cant be auto-parried using revenge, like WLs poke after HB can, which means itll be completely uninterruptible after the Kick has landed URL ; Shinobis Ranged GB and Cents Quick Throw are special GBs, because of that (or its a bug, dont know) they have immunity against GB immunity, which means that when ure in revenge they still interrupt u like ifp u hadnt revenge at all URL Side Notes: Every punish using RevAP has to be buffered and to perform the majority of them correctly, u cant change guards. In the clips where i already have Revenge and still activate to cut off Recoveries from moves that wouldnt knockback the opponent if u hadnt Revenge already, u can discount the already existing Revenge and consider the opponent as being OOS. Other times i simply used it that way cause it was a lot easier to test things that way. Anyway, u should analyze case by case, cause obviously already having Revenge and activating it wont happen in a real game, but things like punishes from RevAP wont change if i already had Revenge or not and so on.

Valks shield tackle can in addition to escaping the most popular mix ups can also escape all of shaman's mix ups. Shaman's unblockable heavy mix up is now poor for duels. With the removal of static guard heros not being able to dodge during hit stun or guard switch and the normalizing of all back dodges now everyone can get hit by her and then back dash to avoid the unblockable heavy and the guard break. Static guard heros still can't attack or gb immediately after switching guards. And finally wardens new top unblockable finisher has very very few frames of vulnerability. You can't gb him out of it on reaction. Timing is super tight even on prediction. Will upload clips of any of this if requested. Currently on mobile.

React to every offense with a dodged heavy, and if they feint simply feint too to avoid a punish.

353,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,The Argument for Competitive 1v1s,132,8re5z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8re5z0/the_argument_for_competitive_1v1s/,2018-06-16 06:37:00,"Over the last year, there has been a huge change the preferred game mode of the top of the competitive community. First starting with 1v1s for a few months at the games launch, eventually moving into 2v2s and finally into 4v4 dominion, which is now the main mode played competitively. &amp;nbsp; 4v4 tournaments in the last few months have been having a lot of success with player participation, now equaling the sign ups of 2v2 tournaments that are much more accessible. 1v1 tournaments have died down, now being mainly prize-less weekly series with little participation on PC. While this is great for the competitive scene, there is still a significant amount of players interested in the competitive part of the game that [are interested in 1v1s.](URL (the survey was done about a month ago on this subreddit) &amp;nbsp; 1v1s are more accessible and are a great stepping stone to getting into the team modes especially as they provide the basic fundamentals will be the bedrock for your ability to play 4v4. A common suggestion among the comp community to new players is to head into 1v1 for a while before even touching 4v4, as its very hard to get good fundamentals just from playing purely 4v4. &amp;nbsp; There are few very top players left defending 1v1s, but Id like to present my view on why 1v1s shouldnt be left behind or abandoned by the game, and why it wont necessarily hurt team modes to also consider 1v1s. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; First, Id like to address the argument that 1v1s have no depth or do not require skill. This is an argument commonly made by team mode players, generally with the main point being that defense is too easy, and the person with the most patience wins. I think that the most obvious moment where this was the case was extremely early in the game with warlords fullblock. Once warlords fullblock was nerfed to no longer being usable on reaction, his playstyle became one of mixing up between crashing charge, headbutt, and 500ms lights. &amp;nbsp; This created a lot of mindgame based gameplay, where you would constantly be trying to outread your opponent or make a good reaction to what he was throwing at you, and it became impossible to simply react to all the possibilities, especially with time snap gone. This, to me, is a good example of why its possible for this game to succeed at 1v1s without losing its identity as a slower, reaction based game. &amp;nbsp; It was all about pressure. Having multiple tools that apply such pressure that it inhibits your reactions, leading you to make mistakes. Utilizing that pressure well, without being predictable. These are concepts that apply to many other fighting games, but in FHs 1v1, they were central. Your ability to react to headbutt did not compare to your ability to read your opponent or mix up better than them, and warlord mirrors turned into a dance of predictions and reactions. &amp;nbsp; Eventually, a combination of warlord nerfs, players getting better and the introduction of lag compensation meant that warlord fell out of the top of 1v1s. Some similar concepts were introduced later, but generally have at least one glaring issue preventing them from being comparable. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I would not want the game to be filled with unreactable openers as that would significantly impact team modes. I do support giving at least every character a mixup that is enough pressure to open up its opponent, and by now I think we have plenty of evidence that they would not necessarily impact teamfights significantly. &amp;nbsp; On the other hand, I believe that as long as it requires some effort to set up, its also completely fine for attack-based mixups to be unreactable. It cannot be spammed, because it requires set up. If every character had offense that functioned, you could not just repeatedly do the same unreactable thing, as your opponent would eventually take the offensive during your setup for this unreactable mixup. &amp;nbsp; A common complaint is that 400ms lights are just unreactables, but in fact they utilize this same concept. Single-direction 400ms lights are predictable, and far easier to react to in a lot of cases. See: Aramusha What enables omnidirectional 400s to work is the fact that there are multiple directions to consider, which is a kind of pressure by itself. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Following is a list of the recently reworked moves that are meant to be offensively viable, and their biggest issues. &amp;nbsp; Zerkers omnidirectional 400ms lights being enabled by a top unblockable.  If the spam guardswitch bug didnt exist for static guard heroes, 400ms omnidirectionals would be unreactable even by the fastest of PC players (This was thoroughly tested recently, analyzing footage of reactions and seeing what amount were predictions or abused the bug) &amp;nbsp; Orochis omnidirectional 400 lights after SR block  Once storm rushs delay bug is fixed, these will be comparable to Zerkers lights. &amp;nbsp; Conquerors variable shield bash timings.  These provide enough pressure alone to create viable offense but are shut down by dodge-&gt;roll. Personally, not a fan of how it functions, but it is still a valid example of the concept. &amp;nbsp; Kenseis Heavy-&gt;Pommel mixup.  Pommel itself is unreactable as a 400ms melee. Its beaten by dodge-&gt;roll &amp;nbsp; Peacekeepers heavy-&gt;top stab.  This is unreactable assuming the feint is delayed with extremely precise inputs, and so would be fixed by a very small change to feint timings to match the delayed feints consistently. &amp;nbsp; Shamans heavy-&gt;top stab.  This is unreactable assuming the feint is delayed with extremely precise inputs, and so would be fixed by a very small change to feint timings to match the delayed feints consistently. &amp;nbsp; Highlanders kick/caber mixup.  This is beaten by dodge roll and walking backwards / back attacks on some characters &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; You may be starting to see a pattern here. Every single reworked character so far has had their offense crippled by a few specific global bugs, meaning that even though their offense is technically sound, it becomes useless against anyone knowledgeable. This is in part why theres such a large discrepancy between gameplay in the top 2.5% and the top 0.01%, as access to this knowledge completely changes how 1s is played. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Overall, these are the fixes that I think are necessary to make 1v1s work. These changes are not balance changes, as they assume that Ubisoft will continue on the path of making offense more viable, as they have been with previous reworks. &amp;nbsp;  Add 200ms GB vulnerability to the startup of dodge rolls. This will allow mixups that rely on GBs to function correctly, and mixups between different melees and melee timings to work. This small change would not affect the main use of rolls in team modes, which is to create space safely. It would only be a nerf to using it as a reaction to feints. &amp;nbsp;  Fix the guardswitch spam bug (Guardswitches on static guard characters making it so that the next guardswitch has no delay) This would create proper, unreactable and balanceable lights at all levels that arent only reactable for the tiny percentage of players aware of or using the bug. &amp;nbsp;  Delay feints by 66ms You can already see the result of this with snake and freezes recent findings on delayed feints. A tiny adjustment to the timing means that several attack based mixups are more usable, and heavies in general are safer to use since the feint happens later, leaving you less time to recognize its not being feinted. &amp;nbsp;  Fix orochi and highlander specific bugs This is an obvious one, but its part of the process to making 1s significantly more varied. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Another common argument is that its impossible to balance both 1v1s and 4v4s. I think this argument is misleading and based upon the fact that all moves must be usable in every mode, which really isnt the case as weve seen with lawbringers CC for example. &amp;nbsp; I think the solution is to make a clear distinction between 1v1 and team mode moves, such as lawbringers long arm, with the baseline of having a decent 1v1 kit. A decent 1v1 kit really doesnt require much besides at least a single point of good pressure as mentioned above, and once thats achieved on a character all of the rest of the variety and depth can be added onto its kit while keeping 4v4 in mind rather easily. Not every character will have an interesting 1v1 kit, but at least every character should be able to press buttons in 1s, and I think that's a reasonable goal. I dont think these pressure tools would necessarily affect 4v4, as we now have multiple examples of good 1v1 tools not being overwhelming to 4s teamfights. &amp;nbsp; One of the biggest issues with this is feats that affect a characters base kit. For example, conquerors shield basher feat is incredibly bad for the game as it means that shield bash must be balanced around the character both having and not having this feat. Its impossible to balance a move while it has both 23 and 13 damage variants in different modes. &amp;nbsp; I would suggest keeping feats separate from the characters kits, perhaps more as extensions of them. For example, a lot of orochis feats feel like theyre extra buttons within his moveset, rather than improving upon already existing moves. That is a lot more interesting to me than suddenly gaining more damage for doing things I was already doing. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Id also like to provide my view on why 1s shouldnt be compared to 4s in matters of depth, as I dont think they are comparable at all. &amp;nbsp; The depth in 4v4s comes from team play, map control, good ganking synergy and timing, and good feat usage. These are 100% very skillful elements, and no one can deny that. I do think that there are a few elements of the game that, while they do not disappear, definitely take a back seat during dominion gameplay. &amp;nbsp; I think that 4v4s have a very different skill set, and are quite a bit less focused around the core combat system in the game. &amp;nbsp; Parries are no longer core to the gameplay, as a large part of the attacks coming at you will be target switched and unparriable. Due to this, feints are not as important and the potential mindgames involved in them are also less important. Defense is significantly harder versus multiple targets, meaning that offense has less thought put into it. Theres a bigger focus on timing attacks to provide the least amount of revenge possible, and less focus on pressuring your opponents into making mistakes. The game has a different focus, one that is not necessarily worse, and many would argue is better. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Personally, I still enjoy these elements of the game more, and I dont believe every player playing this game can enjoy 4v4, nor do I believe that all competitive play should be focused around a mode that not everyone will enjoy. Theres just something more enjoyable to me about being in a one on one fight against another player, with the only things that matter being your own skills versus theirs, your own move set versus their characters. I will not make the argument that its objectively more interesting, but I will make the argument that its a completely different appeal to what 4v4 provides. &amp;nbsp; Hopefully this provides some insight into why I still believe that 1s can be saved after all this time, as Im often debating it on the CFH discord and its been an ongoing discussion for a very long time.

354,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"Hypothetically speaking, what would happen if hard to land unblockables/CC became safe to use, but remained hard to land?",7,8t96jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8t96jv/hypothetically_speaking_what_would_happen_if_hard/,2018-06-23 20:51:34,"*This is focusing on duels. There tends to be a correlation in the game, unblockables or CC that are not good enough to ever land, also end up being quite punishable. Cent's charged unblockable(free parry) and Valkyrie's sweep(free dodge into GB) being two examples out of many. Now, this is just logical progression. Let's say something is slow and clunky, if you have plenty of time to react(excluding rolls), nothing inherently forces you to just avoid it, you can easily decide to use your time for the sake of punishing. However, what if said unblockables were just easy to avoid, but not as easy to punish? Hard feints would inherently allow feint into gb(unless you invent a feint into block-only and cgb-only mechanic), making them harder to avoid. But, a combination of two other mechanics would make it just as easily avoidable, but not as easily punishable: 1. Super-armor. Super-armor is what Shugoki's stance has, it is like hyper-armor, but functions against other things such as CC. 2. No recovery frames. Recovery frames is the period of vulnerability that remains after using an attack. Assume long arm had these two mechanics. It would remain just as slow and easily avoidable as before, but it could tank through attacks and allow Lawbringer back into neutral even faster. Imagine this applied to every hard to land unblockable. Now my exact question here, is what effect on the meta and status of the game would this have? On one hand, they are just as avoidable as before, and will continue to be avoided. On the other hand, their safeness could be incorporated into more situations, or put into more mixups, giving them an actual use. I am personally not sure which one would be the right answer. "
355,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,An Orochi Tweak That Doesn't Make Him OP,2,8vm831,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8vm831/an_orochi_tweak_that_doesnt_make_him_op/,2018-07-03 07:01:07,"Present agility: Orochi can dodge out of the recovery of all of his chain finishers. Proposed agility: Orochi can dodge out of the recovery of all lights and heavies(starters, chain attacks, finishers). *Orochi is agile, and can dodge out of his chain finisher's recovery, which is great, but not enough. If an Orochi cannot reach the finisher and is in a gank, he'll suffer due to his long recovery from his attacks. This will mainly help him in ganks, but also give him some more mix-up potential.* Present Storm Rush: Orochi has to dodge back and immediately press the heavy input to go into storm rush, the input which is difficult and clunky. He cannot dodge while in sitting position or while running to his opponent to perform Storm Rush. Proposed Storm Rush: Orochi can delay his Storm Rush input like he could before his rework, for more flexibility. He can also dodge to the sides and forwards while sitting. He can also dodge forward or to the sides while running towards his opponent until the last 200ms of the run before the Storm Rush attack(meaning 200ms before the red indicator shows). *Storm Rush is better with its omni directional fast attacks(with the left input being somewhat useless for many reasons other than ""more choices"") but it is rather inflexible and clunky, which is weird considering this is meant to be for an assassin. The increased input window is to lessen the amount of attempted failures when trying to perform Storm Rush. The increased ability to dodge either while sitting or running is to give both more mix-up potential, and to also help in ganks(and also to give a counter to a well placed light that can stop Storm Rush entirely).* Present Riptide Strike: A backwards dodge move that is meant to counter attack an attacking opponent. Usually guardbroken out of even when in mid-animation, and does not chain either on whiff or block. Proposed Riptide Strike: The move cannot be guardbroken after 100ms into the attack(I am pretty sure complete guardbreak vulnerability would be broken). Orochi can chain from a whiffed or blocked Riptide Strike. *The reasoning behind this buff is that the move is rather distinguishable from any other move that the Orochi can do, and is much more easily parried than most moves(it is still a 600ms light dodge attack). The small guardbreak vulnerability is meant to fix the problem of being guardbroken mid-animation, but still give it a small weakness to GB, and the ability to chain from block or whiff is solely meant for increased mix-up potential.* All of this is to make the Orochi a lot more flexible and agile, but not in ways that makes him broken beyond repair. No new moves, no nerfs, just QoL changes."

It is also very good whiff punishing tool if you try to stay out of enemy attack range. &gt; &gt;By giving gladiator a dash soft feint from heavy finishers, he gets more opportunities to mix his attacks up with sucker punch or his dash and dodge attacks. **Sucker Punch and Cheap Shot heavy follow up** * Now has a longer stagger duration to make the heavy follow up safe to throw if sucker punch connects without the risk of getting parried and safely going to skewer mix-ups. Sucker Punch is a really weak and high risk move to use since the bash has considerably long recovery frames on whiff and prone to guard break since the heavy follow up can also be guard broken. &gt;With the buff on the heavy finisher earlier turning the heavy finisher into a guard break immune attack. The move turns into a small mind game of letting the heavy fly, feinting the heavy follow-up or doing nothing making it similar to Nobushis light follow up on kick situation. **Counter Jab** * **Stamina damage reduced**. 30 stamina damage to 15 stamina damage * Can now **chain into guaranteed toe stab** * Can now **wall splat** into guaranteed **heavy finisher or OOS toe stab** &gt;Its never used because doing a heavy parry into zone attack does the same stamina damage to the enemy with guaranteed 20 damage &gt; &gt;With the new changes, the jab counter has reduced stamina damage so it cannot send enemies OOS from neutral with one heavy parry. &gt; &gt;The jab counter also gives access to a low damage punish attack with considerate amount of stamina drain to the enemy. &gt; &gt;The new change also makes the move a short range wall splat parry punish tool that depends on the enemys position. If the enemys back is against a wall it can guarantee more damage instead of a low damage toe stab. **Skewer** * Range increased and now has better forward tracking. &gt;Skewer right now is a really bad tool and is really inconsistent on catching back dodging enemy heroes, with these changes it allows skewer to punish back dodgers. **Skewer Bash** * Stamina damage increased from 15 to **60 stamina damage** &gt;Increasing stamina damage to the skewer bash makes the move useful and can send your enemy to out of stamina if their back is placed onto a wall giving more opportunities to deal pressure and more opportunities to deal more damage. **Bee Sting and Crowd Pleaser (side dodge and forward dash attacks)** * Is now **safe on block** &gt;Gladiator's dash attacks are unsafe on block guaranteeing a guard break if blocked successfully and that needs to be removed since its a light attack which also includes the risk of eating a heavy if it gets parried. **Reflex Guard** * Buffed from 500ms to **700ms** &gt;Self explanatory, Gladiators reflex guard decays too fast and needs a lot of practice even in high level to be able to defend properly. With these changes it will make Gladiator's zone attack a lot weaker and more punishable if successfully side dodged, it also removes Gladiator the ability to be a stamina bully with zone attacks by removing stamina drain on the shield bash of the zone. These changes also improves Gladiator's light and heavy chains and allows him to mix up his attack chains with finisher heavy dash cancels and faster light chains instead of staying in neutral and spamming zone attack with no to minimal risk. This also makes gladiator a better fighter in wall corner situations with his new jab counter changes and skewer bash that can send enemies to OOS if positioned correctly. ***tl;dr zone attack is nerfed and whole kit is improved.*** it's also my first time writing up a rebalance/rEwOrK so it's open for opinions and changes."

There's a ~50ms window in the GB startup where you are vulnerable to GBs. I've been told it's still possible to CGB but I have never been able to do it. This seems more like a bug than any sort of mechanic and it basically gives the opponent a GB for doing absolutely nothing. Have the devs ever acknowledged this?

Frankly, I think he still need a little bit of tweak on his riptide strike and stormrush so I would suggest a minor buff below for the move: Riptide Strike ------------------ Riptide Strike is suppose to be Orochi counter move but it is still lacking so hopefully some minor buff below should improve it: 1. Allow to chain to 2nd attack after whiff or blocked 2. Reduce GB vulnerability during mid animation Storm Rush --------------- This is meant to be Orochi opener move but it is easily reactable by blocking the right while react to the left and top. Also, easily counter by heroes with long range weapon that just light attack when you rush into them. Also, as a heavy attack it is so weird that the damage is less than 20. 1. Increase damage from 17 to 20 2. Allow Orochi to dodge cancel anything time during storm rush animation just before attack to deflect those who try to light attack you out of storm rush. Of course above tweak is just a suggestion, I am open to listen to everyone feedback on Orochi rework and where he stand right now, especially against turtle playstyle since Orochi doesnt really strong opener. Keep the discussion civil guys! "
360,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,(cross post) Suggestion for a possible Lawbringer rework,8,8lfby1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8lfby1/cross_post_suggestion_for_a_possible_lawbringer/,2018-05-23 11:10:03," Many times has appeared the idea of a lawbringer rework, it's a quite popular character but his dull playstile, non\-existant offense and a increasing harder time to parry attacks has left him obsolete.Now the objective of this suggestion is to make him viable and fun, a dangerous foe but with no spamable trick, in order to achieve this, we should keep in mind what type of character he is.This is mix from very good ideas i have seen here but i always feel that those have something missing.Sorry for my english. # General traits &gt;***Attempted muder of a Lawbringer, sentence: death*** * side dodge recoveries still 700 ms. I know it's terrible, but, fixing his shove should be enough to punish consistently, besides with this rework he will become a hero with deadly punishes, allowing a decent mobility would be op. * He is a static fighter, relying more in his armor, damage and ressilience rather than low recoveries, soft feints and ways to avoid damage. * Shove becomes a way to turn the momentum of the fight in his favour, allowing easy access to deadly chains and finishers. * Heavy focus on his vanguard\-heavy mix and disabler abilities, with high damaging hits while revolving around shoves, stuns, reads and baits \(no spamable tricks\). * He is stamina innefficient, he cannot keep attacking for long, before going out of stamina \(and with 700 ms recoveries that is a very big weakness\). * With an armor with no\-equal and the most versatile weapon ever he should have tools that should reflect this \(i.e everything is counterable\). # Offensive changes &gt;***I am the LAW!*** * GB count as chain intiator, throw re\-start the chain heavy after GB will be the second heavy in a chain, while throw into a wall will count as neutral heavy, more of this later * all heavies should increase either range or tracking In it's current state he is easily out ranged, and his only ranged options are slow with mediocre damage \(30 dmg really?\), those also lack tracking and doesn't cover much ground, which is silly having in mind he has a pole\-weapon larger than him, a common issue is the weapon clearly hitting the enemy but doesn't register, this should fix itsorry i don't it's current range but feels short for such large weapon * neutral heavies are 40 damage with hyper armor, 900 \(from 800\) ms side and 1000 \(from 900\) ms top, hyper armor kicks in 500 ms into the attack for side heavies while top is 600 ms LB lacks damage, relying too much on combos and parries, but the problem is that his combos are soo slow that rarely conect and when is does is only 30 dmg each heavy, feels lackluster and takes a lot to finish any oponent, as a stationary fighter he trades mobility for staying power relying in outlasting every oponent through damage and his superior HPwhy not making his heavies faster?, because faster than 800 ms become safer from feint into GB, making a parry speacialist have safe parry options is bad design * every light is 500 ms, be it neutral, middle of the chain or finisher 600 ms lights should not exist, unless those have a nice niche like hyper armor, especial counter properties or easy ways to bypass it like conq shield bash into his 500 ms chain or berserk feint into 400 ms lights, also LB lights has no momentum or movement while being short range, this will compesante while making it excellent at baiting light parries * every side heavy that is second in a chain is 600 ms, top is 700 ms, both 30 dmg, hyper armor kicks at 100 ms into attack one of the worst things in ganks is to shove/combo someone to follow up with a heavy just to be guard broken in the middle of it, this will prevent that \(attacks under 800 ms only have 100 ms vulnerability frames\)why 600 ms? \(could be 700 ms side and 800 ms top\) is to put preassure with the shove light/heavy mix up, low recovery heros can block the heavy even if they dodge anticipating the light and if your enemy accepts the light, the heavy is a free parry. * Heavy finishers \(not unblockable ones\) are 700 ms side, 40 dmg, 800 ms top with 45 dmg, hyper armor kicks 100 ms into the attack same thing, sides ones cannot be guard broken while top has more properties with stun and 10 dmg confimed follow up light * Zone attack, 700 ms hyper armor into 100 ms into the animation, 30 dmg current zone attack is laughable of how bad it is, low damage \(20\), decent range but can be guardbroken in the first 400 ms while also being 900 ms, now is a trading tool, high damage but slow for a zone attack, can help with easy accest to hyper armor * **Make Way** \(zone attack from a parry\) 600 ms, hyper armor and unblockable, 30 dmg \( maybe if it is too much, 25 dmg optional\) Make Way is bad, lacks range and is easily blockable by everyone, the worst case is when you parry consecutive people and use make way to punish them, if the first person you parry threw a heavy, he would recover IN TIME to block make way, to be a move speacially designed to punish ganks it doesn't do it's work, being unblockable will be a powerfull move a powerful tool against ganks while also being excellent in team fights \(remember this move is locked behind a parry\) * **Blind Justice**: top unblockable finisher, 1100 ms, 50 dmg, acts as a finisher, soft feint into a second chained side heavy \(30 dmg, 600ms\) and tracks back dodges such emblematic move is useless outside a light parry, with this changes you will force an opponnent to make a decision, you cannot back dodge it, and low recoveries or characters that can be safe from a GB during a dodge \(raider\) cannot shut down this move thanks to the soft feint. * \(optional\) Every top heavy can break hyper armor or super armor \(blind justice\) this a mechanic that i would like to see, big bois with big weapons should be able to stagger anyone with some specifics attacks, Highlander, raider, shugoki, are some other character that should have this mechanic, this would make them actual dangers to heroes that relay too much on hyper armor or revenge \(revenge highlander OF cannot be staggered while throwing unblockables that deals 60\+ dmg\)why so much hyper armor?, who needs low recovery dodges and i frames when you have POISE, on a serious side with this he cannot be light interrupted upon seeing red, this will be his answer for his awful recoveries giving him 1v1 and anti\-gank potencial. # Impale &gt;***Judgement time*** * reduced range to 80&amp;#37; from current state and every external hit \(to the oponent\) will end the charge a successful impale is a death sentence, nerfing it is necesary, this should be enough * 500 ms unblockable, 5 dmg, 10 dmg from a parry, only cost 60 \(from 74 i think\) stamina and acts as a chain initiator current impale is hard countered by blocking left, unblockable will make the impale an actual threat giving him OOS preassure, the 5 dmg and chain initiator is to make it 35 dmg on wallsplat, 10 dmg from a parry, 40 dmg on wallsplat, is not perfect but it's a nerf * parry the impale should still put the LB OOS and reward a light parry punish pretty self explanatory, with a great move comes a great punishwhy maintain the impale from a parry?, because is more useful as a disabler move, an example would be parrying a berserk while in revenge, impale into wall will waste his revenge, or putting away a highlander away from the team fight # Shove &gt;***There is no such thing as a plea of innocence in my court. A plea of innocence is guilty of wasting my time.*** Shove is one of the core mechanic of the law, but is trash, it's reactable and countered by back dodging when you see red, this proposed changes are meant to transform this into something dangerous. * shove is a chain initiator allows easy access to his chains, the follow ups are 500 ms, 15 dmg light, or a 600 ms, 30 dmg heavy, right now if the oponent accepts to be hitted by the light and you do a heavy is a free parryalso in ganks with a heavy as fast you can quickly change oponent and keep shoving to put away your enemies, while still being hard to parry \(a revenge LB has the danger potential of a puppy\) * shove is 600 ms from 700 ms \(could be 500 ms but i don't want to make him an harrasser\), earliest you can triggered from a dash is 300 ms should be a counter attacking/preassure \(in the middle of your chains\) tool, not one to harrass \(from neutral\), but on the other side dodge shove losses to most CC moves due to it's low speed * shove on block removed It's a braindead mechanic that can't be balanced, annoying, rewards blocking without risk, no debatable, also feed revenge with nothing in return * distance reduced from a succesfull shove \(i don't know the current distance\) Right now a heavy attack feint into GB will wiff putting the LB in danger, reducing the distance should fix this issue \(or just fix feint into GB to catch any dodge\) * shove can be used to cancel heavy attacks recoveries This should allow a shove even if the previous heavy is blocked, this will create preassure and potential damage to turtly opponents, preassure from blocking heavies should be more a common thing, like valk or nobu * GB is 100 ms earlier \(still 400 ms, just comes out 100 ms earlier\) A conq can just dodge and bash without needing to react, nullifing shove into light, heavy and GB, shutting down almost every mix\-up from the LB, with this you should be able to catch him forcing anyone into react properly * shove is only confirmed after a successfull top heavy or heavy finisher, blocked ones can be dodge similar to kick being confirmed from hidden stance * shove miss recovery 500 ms \(current one\) i think this is more than enough, i doesn't confirms anything so no reason to big recoveries # Long arm &gt;***There is no such thing as innocence, only degrees of guilt.*** * new mechanic, his own special form of all block, made by holding back your guard This will be the all block version for the law, animation will be the first part of long arm, making him ready for embracing any kind of charge or attack \(something that pole\-weapons are know for\) * has super armor and reduce damage taken by 50&amp;#37; * the move is triggered by hit * doesn't actually block * 300 ms start up * 20 stamina upon activation and drain stamina just by maintaining it the first two it's beacuse is not a block but a trade, as a static fighter, it's vulnerable to GB, rewards reads, if triggered can be converted into a long arm by pressing GB or make way which both are confirmed, if pressed side heavy will make a side unblockable 45 dmg 800 ms heavy finisher, not guaranteed but this could be usefull in ganks * all block can be cancelled into zone attack \(not make way\) pretty much like conq, with the zone attack being 700 ms no one should have a problem with this * every heavy start\-up can be cancelled into all block everything upon this point is to make 3 things, first is to give him a tool to defend himself from bashes, his main weakness but only upon read, second is to have a counter to options selects, be it PK zone or Glad, this will punish those intent heavily, third and last is to punish attacks locked onto someone else, common Tech to make attacks unparriable, the only ones that can punish those kind of attacks are conq and musha, both with their all blocks, now the LB can punish with other means than parrying * pressing GB during all block will make the current long arm this is the offensive part of the moves, the transition beetween all guard and long arm is as soon you press GB from all block position * Long arm as a move is 700 ms from 1000 ms right now long arm is too slow to be effective, 1v1 wise, the only time that can connect is from a shove with a stunned oponnent, but even so if they wait they can easily dodge it, this change will put more preassure to a stunned opponent. * Long arm is vulnerable to GB in it's first 400\-500 ms this is just so you can't long arm upon reaction to GB * long arm is chain initiator and confirms a side heavy with a shove follow up is a chain initiator because the follow up heavy would be 30 dmg, instead of 40 dmg * reduce wiff recovery in order to be punishable for 600 or 700 ms recovery heroes it takes too much time, i have been GB from OOS heroes after a backdodge, you want to punish, side dodge # New moves and mechanics: &gt;***Innocence proves nothing.*** * **Righteous fury:** after any side heavy if the follow up is a top heavy should be unblockable \(blind justice\) this move is one of notable of LB, but is terrible outside of a light parry, with this changes you will force an opponnent to make a decision, you cannot back dodge it, and low recoveries or characters that can be safe from a GB during a dodge \(raider\) cannot shut down this movenote that shove cannot start Righteous fury, also this will provide an easy access to an unblockable like raider, kensei, highlander etc. * **Crime, Trial and Sentence: H=\&gt;H=\&gt;H**\(unblockable\), neutral heavy followed by a side one, 600 ms and 30 dmg \(a top one will start Righteous fury\) with the finisher being unblockable, side finisher is 45 dmg and 800 ms with a wide arc, while top finisher is blind justice he need this badly, in every combo after a heavy comes a light, easily parried, this would provide versatility to his mix ups and defending from ganks, why side heavy finiser 800 ms?, in both ganks and 1v1 is too slow to be effective, an easy parry * **lawful retribution: H=\&gt;H=\&gt;L** similar to the last one but with a final poke for 15 dmg * **And Justice For all: H=\&gt;L=\&gt;L**, after the initial heavy the poleaxe is pointing towards the enemy, it just makes sence that he would use it as a spear to stab the enemy both, perfect tools to complement the treath of a potential shove and to keep putting preassure * **judgement time: L=\&gt;L=\&gt;H**, more mix ups, more versatility * \(optional\) **officer warning** \(or a better name\): neutral heavy start up can be soft feinted into a light shaft strike, comes from the top, chain intiator ,10 dmg ,400 ms and causes stun LB potential danger goes up exponencially against a stunned opponnent, this would be a nice niche to constantly deliver the stun and open up turtles * **relentless prosecutor: foward dodge \+ Heavy**, 600 ms, 20 dmg, earliest can be triggered from a dodge is 200 ms, comes from the top this is to catch oponents tha would roll away from your shove and also being useful to close the gap beetween you and your enemy, to put it short, why i can't just charge with my poleaxe from neutral? \(side note, potential move\) *he could use a way to impale people from neutral, making fleeing oponents really think twice before run from a LB, especially useful since the new backdodge is unlock and run from the oponent, obviously not unblockable* ***Feats Changes*** * **Conqueror**: allow to capture flags quickly, \(Optional\) prolongs some self buff Feat duration \(in this case, juggernaut and righteous deflection\) * **Harsh Judgement**: lower objetive stamina, sprint speed and show them on the map while active no one escapes from the law, useful to prevent an enemy to escape * **juggernaut**: increased duration to 15 \(from 10\) seconds and gives Rock Steady right now juggernaut is too short, with a long cooldown, with this you will hold your ground for 15 seconds becoming a true wall that the enemy has to overcome or a unstopable force in the middle of a teamfight * **Fiat lux**: reduce range or increase it's time activation, increase cooldown, is too dificult to dodge and with low cooldown allows control B from afar or guaranteeds pugno mortis and igneus imber, it's too op and is the pilar of bombringer, also other bomb feats need a look but not nerf them into trash This is the Dream work of a rep 24 lawboi.

361,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,New move idea for Warlord: Shield Strike,6,8m1nzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8m1nzn/new_move_idea_for_warlord_shield_strike/,2018-05-25 23:16:38,"Earlier today I had an idea for Warlord, a fairly historically accurate technique that would also give him another option both for counter-attacking and from neutral, and hopefully would edge him a bit higher in A tier or up to low S tier. *Shield Strike* Input: GB + back Shield Strike is a two-part attack. The first strike, from here on called the shield slam, is a traditional video game shield bash. For animation, think something like Valkyrie's and Conq's GB. This attack is 500ms long and functions like Aramusha's blade blockade, gaining FBS and superior block 100ms into the animation. The shield slam is vulnerable to GB, but cannot be GBed on reaction as it's only 500ms in duration. The shield slam does no damage and has a very tiny hitstun, but it does leave the opponent no chance to interrupt the followup if it hits. After the slam, the Warlord can cancel to neutral or let the move continue to its second part, referred to as the shield strike. This is a straight forward strike with the edge of the shield, almost like a punch. The animation of his parry counter might be appropriate for this. It works as a 400ms unblockable bash attack that does 15 damage. If the FBS part of the shield slam is used to block an attack, the shield strike becomes gauranteed, and also gaurantees a followup headbutt (performed by hitting GB again). What is the purpose of this move? 1. It's a reasonable offensive move from neutral. While telegraphed by the first part, it can be feinted up to its second part, and the second part is not reactable once it starts up. It serves a similar purpose to Kensei's pommel strike, dealing less damage and being safe from most interruption in return for the GB vulnerability on startup. 2. It grants warlord an alternative counter-attacking tool. The FBS of the startup gaurantees additional damage if used as a counter, rewarding the warlord in return for making himself vulnerable to feint into GB. Warlord has his zone option select as an alternative tool if he predicts the opponent will try just that, turning it into something of a mind game for both players. Do you guys like it?"
362,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"New mechanic : ""Bracing""",345,8mnard,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8mnard/new_mechanic_bracing/,2018-05-28 14:07:22,"Bit of flavor for heavier characters. Characters with slow dodges have a hard time punishing bashes, as by the time their dodge recovery finishes, the vulnerability window to punish the bash is already over. This allows bashes to be spammed against Lawbringer and Shugoki with relatively little risk. The most common suggestions increase the dodge speed of these characters to the point where they can punish whiffed bashes, but seeing 150 kg sumo wrestler and a giant in full place dance around like butterflies seems can be a little strange. I propose an alternative, holding the full block button causes these characters to enter the bracing stance that nullifies and counter-attacks bashes/dash attacks/sprinting attacks. LB takes a step back, plants his poleaxe into the ground, and levels the point at the enemy, while Shugoki gains super armor and enters a sumo semi-squat. Enemies that charge into LB are impaled and flipped over long-arm style, enemies that charge into Shugoki eat a demon's embrace like bearhug. This stance allows these two heavy characters to counter bashes in a unique manner without homogenized fast dodges. Possible additions - Guarding is not enabled in bracing stance. - Exit bracing stance by letting go of C. Lawbringer can exit with a sped up long arm or impaling riposte, Shugoki can exit with a sped up demon's embrace. This enables a punish against feinted bashes."
363,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha rework,29,8n19ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8n19ur/aramusha_rework/,2018-05-30 04:09:56,"So this will be my second installment of reworks with my first being the Centurion. I figured Aramusha would be the best Hero to touch on next since he seems to be the weakest hero design wise amongst both this community and the competitive community. More so he presented an interesting challenge to me as he was a hero I personally didn't think needed to be majorly overhauled. But here I am today attempting to make something out of the flawed idea that is Aramusha. Like last time I need to identify the flaws of the hero. Aramusha like a handful of heros doesn't really have a way to force open a turtle. He entirely relies on the opponent to make a mistake to get anywhere. However that in itself wouldn't be so bad. But his tool to get in on said enemies isn't very good. And then we have his infinite combo. A very interesting and fun concept that ends up being worthless against a great player and an absolute nightmare for people who don't have that great of reaction/reading skills. This rework aims to make Aramusha a bit or of an active fighter with a better tool. But we will also see the removal of how annoying his combo can be and some minor damage adjustments to compensate for the power he's going to now get. **Rushing wind:** A unique dash attack that can only be initiated from the forward dodge but can come from any side. Sadly outside the top version it's rarely used. **The changes:** Forward dodge recovery goes from 700ms to 500ms. Top rushing wind can be soft feinted into a light. This light is a 500ms side light that has the same stun property as a deadly feinted side light guaranteeing a top light if it lands. The Rushing wind side attacks have the undodgable property. The soft feinted light will do 17 damage instead of a normal deadly feinted one at 20 to compensate. *These changes gives aramusha a way to initiate. Top dash is already used for trades and can occasionally used to feint game. This simply adds more for Aramusha to use to get in on an opponent. The undodgable property is used to punish dodgers and for another thing later in this rework. All attack speeds are still the same.* **Heavies and heavy finishers:** Heavies themselves are strong at punishing feint bait games in most regards but beyond that offer little use and really only used to get into deadly feint territory. Which comes to heavy finishers. Delaying your deadly feint is really the only way to make use of the deadly feint feature. Which is nice and all but not enough. **the changes:** Normal heavies and heavies mid combo can be soft feinted into Aramusha's kick. Heavy finishers can be soft feinted into ring the bell alternate. Aramusha can also now dash out of his heavy finishers. Heavies at the moment are 600ms and will stay that fast. But damage wise i'm bumping them down. 25 for neutral instead of 30 and 30 for comboed instead of 33. Heavy finisher damage stays at 45. *The soft feint into kick means heavies themselves can still be used mid combo even if they are only soft feinted. and adding an extra option to deadly finishers makes them less easy to deal with. Being able to dash out of his heavy finishers allows him to potentially punish people who roll away from his deadly feint mix up game.* **Ring the bell alternate:** Kind of sort of not really a new move. Uses the same pommel smack animation ring the bell does but without the grab. It blinds the opponent doing 18 damage and 25 stamina damage. It always comes from the top and is not unblockable. it's 400ms and treated as a light if you manage to parry. This lets Aramusha end his aggression with some benefit. The blind effect lets him hide his animations and his allies. Soft feint time is variable up to 500ms in the attack. **Blade blockade:** His tool meant to punish an opponent and let aramusha get in. But it's punish options are a bit poor. And the move itself is a little lacking in flexibility. **The changes:** Blade blockade now lasts for 600ms instead of 400ms with the GB vulnerability window still being 500ms after. But now Aramusha can dash out of his blade blockade before it ends. Blade blockade now successfully repels multiple enemy hits like deflect and parry do. * The longer window means Aramusha can catch attacks easier in a group setting. The buff to blade blockading multiple enemies makes it usable in a gank setting. and the ability to dodge out of his blade blockade means he can potentially enter a mix up with top rushing wind and slightly cover up a miss timed blade blockade. But seeing as how it's a dash he's still vulnerable to a GB on a read.* **Kick:** A fairly situational tool that's good for ledging and occasionally a splat. But beyond that not very decent. **The changes:** Kick now has armor wether it comes from blade blockade or is soft feinted into. Kick now has no delay. Kick knock back distance cut almost in half. Pressing heavy after a kick leads straight into top rushing wind. Kick into wall splat now guarantees a top heavy instead of side heavy plus light for 25 damage. Kick speed remains the same. *The reduced knockback plus armor makes it a more usable option in team fights which is worth considering due to the stamina damage and blind it causes. The delay fix is to make so people can't escape it like certain heros can now. and the punish change is compensation for how much for flexible the kick is now.* **Fury unleashed:** The second most damaging move off of blade blockade but hardly used due to it not being guaranteed in many situations. It has some utility even when blocked. since you can get straight into deadly feint territory but imo that's not enough. **The change:** Fury unleashed is now guaranteed on light attacks. *This in combination with the new deadly feint mix up game means it will become a more desirable option to try even if it's on a move that it's not guaranteed on. Damage is currently 30 and stays at 30.* **Twin vipers:** is actually almost a perfect move. but it is simply avoidable with a dodge. **The changes:** Twin vipers is now 800ms instead of 1000ms and the unblockable gains tracking. *The faster speed of the unblockable means someone has to decide how they will handle the move due to the soft feint light option. And the tracking means someone can't just dodge out of the mix up. Damage is currenty 40 and stays at 40.* **Infinite combo:** A novel idea to have a very flexible combo machine. But it just doesn't work out in high skill matches and is too effective in low skill matches. Blocking simply shuts it out. and the speed is too fast for less than average players. **The change:** Aramusha no longer has an infinite combo. He gets traditional combos now which are: +Light&gt;heavy +Light&gt;Light&gt;heavy +Heavy&gt;Light&gt;Heavy +Heavy&gt;Heavy +Light&gt;heavy&gt;Heavy *This changes deadly feints function from a ""mix up"" on direction to a bridge to gap combos together and reset them. So technically speaking you can still continue for a good while if you're constantly deadly feinting and landing hits. But you can't just mash light forever or heavy forever or a mix of the 2 forever. Which should make things a bit more managable for the average player but keeping the usage basically the same for high tier.* **Wrapping up:** Basically every option aramusha has out of blade blockade has armor now. Twin vipers and fury unleashed already did and the kick now has armor. This means along with the buffs to blade blockade itself and the easier access more usable kick aramusha should be able to continue to perform in a team fight and not be interrupted so much or completely helpless when ganked. Giving aramusha access to (technically) 2 moves from his blade blockade without being in it also means aramusha has more options to use with his combos without entirely relying on the enemy just having bad reactions to simple moves. But the price for this flexibility was a loss of damage to one some punishes (namely his max OOS and his wall splat) but also his raw heavies as well and the fact that he no longer has a true infinite combo without the use of deadly feint. Which means basically less issues for lower tier players and no harm to the higher tier players. The damage nerfs effect them more. But the new flexibility should more than make up for that. General feedback is as always requested. But I'm really interested in hearing feedback on my blade blockade changes. I increased the time on it in order to be able to dash out of it. I'm not married to that idea though and would be fine with keeping blade blockade as long as it is now. And also feedback on Ring the bell alternate."
364,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,My thoughts on the current state of the game. (Warning: Really long),7,8nty3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8nty3p/my_thoughts_on_the_current_state_of_the_game/,2018-06-02 03:50:45,"There are some issues I feel make offense in For Honor not nearly as good, but more importantly, as interesting as it could be. **This post will be 100% my opinion**, so you don't have to agree with anything and everything. I just figured writing this out was cathartic in developing more thoughts on the current meta and my opinions on the game, and that sharing it might make others take a second look at certain things I feel aren't considered enough. First, and most importantly, **strong defense is far easier than strong offense**. Defending in this game, even when facing a character with very strong offense like Conqueror or Berserker, is for the most part very simple and most of the damage you incur will come from attacks that are too fast to react to. Blocking is the simplest and lowest risk thing you can do in For Honor, and the minor chip damage we have now isn't a very sufficient deterrent to someone who ""abuses"" that fact. Along with blocking, parries also function as a typically safe tool, especially when combined with an option select like Nobushi or Gladiator's. Parries would be a fine mechanic in the game, had they not been designed to be done on reaction to an attack. The developers have stated they were actually surprised that people were able to pick parrying up so quickly, thinking that feinting heavies into a guardbreak was enough of a scare to not do so. However it's pretty clear that parries, in conjunction with the current fight system we have, stand to do nothing but cause stalemating issues with less viable characters and massive swings in HP with more viable characters. I'll cover more on parries in the next section, but I wanted to addres my main concerns with them here. So moving on, I want to touch on melee attacks and where they fit in the game. The trend to make offense overwhelm defense has always seemed like a workaround of the fight system rather than an addition. Melee attacks are a pretty good showing of this. Typically in the past, characters that have had very strong melee games have always been prevalent because of how insanely low the risk/reward ratio was. Shugoki with his Oni Charge, Raider with his Stampede Charge, Warlord with Crashing Charge and pre-nerf Headbutt, Gladiator's zone, and Conqueror's current Shield Bashes are the best examples. They all have or had far more reward than their risk entailed, largely being unreactable mixups that forced you to guess. Something like this is fine if the reward matched the incredibly low risk, but for the most part they don't. The main issue with these attacks aren't just the attacks themselves, but the behaviors a melee attack like these shares with guard switch delays, dodge startup, and the actual reaction to the attacks. A great example is when fighting against Highlander and he's in your face in offensive stance throwing OF lights. These things are completely unreactable for the most part, making you switch your guard back and forth to attempt to block them as he waves from side to side. This is an awful idea though, as eating the lights is often preferable to being locked into a guard switch and getting hit by a Kick. When you create melee attacks in this game, they're either incredibly mediocre, like Warden's Shoulderbash, or they're incredibly overtuned, like Gladiator's zone. There really isn't a middle ground option. A melee attack is either reactable and can be avoided based on that, or they're nearly unreactable and require a read. Again, this would be completely fine, but the moves carry almost no risk to the reward they stand to gain. Secondly, which I feel is more of a meta-game opinion, is that **commitment is heavily deincentivized**. The perfect example of this is Centurion. His character design is entirely based around keeping his chains going, cancelling into melee mixups, and punishing you for panicking. Well, that's Centurion's character design in theory. The way this translates in-game is that he has a lot of worthless tools that don't really do much at all. His Jab, for example, has a very obvious startup and can be avoided by every character in the game unless stuck in guard switch delay. The Jab itself only guarantees a light as well, with your only somewhat viable followup to that light to be a heavy that's either slightly charged or soft feinted into guardbreak. Both of those options will do nothing to a competent player, however. They'll just block in the direction the indicator appears, and get ready for the soft feint into guardbreak if it comes. The same could be said for his chain finisher heavy when fully charged. It becomes an unblockable attack that guarantees a fully charged jab into Eagle's Talons. Going back to what I said before, the risk vs. reward on this attack seems amazing. Potential 60 damage for a heavy parry punish worth of damage? Seems alright. Well, that is until you look at the unblockable. It can't be feinted during the last 300ms of the move, meaning if a Centurion player ever commits to it, the attack will nearly always be parried by someone who understands how it works. This also applies to Shugoki, who is also a character built around hard reads and commitment, but is even worse off than Centurion. Even when looking at rather strong characters such as Gladiator, commitment to his attacks isn't vital whatsoever to his gameplan. Skewer is a somewhat decent attack, but feinting the Skewer into another option is always a better tradeoff than letting it go through. You can compare this to other parts of Gladiator's kit as well, like a chained Fuscina Ictus or his chains in general. Committing to these options often nets you very little to what they gain, making them undesirable to use because it's just not a good tradeoff. It's better to get your hit in, back off, and go back on the offensive when you notice an opening. Now that would be a cool character in a game that actually has neutral. But For Honor doesn't have that. Raw heavies are one of the worst things you can do in the game, mainly because of how slow and easily blocked or parried they are. There really is no incentive to commit to these moves whatsoever, especially that chains in general aren't all that strong. The only characters who gain anything from raw heavies are the ones who have multiple non-commitment options out of them, such as Peacekeeper or Conqueror. Peacekeeper can cancel her heavies either into a 400ms soft feint light or a guardbreak, making her heavies very safe. The same could be said for Centurion who I mentioned earlier. Committing to his fully charged attacks is rarely ever the way to go since they're easily parried or blocked, netting you negligible pressure for the latter. Somebody like Kensei is a character entirely designed around not committing whatsoever. He has an incredible amount of relatively safe soft feints and mixups. Kensei suddenly becomes strong because in a character that has so many options to not commit, that committing is the thing you don't expect. His strength comes from the fact that he's so complex (at least in regards to For Honor) that his most simple things are effective. Even when Kensei has all of these options, the far more viable approach is to do things like interrupt with zone or cancel attacks into guardbreak. Third, **the neutral game of For Honor is incredibly flawed**. While I don't like For Honor being considered a fighting game or being compared to them, there are some things that can be learned from the genre. If the development team is going to consider For Honor a fighting game, they should really start incorporating the things that are fundamental in fighting games. The most important takeaway For Honor could take from them is a more complex neutral game. In fighting games, the approach is often more important than the finish. It's a lot easier to get somebody to panic up close than it is from a distance, and closing that gap results in a deeply rewarding and complex back and forth game of pokes, counters, dodging, jump-ins, zoning, etc. This just doesn't exist in For Honor. The neutral game of the game functions something like this. ""Do you have a powerful soft feint?"" No? You don't get to play neutral. ""Do you have a strong melee attack?"" No? No attacking for you. Power creep is a huge concern with this game, especially at the pace characters get reworked and the quality of those reworks. Somebody like Raider is left to abuse whatever quirks in the game he can to get a single hit in, while a character like Conqueror can simply bash. The neutral game doesn't exist because you largely have three options. You can either throw a light attack, which will probably get parried. You can throw a heavy, which will probably get blocked, dodged, or parried. Or you can guardbreak, which will never work against someone with more then 100 hours of playtime. These options largely pale in comparison to other, far more powerful and safe options because there's no real depth to them. Guardbreaks largely don't work in the way that was intended, which is to literally break your guard. If there's anything that should be universal in this game it's guardbreaks. Everybody should have a strong neutral guardbreak capable of opening up turtles. This is such a pure fundamental part of other games that I can't believe it hasn't been touched since launch, it's the most obvious solution to a lot of the problems we have right now. Recovery plays a large role in this too, and ties back into commitment a tad. Valkyrie seems at first like a character that can control the neutral game with strong mobility, defensive, and some mixups. Valkyrie is mostly bad because of her recovery on all of her attacks. Her melee attacks largely have huge windows of vulnerability, with her only ""safe"" options being raw heavies or light attacks, both of which are very punishable options. Somebody like Nobushi is incredibly strong in the neutral game because she has a lot of ways to cancel recovery and avoid damage. In regards to the former, more characters need to be like this. Nobushi has a lot of flow and she's genuinely one of the most well designed characters in the game, even if her offense is mostly unimpressive. If at least some of her options out of recovery were available to less desirable characters like Shugoki or Lawbringer, then they could have a genuine shot at controlling space as well as she does. HP also contributes a lot to this, with the values being far too low across the board with the damage we have. HP in general could be raised by 50% and I honestly think nothing but positives would be gained. Stamina also discourages playing a heavy neutral game, and I wouldn't mind seeing a buff to everyone's stamina in exchange for a more limited OOS defense. Fourth, and finally. **Characters function far too similarly with minor variation**. Let's take a look at three of the strongest 1v1 heroes in the game right now. Berserker, Orochi, and Peacekeeper. Each of these characters has a very similar gameplan with only a mild deviation. Berserker is all about 400ms attacks from feints. Orochi is all about 400ms attacks from chains. Peacekeeper is all about 400ms attacks in general since she has three of them. The only slight differences between these characters are their kits when compared as a whole, but their viable kits are largely the same, with Berserker having an unblockable chain finisher as an outlier, Orochi having more varied dash attacks and chains, and Peacekeeper having soft feints and a more powerful neutral zone. We could also compare Conqueror and Gladiator as well. These characters aren't picked because they have long chains and a lot of melee in their chains, they're picked because they have insanely strong melee openers and good option selects. Even though Conqueror is a Heavy with infinites and charged heavies and Gladiator is an Assassin with an easily accessible unblockable and dash attacks, they both are played very similarly as safe turtles. They chip down damage with their oppressive melee, then use their litany of defensive options to avoid damage directed at them. I could keep going with comparisons but I feel like I explained my point here well enough. Now why does this matter in a post about offensive not being where it should be? Well, it's because there are two main archetypes that are going to largely set the standard for reworks in the future. A character will either gain extensive melee and safe mixups (Kensei, Conqueror), or unreactable attacks and easy ways to get to them (Berserker, Orochi). What I think mostly about this situation is a lack of creativity and more of a push to make characters more viable first, and more interesting second. Obviously viability is a concern, but I feel like most of the issues with characters largely not being viable lies in problems with the mechanics rather than the character's design. Aramusha is a pretty good example of this, in my opinion. In a meta where parries weren't as oppressive and blocking wasn't as safe, Aramusha would thrive greatly due to the amount of variety of compact chaining and mixups he has. While Aramusha isn't all that viable at the moment, he is very enjoyable and interesting. No character functions in the same way or style that Aramusha does. This is probably the reason why I disagree with the character recieving melee soft feints or 400ms attacks. It isn't necessary. None of these things are inherently necessary. What's necessary is a change to the mechanics rather then the characters themselves (although many still do need reworks). If blocking wasn't as safe and parrying was far more difficult, we could see a game where someone like Aramusha is actually very strong without being on the verge of unfairness. While I hope the new heroes shore up some of that creative complacency I've felt with the game over the past half year or so, I would love to see that same approach taken with the remaining base game characters as well. In conclusion, I feel like there are a lot of design problems with For Honor that should be addressed and a lot of minor solutions that could be implemented in the interim at least in a trial setting. Basic mechanics such as parrying or guardbreaks need some serious changing and would shake up the game a lot. While the meta is slowly shifting toward a more offense heavy one, it's at the cost of homogenizing more of the cast and character archetypes that could be fleshed out more independently, rather than the root of the problem in the strength of defense and how it relates to offense.

365,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Changing Shinobi,2,8onxql,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8onxql/changing_shinobi/,2018-06-05 14:23:30,"I know posts like this are generally frowned upon at this point because they get spammed a lot and just seem quite low effort and uninspired, but I was thinking of some neat ideas that wouldn't change his current playstyle too much, while also making him more punishable and less of a pain to fight (and even play sometimes). I should note that I've gotten significantly worse at formatting, my apologies. - Make kick a counter-attack instead of an opener, or in laymans terms, only able to be used off side dashes. Bash spamming seems like its more of Conquerers thing anyway. He gets a lot of damage off kick and it shouldn't be so easy to get. In turn, speed up kick by 100ms on side dashes so it can't be dodged very easily. (Dashing sideways, then double dashing forward or backward will still allow him to kick. Hard to convey what I'm trying to say here, if you're a Shinobi player you'll probably know what I mean.) - Reduce his double light damage from 24 to 18. 24 damage is absolutely absurd for landing (technically) one light, in fact its more than Orochis double top light *while also being omnidirectional.* I don't want to make it as low as Shamans double light because he only has three chains (L, L - H, H - H, L). The damage he gets off a single heavy (imo) is fine because its basically his only OOS punish. - Allow his ranged heavies to chain on block, and make his second ranged heavy unblockable. This means they are no longer free GB on block either. In teamfights, this would only be 25 damage if landed, and its fairly easy to parry because the chained ranged heavy is (I think) 700ms. Basically its just a very weak Balors Might that must be chained into, but the pro is that it has distance. In 1v1, this would give him a decent opener that promotes his ranged playstyle. - Ranged heavies should pull Shinobi towards the opponent for a free light, and his ranged guard break should be the only thing that knocks him down when countered. This would affect him in teamfights massively. He could be pulled into traps, friendly fire, etc. It would also make it so he doesn't get punished so hard for trying to use his openers in 1v1s, and his opponent would get a standard heavy parry punish. - Make backflip's start-up have GB vulnerability, but in turn give it i-frames. This would make it an evasive way to counter-attack in 1v1s (like Berserker and Orochi with their dodge cancels), and it will allow him to be GB punished for a whiffs kick. It will also give him a good way to get to a safe distance in teamfights after whiffs and keep him from getting completely hammered down when he uses it in 1vX. - Speed up ranged heavy opener to 500ms after a backflip. Since backflip will be able to be punished, he should be rewarded for successfully performing it. Its not a crazy change, but because his ranged attacks are his only option after a backflip, they're very telegraphed, so increasing the speed of the ranged heavy opener (aka first heavy in chain) will make it harder to punish and predict. Let me know what you think. Its possible I got some frame data wrong or made an oversight, so if I did, please tell me so I don't look stupid lol. "
366,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Feint/parry rework suggestion. (also a fix for gb vulnerability problems),0,8p0yb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8p0yb3/feintparry_rework_suggestion_also_a_fix_for_gb/,2018-06-07 00:16:05,"The parry changes have done a great job making the reward for parrying lower, but even now the combination of parrying and blocking is still so oppressive to the meta that heroes are being specifically designed with faster attacks and more melee moves just so they can (somewhat) avoid having to deal with this, blocking is very effective (which is kind of necessary for 4v4) and parrying is still too safe, adding reward to turtling while often barely adding any risk compared to blocking. I want to give a small suggestion on how we could improve the interactions between feinting and parrying to make offense a little safer and adding some more mindgame potential to the feinting mechanic. The Idea is simple: feint input should come before attack input, but it can have a very large impact on how feinting works, i will state some of the options this opens up: 1. Parry attempts can no longer be feinted; if you want to parry, you need to commit to the heavy. This adds a lot of potential reward to baiting a parry attempt. If you successfully bait a parry attempt you can guarantee a parry. Soft feints would need to be looked at though, they could be a problem here, idk. 2. You need to commit to any attack/feint; you need to be more thoughtful of when to attack and when to feint. Because a read by the enemy means he can throw an interrupt light. This is the biggest problem with this idea, interrupt lights will become safer to throw, because you cannot cancel a heavy to counter an interrupt attempt, this could lead to some balancing problems because interruptability is very dependent on the attack speeds of both heroes. A solution could be adding HA to some of the slower heavies during late frames, or potentially even a sort of pseudo-HA that is interrupted by heavies but not lights, but this comes with it's own set of problems. 3. Improved gb vulnerabilities; since the game knows which attack is a feint and which attack is not ahead of time, there's no need for long gb vulnerability on attack startup on slow attacks. The vulnerability window can be standardised or at least be brought closer together. 4. Longer feint windows, since you need to commit to a feint the feint window can be made much longer, this would improve the mindgame potential of feinting a 700ms heavy could have a 500ms feint animation, i am not saying it should, but at least the windows could be extended to make them vetter at baiting people out. Feints are vulnerable to gb from start to finish, obviously. My phone is running out of battery so i may or may not add a conclusion or something to this post later. "

Many members of the community seem to take issue with the strength of revives. You can threaten a revive to bait an attack, effectively giving the reviver an advantage even though they've broken off from a fight to revive someone, and if a revive is successful you've added a full health player to the fight. What if revives couldn't be cancelled? You were locked in to the revive. You can no longer bait an attack because you can't defend yourself and in the midst of a gank or team fight you're risking extreme vulnerability for the reward of a full health teammate in the fight. I feel this doesn't weaken the revive mechanic, adds a considerable risk to it and removes the defensive/bait advantage you gain as a reviver. Someone commented it wouldn't change the strength of revive speed as the meta pick, which is true and something i had considered. I don't really have an answer to that. "
368,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Severe Adjustments And Rebalancing To Conqueror V.2.1(Warning: long read),3,8qpgyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8qpgyl/severe_adjustments_and_rebalancing_to_conqueror/,2018-06-13 14:04:08,"After making the first version, I searched throughout the [r/forhonor](URL and [r/CompetitiveForHonor](URL subs, looking for rebalancing and improvement suggestions for the Conqueror. I found them, and realized something else. Assassins are leagues above more powerful than heavies due to having many effective tools, those of which outshine the heavy class, which have fewer, much less effective tools. So I propose this. Give the Conqueror's tools some major viability and effectiveness buffs to finally even out the playing field. What we know: Conqueror's moveset is a mixed bag. His Charge Stance is useless in 1v1s or 1vXs, his Shield Uppercut is underpowered for its stamina cost(which is 42), and his full block soft feints and flail uppercut are easy to deal with in high level play. \*Editor's Note: All of these changes are without feats in mind, and are to balance the moves to be more viable in either 1v1s, 4v4s, Xv1s(Ganks), and 1vXs(Anti\-ganks).\* # Shield Bash His Shield Bash \- specifically his neutral Shield Bash \- is too safe and spammable, while his chained bash and uppercut are underpowered. Time to fix that. \*\*Neutral Shield Bash\*\* * His guaranteed light after neutral Shield Bash is reduced to 11 from 13 * His tracking is on side dodges is reduced mildly * His tracking on back dodges is increased to have the possibility of catching back dodges. * He can follow a whiffed Neutral Shield Bash with a heavy or light, but their damage is reduced to 7 for the light, and 15 for the heavy(Now this and the next point may make it safe, and that's because I cannot think of a solution that is a balance between too safe, or too vulnerable, so someone else should think up of an idea) * When the Conqueror performs an attack to save himself from a whiffed shield bash, there is a delay so that he cannot catch anyone mid\-dodge * Neutral Shield Bash cannot take away the stamina of an OOS opponent, only pause the stamina regen(This feature needs to be widespread across all characters) \*Editor's Note: These changes are to make neutral Shield Bash a lot less spammable. It is still useful as an opener, but that's all it should be. And if Conq misses a Shield Bash from neutral, he cannot follow up with an attack that no one can block. In this sense, it's a much more powerful version of Warlord's headbutt, but not made as spammable.\* \*\*Chained Shield Bash\*\* * If hit, grants Conqueror a side heavy * The guaranteed side heavy's damage is decreased to 23 damage * If the Conqueror does not want to perform a guaranteed heavy, he could still perform a guaranteed light. \*Editor's Note: Chained Shield Bash is slow and low\-rewarding(unless opponent is wallsplatted). This higher reward complements its slower speed. \* \*\*Shield Uppercut\*\* A high stamina\-costing move, with low rewards, that fails at its job at catching dodgers. * Range is increased, to catch back\-dodgers * If hit, grants Conqueror a side heavy * The guaranteed side heavy's damage is decreased to 23 damage * If the Conqueror does not want to perform a guaranteed heavy, he could still perform a guaranteed light. \*Editor's Note: The increased range works at fixing the move. It's supposed to catch dodgers, but can't catch back\-dodgers. The higher reward complements the slow speed and high stamina cost of the move.\* # Full Block Conqueror's full block is useful against new players, but is not as useful in high level play. So we only need to look at his soft feint timings and his options from blocking while in Full Block. \*\*Soft\-Feinting\*\* * FB soft feint window from mid\-attack is increased to last from 100ms as soon as the attack begins, and 200ms before the attack ends * FB soft feint window from blocked attacks is increased by about 300ms * FB soft feint window from whiffed attacks is increased greatly, by about 500\-600ms earlier than before \*Editor's Note: These changes are to make him more mix\-up potential in 1v1s, and to help him greatly in 1vXs, the one area he is at his worst.\* \*\*(Technically) New Move: Stand Clear\*\* * If hit while in Full Block, Conqueror can perform an unblockable zone attack * Stand Clear has high range, about 1.5\-2 meters * Stand Clear's knock back ability * Stand Clear is one hit, that can be be continued as a regular zone, or be continued into Conscript's Attrition * Like Flail Uppercut, it's unparryable, but deals low damage * After three swings, the full guard property reverts to our altered zone's properties \*Editor's Note: This move is to give him the chance to create space for himself in 4v4s and 1vXs. It allows him to continue to fight when outnumbered.\* \*\*Flail Uppercut\*\* * The damage of the Flail Uppercut scales up if, while in Full Block, Conqueror is hit by multiple enemies * Minions cannot scale up the damage \*Editor's Note: This situation would be very unlikely, but should allow for a quick kill. The scaling would be so: 1 hit, 1.0 x damage; 2 hits, 1.5 x damage; 3 hits, 2.0 damage; 4 hits, 3.0 damage. This accentuates Conq's ""Hard Hitter"" aspect.\* \*\*Shield Riposte\*\* \*Editor's Note: Since the soft\-feint into guardbreak is viewed as pointless and awkward, the Shield Riposte returns. This is just another possible option for the Conqueror. While it may not have been known as useful pre\-rework, it may see more use as when it comes to selecting an option after a blocked hit.\* (I wouldn't know how to balance out some of the GB vulnerability of Shield Riposte or the regular zone attack, I'll leave that up to the devs) # Zone Attack An attack that is *very* safe. If you're in revenge with unlimited stamina and uninterruptability, you're practically invincible. So here are a couple proposed changes. * After a second, the Zone Attack loses its guard on top(the move looks like it can't in any way block in every direction while also attacking) * Once the Conq stops performing the zone, they can continue the recovery into Conscript's Attrition *Editor's note: This change is to grant it a weakness and not make the zone a must option for defence. This is also to incentivize Conquerors to use Stand Clear, which keeps its top guard for more than three hits. So the normal zone is still good for option select, but not made as safe, and given an alternate way to start a chain.* # Charge Stance Conqueror's charge stance is useless in 1v1s and 1vXs, as it take time to charge any unblockable, which anyone can see and know what the Conqueror will do. This only makes the charging stance useful as OOS punish, in Xv1s and 4v4s. Lets change that. \*\*Charge Stance Properties\*\* * Charging Stance can block lights without losing his charge, but blocking heavies makes it lose the charge * Guard switch delay decreased to 100ms from 200ms \*Editor's Note: These changes are to make it so that, while in Charge Stance, it's possible to block lights. The inability to block heavies will make it so that enemies throw out heavies more often, thus allowing Conq to use his Superior Heavies to counter\-attack.\* * While in Charging Stance, Conqueror can dodge while keeping his charge \*Editor's Note: This gives Conqueror a way to close the distance of his target. The problem before was that Conq was slow in this Stance, and the enemy could just dodge away to stay safe.\* * If Conq deflects any attack(light or heavy) he keeps his charge * When Conqueror is in Charging Stance, if he uses his pseudo\-deflect to deflect an attack, he can perform a dash heavy attack \*Editor's Note: The suggestion in the previous version was to give him the ability to unblockable dodge heavy from Charge Stance. But I thought that giving him that kind of power would be too much. So I restricted it to only being performed if Conq deflects an attack, which would incentivize him to deflect more often while in Charge Stance.\* \*\*Soft\-feinting From Charge Stance\*\* * Doing a Shield Uppercut from an Unblockable Charged Heavy gives the Uppercut the ability to wallsplat * A Shield Uppercut from a Charged Heavy can be performed 100ms later than from a normal heavy * Doing a Full Block Soft feint from an Unblockable Charged Heavy decreases the start time to 200ms from 300ms \*Editor's Note: The Stance is unique to Conq(somewhat), but it is so unrefined that it feels like an add\-on. Giving these moves special properties accentuates the power of this stance, and gives the stance enough viability to become a powerful way of fighting.(like how some people are more focused on feinting, or how some people focus on bashes.)\* # Stamina Conqueror is a heavy, and thus has a low stamina pool. But the stamina costs of some of his moves are either too high or too low. So this is to balance them out. * Conqueror's charging shield crush's stamina cost is reduced to 50 from 60 \*Editor's Note: This move confirms, at best, a Shield Bash into light, which is 13 damage without feats. And if whiffed, can be punished severely. A lower stamina cost is meant to balance out the low damage reward.\* * Conqueror's Shield Uppercut's stamina cost is reduced to 30 from 42 * If performed from Charge Stance, Shield Uppercut's stamina cost would remain at 42 \*Editor's Note: The stamina decrease may seem like too much, but the added guaranteed heavy should add to the stamina cost, balancing the move.\* * Conqueror's neutral Shield Bash's stamina cost is increased to 20 from 10 \*Editor's Note: The Shield Bash's extremely low stamina cost added to its spammability. So this change is intended to making it a opener and make people think twice before using it.\* Conclusion: After these changes, Conqueror becomes more focused on his Charge Stance and his Soft\-feint capabilities, instead of his Neutral Shield Bash. His soft\-feint timings become godly, to complement his non\-existent hard\-feint potential(none). His Charge Stance becomes terrifying in its own sense, like Highlander's OS, but still has its fair share of weaknesses. With this, he's solidified as a heavy: a slow, but very deadly adversary."
369,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Aramusha rework: Not just unblockables and melee attacks edition,23,8eolyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8eolyc/aramusha_rework_not_just_unblockables_and_melee/,2018-04-25 08:35:01,"Aramusha is a really unique character that's ultimately very underwhelming for two reasons. First, the options he has are limited by the fact that his offensive requires a parry or a blocked heavy to initiate, and even then he gets access to some fairly predictable and punishable soft feints. The primary focus with buffing Aramusha would be to make this area of his kit stronger without just loading it with unblockables or faster attacks. Second, over half of his kit is locked behind Blade Blockade, a very gimmick tool with little actual function in most situations, apart from punishing some unlocked attacks in ganks. Addressing these two issues while introducing some minor tweaks is my main focus going forward. Let's get on to the first change. **Increased stamina from 120 to 150** Aramusha is designed to be a very aggressive character, but his stamina doesn't reflect that in the way it does to Gladiator and Centurion. By increasing his stamina, he's allowed more to work with in terms of his stamina management, which can be very hard to manage as a feint heavy character like Aramusha. This will also help round out some other changes later on. **Deadly Feint improved** Deadly Feint is the main gimmick of Aramusha's design, but it's not all to write home about. While seeming like a fairly decent option at first, it turns out to be a detriment since Deadly Feint is always a light attack, making it very risky to use. To help with this problem, Aramusha needs some minor changes to make the options more varied. **Deadly Feint into heavy** By allowing Aramusha to soft feint into his powerful heavies, it scares people who parry in reaction to the initial flash. It also helps to keep his offense going, since Aramusha can immediately Deadly Feint again from the side if the attack isn't parried. **Chain finishers can be cancelled into Blade Blockade** The thing with Blade Blockade is that it has to be done in neutral like a parry, ultimately making it have to compete with a parry. This means that a lot of the time, Blade Blockade isn't as desirable since it has a lot of recovery. By allowing Aramusha to cancel into a defensive action, it helps him with his counter-attacking nature. Blade Blockade is also in a very bad state right now in regards to it's usability though, even with this change, so there's a general change to the move itself to increase it's viability and make it far more interesting. **Blade Blockade reworked, no longer a ""bootleg parry""** The biggest problem by far with Blade Blockade is that it's too similar to a parry and is therefore subject to the same balance issues as parries. While parries are rather safe against feints, even with guardbreak vulnerability, Blade Blockade is extremely susceptible to them. To help distinguish the two options, Blade Blockade now acts more like a ""defensive stance"" than a parry. By holding the full block button, Aramusha now assumes a stance where his indicators disappear for the opponent and he can block in a direction without having a tell. When an attack is blocked, it acts as Blade Blockade does now by allowing Aramusha to use his Blade Blockade exclusive moves. This seems very strong if left at is, which it is, allowing Aramusha to basically parry by just blocking, let alone doing so while not knowing what direction he's guarding in. To balance it out, two other changes have been made, the first being much less intensive. **Blade Blockade stamina use cost increased to 25, Blade Blockade held cost set at 5 stamina per tick, two ticks per second. Blade Blockade can now be cancelled with a side light** The stamina changes stop Aramusha from sitting in full block all match with little downside, a problem many full blocks have had in the past. The change with allowing him to cancel into a light keeps the move from being easily punished by guardbreaks, but being a light still makes the move punishable if misused. **Fury Unleashed reworked to help in team fights, Twin Vipers damage reduced to 35, Ring The Bell damage reduced to 0 and starts a chain, Push Back Kick unchanged** Fury Unleashed would be far too much damage as a guaranteed hit on Blade Blockade, and if it wasn't guaranteed it would be completely inferior to Ring The Bell. To keep his Blade Blockade variety high and also help him in an area he is lacking, Fury Unleashed is now an unblockable spin slash that deals 25 damage. This will function much like Orochi's zone, but to compensate for exactly why Fury Unleashed was changed, it's 700ms and cannot be feinted of confirmed from Blade Blockade. This stops it from being used in a 1v1 as effectively and keeps it's purpose dedicated to a group fight. Twin Vipers is already a fairly good option, and with his Deadly Feint changes 40 damage is a little too much. Ring The Bell is a very strange move right now, because it's meant to open up somebody to Aramusha's chains but instead stuns them for about as long as Aramusha takes to recovery for it. My letting it initiate his chains, this gives Aramusha a real change to genuinely open somebody up, in a different way than Twin Vipers does. Push Back Kick already relies on a positioning error and confirms fairly low damage in comparison to Aramusha's kit, so I feel it's fine. **Rushing Wind can now be charged into an attack similar to Riptide Strike by holding Back + Heavy in any direction, acts as a chain finisher** Aramusha has a lot of trouble opening up hard turtles because the only thing he has to do so are Deadly Feints on blocked heavies. This makes it much harder for Aramusha to open someone like Peacekeeper or Lawbringer who can either dodge or shove a good deal of his pressure. By giving him a charged attack that can force a reaction offensively or defensively, he's given a real shot at opening up hard turtles. Aramusha can charge the move up to 1000ms, at which point it will be automatically launched. Since it acts as a chain finisher, it can be cancelled into both Deadly Feints or Blade Blockade. **Feat changes: Rock Steady replaced with Thick Blood, Fear Itself replaced with Persistence** Rock Steady is a real problem on an already mobile character like Aramusha, and doesn't fit his character either. Replacing it with Thick Blood helps his survivability in a more fair way. Persistence is a new Tier 4 unique feat, which gives Aramusha 10 damage and 10 stamina on any attack blocked with Blade Blockade. This will help him hold off and fight groups better. **Minor changes: Chain finishers now have a larger angle of attack to help in outnumbered situations, side dodges slowed to 600ms, Blade Blockade no longer triggered by minions, HP increased to 150** These are all small changes that help compliment Aramusha's design. Outside of his new Blade Blockade move, Aramusha doesn't have much to fight when outnumbered, and Twin Vipers leaves him fairly vulnerable for a time. His side dodges are also very good, and should be nerfed because his Blade Blockade is now a very solid defensive option. Blade Blockade now has an incredibly synergetic attack with minions in the form of his reworked Fury Unleashed, and an absolutely broken tool in Persistence. By removing the ability for him to activate Blade Blockade on minions, it helps keep those options strong and for their intended purpose without making him too unkillable at B. His infinite light chain is still very good at clearing minions, however, so he hasn't lost all of his power in that department. His HP also doesn't reflect his Heavy/Vanguard typing well, and needs a bit of a raise to help his survivability."

It has been going on for multiple seasons and really hampers his fighting capability fixing this would go a long way to make him better * fix throws to stop taking additional stamina for no reason this is to fix the issue of lawbringer from being unable to do his max punishes due to the extra tick of stamina being taken away * Fix the poor hit-boxes/tracking of his attacks so they match his weapon length and the momentum he supposedly has this would go to help fix his team fighting ability allowing him to step into other opponents to either/ save his teammates from punishes. or to switch targets to further his chains * remove guard break vulnerability on his parry followups (light riposte is the worst example of this) simply to stop lawbringer from being punished for using his followups when being ganked * update his unlocked chains to match the updated move-set this is more of a minor issue since you normally don't use the unlocked chain however it should be fixed anyway to make it consistent ---------------------------- Move-set updates ---------------------------- * speed up dodge recovery to 600 ms this is a simple fix that would allow him to punish reckless bash moves and leave him less vulnerable for playing correctly * make his side lights 500 ms, and the book chapter verse finisher 400 ms as-well this would mean that his side lights wont be as easy to parry or block , as-well as upping the speed of his book chapter verse finisher would make it worth it to use as he has to go through his chain to get to it and would be a worthwhile option to use * speed up his side heavies to 700 ms and his top heavies to 800 ms Speed his side unblock-able to 800 ms and his top unblock-able to 900 ms goes without saying this would help him out with his offense as its damages would be more in line with a good speed to damage ratio ----------------------------- Longarm ----------------------------- * speed up longarm to 800 ms and reduce and allow it to count as the first part of his chains hit or wiff to keep flow going this will allow him to have an option to use it on wall-splat and get him into his unblock able much faster this also means he wont be as vulnerable on a whiffed longarm as he will have the option to keep his chain going thus not halting the flow of the fight * Make the animation/recovery(1800 for the animation and 800 ms for the recovery) to (900 ms animation and 700 ms recovery) lawbringer would still be able to land his side heavies however reducing the time an enemy is stuck in longarm would help counteract its faster speed. he should be able to land it more often * remove free longarm from guard break as stylish this is in my opinion it has to go as it lawbringer will have more ways to land it . this would also weaken his gank game abit ---------------------------------- Shove ---------------------------------- * Shove on block no can no longer chain as simple as this , he now only has a means to shut some chains down to keep pace, however this would also encourage lawbringer to try to parry followups more often and will frustrate opponents less he can still use it to drag fights on but he will not be rewarded for it as he can still take chip damage (it can add up even if its minimal) * forward shove is now 400 ms at 200-300 ms into his forward dash . as this move technically has no confirmed followup i thought it would be fair to speed it up on forward dash to catch people and give him some OOS game vs turtling opponents By making it so it can be activated at 200-300 ms into his forward dash would allow him to take advantage of his 400 ms dodge recovery to catch people who back dodge or side dodge too early much like how conq/warlord/warden can * shove is 500 ms at 300 ms into side dash this should be used as his means of counterattack and getting his shove mix-ups in vs reckless bash moves , speeding it up will also man people have to act as he is doing the shove not late as it is currently -------- Zone -------- * Raw Zone is 800 ms and now does 30 damage this zone is one of the slower zones currently and it only does 20 damage by speeding it up slightly and allowing it to do damage makes its risk a bit more worth its risk while not allowing lawbringer to spam it * zone and make way hit-boxes improved to better match the weapons animation currently his make way and his zone can clip through still opponents despite the weapon going through them ------------ Parry followups ------------ * Make way is now 700 ms it still has hyper-armor as well as do the 25 damage from parry however by speeding it up will let lawbringer to catch opponents to the side and prevent it from being as easy to block because of external parry mechanic *Make way now uses the stamina of a normal heavy as he has to parry to get make way it seems fit to reduce the stamina usage * Impaling riposte now does 10 damage instead of 20 the reason for nerfing this is to make it not as punishing for people to get parried by the law making the maximum heavy parry punish with a wall 40 instead of 50 while still a high punish its nowhere near as harsh for making a mistake vs him this also means his top heavy from light parry will see more use as it will become the go to light parry punish *Reduce the max range of impaling riposte by 25% (I don't know its current max range off number the top of my head but i know the feel of it) this is to once again tune down his parry power by making lawbringer be more aware of his positioning and to further encourage the use of his other followups * impaling riposte now uses 40% stamina (used to be 80% ) to counteract the damage change he now can use it to keep his momentum going if he gets a wallsplat instead of stoping after a top heavy ( and somtimes followup light) to recharge stamina this improving the flow of the fight ------ Chain updates ------ * make his side lights 500 ms, and the book chapter verse finisher 400 ms this would mean that his side lights wont be as easy to parry or block , aswell as upping the speed of his book chapter verse finisher would make it worth it to use as he has to go through his chain to get to it and would be a worthwhile option to use * speed up his side heavies to 700 ms and his top heavies to 800 ms Speed his side unblock-able 800 ms and his top unblock-able 900 ms goes without saying this would help him out with his offense as its damages would be more in line with a good speed to damage ratio * All block-able top heavy chains now do 35 damage his chain starters still do the same as they do now however this will reward lawbringer for landing the riskier and easier to parry top heavies * any shaft strike now counts as the first part of Swift justice/book chapter verse/judge jury executioner this is to give light riposte and his finishers more versatility as to keep pressure up say lawbringer lands swift justice finisher he can keep the pressure up after the shaft strike to reward him for landing the combo * swift justice finisher now can be used on side heavies once again to reward lawbringer for landing the final heavy in swift justice and to keep pressure on the opponent -------------------------------------------------- Add new chains as to increase his V E R S I T I L I T Y ---------------------------------------------------- ------------------- Law and Order L,L ------------------- TL 500ms (15), L 400(15) SL 500ms(15)*, L shaft strike (5)(shaft strike is a chain starter for either swift justice or judge jury executioner/book chaper verse) TL 500ms (15), L 500 (15) URL URL URL i made a rough concept of it earleir and it would not require much of a new animation but synching already existing animation by also having the top light treat the chain differently and giving it a more damaging yet not confirmed fast poke gives him options to keep the opponent from getting easy parries on him ------------------- Righteous fury H,H,H ------------------- SH700 ms (30) Th 800 ms (35) Unblock-able finisher side 800ms(45) unblock-able finisher top 900 ms (45) its an alternate way to get to his unblock-able finisher and to once again make his chains harder to predict/parry as well letting him pressure oos people abit more as they nolonger just need to simply block his first light to stop the chain this would require no new animations but would require some syncing of existing movements ------------------- Dead Or Alive HF (Cancel)&gt;L-Shaft strike) ------------------- allow lawbringer to cancel his heavy finishers into an undodgeable shaft strike for low damage but counts as a chain starter to keep pressure up and can be used as an alternitive means of a parry bait/dodge bait this can also be used to swap targets to help increase his teamfighting capability The shaft strike itself is 400 ms and does 10 damage and has a minor blind it will always come out on the opposite side of the side heavies and on the top heavies he can choose what side it comes from Dead or Alive starts right at 400 ms into his side unblock-able finisher and 500 ms into his top unblock-able finisher 300 ms into his block-able side finishers and 400 into his top block-able finishers super-armor this may require a new animation but it might not as you could blend the animation to the shaft strike ----------------------------------------------- NEW PASSIVE , Righteous Momentum ----------------------------------------------- Whenever lawbringer is using his finishers/ shove/longarm he gains super-armor and gains 25% damage reduction to help with trades this is to make it harder to knock The armored people in the game out of his moves as well as preventing reckless bash moves from stopping him from using the finishers in teamfights --------------------------- Feat Re balance --------------------------- * conqueror- Allow it to capture flags faster in tribute Currently this feat doesn't have a use in tribute despite it being use for quick captures , it would make more sense for this to work in the game mode * Harsh Judgement Allow lawbringer to use it when locked on to assassins when they have stealth active(currently does not bug perhaps?) /let it Drain 70% max stamina for its duration/stamina bar now shows whats left as well as an indicator showing you cant gain more stamina when this feat is active This is a feat unique to lawbringer but never really changed how the enemy played , by removing half the opponents stamina this would mean the target would need to be much more mindful about how they would attack the opponent. lawbringer could also use this feat on an opponent an ally is fighting to help him out or to force one to back off if they are being ganked Adding the indicator to your stamina bar would help people tell where their stamina would lie instead of guessing where its at. I'm unsure whether or not its a bug for lawbringer to be unable to use it on people in stealth at all * Righteous Deflect When activated law bringer gains hyper armor for the duration This move required you to parry your opponent in order to gain the damage reduction, however despite the damage reduction it was fairly easy to shut down him due to his lack of natural hyperarmor lawbringer often could get stunlocked out of his followups in situations where he was outnumbered with this change he would have another valid option to chose over the other tier two feats on top of letting him be a front line fighter more effectively * Juggernaut- Increase duration to 20 seconds Can now move at full speed \Guard break attempts now bounce off Juggernauts duration was pretty short and often times people could guardbreak you over and over in for allies to get free damage on you leaving the feat kinda useless for that time By causing people to bounce off it would give lawbringer some room to fight when outnumbered or perhaps work his battacks in people also would often run away because it slowed movement down where you could never catch up without canceling the feat by allowing the lawbringer to go at full speed with this feat he could keep up with opponents much better aswell as activating it before team fights and initiate into the fight * Regenerate Can now be used when sprinting (any form of attack and locking on will stop this effect) Regenerate was an underwhelming way to get health back especially in dominion where you could stand on a point to get said health back, by allowing it to activate while lawbringer is sprinting means he could me more mobile and heal up between fights to be ready for the next encounter * Pugno Mortis- Now does 50 Damage instead of 70 Reduce area of effect by 10% Pugno Mortis is a powerful tier 3 feat that explodes fast and could be thrown far with its only downside being its long cool down By lowering the damage it will punish players less for being unable to escape * Igneus Imber Reduce area of effect by 10% /Increase cooldown between bombs by 10 seconds once again reduce its damage to 50 lawbringers bombs where often a point of annoyance among many players as they can be spammed easly and are hard to avoid mid fight by increasing the cool down and reducing the area of effect it will be easier to escape and will mean the lawbringer must use his bombs more tactically while not reducing the power of the move too much * Catapult- Increase time to impact by 25% increase self damage and damage to teammates by 25% By increasing the time to impact this should allow players to better escape the ohko range of the catapult perhaps even dodge it all together, As well as making it do more damage to teammates it would mean people need to use it more tactfully as-well as communicate with teammates that you are going to use it in a fight"
372,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,The unblockable bash problem and a possible solution,28,84r1k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/84r1k9/the_unblockable_bash_problem_and_a_possible/,2018-03-16 10:29:01,"For Honor currently has a problem with certain characters being rendered useless by others, one of the big factors in this is unblockable bash type moves (conq's shield slam as an eg.), if you are playing a centurion and you get matched against a conqueror you are going to have an exceptionally hard time punishing him, its a similar story for many other characters with 600ms+ dodges w/o a dodge attack. This problem isnt the only problem however, one often proposed solution is to simply nerf unblockable bashes until they all have large recovery windows, but this brings us to the second issue, Guard Breaks. Guard breaks are simultaneously the fastest move anyone has from neutral (except PK lmao) at 400ms and also lead to the most damaging punishes available to each character, this leads means that any character can easily dodge a Valkyrie sweep, throw her into a wall (or ledge her) and ruin her life for having such high recovery. This in the case of certain unblockables like warlords or gladiators case isn't necessarily a bad thing but it causes a balance nightmare, either an unblockable is universally, incredibly punishable or its safe to anyone but assassins. So how do we deal with the fact that many characters just cant punish these extremely powerful moves even with a good reaction while others (anyone with a 500ms dodge) can simply dodge it on reaction and get a huge reward for doing so? My solution came idea came to me when playing highlander, during offensive stance he can actually cancel his dodge into a light attack 200ms into his dodge, meaning he has an insane 600ms dodge punish, this is what makes his dodging so absurdly strong (and arguably needs looking at). Not everyone needs that of course! But what i propose is that every character without a dodge attack should be capable of cancelling a 600ms+ side dodge into a light attack during the final 200ms of recovery (400ms into the dodge), this would mean that using a 500ms light would lead to a punish against any successfully dodged unblockable as it hits that magic 900ms punish number without leading to huge damage via a GB. This would also allow assassins to retain their identity as dedicated dodge attackers due to 1) how slow these new ""dodge cancel lights"" come out and 2) assassin dodge attacks maintain full GB immunity while these new ghetto dodge attacks would still have 500ms of GB vulnerability during the initial dodge, which should hopefully be sufficient for heavy feint gb to punish people trying to turn warlord into a dodge master. Thoughts on this? TL;DR Unblockable bashes need to be punishable without relying on causing absurdly strong punishes such as a dodge GB ledge/big combo therefore 600ms or higher side dodge characters should be able to cancel the final 200ms of their dodge into a light attack to give a universal 900ms dodge punish to unblockables that is fair, risky and fun. Note: Im aware Highlander and Shugoki lack 500ms lights for this to work, i think this is a fair weakness for highlander since his offensive stance is so sick and shugoki needs a major rework overall. Im also aware that you can read an unblockable preemptively dodge and get a gb punish, im fine with that since its an interesting risk reward dynamic, im purely talking safe bashes vs suckers that cant punish it at all even on a good reaction."
373,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Proper Ganking Techniques and Combos,56,868eg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/868eg1/proper_ganking_techniques_and_combos/,2018-03-22 14:01:43,"Hello All, &amp;nbsp; Thanks to u/themmeatsweats, Past mistakes and Predator for helping me out with this. Also thanks to u/FreezeTT for inspiring me with his video on ganks. Thought that it may be helpful to some of you to have a visual representation of how to efficiently and intelligently kill an opponent when you have the numbers advantage. There are certain techniques and combos that you can do to maximize your damage proportional to the amount of revenge you give your opponent. You keep them locked down long enough to kill them without giving them the chance to defend or pop revenge. &amp;nbsp; Some of these techniques require team coordination to pull off but others are very simple. The most important techniques featured are: **Counter Guard Break Vulnerability** &amp;nbsp; During the counter guard break animation, your opponent is completely vulnerable. Besides a bit of damage mitigation, they are unable to block your attacks or dodge any sort of CC moves. This means you can confirm moves like impale, long arm, shaman pounce, etc all off a simple counter guard break. So in effect, you can punish your opponent even when they properly defend! Getting as much damage out of every GB attempt as you can is important due to the large amount of revenge gain your opponent gets for countering GB's. You will see some examples in the video. &amp;nbsp; **CC/Hit Stun Recovery** &amp;nbsp; Moves like shaman pounce, raider stampede charge and impale are what are called CC moves, or crowd control moves. They pin down the opponent leaving them unable to act or defend. These moves give huge opportunities for burst damage when used intelligently, often you can one shot an opponent from full health with proper coordination. An important thing to note with many of these moves is that you have to time your attacks carefully so you dont interrupt them. This doesnt apply in the case of moves like impale or stampede charge, but it does with moves like longarm or shaman pounce. Making the most of these damage opportunities allows you to quickly and efficiently dispatch your opponent. &amp;nbsp; **Heavy Hit/Block Stun** &amp;nbsp; This one is probably the easiest to perform and has a variety of uses. Essentially, when an opponent is hit by or blocks a heavy attack, they are held in place for a period of time, unable to dodge. This is important with moves like shaman pounce, stampede charge or demon embrace that require the opponent to be standing still to hit. If your enemy is bleeding and your shaman is nearby, throw a heavy attack. If the shaman is smart, they will recognize the opportunity and pounce. No matter if the opponent blocks, parrys or is hit by the heavy, the pounce is confirmed. Even when they parry they are held in place long enough to confirm it. They can dodge the heavy, but that requires precise timing to dodge both the heavy and the pounce and also leaves them open to GBs. Essentially its an easy and safe way to confirm certain CC moves. &amp;nbsp; Those are just a few examples of the different ways in which you can help your teammates confirm their CC moves. Even when you dont have direct communication with teammates, good players can recognize when you are trying to set them up for these moves and after a couple attempts you should be able to have it down even without being on comms. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask and you can see all these techniques put to use with example combos in the video below: &amp;nbsp; URL Some great clip examples compiled by u/aceace87 URL URL URL URL URL URL URL "
374,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Why people hate option selects?,0,87waf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/87waf7/why_people_hate_option_selects/,2018-03-29 09:43:37,"After seeing some discussion about it, i feel like most of community (including here) hates it. Why? Just why? It adds complexity to game. I understand its harder punish an OS pk due to speed of her zone and lack of lag comp. But almost every class have some kind of option select. And all of them punishable. (Fuck you glad and fuck your OS zone with 0 ms vulnerability.) It gives some meaning to Heavy&gt;feint to nothing. As you know, if your opponent goes heavy&gt;feint and you fall for it, you can easily cancel your heavy to prevent punish. Yet... Most option selects are NOT cancellable. So if you go for a OS parry you are dedicated to go for it. Also different classes have different OS options. HL, Conq and Cent can charge their heavies instead of throwing immediatly. Hell... conq has more then 1 OS but every single one of them can be punished. Zerk's OS is great at defence (at the cost of stamina) but worse for offence. Nobu has different OS options. TL;DR. I understand some option selects are a little better then others. Some classes don't even have an option select. But in the end every single one of them are punishable."
375,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,[Idea] Revamping the fighting system - how stamina can be the balance of offense and defense.,7,7xktrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/7xktrm/idea_revamping_the_fighting_system_how_stamina/,2018-02-15 07:00:06,"*Greetings, warriors!* It can help, but I don't believe increasing chip damage over the board is the solution to change the fighting system to a more healthy one (less powerful defense, more threatening offense). But using stamina in a more interesting way can be the solution we need. Just throwing out ideas (is that allowed, mods?), and if there's enough feedback, I would love to make a more detailed post, with detailed numbers. *Before anything, these ideas will work much better with health and* ***stamina*** *pools increased, consider that, please.* **Topics (TL;DR):** - **Block**: Costing stamina when blocking attacks. Heavies deals great stamina damage, lights costs more than they damage, to avoid spam. Lights not being interrupted on regular block - as everyone agrees with. - **Feint and GB**: Right after a feint, **blocking** will cost more stamina than usual, making parries riskier (as of now, if you are baited to parry, you just feint and block the attack). Also, attacks have 100ms of GB vulnerability, to reduce the risk of starting chains and continuing them. - **Dodges and chains**: A discussion if dodges are indeed safe versus chains or **not**. I want to show my opinion to know your opinion and facts. - **Parry and other defenses**: We need to give every hero a special defense because they are riskier (FBS, deflects, dodge attacks, superior block attacks) and remove any damage from parry, leaving the player who parries to gain stamina only. But giving each hero a special defense needs some reworks, so I propose a short solution, removing the stamina damage and reducing the health damage from parry, also giving the player who parried stamina. - **The OOS state**: Only in this state, chip damage would be higher and **lethal**, stamina pauses when blocking and dodging, dodge has more recovery, and melee attacks don't drain stamina. Almost like the defensive meta changes in Public Test Server 2, but working better with this new stamina management. &amp;nbsp; ***A Comment about Stamina*** Stamina should be the balance element between offense and defense, attacking and defending costing stamina, and OOS state being the punish for not managing both correctly. * The idea is: blocking too much should be more dangerous, incentivizing the riskier defense (with FBS, deflects, dodge attacks, superior block attacks), while if the attacker doesn't manage his feint and mixup game, it will also be dangerous. &amp;nbsp; ##**Block** *The obvious:*  Light attacks won't be interrupted on regular block, to improve the mixups. With the idea of *light attacks not being interrupted in regular block*, basic attacks [light and heavy] should drain stamina when blocked, with: * Slower and stronger attacks draining much more stamina than their costs. * Faster attacks draining less stamina than their costs. **Comments**: Heavy attacks and chains are going to be more powerful, but you won't be rewarded for spamming fast attacks. &amp;nbsp; ##**Feint and Guardbreak** Chain openers and chained attacks should have a very small window of vulnerability (100ms) like lights have now. The counter to a parry bait shouldn't be a GB, but stamina damage. Also, there are some cases where baiting a parry from the opponent gives you nothing because they will feint and block your attack. To solve this all: * Blocking an attack right after a feint will cost an extra amount of stamina, even if it's a fast attack. &amp;nbsp; ##**Dodges, and chains** I need to make it clear the relation between using chains and dodging its attacks **(correct me if wrong)**. If someone dodges mid-chain, your next attack caught them (only not when the next attack is very slow). But, when you finish with a chain a light attack, they shouldn't be able to dodge out [but can deflect], otherwise if it's finished with a heavy attack, you can feint and GB them or parry a dodge attack, but the problem is that this mixup is easy to react, so dodging starts being safe, because if you let the heavy fly, they will dodge and GB. That mixup game **already exists**, even if it's weak, but it'll happen more often with lights not being interrupted, showing that dodges are indeed safe - preventing stamina damage AND chip damage. *So, we need changes:* * Attacks have less recovery if missed; * Dodging pauses stamina regeneration; * Backdodge have a higher recovery, side dodges needs a balanced recovery. But here comes the discussion, if dodges are indeed good, **or** Guardbreak/Parrying dodge attacks are true counters to them (in these situations about chaining attacks), making my statement in the second paragraph completely wrong, and my changes unnecessary. But it's true we need a balance between the chain-dodges mixup game, these ideas are just a start. There are other cool ideas to improve and balance chains and its counters, like making attacks post openers faster, but let's focus on parry/stamina now. &amp;nbsp; ##**Parry** As u/ConqBonk argued in a comment in this post about [*why other fighting games doesn't have defensive meta*](URL parry will always going to be a problem if it guarantees damage the way it works now: &gt;""[...] Offense theoretically can reward you a lot of damage if you get a read on your opponent, but it typically doesn't happen, because there's a bias towards the defensive playstyle which rewards the defender for *reacting* to the opponent's offense rather than reading. Unless parry is changed to have some sort of delayed startup rather than instant, this will always be the case [...]"" Damaging through defensive plays needs to be like the ""delayed"" defenses in this game:  **Full Block Stance** (Warlord, Aramusha, Reworked Conq);  **Deflects** and **pseudo-deflects** (Valk, Kensei, Conq);  **Superior block attacks** (Highlander, Warden, Conq);  **Dodging** and countering (With attacks). Because they somewhat have delayed startup, harder input than parries, or are more counterable, thus having a bigger and more interesting risk, with a balanced reward. It's a more intense and complex gameplay with Conqueror trying to damage you through these defense options than waiting for parry - that is, nowadays, too good and safe. #***It will be much better if every hero have these special, unique defenses and parries guaranteeing ZERO damage*** But we need a short solution, as giving everyone their unique defense would need some great reworks, so I propose this: **[Heavy] and [Light] Parry:**  Don't drain opponent's stamina;  Both guarantees less than 20dmg no matter what [needs balancing across the heroes];  **Give stamina to the player parrying, with heavy parries giving a medium amount, and light parries giving a high amount;**  Parry Counters that are melee attacks [Centurion, Gladiator, Warlord] wouldn't confirm health damage, but only stamina damage. Which means it needs to be a choice of what you want to do with your opponent. *This means that if you want to deal damage by being defensive, parry isn't going to be the best option (and this is pretty healthy!), but more a risky way to recover from being pressured by attacks.* &amp;nbsp; ***Finally, the powerful...*** ##**OOS state** * Your dodges - especially back dodge - have more recovery; * Dodging pauses stamina, blocking pauses stamina regen; * Chip damage is slightly increased; * **Chip damage is LETHAL;** * Parrying staggers the opponent's for a small amount of time but restarts the stamina regeneration; * Meele attacks (bashes, punches, kicks) doesn't drain stamina while OOS. **Comment:** OOS state needs to be dangerous, to the defender and attacker manage their stamina better. It will be a test of skill to not go OOS, instead of who is a better turtle. It will be an awesome advantage putting the opponent in OOS state, especially with chip damage being *lethal*. &amp;nbsp; ***I'll finish this talk with an example situation*** *Conqueror vs Warden* Warden wants to put Conq in OOS, so he wants to throw some attacks, but Conq doesn't want to lose stamina, so he will try to dodge attacks, parry, or even risk into FBS. What happens? Warden either goes to drain his stamina with basic attacks or reads that Conq is super defensive, and tries to open him up with shoulder bash and feints. Conq tries to avoid his mixups by dodging and not parrying, Warden reads that and starts throwing heavy and light attacks to put pressure him and his stamina. But Conq suddenly reads that Warden wants to do that, parry, get stamina and he's the one trying to put Warden in OOS now. So Warden needs to risk parry, or dodge, to not go to OOS, while conqueror tries to land a basic heavy, or hit him with lights, or mix up with shield bash and GBs; this and all, losing stamina on the process, and the cycle goes. **Thanks for reading!** Edit: just changing the tl;dr of blocking to avoid confusion.

I'm aware that all attacks including lights have a 100ms guard breakable window, and in fact on several occasions during this session my light attacks properly bounced guard break attempts, but having played aramusha before they fixed his light attack GB vulnerability, there was at least one occasion where it felt exactly the same as that: I saw my light animation's startup before the enemy's GB hit. Has anyone else experienced this? Or is this just bad luck with the 100ms window/lag compensation anomalies? (I experienced no noticeable lag during this time.) Most of these occasions were defensive form lights but there was one offensive form light that also got guard broken."

I would totally give the charge of the heavy superior block since he has the gb vulnerability and would enable a nice counter attack due the lack of recovery (also remove hes hability to gb from the charge) and maybe let him enter the charged heavy from any point in the chain while making him flash the attack indicator (ala highlander)"
378,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,"My grain of salt to the work Orochi desperately needs to be the fun, viable and counter attacker he was meant to",21,80igvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/80igvp/my_grain_of_salt_to_the_work_orochi_desperately/,2018-02-27 12:32:40,"Orochi main since Season 1. Eventually moved out to nobushi and pk for viability and ended up with glad. But i dont want to see my boi roach end up dusting in damiens basement. Here is my contribution! #The Goal The main goal of Orochis rework is to make him viable and fun without losing his core identity. In my humble opinion Orochi is the character that has it the hardest in the roster. Not only he is extremely unviable, but his identity as a counter attacker in a world of turtles makes him struggle. We need to help him force a reaction of the opponent so he can get to use his counter attacker moves. #New Animations gIvE oRoChI ToZEnS kiCk Jokes aside: 1. **Slip strike** Heavy soft feint. Inputted by pressing dodge during the first 500 ms of a heavy. Made for when someone baits an attack, you can press heavy for parry or soft feint into a special dodge where orochi crutches and dodges into a 10 dmg and stun elbow strike. Kinda similar to left throw. Has i frames so it dodges heavy feint into another attack. Inmune to gb during whole attack but punishable with gb on dodge. 2. **Riptide strike** Changes to riptide. Now it acts as a special parry and now needs to be inputted right before an attack connects. When orochi pulls his sword up, he actually gets to parry the attack and the attacker bounces backwards because of the force of the roach. This stuns them. (Not the effect, just they cant input any action) If the riptide didnt connect, orochi does the same riptide as always. Exactly If it did, during the stun, orochi has 4 options: &gt;unblockable, inputted by pressing R2, 30 dmg and guaranteed on light riposte &gt;unblockable stun backwards or forward throw, pretty good throw distance &gt;Unblockable, inputted by pressing R1, 25 dmg guaranteed always &gt;Feint The animation? Both light and heavy riposte have the same cool ass animation. Orochi does a top hilt unblockable attack, only parriable on heavy followup on heavy parry. 10 dmg the hilt stun and 15 or 20 depending on the followup. In the followup he grabs your hand, gets behind you with your arm stretched, and he kicks you in the elbow. 2 second animation. Sorry if i didnt express myself right, think about conqs dislocator, but the foot on the elbow 3. **Parry punish** Input gb right after a parry to do the new parry punish. Knee to the crutch and then a sick ass kick to the side of the head that stuns ofc and throws you in the ground. Allows for top lights 4. **Tobi Kadachi or idk some badass japanese name** Inputted by dodging forward and pressing gb. Roach dashes forward and does a knee to the guts. Whats special about it? You can redirect the knee to either delay it forward or do it to either left or right. This way Roach can predict the direction the opponent is going to dodge, and redirect the knee to catch them. Delaying it to forward catches rolls and backdashes, no exceptions. After the kick (that does 10 stamina dmg) orochi can flow into a omnidirectional 25 dmg unblockable inputted by pressing R2. This is feintable and soft feintable into slip strike If you dodge right, Orochi wouldnt be able to catch you on reaction, only on prediction. It does not grant a gb on dodge, but it leaves you enough vulnerability for every single character be able to punish it with at least a light. The animation would be a kick to the stomach and while grabbing the sword backwards a cool ass strike. 5. **Storm Rush** Now storm rush gets also a top attack. Animation would be orochi doing a mini jump (with one feet on the ground) and grabbing the sword backwards he would do a top strike. 6. **Onislayer** Inputted by walking backwards and pressing gb. 600ms total. Orochi does an unblockable bash similar to caber toss. He grabs your hand and does a martial technique where he kicks your knee and counts as chain starter. #Minor Tweaks 1. Storm rush now is a bit faster. 100 ms maybe. 2. Storm rush now has a top attack. Every side storm rush guarantees top lights and every top storm rush guarantees side lights 3. Storm rush is now soft feintable till the last 200 ms. Thats to prevent parrying 4. Storm rush now 20 dmg 5. Top lights now 20 dmg 6. All lights now are 500 ms. Chained or not. 7. Storm rush now has superior block on the side roach is attacking 8. 2nd chained heavy is now 600 ms and unblockable. 25 dmg and soft feintable into slip strike 9. Now wind gust tracks rolls. Well, thats it. Probably unbalanced and very difficult animation-wise but i wanted to it anyway. Feedback is appreciated, and i hope we get news about Orochi soon. Thanks for reading. "

Except when I clearly bait them I eat their heavy. I know heavies are vulnerable to gb some ms into them. I also know heavies 700 ms or lower have much less vulnerability. However I just played some games against a warlord and kensei. I baited a top heavy and gb'd right after and ate the heavy instead. Kensei's top heavy is 1000 ms so how is it that I can't gb him immediately after baiting him? Any explanations?
381,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,The Design and Distribution of Defences in For Honor,34,8395du,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/8395du/the_design_and_distribution_of_defences_in_for/,2018-03-10 05:58:20,"Hi everybody. A lot of people had some pretty engaging discussion on my last post, which dealt with the [design of mix-ups in For Honor](URL Unsurprisingly, most people seemed to agree that variety of mix-up archetype is currently too limited. Additionally, a lot of people expressed favour for the emerging ""block confirm"" archetype, wherein an attack confirms some kind of follow-up regardless of whether it hits, or is blocked. This mix-up archetype is not common as of now, but is seemingly both expected and desired from future reworks. Today, I'm going to address something inextricably linked to mix-ups; the topic of defence. As we're just heading out of a defensive meta, I have absolutely no doubt that my conclusion today will be much more controversial than those from the mix-up discussion, but please here me out as I spend the rest of this post trying to convince you that: *Defensive mechanics, just like mix-ups, need a more widespread distribution amongst the heroes of For Honor.* **What do I have to defend against?** Put simply: attacks. There are a few ways in which damage can occur as a result of attacks though, so let's summarise them briefly. If For Honor, you can: - Be hit by an: - Attack, in a direction you weren't guarding - Unblockable attack regardless of the direction you were guarding - Attack, in a direction you weren't guarding, but take chip damage - Offensive feat with a damage property (like Longbow) - Be rendered vulnerable by a: - Guardbreak - Parry - Melee bash - Melee grab - Feat with an immobilisation property (like Bear Trap) I'm not going to say much about these for now, but we'll come back to them later. **How can I defend myself?** For Honor offers a few defensive mechanics, which I shall also list now: - Block - Block counters (block&gt;Shove, Swift Recoil, Fullblock counters...) - Attack - Fast attack to interrupt - Superior Block attack to counter - Hyper-armour attack to trade - Dodge - Roll - Dodge attack - Deflect/Superior Block dodge - Special move with dodge property (Like Hidden Stance) - Parry - Revenge activation's auto-parry - Super-armour (immunity to all stagger, including that from CC, as opposed to regular hyper-armour) **So? How does this matter?** To justify my claim, that better defensive options are needed for more heroes, I will create a matrix to display how each form of damage-confirming offence interacts with each form of defence: **Defence\Attack**|**Blockable Fast Attack**|**Blockable Slow Attack**|**Unblockable Attack**|**Damage Feat in-range**|**Damage Feat out-range**|**GB/Feint&gt;GB**|**Melee Bash**|**Melee Grab**|**Immobilisation Feat** :--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: **Regular Blocking**|D|D-|A|A|A|-|A|A|A **Parry Attempt**|D+|D+|D+|A|A|A|A|A|A **Revenge Proc**|D+|D+|D+|D-|D-|D(+)|D(+)|D(+)|D **Revenge Attack**|D(+)-|D(+)-|D(+)-|D-|D-|D+|A|A|A **Dodge Type**|D(+)|D(+)|D(+)|D(+)|D|A|D(+)|D(+)|D **Block Counter Type**|D+|D+|A|A|A|-|A|A|A **Fast Interruption**|A|D+|D+|D+|A|D+|D+|D+|A **Hyper-armour**|D(+)-|D(+)-|D(+)-|D(+)-|D-|-|A|A|A **Super-armour**|D(+)-|D(+)-|D(+)-|D(+)-|D-|-|D(+)|D(+)|D- *Key:* - *-: tie, could go either way, or interaction not relevant* - *D: defence success* - *+: defence is actively rewarded with damage opportunity* - *(+): defence can potentially be rewarded with damage opportunity* - *-: defence is only partially successful, offence still receives partial reward* - *A: Attack success* Here's what I learned from constructing this table: - Dodge-based defences are excellent, and can be used to avoid almost everything. - Evasive dodges (on a character with decent recovery) outside of your opponents GB range are not punishable by anything - This is probably the most illustrative explanation I've seen yet for assassin dominance in the meta - Assuming you aren't dealing with a hyper-armoured opponent, or feats, fast attacks are also a pretty great defensive option - They are obviously slightly riskier than dodges, but still unpunishable against slower attacks if performed fast enough - This is, of course, another contribution to the assassin meta, although not as pertinent, as most characters have at least one 500ms attack from neutral - Revenge is a great tool with polarising match-ups - Revenge is an outstanding defence when activated - During revenge, opponents with no easily accessible CC (like Orochi) become significantly less threatening - During revenge, opponents with easily accessible CC (like Conqueror) barely have to deviate from their usual strategies at all - Ironically, slower heroes are typically inferior at defending against melee; an increasingly popular attack type - In duels, no character (except Shugoki) has a counter to any melee attack without dodging - Dodges on slower characters are generally worse than those of assassins - Slower characters without feats also inferior vs offensive feats compared to fast characters **So, how should things change?** Clearly, the key issue with defence in For Honor Season 5 is that defensively oriented characters typically possess worse defensive tools than offensively oriented characters. - In a duel environment, the most universally applicable defensive tools are the various dodge permutations, and fast attacks. These are tools given more predominantly to offence oriented heroes. - In a 4v4 environment, revenge is the most powerful defence tool. It has been widely observed that assassins are able to acquire revenge faster than any other class. The most commonly suggested solution I've seen from many members of the competitive community is to homogenise dodges to 600ms, and to remove any light attack slower than 500ms from the game. Without mincing words here, I think that *these suggestions represent exactly the kind of band-aid fix that Ubisoft are frequently accused of making, and that they would completely shatter character identity and interest in the game.* I think we can do better than simply homogenising the cast. By using the table above, and some other ideas of my own, I will now present a list of suggestions that could more adequately equip heavier characters for defence, without engendering the passivity of the turtle meta: **Armour should be more widely distributed** This would be implemented by distributing hyper-armour across many (but far from all) attacks in the 800ms+ range. A key element of this point is that particularly tanky characters should have some way of achieving super-armour. This would remove any preconceived necessity for universal 600ms dodges, as characters like with 700ms+ dodges could respond to incoming melee mix-ups with a super-armoured counter-attacks instead of a dodge. This would have the bonus of making slower attacks viable, in a world where the fastest attacks constitute some of the best defence. I have seen a lot of ire for the idea that more characters should have access to armour; I frequently read comments in rework suggestions that say things like: &gt; Why must people insist on plastering hyper-armour on everything? To those people, I say: - Armour doesn't need to be applied to all slow attacks. I have seen nobody propose such a thing - Armour isn't just a binary property; not all hyper-armour was created equal. It is possible to allow less tanky characters access to hyper-armour at a cost: - Lighter characters with slow moves could have hyper-armour that occurs for a shorter period of the animation, making it a less reliable way to trade - Hyper-armour, perhaps more so than unblockable status, is often only as useful as it is accessible. By hiding the hyper-armour attacks behind prerequisites, such as only granting the property on chain moves, one can make it more situational, so the hero cannot rely on it in the same way, thus feeling less tanky - Hyper-armour can be tied to move that are less safe for vanguards-type and lighter tank heroes. For example, if a hero only got hyper-armour on an unfeintable leaping attack, they gain a trading option in exchange for great risk. Meanwhile, heavier heroes can be given *safer* access to hyper armour, such as Warlord's feintable hyper-armour heavies. - The very slowest and tankiest of heroes (Lawbringer, maybe DS Highlander, maybe Warlord) could be given Super Armour on some moves. Shugoki currently gets this from neutral, and whilst I think that should be subject to change, it definitely sets him apart from the other heroes in *just* how tanky he feels. In short, more widespread armour is *not* a homogenisation move. If anything, it can facilitate quite the opposite. **Heavier dodges** This seems counter intuitive, but stick with me, and think of Conqueror for a second. Conqueror is considered highly viable, and their 800ms dodge recovery is not deemed to be a problem. Of course, this is because it can be cancelled into Shield Bash, a move that beats GB attempts, and is pretty low risk. I'm not about to suggest giving a Shield Bash equivalent to anyone else, but I do think that the concept of a slow dodge with a plausible threat is one worth looking at. Here is an example suggestion: - A slow side dodge with a stamina-intensive, chargeable, feintable, armoured melee cancel. Perhaps this many properties is a little too much, but the idea is that the dodge would be GB vulnerable for a nominal period of time (500ms, for example). The start of the melee cancel would remove GB vulnerability and trigger the hyper-armour, but also render the hero stationary. The bash would have a long duration and cancel. - A light attack would punish this move if it were to be feinted but that same light would be punished by the melee otherwise - The move would also be susceptible to melee attacks, both from a soft-feint like Caber Toss, and from a hard-feint if fast enough like Headbutt - Giving the move a high stamina cost would prevent it from becoming an optimal defence strategy, and would require the hero to think carefully about when to use it **Variable hard-feint timings** Pretty simple idea here, that of allowing some characters to choose between feinting earlier or later. - Later feints are more convincing, and more likely to coax reactions - Earlier feints are more likely to allow the hero to interrupt a reaction with their own light, even if it is slower than average Raider would be an example of a hero who would really benefit from this kind of tool. Allowing the hero to vary his feint timings on Raider's Fury would grant a more potent mix-up right out of neutral, and reduce the effectiveness of fast attack interrupts against the character. **Discussion time!** - Are the more defence oriented heroes in need of more tools? - Which tools would you like to see more of? - Do you think my ideas would be effective at balancing the game for the more defence oriented heroes? - Have I convinced you that we can get by with slow dodge recoveries on some heroes? - Can you think of any other great defensive tools to make heavy characters more viable defensively? - Do I overuse bullet points? In any case, thank you for your time."
382,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,How To Counter Shaman Unblockable Mixup,74,83q8wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/83q8wa/how_to_counter_shaman_unblockable_mixup/,2018-03-12 09:38:27,"Hello All, Shamans unblockable mixup is something I see many players struggling with and asking for tips about. After speaking with Bodrat, he informed me of a simple counter that works for MOST heroes. Basically, any time you BLOCK any shaman heavy (that includes neutral heavies, or any wildcats rage variant) you can simply back dash as soon as you see the unblockable startup. You will be put out of range for all her follow ups including the gb soft feint. The block stun is short enough that you can escape. If you get hit by a heavy though this will not work. Some clarifying information though. After some testing there are heroes that this does not work on. This works for all assassins first of all. The only heroes this appears to not work on are kensei, shugoki, aramusha and LB. other people will be looking into this so perhaps theyll discover why it wasnt working for me on those characters. Even highlander can do this. Below is a video along with explanation. Also, if your hero has a zone with 100ms or less gb vulnerability you can simply zone parry to protect yourself as well. If they follow through with the attack you will parry it, if they soft feint you will knock them out of it. Use this on a hero such as aramusha that cannot escape by back dashing. Just be sure to watch your stam. This not only allows you to avoid damage, but most heroes can even punish her in whiffs recovery. Using this renders shamans whole mixup basically useless in 1v1. In 4v4 where you may be getting hit by multiple attacks this is much less useful. In those instances its usually best to just roll if possible. One other thing of note, depending on your back dash recovery, the shaman may be able to catch you if she predicts you will do this and soft feints with a forward dash into wildcats rage in a direction you werent guarding. But it would have to be on read and even that may not work. Video: URL If anyone has any questions, clarifications or other comments please leave them below. Thanks!"

384,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Inconsistent character values need to be addressed.,66,840rvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/840rvv/inconsistent_character_values_need_to_be_addressed/,2018-03-13 13:22:17,"Dodge values, differences in bleed damage, I don't care, the inconsistency is the dumbest design choice and discourages learning another character. Biggest issue is recovery, what shit code have they written to make it so there's an inconsistency on who can be punished by Nobushi's confirmed kick from HS? Or certain things being guaranteed on other characters but not others? GB range and tracking between characters? Different damage for unlocked attacks compared to their locked counter parts? Who the hell fucked that up? That's a few I can remember off the top of my head. Anyways again, there is going to be zero knowledge of this or very little for the devs to have any urgency about and it will be fixed...next year. I'm counting how long it takes for the devs to acknowledge the CGB issue we've known for months now too. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In regards to inconsistent character values, here's the first: GB vulnerability: There are certain attacks in this game that can either be guardbroken during their attack (however far that may be into it) or not, the value of which is completely different across all characters (which itself is fine) but there are certain things like Gladiator's zone being 600ms having absolutely zero guard-break vulnerability while many other unblockable bash type moves have GB vulns somewhere in their move or throughout its entirety. Another example of this is Highlander's kick, afaik he can be GB'd after kick recovery but it's possible to do another kick that has zero GB vuln, and a lot of his heavies seem to have GB vuln 100ms into the attack or absolutely none, leading to a lot of GB's bouncing off leading you to eat a 45 dmg top heavy. GB Vulnerability during attacks needs to either exist on everyone or not exist at all. Dodge recovery: Already discussed in this subreddit, there's a huge inconsistency when it comes to being able to punish certain attacks with side dodge with certain characters because their recovery is simply too slow to get a GB off for a punish, ex: Shugoki side dodge vs WL headbutt A simple fix and one mentioned here a lot would be universal 600ms side dodge recoveries. GB on block: I only know of one attack at the moment that is unsafe on block (gladiator dash attacks) but I think there are more, or they may have been changed. Blocking is an incredibly easy thing to do, there should be no big reward for blocking an attack, that's simple enough. Reflex guard decay: Why exactly does glad have a shorter reflex guard delay than every other assassin? Totally disregarding other bugs associated with reflex guard, if we're going off balance with aesthetics like some of you suggest then there is no reason why a guy with two wooden sickles, or a dude with two axes, or a crazy bitch with a hatchet and a kukri, would have a better guard than someone with a buckler (yes I know it's not made for blocking.)

385,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,What I Would Like To See In A LB Rework,34,7vk60z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/7vk60z/what_i_would_like_to_see_in_a_lb_rework/,2018-02-06 13:26:10,"**Objectives:** -Give LB more offensive options -Reduce LBs defensive capabilities with block shove while maintaining his role as a counter attacker -Increase the viability of LBs chains **Damage Increases:** -All neutral heavies damage increased to 35 (from 30) -All chained non-unblockable heavies damage increased to 40 (from 30 or 35) -Final light in ""book, chapter, verse"" chain damage increased to 20 (from 15) -Impaling riposte damage decreased to 15 (from 20) Increasing the damage of LB heavies across the board is to more appropriately match their speed to their damage. Keeping neutral heavies at 35 instead of 40 like chained heavies is to prevent LB from having a 40 damage GB punish, which would be a little ridiculous. This also prevents LB from having a 60 damage parry punish with impale into top heavy, in conjunction with a minor impale damage nerf. With the parry changes, LB now has the highest damaging parry punishes in the game, so there's no need to further increase their damage. The damage increase to the final chained light is to add extra incentive to using the light over the big unblockable heavy, as well as identifying it more as a chain finisher. **Shove Changes:** -Shove on block removed entirely -Dodge shove speed increased to 600ms (from 700) -Dodge shove can now be activated as early as 100ms into the dodge (from 300) -Dodge shove now guarantees a light attack -Increased stun on shove mixup (300ms stun before you can dodge) -Shove mixup is now guaranteed on a blocked chained heavy The speed increase to dodge shove would give LB a viable and powerful opener out of neutral. Though slower than Conqs shield bash which is quite reactable, the overall input will be faster (SB is 500ms + 300ms dodge startup), giving it more competitive viability. Guaranteeing a light attack after dodge shove will also allow LB to punish bashes, or win a trade if he is hit during shove hyper armor. By allowing shove mixup to land even if a chained heavy if blocked, LB will be able to apply more pressure, especially against OOS opponents, and will overall buff LBs chains. The 300ms delay before you can dodge out of shove mixup is to improve the matchup against Conq (with the added delay, a heavy will be able to land against a conq if he goes for a shield bash), and as well as help heavies land against back dodges. Removing block shove is a decision for the best, as no matter how its balanced, having a move that rewards you for simply blocking an attack should not be in the game. **New Moves / Effects:** -Neutral heavies now have hyper armor starting 400ms into their animation -Chained heavies, including unblockable heavies, now have hyper armor starting 100ms into their animation -New heavy, heavy, heavy chain Giving HA to all LB heavies will identify him as more of a counter attacker and the faster applying HA on chained heavies will further strengthen his chains. The new heavy, heavy, heavy chain will also make LBs chains less predictable (currently a heavy can only be followed up with a light, making for an easy parry). It will also allow shove mixup to be accessed more easily, as it no longer requires a light to start the chain. **Recovery Changes:** -Side dodge recovery reduced to 600ms (from 700) -GB startup vulnerability on Longarm reduced to 100ms (from 400?) -GB startup vulnerability on unblockable heavies reduced to 100ms (from 400) By reducing the GB vulnerability on Longarm, the move can now be used as a prediction CGB (for example, WL dash forward GB), giving the move use outside of a gank. On unblockable heavies, LB will see opponents GBing him out of his chain finisher less often. The side dodge recovery decrease is because I wouldnt curse even my worst enemy a 700ms dodge recovery. With these changes, LB gains much more offensive options with a much improved dodge shove and shove mixup from easily accessible blocked chained heavies. The removal of block shove will also make LB more pleasant to fight, while the added HA on heavies will still give him powerful counter attacking options. Any thoughts? "

388,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Another Lawbringer Rework Idea,3,7ecgos,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/7ecgos/another_lawbringer_rework_idea/,2017-11-21 08:44:11,"So all I ever really submit to this sub are Lawbringer rework ideas (this is like my fourth one now I think), so to start off sorry about the repetition. After reading all my other rework ideas though I find I always try to overtune him or don't really take into consideration the 4v4 implications, so going to throw out some new ideas to try to keep him balanced across all modes and skill levels and see if anything sticks. Block Shove -Increase stamina cost to that of a zone attack -Does not chain or guarantee into anything OR -Remove all together Last time I said make block shove no longer guaranteed, making it usable as a trading tool, which was quickly shot down by many competitive players (understandable, looking back it was a pretty garbage idea anyways). So rather than that, massively increasing the stamina cost and not allowing it to chain into anything repurposes the move from a counter offensive attack to a situational defensive measure for stopping enemy chains. It would allow the Lawbringer to get a bit of breathing room while being pressured at the cost of a large amount of stamina, and wouldn't feel as oppressive because of how less often it could be used and no longer giving the Lawbringer an offensive advantage. I worry that having a move just from blocking just might not belong in the game however, so removing it all together I don't think many Lawbros would complain as long as they get some more offensive options New Chain! -A new shove, light, heavy chain -After a shove (dodge shove or heavy shove only; only if the shove connects), a guaranteed light with the same animation as the Swift Justice light dealing 10 damage, into a final unblockable same as Judge, Jury and Executioner So this is a much more experimental idea meant to address a lot of the complaints about the Lawbringer. His low damage heavies for their speed, shoves not guaranteeing any damage, and his unblockable not seeing enough use in most situations should all see changes with this new chain. After any heavy, the guaranteed shove into guaranteed 10 damage light would offset the low damage of the heavies. Dodge shove, though only guaranteeing 10 damage, would no longer only lead into a reactable mixup. After the light from both shoves, the final unblockable could be used to put heavy pressure onto the enemy. Its a bit of a three birds one stone suggestion, but I do think it tackles some of his issues quite well. Also, all the animations are currently in the game, so it wouldn't take all too much development time (probably). Dodge Shove -Increase speed to 600ms With the now guaranteed (though low) damage from the shove, as well as an unblockable to put on pressure afterwards, a speed increase to 600ms would be the last piece of the puzzle. As most high competitive players would agree, 600ms is the absolute minimum for an unblockable to be considered an opener. Considering that the move has hyper armor and is unpunishable by a large portion of the cast, its reasonable to put the move at that speed rather than faster. Since dodge shove also has varying initiation times throughout the course of the dodge, it would also be more effective of an opener compared to centurion's kick for example. Judge, Jury, and Executioner -Final unblockable now has hyperarmor Pretty straightforward, the move is quite garbage considering how long the enemy has to hit you out of it. Hyperarmor would help the most in 4v4s, and would give a marginal increase in effectiveness in 1v1. Make Way / Zone attack -Both attacks are considered the same, and do not hold unique properties between each other -Hyperarmor on both moves -Increased damage to 35 -Increased speed to 800ms -Increased hitbox size I've kinda accepted we aren't getting the animation in the advanced tutorial, so these are just changes to the current animation. There's really no reason for the zone attack and make way to be treated differently, so both moves should carry all the same attributes. The increase in damage, speed, and addition of hyper armor would make the move much more powerful in team fights while also giving it trading potential in 1v1s. Longarm -Only 100ms of startup GB vulnerability -Grants hyperamor -Decrease in recovery time (still GB punishable but still drastically reduced) As suggested by many higher competitive Lawbringers, having a GB vulnerability of only 100ms would allow for the move to be used as a CGB that guarantees damage, staying true to his role as a counterattacker. The recovery time decrease is straightforward, OOS enemies can dodge and GB you which is just ridiculous, though I agree it should still be GBable on dodge. The hyperarmor just makes it that little bit better in a team fight as to not be hit out of its massive animation. Book, Chapter, and Verse -Final light increased to 500ms -Final light increase to 20 damage Arguably the most useless part of Lawbringer's kit, the move is too slow to hit anyone ever and does too low damage for a chain finisher. An increase to both would address both these problems. Other changes -Decrease in running speed -Increase in health by 10 points -Igneus Imber decrease in number of bombs to 3 -Igneus Imber increase in cooldown time by 10 seconds per bomb Just a couple final changes I didn't really have a place to throw them under. The decrease in running speed, though minimal in its implications, is just a minor nerf as to the complaints to how he matches Warden's running speed. The increase in health would be to identify him more as a heavy hybrid, as the disparity in health between him and Vanguards or assassins is really only a light or heavy. This would also give him marginally more survivability when holding a point. The nerfs to Igneus Imber are also to address the ""Bombringer"" complaints, which I do feel are justified. That's about it for my ideas; can be noted very little of the changes carry over from my last document because I am incredibly indecisive nor a game designer. Even if some of these new ideas are ridiculed by this sub and I'll look back and laugh at, keeping discussion up on Lawbringer I think is important as I feel he ia onw of the characters most in need of major rebalancing.

389,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Fixing For Honor part 2: Ideas for building fundamentals,8,70s02q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/70s02q/fixing_for_honor_part_2_ideas_for_building/,2017-09-18 12:08:44,"Alright I'm back again(for the last time) with a follow up to the [previous thread](URL and this time I have tons of terrible Ideas for you guys to tear apart. This is just my first attempt at putting together something I think will work so constructive criticism is very welcome. I'm going to be basing all of my changes off of the foundation started in the other thread so you may want to at least skim it if you want a bit more context into the reasons behind these suggestions. 1) Advantage/Disadvantage -------------------------------- Implement a system that tracks player actions and buffs/debuffs them after repeated aggressive or passive actions. Blazblue has mechanics called Active flow(offensive buff) and Negative penalty(turtle debuff) that serve a similar purpose. I'm using the name Valor but you can call it whatever you want. Basically offensive actions such as landing attacks(on block and hit), landing GBs, forward dashing, walking forwards, parrying etc. would increase your Valor. Anything aggressive or risky should increase the value. Once the value is high enough the player will enter a buffed state in which they will gain certain tools to more effectively run their offense and crack open turtles. Similarly, Valor will be lost on passive &amp; defensive actions. Blocking, rolling, back dashing, walking backwards etc. And once you hit a certain negative value you will get debuffed. This mechanic can operate in the background without any sort of UI needing to be added to support it. The only thing that needs to be known is what actions affect it, how they affect it, and of course the player needs to know when the buff/debuff is active. Additionally, this mechanic can be activated/deactivated similar to revenge. This can be active by default in duels and inactive by default in 4v4 modes. The inverse of the revenge mechanic. To remain out of the debuff state both players should need to take risks and avoid passive behavior BUT players who gain Valor early on should be further away from the debuff state. Giving them greater access to the counter offensive options that come with spacing, like whiff punishment. It also would be entirely dependent on the actions of the player rather than their opponent. So, theoretically two very aggressive players could both enter the buffed state at the same time. **Offensive buffs** Level 1 * Stamina regen increase(low) * Feintable GB * Chip damage increased to 30% Level 2 * Stamina regen increase(medium) * Feintable GB * Decreased tech window on GB(200ms) * Chip damage increase to 40% Level 3 * Stamina regen increase(high) * Feintable GB * Decreased tech window on GB(200ms) * Chip damage increase to 50% * Uninterruptable light attacks from neutral **Defensive nerfs** Level 1 * Increased stamina regen delay on block, dodge, &amp; roll * slowed stamina regen * decreased back dash length * decreased unlocked sprint speed Note: GB feints will be hard feints to neutral like heavies. They will occur at 200ms &amp; 100ms before impact depending on when the feint button is pressed. **Valor gain &amp; loss specifics** Low Gain * attack with light attack(on block) * initiate forward dash(at close/medium range) * attack with bash/unblockable(on hit) Medium Gain * attack with heavy(on block) * attack with light attack(on hit) * successful GB(not teched) High gain * attack with heavy(on hit) * Successful parry Low Loss * Backwards walking * Blocking light attack * Blocking heavy attack Medium Loss * Back dashing High Loss * Rolling When idle or out of combat, Valor will slowly return to the default value. **Valor &amp; Revenge** The mechanics that determine valor and revenge should have an inverse relationship on one another if both mechanics are enabled. First off, the revenge tagging system would need to reduce the revenge gain in 1v1 situations to be 0 while still keeping the revenge gain in 1vX situations where it is currently at. Any action that currently results in revenge gain would also result in Valor gain but this gain will not take valor above the 0 it will only eliminate any negative Valor accrued. Any action that results in giving revenge would do the opposite. It would reduce Valor down to 0 but not take it into negatives. This will require a system that tracks the revenge gain of the last few enemies that you have locked on to(Within a certain timeframe &amp; If they are still within the immediate area) and adjust the valor of the player accordingly. If implemented effectively, Valor will only reach the buffed or negative states in 1v1 scenarios and revenge will only become a factor in 1vX scenarios. 2) Defensive mechanics --------------------------- * Standardize the GB vulnerability window across all heavies so that every heavy can be GB'd after a baited parry attempt. * Standardize back dash recovery to be 800ms. Assassins should be able to cancel a back dash into an attack for whiff punishment(similar to Orochi's storm rush) but over reliance on these mechanics should incur the negative penalty. * Add a stamina recovery delay of after rolling. Should be at least 1 second to account for the time it takes for the aggressor to re-engage. * HP regen on last bar of health removed * Chip damage kills * Parry changes from PTS 2 implemented. Specific characters can have parry follow up damage reduced/adjusted. Zerk's GB on deflect should have the resulting stun on the defender reduced to limit him to his faster attacks. The intention is to reduce damage off of a parry and allow pressure and mix ups to be the primary source of damage. note:Characters like orochi/warlord that are specifically designed to be counter attackers should still get good damage off of counter offensive options but that damage should not come from parries. Rather, it should come from predictive counters like trades, whiff punishes(storm rush/riptide), dodge attacks, and light attack interrupts. * Attacks initiated against a player that is unlocked will be unblockable/untechable even if the player enters guard mode to counter the attack on reaction. * GBs can not be teched when unlocked * GB tracking range will be increased against unlocked players * Sprinting towards an enemy that is sprinting away will gradually increase the speed of the chaser.(Duel modes only) 3) Neutral offensive options ------------------------------- * Standardize all forward dashes to be in the 300-400ms range * Adjust feint timings on all feintable attacks to occur at 300ms, 200ms or 100ms prior to impact. This should be adjustable depending on when the feint button is pressed. * Add soft feint into GB/Light attack on all reactable light attacks(greater than 400ms) * All heavies should track back dodges if the dodge is initiated within GB range. This is to avoid players being able to whiff punish heavies while standing directly in front of their opponent. * Fast(500ms) unblockables will not guarantee damage from neutral. Rather, these attacks will give frame advantage and guarantee an uninterruptable follow up that can be used to initiate pressure. However, 500ms unblockables will still deal damage as part of a chain. * all characters will have an unreactable light attack from neutral(400ms) that will only come from one direction. These attacks will deal low damage, be punishable on block, have a high stamina cost, have short range(shorter than GB), and will give 30 revenge to the defender on hit. Characters with good zones(like Warden, Orochi, &amp; PK) will have the 400ms attack on their zone input. Others can have a top heavy soft feint into light attack that is 400ms. This attack will not chain into any other attacks. * any characters with heavies that are slower than 700ms either need a speed upgrade or hyper armor to avoid easy reactional interrupts 4) Pressure options ---------------------- General Suggestions _________________ * All chained light attacks are uninterruptable on block * After landing a blocked attack(or on hit) chained side lights will always be 500ms and top lights will always be 400ms.This is equivalent to high/low mix ups. 400ms light attacks in chains will not be punishable on block and will be uninterruptable like other chained lights. * Blocked heavies can be canceled directly into a GB * Pushback on CGBs reduced so that defender will still be in GB range following the CGB Detailed suggestions _________________ Overall intention is to increase the effectiveness of mixups by giving more options off of a blocked heavy or blocked(uninterruptable) light attack. Mix ups available from chains starting with light attacks should be stronger overall due to the need for level 3 Valor, a successful parry, or an interrupt before you can access them. **After a blocked/landed heavy you should have the following options** All characters * Chain into GB * Chain into GB Feint &gt; Light(catches early CGBs) Character specific --Characters with unblockables on dash-- * Dash cancel into fast but reactable unblockable(will guaranteed damage on hit) * Dash cancel into GB --Characters with Heavy &gt; Heavy chains-- * Chain into heavy(raw)(max mash out punish) * Chain into heavy feint &gt; Dash or Heavy feint &gt; Heavy to reset pressure(opponent can mash lights to interrupt reset) * Top Heavy soft feint into 300ms light(100ms after start up so 400ms total)(only on top attacks)(high/low mix up &amp; low mash out punish) --Characters with Heavy &gt; Light chains-- * Chain into 500ms side light * Chain into 400ms top light **After a blocked(uninterrrupted) or landed light you should have the following options** All characters * Chain into GB * Chain into GB Feint &gt; Light Character specific --Characters with command unblockables(Back + GB)-- * Chain into fast but reactable unblockable * Chain into a slow unblockable that tracks either back dodges or side dodges(Note: Having on of each in your kit is preferred as the addition of a directional requirement can slow the opponents reactions to the other unblockables.) --Characters with Light &gt; Light chains-- * Chain into 500ms side light * Chain into 400ms top light --Characters with light &gt; heavy chains-- * Chain into heavy(raw)(max mash out punish) * Chain into heavy feint &gt; Dash or Heavy feint &gt; Heavy to reset pressure(opponent can mash lights to interrupt follow ups) * Chain into heavy feint &gt; light to reset pressure(only available at level 3 valor. Can not be mashed out of) * Top Heavy soft feint into 300ms light(100ms after start up so 400ms total)(only on top attacks)(mix up &amp; low mash out punish) **Conclusion** So, essentially you start off with your high/low/GB/GB &gt; Feint off of a blocked or landed heavy then you gain access to your fast unblockable mix ups as well. Once you have gained enough Valor to initiate with your light attacks. **On 50/50 guess mix ups** Some may not agree with me but I think with the plethora of options available above the need for a pure guess mix up isn't really necessary. That being said, I don't think they necessarily need to be removed entirely. Rather, I think 50/50 mix ups should only be effective against an OOS opponent. This would allow these mix ups to remain while still being avoidable by staying out of the OOS state. This could be enabled by simply making all 50/50 guess mix ups slow enough to be interrupted by a 600ms light on reaction(so say 1000ms) but reduce the speed of OOS attacks to ensure they would not interrupt. I'm not entirely sure how fast OOS lights are but I don't think anyone will care if they get a bit slower across the board. 5) Quality of life ------------------ * Dodge delay after guard switch needs to be removed * Attack speed inconsistency due to lag needs to be fixed * Flicker needs to be removed 6) Effects on the optimal approaches ----------------------------------------------- With the changes given above I think that 1v1 will be a bit closer to the standard set by other fighters. ""Mid screen neutral"" is effectively the situation in which both characters are near 0 Valor and they are both outside of GB range. In neutral you have three main options to approach walking in, dashing in, and throwing a heavy at maximum range, each of which can be countered. A walk in can be countered through initiating with a heavy prior to your enemy entering GB range but this can be interrupted with a light attack on a read or simply parried if your feint game is too predictable. A dash in can, of course be countered with a GB but characters with dash attacks can throw those out against players attempting to GB their dash ins. Other characters will need to catch the opponent off guard when they aren't looking for the dash in. Throwing a heavy at max range will now be viable due to the fact that you can feint your heavies to continually bait the enemy into back dodges. The opponent will then need to read your offense to avoid putting themselves in the negative state. Once the enemy has been conditioned not to back dodge on reaction to heavies you will be able to initiate with a heavy or heavy feint &gt; GB. Once you have made your approach you are either already in pressure due to landing a raw heavy or at close range after a GB tech or dash in. At close range neutral you can then continue GB pressure to bait out a light attack, counter the opponents GBs with lights, block any light attack to gain your 100ms frame advantage( which will allow you to initiate a heavy without worrying about getting GB'd during startup), attempt to parry a light on read, GB the opponent if you read a back dash, or if your opponent is turtling you can throw a heavy right in their face since they won't be able to back dodge/interrupt on reaction. At close neutral you will also have access to some basic openers with your unreactable/reactable light attack mix up and your dash attack options if you have them. Now, once you've finally landed your attack whether it be a blocked heavy, a successful light, or your bash initiator you can enter some of the mix ups I've listed above to get some hits in. Once the pressure game has started the aggressor can feint heavy into heavy to reset pressure or go for light attack, GB, &amp; unblockable mix ups. And the defender will be able to read dash cancels for GBs, read and parry any light or heavy, dodge out of unblockables to punish and so on. They can always roll out to reset to neutral, but only so many times. **Afterword** Alright that's all I've got for ideas at this point. Let me know if there are any conflicts with 4v4 that you guys notice. Outside of feintable GBs(Which are 1v1 exclusive) I tried to stay with the same types of mechanics we have already seen on some characters like warlord, PK, &amp; Gladiator but adjusting them so that rather than neutral spam they can only be used as part of a 4-way mix up during pressure. Anyways, let me know what y'all think. Edits: Formatting again"

Some character can get away with whiffing, missplaying and all and all playing unoptimally while some have no room for error at all. I'm not suggesting that Shugoki, Highlander and Conqueror should have the recovery of a PK/Nobu, but maybe don't make it so shit on top of already being worse offensive characters? Now i get that this isn't a big deal in a turtle match, but in team modes and general gameplay it's huge. When some characters leave you open while starting a heavy, ending a chain, dodging or doing an offensive move like Highlander kick compared to some that can do all that with little worry about getting punished. Maybe not an issue of the utmost importance, but just as nerfing overprefroming characters bringing up the worst of the bunch is just as important, and heavier characters being shit offensively have been an issue for too long."

Feels like that the two new characters were both added with aspects of the PTR, Highlander's being his no GB off parry, Glad's being that his heavy's GB vulnerability being only the first 100ms Obviously the best solution would to be just parry the heavy they throw out in attempt to parry, since thats what you would do against centurion, however Gladiator's heavies are 700ms, not 600. So not only does this mean that gladiator has a very small GB window for a average timed heavy, but he also has an easier opportunity to feint his own parry."

I have tried using a light to stop their guardbreak and flow into offensive stance and I keep getting guard broken. Could this just be a latency thing or had anyone else noticed this?

393,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,For Health: Foundation Work,14,6uxvhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/6uxvhp/for_health_foundation_work/,2017-08-21 05:53:35,"For Honor is a great game, but it has it's issues, no doubt about that. Ranging from mechanical issues to hero balancing to connection problems. One of For Honor's biggest issues is it's foundation; or the pillars that hold up the game. The ideas are great, the implementation could use some work. These are just my suggestions on what could be done and they have already gotten some good feed back. Any other feedback is welcome and please keep in mind none of these are a 'MUST' rather just ideas on what could be done to possibly improve the game. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Chip Damage*** So in the PTS Chip was finally increased. However, it still isn't where it needs to be. Currently it only applies on non-interrupt block attacks; meaning mainly heavies. This also means Conqueror is completely immune to chip but I'll go more in depth about that later. What should be done? - Both heavies and light attacks (even if interrupt blocked) should cause chip. This further reduces the turtle meta so that all attacks do some type of damage on block. - Increase the chip damage values and have separate values for lights and heavies: 30% for light attacks. On a 15 damage light this would be 4.5 damage. 25% for heavy attacks. On a 30 damage heavy this would be 7.5 damage. Now chip actually has a meaningful effect. This leads to parrying being more of a necessity to reduce damage. Thus leading to potential mix ups. Superior Block Counter attacks like Warden's or Highlander's crushing counter would not suffer chip damaging using them. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Time Snap*** This is essentially a lag compensation mechanic the developers made to combat inconsistencies with attacks during lag. In patch 1.09 it was removed/turned off and since than attacks (especially on console) have been wildly inconsistent. 500ms becoming 400-499ms and parrying timings being drastically changed. This change was not at healthy for the game and makes heroes like Gladiator or Peacekeeper (anyone with fast attacks) a menace to deal with; especially on console. Despite the fact that parrying was made harder because of this change. this was not the right way to go about making parrying harder. Time Snap should be re-enabled to give attacks consistency and another way should be found to make parrying more difficult; which leads me to my next point. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Parrying*** Parrying is a great mechanic. It is very much the counter that all heroes have access to. However it is incredibly easy to pull off once you master it. The window for parrying from what I recall is 200-299ms. The 200ms is where you would get the parry and the extra 99ms is essentially a safe partial parry. You missed the parry but it still does the parry start up animation to block. I'm sure most, if not all of us, have seen it happen. The partial parry is being removed according to Roman so now it would be a strict 200ms. However, how often do people actually miss parries? The window is incredibly big. 200ms is almost HALF of a 500ms to get a parry. The window should be made smaller so that parrying is more difficult and a more precise skill: - Reduce the parry window from 200ms - 100ms. This changes parrying so that instead of parrying the attack as it comes towards you, you parry it RIGHT BEFORE it hits you. 100ms is a big difference when it comes to parrying. A smaller window leaves more room for mistakes and makes parrying harder to do. Now I know console will be a concern, however, if time snap is enabled again attacks will be more consistent and it was also much easy to parry attacks on console while time snap was on. I think it should balance out. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Parry Rewards*** In the PTS all parries lead to a light attack. Now Light's are faster than heavies so they are harder to parry. With the smaller window suggested, parrying light's will be even harder. You should get a bigger reward than parrying a slow heavy. - Light Parry gives LEAST DAMAGING heavy attack (Warden's side heavy instead of top heavy) Heavy Parry gives only a light attack A little work would need to be done on the damage values of hero heavies so that side heavies have different damage values than top heavies or vice versa. For instance, all of Conqueror's heavies do 25 damage, but his top heavy his 100ms slower (800ms vs side heavy 700ms) conqueror's top heavy damage could be buffed to 30-35 damage. Separating the rewards by splitting up which type of heavy is used (left/right or top) allows punishes and rewards for specific actions to be fine tuned. Most damaging heavies (Raider's top, Warden's top) are reserved for knockdowns and/or wall bounces. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Guardbreak/Parry/Feint*** So there is supposed to be a mini mind game when it comes to parrying. Parrying shouldn't be 100% safe. In the PTS it pretty much was safe. This was due to the 100ms vulnerability time on heavies. Now the reduction in vulnerability to 100ms was a good change. However, it pretty much killed the mind game of parrying for those who don't have heavy soft feints into guard break. So what should be done to bring back that mini-mind game: implement a feint recovery time. - After a feint you cannot CGB or block for 200-300ms (the smaller the better, needs to be a prediction; not a reaction) Just like the Warden nerf of shoulder bash feinting where you are vulnerable after feinting, the same thing would apply to feinting heavies. Now there is a mind game: Is what is the opponent going to do? - Looking to guard break my feint attempt? Let the heavy fly. - Expecting me to let the heavy fly and parry me? Feint it, possibly into something else Heavy beats guard break that beats feinting that beats heavy. Everyone has access to this. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Removal of Interrupt Block Light attacks*** This one may be extremely controversial, and again not all these ideas have to be implemented but I feel strongly about this one. The turtle meta is not just due to the lack of chip damage. Currently blocking is EXTREMELY powerful because it reduces damage heavily AND it stops most momentum*. It stops momentum because most of the combo strings in the game are composed of more lights than heavies. Interrupt block negates the momentum because as soon as a light is blocked and the fight is set back to neutral. If interrupt block was removed, you could preform combo strings while an opponent is blocking (aka block strings). This makes parrying the combo breaker of For Honor. It also makes parrying more of a necessity and defensive tool than an offensive one. This wouldn't effect superior block counter attacks (Warden's Crushing Counter, Conqueror's Heavies, Kensei's dash, Valkyrie Lights, etc) or the superior block/interrupt block properties on all block. 2 Wardens are dueling: - The first Warden starts his aggression with a light, light, heavy combo string - The heavy is parried and the other Warden starts their aggreasion with a light into a heavy feint guard break mix up. - The first Warden goes for a feinted parry attempt, expecting the other Warden to go for another parry, but gets guard broken because guard break beats feinting (Rock Paper Scissors) and the combo continues. Removing interrupt block also puts more of an emphasis on aggression, than just being defensive. You can no longer be defensive and stop combos easily. You have to be pro-active in your defense; if you just block you are going to suffer damage through chip and that WILL add up if you continue to do nothing about it. Parrying isn't the only way to get out of the block string, you can dodge, roll out, etc. Most combo strings are only 3 moves long so players are going to have to be creative to make longer combos. This whole thing also puts LESS of an emphasis on openers, and more of an emphasis on mix ups because you either suffer the damage by being super defensive, or you take the initiative and counter attack using tools every hero has at their disposal: lights, heavies, parrying, dodging. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Superior Block &amp; Conqueror*** Superior Block (not superior block counters like Crushing counter) is unique to Conqueror in that it is active on neutral block. Superior Block is supposed to be immune to chip damage and interrupt all attacks and it allows Conqueror to do just that from neutral. This should not be the case. - Conqueror's passive neutral Superior Block should give a passive 10% reduction to chip damage (adjustable according to chip values, I got 10% off my values above). If it can't be done because of coding of the other Superior Block type moves (Crushing counter, etc) rename it to something like ""Sturdy Shield"" and make the mechanics different from superior block (passive 10% chip defense). Conqueror is supposed to have the strongest defense in the game and this really solidifies that role. Other idea's for changes to Conqueror can be found [here](URL --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Dodging vs Dashing*** In a previous Warrior's Den, the devs stated they thing dodging as an offensive tool. This is the reason they gave for non-reflexive guard heroes having a delay after dodging or changing guard. The devs also said this is what makes the assassins unique. All heroes should have the ability to block and dodge effectively; even more so now that we have heroes like Glad who have fast attacks but also fast unblockables that need to be dodged. This puts certain heroes (most of the cast) at a distinct disadvantage against heroes like Gladiator. Now there should be something to differentiate assassin dodges and non-assassin dodges as Assassins should have better dodges than other heroes (Assassin's vs Heavies). This would be dodges and dashes: - Dodges and dashes are 2 different maneuvers A DODGE would be defensive, while a DASH would be an offensive dodge. All Assassin's would have dashes while every other hero would have dodges. The difference between dodges and dashes are that dashes have more utility to them than dodges. Dashes have deflect property, dash attacks, dash distance and speed as well as more I-Frames. Assassin's are meant to utilize their dashes and deflect properties more than their blocking. They're meant to be slippery and weave offense and defense together with deflects. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- These are just my thoughts on what should be done to improve the foundation. I'd love any feedback and opinions! Again not all of these (or any) would HAVE to be implemented. These are just my suggestions. Cheers!"
394,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,A healthy rework of Reflex Guard,3,6vk3lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/6vk3lh/a_healthy_rework_of_reflex_guard/,2017-08-24 02:25:17,"Please do not be scared of the wall of text and read it. If you agree, upvote. If you think there's a way to further improve this, state why. Have a nice read :) Reflex Guard is a mechanic that currently stands as a nuisance for a lot of Assassin players. It truly does not differ in the way it practically works from a normal guard, although in theory it is meant to make Assassins weaker at blocking, and encourage them to use movement abilities more. Currently, because of how easily one can ""mash"" or ""reset"" the Reflex Guard, on the battlefield it behaves just like a normal guard but with the, again, nuisance of having to keep it up continuously. I have a change in mind that would increase the challenges that Assassin players have to face while simultaneously cementing the Assassins as unique and defined characters. Disclaimer: I do not mention buffs here. Most Assassins need some buffs and reworks at the moment, but that's another topic altogether. Here I am discussing the mechanic of the Reflex Guard and how it could be changed for the better. This thread is not dedicated to other sides of the Assassins' kits. The changes: 1. Remove the ability to ""reset"" the guard in the short time span that is currently possible. This is the very mechanic that allows players to use Reflex Guard as if it were a normal guard. Removing the ability to reset by ""activate guard -&gt; allow it to decay -&gt; reactivate guard"" and ""activate guard -&gt; change guard -&gt; return to original guard to reset"" would prevent Assassins from being as immune to normal hits as all other classes. 2. Set a timer to complement Point 1. This timer would cause the player to be unable to enter the same guard stance again through both natural and manual resets. In other words, if you decide to enter a guard stance and it decays, you are left vulnerable from that side for the next ~0.8 seconds. Note: This does NOT mean that you cannot attack from a decayed guard stance. It simply means you won't be able to block. Your offensive capabilities will not be hindered. 3. Blocking an attack nullifies the timer and allows another activation of the Reflex Guard. This is essential to make this set of changes work. If the Assassin actually manages to activate their guard at the right time and block an attack, their timer will be discontinued, thereby allowing them to block a second attack even from the same side. If this were not implemented in combination with Points 1 and 2, then the second light in most Heavy -&gt; Light chains against the Assassins would be guaranteed if done from the same guard, which would be a disaster. If lights were to be made uninterrupted on block in the future, that would also cause the same issue with Light -&gt; Light chains from the same side. The timer must not apply if the player blocks successfully. 4. Decide on a universal set time for guard decay. We all know how badly this game needs consistency right now, and having Assassins' guard decays be different, with these implemented changes, would probably differentiate match ups for certain characters, which we should avoid. The player must feel comfortable with their reflex guard without having to deal with ~300 ms differences between every Assassin. I recommend setting every Reflex Guard at the speed of Shinobi's, which is short and vulnerable. The guard decay of the OG Assassins is way too long and allows them to block both lights and heavies with the same activation, too often. Shinobi's and Gladiator's decay times (I believe they are the same) are much more adept for actual vulnerability. The positive repercussions: 1. Assassins will finally be more vulnerable. They are not and have never been as difficult to use as they were supposed to be, so these changes will cement them in an actual status of being the ""technical"" fighters of this game. Their blocking abilities will finally be restricted and inferior to everyone else's, which will render their play style more thematic and original. 2. The Reflex Guard will finally live up to its name. It will require good reactions and intuition to use effectively, without being an alternate version of the normal guard. It will be a unique challenge that only these characters will have to face, and it will shift their focus on different strategies to be effective. 3. Assassins will have to treat light attacks and heavy attacks differently, ""read"" appropriately for which one is coming, and respect feints more. Imagine this scenario: you are playing as an Assassin, and you are fighting against a Raider. He initiates a top attack, and you reactively block top guard thinking that a light is coming. Quickly you realize that the Raider instead initiated a top heavy, which means that by the time the hit reaches you, your guard will have fallen, and you'll eat the damage (this scenario also works with a feint; if an enemy throws a heavy attack at you, you try to block it and they feint, the upcoming light attack from that guard direction will not be blockable due to your decay). This forces you to switch strategy on the fly, and rely on another option... 4. Dodging, parrying and deflecting will become crucial. ""Reading"" a light attack and activating your guard, to then discover that a heavy attack is coming at you, will force you to do the above mentioned maneuvers to avoid damage. Each will come with its own set of weaknesses, but your game plan will revolve a lot more around these under-used abilities. Assassins will be forced to be agile (their intended play style) to stay alive. 5. Footsies will indirectly become a lot more important. I REALIZE that while reading these changes one might think that Assassins would be nerfed way too hard, but the reality is that finding yourself in a bad situation would be the result of being reckless in the neutral game, and refusing to maintain space between you and the opponent. These changes would not only make players be wary and keep their distance, but would also encourage the habit of interrupting the opponent's aggression with your own aggression if they come close to you, with say, your fast light attacks. The environment would become a lot more aggressive yay! 6. Epileptic gameplay will be SHUT DOWN. We all have met the dude who likes to allow their nervous system to take over and switches guards like a maniac. Well, such habits will be significantly weaker, as they'll leave you very vulnerable from a stance every time you switch away from it. It will not prevent one from using this technique offensively, but it will make it so that using it will decrease your defensive capabilities. This means that if you'll see someone doing this, you'll probably be able to get an unblockable light from a stance they've just switched out of. They'll still be able to parry you, of course, but their blocking will be shut down. Note: slowly switching guard clockwise or counterclockwise will still allow for all your guards to activate, but doing so fast or switching back and forth from only 2 guards will not. 7. The changes are quite realistic. Moving your Assassin's little weapons towards the incoming hit does provide a little more force than just holding them there. The guard would decay little after the animation. The changes suggested should not upset realism-seekers much at all, so I am quite convinced that they won't bastardize any philosophies or rules. On the other hand, the uniqueness of characters will be enhanced. So, what do you think? Do you find this interesting, and game changing? If you have extra suggestions, doubts, or find mechanical flaws that could arise from this system, don't hesitate to post them below and I'll consider them. If you liked the changes, again, upvote for visibility and let these devs know we want this game to make a comeback. EDIT: Clarity of some points."

These were just numbers I came up with after testing and making calculations. Feedback is welcome! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Foundation*** --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Chip Damage*** In the PTS Chip was finally increased. However, it still isn't where it needs to be. Currently it only applies on non-interrupt block attacks; meaning mainly heavies.

This leads to parrying being more of a necessity to reduce damage. Thus leading to potential mix ups. Superior Block Counter attacks like Warden's or Highlander's crushing counter would not suffer chip damaging using them. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Time Snap Replacement*** So what Time Snap did was it added essentially an inconsistent 0-99ms delay depending on how close you were to the next 100ms snap. Essentially what I've heard floating around is add a consistent 100ms delay so attacks are now as they were before Time Snap removal. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Parrying*** Parrying is a great mechanic. It is very much the counter that all heroes have access to. However it is incredibly easy to pull off once you master it. The window for parrying from what I recall is 200-299ms.

Separating the rewards by splitting up which type of heavy is used (left/right or top) allows punishes and rewards for specific actions to be fine tuned. Most damaging heavies (Raider's top, Warden's top) are reserved for knockdowns and/or wall bounces. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Guardbreak/Parry/Feint*** So there is supposed to be a mini mind game when it comes to parrying. Parrying shouldn't be 100% safe. In the PTS it pretty much was safe. This was due to the 100ms vulnerability time on heavies. Now the reduction in vulnerability to 100ms was a good change.

Currently blocking is EXTREMELY powerful because it reduces damage heavily AND it stops most momentum*.

Warden's top light Crushing Counter has Superior Block on start up. Kensei has it on the side he is guarding while dashing. Valkyrie has it in any direction she dashes. However, Superior Block (from my experience) only effects Heavy attacks. This is what allows assassins to parry something like Highlander or Warden's crushing counter if it's off a light attack; the recovery is quick enough to parry and Assassin's can parry right after recovery. Superior block should effect both light and heavy attacks. This is would allow ALL superior counter moves to actually hit and not just ones that are unblockable or off heavy attacks. Now that superior block is only for counter attacking (removed off Conqueror's normal block; see the Conqueror notes below) it makes sense to allow it to effect all attacks, not just heavies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Dodging vs Dashing and Dodge Recovery*** Non-reflex heroes cannot switch guards after dodging or vice versa. All heroes should have the ability to block and dodge effectively; even more so now that we have heroes like Glad who have fast attacks but also fast unblockables that need to be dodged. This puts certain heroes (most of the cast) at a distinct disadvantage against heroes like Gladiator.

Dashes have deflect property, dash attacks, dash distance and speed as well as more I-Frames. Assassin's are meant to utilize their dashes and deflect properties more than their blocking. They're meant to be slippery and weave offense and defense together with deflects. Dodge Recovery should be the same throughout the cast; 500ms for all (or 600ms if 500 is too small). This makes dodging safer and a more valid option; especially for assassins who are supposed to be using deflects. You don't see many deflects because of how unsafe dodging is. The only concern is making sure dodging doesn't become over powered with the feint recovery change. Maybe 600ms for Non-reflex heroes, 500ms for assassins? It would be a small difference, but it should work out. If you want different classes to have different dodges, you can use distance to differentiate. Heavies: Shortest, Vanguards: Medium, Assassin: Longest Hybrids: Variable based no type of hybrid (Lawbringer Short, Valkyrie Medium, Nobushi Long) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Hero Changes*** ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Warden*** The first 2 [attacks](URL would essentially be semi charged heavies. - The first swing would be semi charged Heavy and the second swing would be normal follow up Heavy. A semi/partial charged follow up Heavy would essentially look like a semi charged heavy (1): a wild one handed swing). - [Warden's Oath](URL . - A fully charged heavy. Simply hold down Heavy. Unblockable and hyper armor attributes would not be added to the move until the wind up (charging) is done and it reaches the fully charged state and the move begins. - Top Heavy Warden's Oath is 1200ms with attributes coming in at the final 300ms - Side Heavy Warden's Oath is 1100ms with attributes coming in at the final 300ms - [Stabbing Charge](URL - Leads to a thrust that pushes forward, a lot like Lawbringer's impale. Just take away the animation at the end so we don't have cut scenes like Centurion. Just like a fully Charged Heavy no attributes would be added to the move until the wind up is done and the fully charged move begins. The push back would be shorter than Lawbringer's for balance purposes (maybe half as far?) but slightly further than Warden's throw as to give it purpose. - That stab would only be dodgable, not parryable; rewards guard break on dodge - The stab would do 25 damage damage and would not reward a heavy off wall bounce, only a light attack - serves as a way to get into his shoulder bash mix up - Stabbing Charge is 1400ms from a heavy follow up with attributes coming in at the final 300ms and is 700ms from a dash heavy with attributes coming in at the final 300ms There are 2 ways this move could be preformed: - The first would be to make it a fully charged follow up heavy. *OR* - A forward dash + Heavy would lead to a Stabbing Charge. The preferred way would be to give Warden both of these options to preform the Stabbing Charge. Much like how he has 2 ways to go into his shoulder bash: Light into shoulder bash, or dash into shoulder bash. - [Warden's Fury](URL In an early build of the game, Warden was doing what looks like a Heavy into a Light. It was a slash into a Mortor stroke. The light could be combo-ed into a shoulder bash mix up. The follow up light would be 500ms-600ms. *Buffs* - Remove free guard break on zone block - No attack should ever reward a guardbreak on block; not to mention peacekeeper's and warlord's zones are MUCH better than Warden's and are safe on block *Nerfs* Warden really doesn't need any nerfs, he is pretty good where he is after all the nerfs he received. However, a lot of people still disagree with the shoulder bash/guard break mix up. Mostly because he is the only one who can do it. While at one point I did agree, I learned to counter it. However, I do have a suggestion to remove the guard break off shoulder bash, but still keep shoulder bash viable. - *If guard break off shoulder bash was removed:* - remove charge time for level 1 shoulder bash from neutral; so it acts like other openers (flows with dash) - Keep the level 1 shoulder bash charge time off shoulder bashes after light attacks (light attack, 600ms for level 1 bash) this stops vortex from being broken - replace level 2 shoulder bash with level 3 shoulder bash, (hyper armor and top heavy reward) - level 3 shoulder bash would have the charge up time of the fully charged shoulder bash in the story mode - increase feint window of shoulder bash from 400ms to 600ms This would be a slight nerf to warden's potential shoulder bash damage; all he would get off a uncharged shoulder bash is 2 lights, instead of the potential guard break into side heavy or top heavy with a wall bounce ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Raider*** - *Opener* - **Hilt Strike** A hit with the butt of the ax. Runs forward and does something akin to an [this](URL Can only be done from forward dash. *Nerfs* - Stampede Charge start up reduced from 300ms to 500ms - Stampedge Charge as it currently is, is way to fast for how good it is. - Either reduce the stamina drain on stampede charge/fireman carry or reduce the damage off wall bounce - The amount of stamina drain you get off a stampede charge or charge from guard break is incredibly high (it's like centurion's entire purpose in one move); coupled with the high confirmed damage off either a wall bounce or straight throw into knockdown makes the move too devastating if landed. Either reduce the confirmed damage, or reduce the amount of stamina drain (preferred) - Increase Stamina drain on Raider while using Stampede Charge - For the amount of stamina it drains, next to nothing (if anything) is drained from Raider, look at Lawbringer's impale ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Kensei*** - *Opener* - **Knee bash** (600ms) Kensei launches forward into a rising knee [straight into the enemy's jaw](URL The elbow coming down would either be kensei's elbow or the butt of the hilt. Applies blinding effect. Can only be done from forward dash and gives a top light(?)(balance purposes) - Kensei can soft feint his heavy into a light in any direction - If the light is blocked it counts as 1 part of his chain, if it lands, it counts as 2 parts of his chain meaning he can go directly into his unblockable if it lands. - Kensei can soft feint his heavy into a guard break - Kensei is meant to be the soft feint master of the game - Kensei can soft feint his hyper armor side heavy by dashing - This applies to all hyper armor side heavies; including the soft feinted one from his unblockable (soft feint into a soft feint) *Buffs* - Increase the speed of all dash attacks - Anyone with basic parrying skill can pretty easily shut any of kensei's dash attacks. They are also one of his best ways to get to his unblockable mix up so make them a little better. - This will also allow Kensei to get his dash attack in if he he dodges in the direction of an attack with his superior block up - Increase the speed of his unblockable - Against really good players, Kensei will either be knocked out of the unblockable, or it will be reaction parried after the feint window ends. Speed it up so it's more of a reliable mix up. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Conqueror*** - (Passive) Bonus 10% on chip damage (Replaces neutral Superior Block) - The flail was generally meant to get around defenses and do damage through blunt for trauma. Conqueror's attacks should reflect that by giving him a small bonus to his chip damage - (Passive) Bonus 10% chip defense (Replaces neutral Superior Block) - Since conqueror is meant to have the best defense, he would get a natural 10% chip damage reduction. This solidifies his strong defense role. - Attacks on all-block lead to confirmed heavy shield bash - This gives more use to all block other than just blocking - Follow up heavies and heavy finishers can charged. - Fully Charged Heavies become Unblockable - Uncharged Chain finisher heavies have hyper armor (only after a minimum of 3 consecutive light attacks (even if blocked); shield bash into light counts as 2 attacks) - Charged heavy chain finishers have hyper armor AND are Unblockable *Buffs* - Buff light damage from 15 - 20 damage (adjustable) - Conqueror is a heavy hitter, he should hit like one; also synergizes with his passive 10% chip damage boost (using chip numbers suggested above: 20 * (.30+(.10)) = 8 chip damage) - Follow up light after shield bash is 15-17 damage instead of 20 - Buff Top Heavy damage from 25 - 35 Damage - Buff Side Heavy damage from 25 - 30 Damage - Speed up heavy shield bash follow up after heavy attacks and from all block - The heavy shield bash is EXTREMELY slow will almost NEVER hit. Speed it up and give make it more of a threat. - Superior block on Conqueror's heavy constantly lands - I'm sure many conqueror players notice that more often than not their superior block heavies often GET blocked, this should not be the case. - Remove the stamina regen penalty from all block - There is literally no reason for this *Nerfs* - Parrying a light should punish the conqueror - In the PTS, parrying a conq light gave nothing, a parry should always reward something - Increase the stamina cost of Shield Bash - Right now you can do 12 shield bashes in a row without a follow up light, and 7 in a row with a follow up light; that's a ridiculous amount of times. Currently, it's warranted with how weak Conqueror is, but with these buffs shield bash should have a higher stamina cost so it's not spammable CC. (7 times without follow up light, 5 times with follow light maybe?) - Remove Conqueror's passive superior block on normal blocks and replace it with the aforementioned passives - Removes his ability to get a guard break on heavy block - Dodging Light Shield Bash rewards a guard break unless it's followed up by a Light attack ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Warlord*** - [For Vallhalla](URL - Gudmundr has what could be said is a charged heavy attack. This would NOT be unblockable, but it would have hyper armor once fully charged (this is because it has an unblockable follow-up). Only CHARGE UP would be feintable. But the fully charged heavy would not be; you would have to commit. - Side heavy charge is 1000ms with hyper armor at 900ms, top heavy charge is 900ms with hyper armor at 800ms - The uncharged heavy would still be feintable - If the charged heavy is dodged, it leads to a guard break (Unless it was a charged heavy (1) in Hack and Slash, then it could be followed up with a light) - The follow up light in Warlord's Hack and Slash string (Heavy, Light) would still be an option after a charged heavy. Either shield uppercut, or light attack. - Warlord would be able to charge the heavy in Focused Strikes (Light, Heavy). The Shield uppercut can be preformed after this heavy, however, unlike Hack and Slash, a light could not. The shield bash would be Warlord's only follow up option after Focused Strikes. - [Shield Uppercut](URL - Off a normal heavy (not charged) the bash cannot be done if the heavy is blocked, but can be done if the heavy lands. If the heavy is charged, the bash CAN be done on block, but it is dodge-able and punishable by guard break, if the Warlord doesn't follow up. - Bash is confirmed on Charged heavy hit, but not on uncharged heavy hit - [Odin's Lightning](URL - After the bash, Warlord can follow up with another heavy (can be charged). Much like the first heavy, only the uncharged heavy and CHARGE UP could be feinted. This heavy would also only have hyper armor if fully charged. - Frame data same as 'For Vallhalla' - The follow up heavy (charged or not) can negate the potential guard break from the shield uppercut. If your opponent reads you however, you can be punished by parry or another dodge - Can be done in any direction, not just top - If Odin's Lightning is dodged, it's a free guard break - Further more, this little combo has A LOT of mix up potential if the charged heavy is started on Heavy (1). Charged Heavy (1) into either: the light attack or the shield bash. *** - A lot of people agree that Warlord should not have Hyper armor on his heavies and I agree. However, the hyper armor could be implemented to only be on the fully charged heavy. Almost all charged heavies in the game have the unblockable attribute, since this wouldn't, it makes sense to at least give it hyper armor. If a Warlord reads an attack coming, he can charge a heavy to go into a mix up. *Nerfs* - Remove hyper armor off normal heavy attacks - Changed to charged heavy attacks - Slow down headbutt or increase stamina cost - With how well it flows out of dash and how spammable it is it shouldn't be as fast as it is. Slow it down by about 100ms to make it 600ms, in line with the other openers, or increase the stamina cost - Reduce zone tracking - The zone tracks like Centurion. It is near impossible to dodge because it will track you through any dodge. Warlord is not meant to have a tone of range like nobushi's zone. The speed and damage would be fine if it didn't have so much range and tracking. - Lights from 500ms - 600ms - Warlord is a heavy class, but has some of the fastest lights in the game (on par with peacekeeper, an assassin) - Dodge recovery nerf - If dodge recovery is not made standard across the cast, then nerf Warlord's dodge recovery. He is a heavy and shouldn't have the best dodge recovery if everyone else doesn't as well. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Shugoki*** *Opener* - **Bodyslam** A straight up body slam. A small charge forward. I think it fits shugoki really well considering his size. Can only be done on forward dash. - Allow follow up heavies to be charged - (Heavy into Charged heavy) or (Light into Charged heavy) - Headbutt should be allowed on follow up attacks; currently you have to headbutt off the first attack - (Heavy into light into headbutt) or (Light into heavy into headbutt) - Oni Charge knocks down OOS opponents - Currently Oni Charge is useless unless you are on a bridge - Allow the soft feinting of follow up heavies into Demons embrace *Buffs* - Decrease recovery of the fully charged heavy - As it stands, if you use the fully charged heavy on a knocked down opponent, it's a free guard break for them - Remove the 25% damage debuff while Shugoki's hyper armor is deactivated - When Shugoki's hyper armor is deactivated through guard break or other means, he takes 25% more damage. This effectively gives him as much health as peacekeeper. Remove this debuff to solidify his role as a tank - Decrease the Shugoki's recovery after headbutt - After headbutt you are frozen for about a full second or two and are unable to add pressure on the stunned opponent. This effectively makes the stun useless and renders headbutt as a mere stamina draining tool - Give Shugoki's Zone heavy/execution damage - He's meant to be a hard hitter and his zone is pretty slow. - Reduce the stamina drain on charged heavy parry - As it stands currently, a single parry on Shugoki's charged heavy leads to instant OOS, with the upcoming OOS changes, one parry should not lead to OOS - Guard break no longer removes hyper armor, only a landed attack removes the hyper armor - This effectively makes shugoki's hyper armor useless because of how easy it is to negate it - Demon's embrace speed increased from 1200ms to 1000ms - Demon's embrace no longer consumes hyper armor - With the amount of damage he takes on miss, it's a bit much to remove this as well - Damage reduced while in Demon's Embrace - In team fights you can effectively take more damage than you heal during the animation *Nerfs* - Demon's embrace no longer confirmed on wall bounce - This is a bit much for shugoki and is only valid currently because of how weak he is, Demon's embrace should be a team fight or trading tool based on reads ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Peacekeeper*** *Opener* - **Backflip kick** Essentially the same as her forward throw. Peacekeeper charges in a direction and does a backflip with her foot landing on the opponents chin. Side dash attacks would essentially be a bicycle kick. If she dashes right, she would turn to the left as she dashes and back flip kick into the side of the opponents face. Can be preformed off forward and side dashes. - Allow us to change the direction of Dagger Cancel (Heavy into light soft feint) - Currently, dagger cancel locks you in the direction you did the heavy. This pretty much reders it useless ad the parry timings for the heavy and the dagger cancel nearly line up. Not to mention blocking negates the entire thing. - Make dagger cancel 500ms so it's not over powered - Allow soft feint into guard break off any heavy - Currently, Peacekeeper can only soft feint her FIRST heavy into guard break; if you allow her to soft feint any of her heavies in any of her chains, there is more use to them and you may see more than just light spam, especially with the feint changes - This would be no different than Centurion, except Peacekeeper would have a must stricter timing because she can't charge her heavies - Allow dash cancel off any heavy *Buffs* - Top heavy damage increased from 33 damage - 35 damage - Side heavy speed increased from 800ms - 700ms (to make up for the small damage nerf) *Nerfs* - Slow down the speed of her zone from 400ms to 500ms - Now that Peacekeeper would have an opener, she has no need for such a fast zone to open up players - Follow up light reduced to 500ms from 400ms - With interrupt light on block removed and parrying being made harder, having a 400ms follow up would be a bit too powerful - Increase the recovery on zone cancel (like nobushi) - Zone cancel recovery is instant on peacekeepers zone; with how fast and good it is, it shouldn't recover as quick - Side heavy damage decreased from 33 damage - 30 damage ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Berserker*** *Opener* - **Lariat/Haymaker/Hook** A straight up swing. Fits zerk really well with his reckless style. Can only be done off forward dashes. - Turn Top Heavy Finisher into a feintable Unblockable - Many berserker mains have been asking for this and I agree, the top heavy finisher should be unblockable. It's too easy to mitigate most of the damage just by blocking and considering the potential risk a berserker takes to get to his top heavy, I think it's warranted. - The top heavy would become unblockable ONLY after a minimum of a 2 chain hit (signified by the same red glow conqueror has on his fully charged heavies) - Either his Light, Heavy chain into top unblockable, his Heavy, Light chain into top unblockable, or his triple heavy chain with the last heavy being unblockable if it's done from the top - This would be for balance purposes as being able to do a 500ms light into a high damaging top heavy unblockable would be too much - Berserker should be able to soft feint any of his attacks in his infinite chain by dashing (besides his Top Heavy Finisher) - Berserker is meant to string many attacks together and flow in his chains; like a bladedancer or a river. Keeping up a relentless assault while reacting to the opponents actions. However, currently, all a berserker can do is soft feint the first attack he does or the heavies in his infinite chain. Change this to both heavies AND lights and berserker now has the ability to flow through his chains and truly be an unpredictable relentless *Buffs* - Top Heavy Damage buffed from 38 Damage - 40 damage - Side Heavy Damage buffed from 33 Damage - 35 Damage ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Orochi*** *Opener* - **Windmill Kick** Tozen has a [kick](URL in the story mode that would make for a GREAT orochi opener. Slow it down a bit, remove the hyper armor and knockdown, and remove the taunting Tozen does so you can get in a light attack, and you have a unique looking opener for Orochi. Can only be done from forward or side dashes. - [Form of the Dragon](URL - Tozen has a type of all block or all parry. This would be a unique feature to the Orochi in that he would be the only assassin to have a type of all block. - This would be done just like all block, hold back on the guard stance. - As to not render normal parrying useless, if a player can bait out orochi's all parry, he is vulnerable to a gb so there is now risk to using it. - Functions just like conq or warlord all block in that there is a slight delay to activation so it is not a reactive tool - Drains stamina during use - If someone hit's the all parry, you can go right into Windmill Kick or Sky Strike and thus a mix up. - [Sky Strike](URL - Orochi can cancel out of Form of the Dragon directly into an unblockable -The direction can be changed by change the direction of the attack and hitting heavy at the same time as to not make it too predictable. - Speed it up a bit because it is incredibly slow - make it feintable for mix up potential. - Twister Cuts - A Light, Light, Heavy chain - Gives a little bit of synergy with his confirmed double top light - Double top light -&gt; feinted heavy into either another double top light, guard break, zone attack, opener, all parry unblockable. Having a feintable attack after the double top light would give Orochi access to a few more mix ups. *Buffs* - Speed up Orochi's side lights and follow up lights to 500ms - All assassins light attacks are 500ms, Orochi's should be the same - Speed up storm rush - As of right now there is almost no point to storm rush. Even if you read an opponent and dash back into it to dodge their attack, chances are they will recover fast enough to the point where they can just block storm rush - Increase the Damage of riptide strike to give it more use and make it feintable - Riptide strike is meant a prediction tool, much like nobushi's hidden stance; thing is it doesn't do enough damage to warrant it when deflecting or parrying gives more damage and is much easier. - Increase the speed of riptide strike - There have been times I have successfully dodged a move with Riptide strike, only to have it either blocked, parried, or deflected because of how slow it is. You should be rewarded for making a read, not punished - Increase speed of Zeypher slash, lightning strike, and crashing wave (running heavy) - Against anyone with basic parry skills, these moves are almost useless, speed them up a bit in order to have them be useful dash attacks *Nerfs* - Reduce the damage of his double top light - Orochi's double top light does heavy/execution damage. Instead, it should function like warden's double side light in that it does less damage than 2 different lights that aren't confirmed - Warden's light attacks and double side light's function like this: ( (double side) 24 damage total for 2 hits out of neutral 15+9, Side into top is 15+15=30 since neither are confirmed) Orochi's should function similar so it's not lethal damage off a confirmed follow up. *** DamnNoHTML had a GREAT [post](URL awhile back about Orochi and what could be done with his current moveset to make him more viable! Since this post is essentially a mass moveset expansion post, I thought it would be good to include a link to his post! ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Lawbringer*** - Allow Lawbringer to start a feintable impale if the final light is a side light in Book, Chapter, Verse (Light, Heavy, Light) by hitting heavy after the final light attack - This would give actual use to Book, Chapter, Verse as it currently has NONE when compared to something like Swift Justice (Heavy, Light, Heavy) that can go into a Riposte if the final heavy is from the top. - This would function just like the Riposte after Swift Justice, just instead of the light attack button, it would be the heavy attack button - Hyper armor on heavies - Lawbringer is clad in armor and has a giant pole ax that has a ton of momentum behind it, it makes sense he would have hyper armor - From a balance perspective it also makes sense since his heavies are pretty slow when compared to other heroes *Buffs* - Increase Lawbringer's top heavy do 40 damage, and side heavies to 35 damage (Top Heavy is 900ms and Side Heavy is 800ms, why do they both do the same damage? 30 currently) - Law bringer actually has some of the weakest heavies in the game currently. Considering his design, he should do more damage with heavies - Increase the speed of the final light in Book, Chapter, Verse from 600ms to 500ms. - In order to make the light in Book, Chapter, Verse useful, it has to be the same speed as the light in Swift Justice - Increase the speed of shove from 700ms to 600ms - No competitive player is going to be hit by shove out of neutral, it's too slow. Speed it up to make it more of a threat **Shove Changes** - Shove guarantees a light on hit (not dodge-able) when used from neutral - This essentially removes the mix up and more potential damage in exchange for confirmed damage - Shove mix up no longer reactable (shove post heavy hit) - Speed up the light so it becomes a true mind game mix up, in competitive play, the shove mix up is reactable; however, nothing would be confirmed *Nerf* - Remove shove on block - If shove is made a true mix up, or confirms a light, having it off block would be too much. Plus having shove on block re-enforces turtling ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Valkyrie*** *Opener* - **Shield strike** A little different from Conq's shield bash. Valk lurches in a direction and instead of charging forward into a bash, she swings the shield in a horizontal fashion to the opponents face, or upwards vertical if she dashes forward. - Applies a blind effect (ala Centurion kick or Stunning stap). - Can only be done from 3 dash directions: forward, left and right. The reason it can't be done from a back dash is she has her all block there. - Openers combo into her side dash attacks. - Valkyrie would dash to the side and smack the opponent with her shield horizontally (her opener from a side dash) if it lands, doing a light attack will make Valkyrie flow right into a confirmed dash attack. If the dash attack is done AFTER a side dash opener, she can either follow up with a light or a spear sweep directly after the dash attack. Or she can guard break much like she does currently. - Her forward dash opener could be followed up into a confirmed light into the same mix up above. - Forward dash opener, into light (NOT THE DASH ATTACK), into mix up *Buffs* - Top Heavy Damage buffed from 25 Damage to 30 Damage (800ms) - Side Heavy speed increased from 800ms - 700ms (25 damage) - Remove free guard break off dash attack block ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ***Nobushi*** *Opener* - **Naginata Kick** Just allow her to use her kick from neutral. If she dashes forward it does the normal kick animation. If it's a side dash, she does something similar to Shinobi where she does a mini round house using the Naginata as a lift kicking in the direction she dashes. Whether the neutral opener would lead into a bleed or not, I have no idea. Probably not as that may make her opener too strong, but who am I to say. Can be done from forward or side dashes. - Give Nobushi dashes instead of dodges - As exlained above, dashes are essentially offensive dodges. Nobushi is meant to be the Hybrid Assassin, she should have better dashes than the rest of the hybrids to solidify her assassin role. - Kick follow up after any attack - Attacks like Cobra Strike and Viper's Retreat cannot be followed up with kick. It feels weird and out of place to not be allowed to use kick after these moves for a potential mix up. - Attacks with bleed on them apply 5 bleed on block - (not stackable: can't reapply until it has run out and a potential time limit until reapplication) - Way of the Shark passive applies to chip (only 10% instead of the normal 20%) - Synergizes with 5 bleed damage on block. Puts a strong emphasis on parrying Nobushi instead of just letting her hit you *Buffs* - Reduce stamina cost of hidden stance - Increase kick speed from 800ms to 600ms (both opener and follow up) - Nobushi's kick is MEANT to be part of her mix ups. However, it is SO slow, it will never hit against anyone competent, even if someone delays the kick. Speeding up the kick allows it to be used in more situations and more mix ups. - Sidewinder Form Speed increased to [100ms]+500ms from [100ms]+600ms (Essentially makes it 600ms instead of 700ms) - the [100ms] is the minimum dash time until the move can be preformed - Cobra Strike increased to [100ms]+400ms from [100ms]+500ms *Nerfs* - Dodging Kick rewards a guard break unless it's follow up with a light attack"
396,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Should Blocking/Guarding Have Its Own Manual Input? Examples Provided!,3,6p0nhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/6p0nhc/should_blockingguarding_have_its_own_manual_input/,2017-07-23 20:27:59,"EDIT: Formatting and rephrasing of long-winded sentences for better flow. As the title reads, should blocking/guarding have its own manual input? This would mean blocking would have a button assigned to it, or something similar to that of holding 'back' in a 2D fighting game. *I have stated this in other threads I've done: I do not claim that my ideas are the greatest or are perfect in any way, and are simply suggestions that could pave the road for better gameplay after extensive appropriate tweaking is done.* Unlike other fighting games, For Honor uses an automatic guard stance system similar to that of The Legend of Zelda. So long as you are locked on to your target, you are blocking- just with the addition of 3 different guard stances thrown into the mix. Thing is, this isn't The Legend of Zelda. Over and over again, the fact that a player can simply hold their guard continuously has fueled the ire of many people who play For Honor. I have always felt that the automatic block that For Honor uses is a core problem with the gameplay. The problem with this system is that it has caused a large majority of the issues that For Honor faces when it comes to one of fighting game's oldest golden rules: **Attack&gt;Throw&gt;Block&gt;Attack.** **What this simple doohickey reads is, an attack will be higher priority and interrupt a throw (in this case, a Guard Break), a throw/Guard Break(GB) will bypass the guard of someone who is blocking, and someone who is currently blocking will take no damage or receive significantly less damage from attacks.** Because blocking is an automatic thing in For Honor, GB cannot have the property of bypassing block. If it did, the only way to avoid being guard broken would be to throw an attack on reaction to an incoming GB. This is not ideal, as we already have parries being a questionable system that offers more reward for less risk (largely due to automatic blocking being a thing, as many players have pointed out in the past). As most players know, in the current form of For Honor's gameplay, GB is largely used for either punishing dodges or for use immediately after performing a successful parry. The problem with this in particular is that not all characters share the same type of dodge. Because not all characters share equivalent dodges (or equivalently useful dodges, such as a step vs a roll vs a teleport in other games), characters like Warden will dodge significantly less, or almost never dodge unless prompted to by an Unblockable. With the upcoming PTS2 changes, Guard Break will see even less usefulness due to the fact that characters will not be stunned long enough after a parry to perform a Guard Break. While this is a great thing, reducing the reward players will get from a parry (including removing free ledging from parry), Guard Break will now only be useful when someone dodges unless your opponent is poor at perfoming CGBs. If your opponent is already poor at CGBs from neutral, this change wouldn't make a difference anyway. Every attack is also going to get a 100ms vulnerability window (not just heavy attacks) to Guard Break after the changes, but we have yet to see how well that will pan out. **If we were to assign blocking to its own input, GB could be given the property to be untechable (CGB, in this case) if someone uses GB on a manually blocking opponent- allowing it to be more useful in a traditional fighting game sense.** This would make blocking attacks more skillful, involving the player knowing when an attack is coming. I know what you're thinking though, *""wouldn't people just hold down block until they need to attack or a GB is coming?""* **Here's why they wouldn't, and I've provided multiple examples of possible alternatives to the current system:** **Look at Super Smash Brothers for example**, where shielding (basically blocking) has its own duration that drains the longer you hold it down. Furthermore, the shield can break causing the player to be stunned briefly if they take too many attacks in too short of a period. Not blocking (and say, attacking or dodging instead) allows the shield to regenerate fairly quickly. If someone grabs you while you are shielding, there is no way for you to tech the grab when it occurs. This allows for players to go back and forth in their gameplay offensively and defensively, and also give players the fear of being grabbed if all they do is block- rather than what we have with For Honor where the only thing that threatens a block is an Unblockable *(which not every character even has!)*. **The other thing For Honor could do** if Smash's system isn't appealing enough, holding the block input could reduce/freeze stamina regeneration. By carefully weaving blocking and dodging attacks together, one could mitigate the stamina loss from having to block attacks, allowing time for stamina to return before resorting to blocking again. With this change, GBs could potentially still be used to counter dodges, but they could also remove that property if it (GB countering dodges) proves too strong with a system like this in place. In the wake of this, attacks might even cost less stamina encouraging offensive play due to dodging becoming less risky. GB would still be untechable if you are hit while manually blocking. Blocking would behave as it normally does, but perhaps while using a manual block, stamina regeneration would be stunted down to maybe 25% or frozen entirely until the block is released. If a system like this is used, there would be no need to introduce a new mechanic like a 'block meter'. **Another suggestion would be** to make blocking similar to that of Chivalry's (which I'll call ~~'reflex block'~~ Chivalry Block), which is a game that For Honor in its early stages was frequently compared to. Like in Chivalry, blocking could be treated as a reflex mechanic similar to that of parrying, but easier. As an attack is coming in, the player could press the block input and it would block the attack as usual, with a reasonably lenient window to make the block input. This could be combined with one of the systems mentioned above so that players wouldn't simply block everything. EDIT: I was hoping it was implied well enough, but I'll say it here, if you tried to block an attack with this mechanic and it was feinted, you would be left vulnerable trying to block an attack that never happened. *An interesting (but questionable) idea to add to the Chivalry-style block, however, would be to give the player who blocked the attack frame advantage (or a sort of ""enhanced"" faster attack like Mortal Kombat's). This would force the attacking player to block/parry an immediate, faster incoming attack from the defending player. This would cause an exchange of fast attacks until a player is struck or a player chooses not to strike immediately. With a system like this in place, VERY extensive tweaking would be necessary. I'm also very aware that it may also not be in For Honor's style to use a mechanic like this.* **What do you guys think?** Again, my ideas aren't perfect nor are they the best but I think there's definitely a lot For Honor could learn from other video games with similar mechanics and that's what I wanted to express with this."

By including them in the test, it does not necessarily mean we're releasing them in the live game.*** --- **Parry** - Light Parry frame advantage is reduced to be consistent with Heavy Parry - Guard Break is no longer guaranteed - Parrying too early consistently opens up your defense (you can no longer spam parry while in hit stun to parry chains) **Guard Break** Old attack interrupt values - Startup 0-700ms - 0-100ms Guard Break vulnerability - Startup 800-1000ms - 0-400ms Guard Break vulnerability - Startup 1100-1300ms - 0-600ms Guard Break vulnerability - Startup 1400-ms - 0-800ms Guard Break vulnerability New Value - All attack startups - 0-100ms Guard Break vulnerability **Stamina** - Stamina Regen on Block and on Dodge is now paused: - Dodge left, right, and Dash forward: no stamina regen on the first 400ms - Dodge Back: no stamina regen on the first 600ms - Interrupt Block (light attack block, stops chain): no stamina regen on the first 300ms - Regular Block: no stamina regen on the first 500ms Out of Stamina state makes players more vulnerable: - Blocking Light Attacks will not result in Interrupt but Regular Blocks, allowing your enemy to keep chaining lights - Impossible to Parry - Dodge and Dash are 200ms longer to make you more vulnerable to Guard Break - Dodge and Dash no longer have any special defensive properties such as Deflect or Superior Block - Getting hit by Melee attacks when Out of Stamina doesnt drain stamina, it only pauses the regen **Chip Damage** - Chip Damage increased to 18% for any attack **Revenge** - Revenge activation cant be interrupted by Melee attacks (headbutt, bash, etc.) - Incoming Melee attacks dont interrupt attack startups - Outgoing Melee attacks dont Unbalance enemy - Shield is increased to 70 (from 50) - Outgoing attacks cannot be parried &gt; The last big change to Revenge State is that were making all your attacks impossible to Parry. The overarching idea is to make Out of Stamina and Revenge State consistent: if youre in Revenge State, its pretty much as if your opponents are Out of Stamina with the no Interrupt Block on Light, no Parry **Flicker** - Removed Zone Attack input buffer **Duel/Anti Run Away** - Added an Anti Run Away system in Duel - Time out victory is awarded to the Player with the highest percentage of HP remaining The Anti Run Away system works by tracking characters navigation to identify who is running away and who is in pursuit. If the system confirms that an entity has been running away for too long, it applies different boosts / penalties to both players. Runner: - Navigation Speed reduced by 20 % - Automatic Stamina drain over time Pursuer: - Navigation Speed increased by 30 % "

The range guard break is decently fast, and if its fast enough, could it be used right after the kick if it was dodged, basically at the time the person is still recovering from the dodge vulnerability?"
399,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Cracking the turtle meta - More indepth suggestions,12,6eym1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/6eym1p/cracking_the_turtle_meta_more_indepth_suggestions/,2017-06-03 11:40:28,"***WARNING WALL OF TEXT*** Hello, I apologize in advance for any typos I make, English is not my first language. yesterday /u/MansfieldPower posted a [very nice list of ideas to change the turtle meta](URL and now that it's gained traction I'll like to take this oprtunity to make some better arguments for some of them while making a couple of suggestions myself. I don't agree with everything he said but most of his ideas are in the right direction. Disclamer: Most of these changes NEED to go together in order work properly and are desinged with normalized guard change speed in mind. **1) Blocking Lights doesn't interrup them** One of the main reasons why it feels like there aren't enough moves in the game is because most of them are chains, and chains are kinda bad. This is bacuse chains are extremely easy to stop, heavys are easy to parry and lights are easy to block, by removing that last part chains become much more viable, making the reciving player need to actualy do something in order to escape them. Note: heroes with superior block will still interupt lights. *Buffs:* *Attacking heroes like the Kensei and the Berserker *Specialized defence heroes (Conqeror, Warlord, LB, Nobushi) *Nerfs:* *Non defensive heroes that don't react to the attacks **2) Chip Damage** Now that light attacks are better let's focus on the other part of chains: heavies. Chip damage is by far the most suggested comunity change for the defencive meta. It makes sense, Blocking is way too good considering that in most characters is a completly passive hability. It has no real risk because its natural counter, unblockables, are normaly locked at the end of chains and are very easy to parry (not to mention that not everybody has one). So the best solution is to make a new risk: chip damage, by increasing the curent patetic chip damage on heavys to around 30~40% (not 50% thats way too much). This forces the defencive players to try to parry incoming heavys, exposing themselfs to feints. Note: i don't belive stamina damage on block would be a good idea, it would lead to matches where one person runs out of stamina for being agresive and then just dying because they can't regain it. *Buffs:* *Parrying *Deflecting *Attacking *Feints *Nerfs:* *Not doing absolutly anything **3) Parrying no longer gives a GB** Parries are one of the strongest tools in the game: they interupt chains, stop the chip damage, do stamina damage and push people away. Now, it is a bit ridiculous that they also give you a gb, because it makes parries the best option in any situation rather than a nesesity to change to flow of battle. If we only increase chip damage it wouldn't really change much, because parrying is still the best way to guarantee damage on every hero. By removing the free GB (Gb attempts bounce off, like when you try to GB a wallsplat) but increacing stagger time slightly (on heavy parries) most characters should be able to sneak a light attack after a parry, still rewarding you for actualy doing something without completly screwing the attacker up. *Buffs:* *Anybody attacking *Heroes with special parry moves (Warlord, LB, Centurion) *Anybody with a deflect (specialy the Orochi) *Nerfs:* *Non counter-attackers playing too defensily **4) Unsafer Feints** If the last 3 points are implemented the general defence of the game stops being pasive and turns active, but unlike the other defence methods (blocking and dodging) parrying is still too safe, because of feints. Feints are complicated, they are an extremely good offencive tool or literaly useless depending on the other player. But as I said earlier these changes are to make parries more of a necesity, and because of that parry attempts are going to become more common wich leads to feints becoming incredibly more powerfull, actualy, a *bit* too powerfull. Currently feints are mostly balanced around the fact that they cost a good chunk of stamina, and that is good, but the problem is that they have no real risk. All the risks they have are conected to the initial heavy (no CGB, no block) but the feint itself has none, putting you straight back to neutral as soon as it's done. This is a big problem, both in offence and in defence: in defence, this makes parry attempts unpunishable and in offence, it makes feints incredibly save. So to fix this I propose a simple solution: After a feint have a small 200-300ms window where the feinter has no guard and can't CGB, much like the warden's SB cancel. This is enough time for the first feinter to parry the coming heavy or to hit a light if the other player decides feint the parry attempt, but it also makes a player who is feinting too much to become vulnerable and punishable by a light. With these changes a decrease in the stamina usage of the feints would be acceptable. **Optional: Make Unblockable attacks unparriable** This one is a completly optional, but I do belive that unblockables need a change in order to be good. Unblockables are supose to be big, hard hitting, slow and terribly telegrafed attacks that you never want to be hit by. But currently, apart form Raider and Centurion, unblockable attacks are way too easy to counter: you can dodge them or you can easly parry them. With my proposal dodging will become the only option, yes, but considering that all of them have a pretty high miss recovery, dodging allways leads to a good punish. In order to balance some of the posible problematic heores I suggest nerfing the Raider's backwards traking and incresing the miss recovery a bit, in the Centurion I propose nerfing the side tracking **of the attack itself, not the charge up**. Side note: the Conqueror's fully charged heavy should really be unblockable. *Buffs:* *Kensei, Raider, Lawbringer, Shugoki, Centurion, (maybe Conqueror) **Posible problems** All big changes in games come with bigger changes in the meta, but let's not be stupid, these changes carry some obvious consequences that can be fixed right from the start: *Berserker: All of the changes above considerably buff the Berserker by themselfs, combined they make him a moster, but with only one change he becomes much more manageable: remove the stamina cost reduction from his infinite. He will still be strong, but at least he won't be straight up busted. *Peacekeeper: Let's not kid ourselfs, PK's second light should have been nerfed a long time ago, making it 500ms (like almost everybody's) solves any problems she might have had and eliminates the character's bigest crutch. *Valkery: While I've never found her hard to block, I know some people have problems with her, so I'll mention her although I don't think she needs a nerf. *Conqueror:This one is actualy a buff, because Conqueror's curent situation will still stand: he'll be effective but no have many viable moves. I'll probably make another post with ideas on what to do with him, but regardless he needs some changes. TL;DR *lights dont get interrupted *chip damage (just like 35%, seriously) *no gb after parry *Feints get a warden like vulnerability period *unblockables should be unparriable (maybe) *nerf the obviously broken heores. Edit: A lot of people seem to disagree with the feint nerfs, and I do understand why, but the main point of the nerf is to make parry attempts punishable and to make feint spamming a bad idea, rather than a straight nerf to all feints."
400,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,Charge attacks and how to fix them - discussion,9,69l06k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/69l06k/charge_attacks_and_how_to_fix_them_discussion/,2017-05-06 22:43:30,"After the recent mini-drama about the 180 degree Warlord charge banned in tournaments I decided to consider if there are any good solutions to implement in order to avoid controversy and boring show in tournaments and improve on the gameplay overall. This is what I came up with. For the game mechanics changes: Sugoki Oni Charge ""fix"" was only a quick patch and helped to alleviate symptoms, but failed to fully address the root cause of the problem. That's why we see the Warlord charge the way we saw in yesterday's Sypher tournament games. This style of play will pop up always on any character with similar charge mechanism in the future if no changes are implemented and will gutting a character, stripping them out of their useful and iconic moves is not a proper way to address any problem in balancing. The root cause is you can actually reliably disengage the fight over and over again with no real punishment. This way you are allowed to back off, regain stamina and do the charging move. I believe charging moves were implemented in order to allow tanks to get a good initiation off and apply some CC, but were not intended to use in the middle of a fight. This is what is causing issues. Not that these moves exist at all, but that they can be ""abused"" and spammed over and over with opponent not really being able to respond properly and fight on even terms. When characters are not allowed to disengage the lock easily or reliably, initiating these moves will become harder and riskier, but still possible, allowing healthy counterplay and letting these heroes keep their charge moves. There can be a number of possible solutions to that and I will be happy to see other suggestions considered. What I suggest is a twofold solution. 1. Implement a sprint ""build-up"" or delay. A character should not be able to start sprinting as fast as he can right now, especially if that's a heavy class. A delay in sprint or a build-up can be implemented so the hero gains full speed later that it is, thus not allowing him to leave the opponent's danger zone as fast as it can now. It is another point of balance as well as assassins can have a hit-and-run pattern with quick disengages and heavy characters (the ones with charges) can have a slow disengage speed, which would be considered their weakness. 2. Depending on a character the first 0.3-07 (roughly - it's a minor balancing issue) after dropping the lock would be vulnerable to free guardbreaks. This gives, again, additional way to balance and flesh out differences between classes, influencing their play patterns as well as allows to punish the person who tries to lose the lock and disengage in order to initiate a charge. What is important here as well, neither does a sprint build-up/delay nor the gb vulnerability stops people from performing an unlock tech, which is important considering the fact devs stated they want to let them stay in a bit changed form. Sprint build-up/delay is also designed to keep your opponent close for a moment if they opt to do an unlocked attack into sprint, omitting the gb vulnerability frames. Let's not forget this will have an impact on other game modes than 1v1s and this will make it harder for tanks (and other characters to some extent) to disengage all sorts of fights and run for a powerup/heal in a homepoint, etc.. That's for balancing changes suggestions. Once again, I would like to see your counterpoints and other suggestions for the possible solution on this issue. Maybe I failed to identify the root cause at all? Would you like to see Oni charge knock down come back after similar changes were to be introduced? At the end a quick note for tournament organisers on a suggestions to rules implementation, so you can avoid games where two warlords just run at each other without introducing really vague rules on the 180 charges, which are hard to measure (you can delay it 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 or 1.2 seconds? Which one is allowed and how to measure it?), but still not just ban charges at all. 1. At the start of a new round, players are allowed to lock and unlock at will until first blood is drawn. 2. After first blood, a player is allowed to unlock and run only if one of the warriors is out of stamina. These are simple to measure rules (still require recording/monitoring, but if you are going to ban anything, you're in this spot anyway) that do not strip characters off of their charge moves, unlock tech and allow for oos punish even with a charge move on a basis that you can catch up to the backdashing or running opponent. TL;DR: no such thing. Please read the whole text as every sentence is important."
401,vulnerability,CompetitiveForHonor,On cancelling parry attempts,6,5w745q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/5w745q/on_cancelling_parry_attempts/,2017-02-26 10:34:27,"This is all over the place, but the gist of it seems to be: Delaying feint inputs matters. Update: Most info in this post may now be obsolete for the following reasons: Shugoki feints show 50 vulnerability frames on feint. Changes in the indicator UI have been shown to not necessarily correspond to actual game states. There is an added delay between input and UI indicator change that varies by attack. Original post for posterity: I made recordings of parries and feints. I recorded at 60fps against a bot, and counted the frames in MPC-HC. Results were consistent to within one frame, but frame timings are different from the targets perspective when playing online. In my tests both Warden and Peacekeeper cancelled their attack at 32 Frames. Both needed 32 frames to go Guard-Attack-Feint-Guard, and this timing was consistent in my recordings regardless of spammed or delayed feint input. I was able to input successful feints as late as 24 frames after attack input. The actual window is likely a bit wider. In my own attempts, inputting the feint immediately always voided the parry. That is despite the fact that the feint itself seems to happen at a static timing. I found no consistent timing for when a parry is resolved. I tried to go by animations but got inconsistent results. I tried to take the time from my input to the stamina deduction on my opponent and got different results depending on the duration of the attack: On a Peacekeeper Side Light is was 10 frames after registered input. On a Raider Top Heavy it was about 17 frames after registered input. This may or may not depend on which frame of the input window you input the parry on as well. Even for slow attacks, the parry resolves well within the 24 frame period for successful cancel. This also means that you can safely attempt to parry any attack on the fastest possible timing so long as the second fastest possible attack happens more than 32 frames after the parry window of the fast one. Useful for those who cannot reliably hit the 5 frame (83ms) parry indicator window on pure reaction and rely on anticipating it to a degree."
