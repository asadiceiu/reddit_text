Sometimes I (27F) feel like I do try to fuck the pain away when I'm really staring down some deep, deep shit. For example, the night of my mom's wake, I asked my boyfriend to fuck me. He was spike, ""are you sure?"" And I responded, ""I really need to be close to you right now."" But in retrospect, I think that I was in so much pain that I just wanted to lose myself in the ecstacy of sex, just like any other drug. Today, I had a 4 hour conversation with my older half sister who has resented me since the day I was born. Our father had her when he was 17 and then cheated on her mother with my mother, who he ended up marrying and having me with. It was a cathartic conversation that addressed the pain of a lot of people involved. Afterward, I felt like I had a vulnerability hangover from having such an intimate conversation with someone who felt like a stranger up until that point. I then wanted my boyfriend to fuck me like 8 hours later before bed. We fucked. And now I'm wide awake unable to sleep because it's like having sex knocked my emotions loose. I'm up crying as I replay the conversation and now thinking about whether it's healthy to want sex when you're that sad. Tldr; Does anyone else want sex when they are very sad, like someone-just-died sad?"
1,vulnerability,CPTSD,I am currently working on a project about abuse and trauma. Four main characters are representative of the four trauma responses. This is fight.,1,i5kjbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/i5kjbf/i_am_currently_working_on_a_project_about_abuse/,2020-08-08 05:39:47,"trigger warning for abuse. This probably isnt the right place to post this, but I figured you guys might appreciate my work.  Tragor pounded on the walls with her fists and screeched for warm mother, until she realized warm mother wouldnt be coming for her. Then she screeched for Maug, then she screeched for the blood of Soruus and her caretaker, then she screeched just to screech, just to release her hatred for cold mother. Then she had no energy to screech at all, and she sat there and chirped. For warm mother, again. It hadnt occurred to Tragor before that the guards found reason to fear her. The shadows of their figures shifted and paced in the flickering light behind the tiny barred window, and their nervous voices mingled together like the incomprehensible croaking of cranes. Every once in a while, the clack of the caretakers cane and the utterance of her true name made it through the steel door, and her stomach tensed at the sound, drawing her body closer to itself. Exhausted, she let herself lie on her side and watched them through one open eye, curled inward until her bare knees nearly touched her chin. Her tongue flicked at a slow, steady rhythm, like the beating of her heart and the distant traces of magic in her veins. Without Maugs presence, there wasnt anything to pick up besides the remnants of her tears and sour blood on her lips and concrete and emptiness and cold. Too much cold. The warmth that came with her excitement at being caned ten times instead of twenty dissipated quicker than a stroke of lighting across the horizon. The soreness in her feet was warmth, but that warmth was wholly unwelcome, warmth that made her shake and hiss and bite herself until she bled. It brought her back to the iron claws that pinned her to the floor and wrapped tight around her ankles, until she held out the bamboo chip that spoke her true name and recited it each time the cane struck the soft-scaled soles of her feet. She pulled herself closer. Horrible warmth. But the floor was cold and the air was cold and her gut felt as if its entrails had been scooped out and packed solid with ice. Cold, cold, cold. What a shame the little voice hummed, gurgling from the deep, pitch-flooded recesses of her mind. What has she done to you? Maybe cold mother meant to leave her here forever, so shed never try to abandon her again. Maug was a vile creature, and Mother made her cold, until the cold was all that was left of her. Tragor was viler. Mother would never be warm again. Youre a smart little demon. I think you already know how this ends. If youd listened to me, youd be curled up deep in the forest, belly full of fresh rabbit, as content as a creature like you could ever hope to be. The bolts clicked. Tragors eyes snapped open. It wasnt Soruus. Instead, the caretaker and a guard entered, one after the other. Both guard and caretaker wore steel second-scales over loose gray uniforms, the chests imprinted with the sleek horned crane seal of Seirxal. The guards face was left uncovered, revealing his faded, wrinkled scales and sagging jowls, like fallen leaves in the mud. His batons were mounted at his hip. Unlike him, the caretaker had no batons, and a steel mask concealed his face. The white swirls around its eyes matched his armor and the silver inlays in his short bull horns. He had a chunk bitten from his snow white cape, and what remained dangled behind his metal plated legs (and between Tragors teeth). His rough, umber-and-moss-green scaled hands were the ones that had held her ankles until they went numb, and the ones that tore Tragors own cape from her shoulders and dragged her to the cold. In his presence the vulnerability of her bare scales was impossible to ignore. She wanted to shrink inside herself, hide inside her own body and the cape hed taken away. A low growl grew in her chest. The caretaker slammed his cane down on the concrete inches from her face, and she shrunk back. Behave. Tragor hissed and flared her frills, raking her claws across the ground. No words made their way up her throat; no words could, not near them. She snapped at the cane, and they stepped back. When she looked into the caretakers mask, the fear that showed from behind the steel mirrored her own. The cane struck her shoulder, and current surged through her flesh. She howled. It burned, burned like a thousand ants biting beneath her scales. Her muscles jerked; her head bashed on the ground, streaking white across her vision. In her spasms, she couldnt stop herself from uncurling, from revealing the vulnerability of her bare torso. Her flailing arm knocked the cane from the caretakers grip, and he cursed. Tragor twitched, her limbs splayed out on the concrete. Her stripesthey had to see her stripes. She still had her stripes. The guard seized her by her arm, twisted it behind her back, and hauled her to her knees. The caretaker grabbed her horn and thrust the cane beneath her chin. Her head slammed into the wall, forcing her eyes to meet his. His grip tightened on the cane, and the metal prongs dug deeper, finding its way to the soft skin between her scutes. Ten hours in the hush room wasnt enough to calm you down, the guard drawled, Thought youd had enough by now. The caretaker knelt in front of her. His finger tapped on the canes handle. The neat patterns engraved into the bamboo glowed white. Tragors heart pounded and her frills flared, in both fear and fury. Her gut felt full of ice, heavy as lead. But she had to stand. Shed tear off their shiny second-scales and snap their limbs from their sockets and scoop out their terrible eyes and paint the walls with their viscera. She willed her rage into a tiny glob, dug up the dregs of her soul within her muscle, but there was little to fuel her, almost nothing left of the familiar heaviness of magic. The caretaker narrowed his eyes and twisted her horn painfully. You, he said, with a colorlessness in his voice that mimicked the blank white of his cape, You come with us. Your mother wants you out. No more running. You bite, and you get the muzzle. Do you understand? Tragor bared her teeth and choked out a noise, some sort of growl-gurgle from her throat. He leaned closer. Her arms tingled. The meager tar of her soul in her veins roiled to the surface, seeping from her scales. Come on. Use your words. She struggled to form sounds, twisting madly as he forced the cane further into her chin. Do you Tragor roared and wrenched her arm out of the guards grip. Dark smoke rose between her scales. The caretakers eyes widened as she grabbed him and dug her claws into his bicep. His grip released from the cane, and it clattered to the ground. Tragors claws dragged down his arm, ripped fabric from scales, scales from flesh. The caretaker clutched his wrist and stumbled back, groaning and swearing, his tranquility melted away. Blood seeped from his wound and oozed through his uniform, as dark as the smoke from Tragors claws. She collapsed forward in pain once more, the freezing tips of the guards batons on the small of her back. What did he tell you? the guard snarled. For a brief moment, as her vision cleared, Tragor caught a glimpse of the caretaker cradling his wounded limb, trying to hold together the dust that drifted to his feet from his crumbling flesh. She pushed herself onto her trembling knees, and the guard struck her again. What had been the sting of fire ants became the burn of thousands of needles of ice stabbing every inch of her skin. She screamed, and screamed, and screamed, until there was nothing left inside of her, and she spasmed silent and wide jawed on the ground. She couldnt see the caretaker or the guard, she couldnt hear their shouts, she couldnt move or think or cry. In her convulsions, she couldnt even remember her true name. What is going on here? A rough voice cut through her agony. The batons released from her skin, leaving her wheezing and shivering on the ground. She grasped her stomach and brought her eyes up to the door. Through the white spots in her vision stood Mother, all harsh edges and sharp fanged. Her face was hard as black basalt. Mother had traded her own second-scales for a woollen vest the color of a dim winter sky, with silver buttons down the center and embroidered silver patterns that ran along the edges. It laid flush to her skin, accentuating the leanness of her body. A cape draped over her shoulders and down her back, concealing her arms, pressing down the frills at her neck. She was flanked by four more guards, each second-scaled just like the others, with batons at their belt, not canes. They were masked, their horns cropped to jagged points. They stood taller than she, three even taller than what extra height her curled rams horns gave her, but her presence dominated the rest. M-mother... Tragor stuttered. The guard grunted. Oh, you know how to talk, he scoffed. Mother cast him an icy glare. His spines prickled, and he bowed stiffly. The caretaker did so as well, his jaw tight. My apologies Would you like to answer me, Langol? What is going on here? The prototype In Mothers voice, Tragors true name struck her like a venom tipped scourge, clawing deep, deep into her chest. was to be pacified and escorted out of her solitary chamber. You were given direct orders not to use excessive force. Shes not to be harmed before being revealed to the Imperatier. Tragors heart stopped for a fraction of a second. Not sent to her chambers. Not brought back to train. Revealed to the Imperatier. Oh, my Tragor. The voice bubbled. How do you forget so quickly? She didnt know. Her feet were still sore. She couldnt fight like this. She wasnt ready. Not yet, prototype. Cold mothers voice stung her memories, those days when Tragor couldnt stand, when she felt her own limbs close to crumbling. Not yet. Youre not finished. The Imperatiers heiress would break her apart. This dread was what Maug had felt each time Mother sent her to the pit. It was the last thing shed felt at all before she failed. Never warm again. Never warm again. Langols expression soured. Excessive force? He spoke to Mother as if she were a misbehaving hatchling. Your prototypes just another heiress. It acts up, and I punish it. Do you think she can fight in the pit like this? Behind her icy expression, Tragor saw a twinge of fury in her clefting mandible, in the slight flick of the spines on her head. Just look at her. Shes bleeding, and she absolutely reeks. It probably pissed itself. Chewed up its arm too. He nudged Tragors arm with his foot, and she ground her teeth. Pathetic thing wants attention. Mother shot down a look of disgust. Then muzzle her. You could have restrained her without such brutality. A five second shock would have sufficed. Does it matter? Langol thrust a claw in Tragors direction. Look. The prototype barely has any marks. The council's inspectors dont care. Theres nothing for them to find! The councils regulations are meaningless. She is not a Cadare or a Hiar. The prototype belongs to Seirxals, and you are a guard of the Seirxals. You follow my orders. Youve already lost your privilege to a mask. Do not force my hand. Your orders are Langol, you have been relieved of your duties for attempted destruction of imperial property and disrespect of your Imperian. You are to leave the Seirxal quarter immediately. You will not receive this months pay. Langols jaw parted, frills flaring, before he clenched his fists and threw down the batons. He spat on the ground at her feet, any pretense of civility gone. Your father was right to treat you like the scum you are. He pointed a shaking finger at her chest. Youre justjust some insolent, vile child. I hope his tormented spirit haunts you all eternity. I hope he knows all of his hard work went to the depths because of you. Mothers expression didnt change. I retract my previous order. Please strip Langol of his rank. Permanently. Langol grunted and whirled around. Two of his fellow guards were upon him without so much as a hesitant look. He elbowed one in the jaw, sending him sprawling. The other tackled him and pinned him to the ground with his foot. Compared to his younger former colleagues, Langol moved like syrup, even as he struggled beneath the guards grip. Metal crunched, fluid squelched as the guard planted a foot on his neck and pressed some metal thing into his spine. It ripped into him with a horrible sucking sound. Langol fell limp, his gray eyes blank and wide with terror. His mouth hung open, the reflection of a scream thatd never left his throat. Bring him to the harvester. Take his armor; his replacement will need a set. Mother turned to the caretaker, whod leaned over to grab his cane indignantly. He stood straight and regained his composure, like his spine had been pulled to the ceiling by a wire. Imperian Seirxal, he said, coolly, You must understand. Even after discipline, the prototype was aggressive. Broke off a guards horn trying to escape. One day before its duel, no less. Its vicious. He held out his wound for her to see. Tragor grimaced at the dark, crumbling cut. It was shallow, not as shed expected, only appearing worse than it was from the rot her claws inflicted. She stroked her scales, letting the sensation calm her. Langol defended me. We did what we had to do. Heiresses answer to force. Even yours. I hope you learned You do not order your Imperian, Mother snapped, You are a caretaker, but you do not dictate the prototypes handling. If you cannot accept my position as your superior, then you can join Langol in purgatory. The caretaker stood stiff, set his hands on the cane, and spoke no more. Ill summon a flesh-shaper to seal your scratch. You will be fine by noon, as long as you dont rub in the rot. Youre lucky shes weakened as she is. Her magic is fickle. Cold mothers eyes fell to Tragor. She flinched. Prototype. Her voice was both dull and sharp, flat and piercing. There was no tenderness in how she spoke, no warmth in her expression. No warmth at all. Cold, cold, cold. Did you attack the caretaker? Tragor nodded. Cold mothers mouth pursed. Face down. Arms out. Tragor obeyed. Smoke stuttered from her scales, and her barriers flickered into vision. More yellingfour guards burst through the paper-thin barriers, pinned her down, grabbed her wrists and twisted them back. Cold metal clamped around her hands. What did she say about magic? the caretaker said. The lock snapped shut. A shudder ran through her body, all the way up and down her spine. Its erratic hum drowned out the regulating thrum of her soul. She collapsed like a dead rat. Get up, said cold mother. Tragor chittered, but her fury, fury that had her scratching and screaming at the caretaker, was gone near cold mother. She uncurled and dragged herself onto her knees, then to her aching feet. The guards, the caretaker, Mother, all became juveniles under her stature. The guards shuffled their hands on their batons nervously. The caretaker stayed still, sealing his emotions behind the mask, but even in his eyes was fear. Tragor thought of how neatly her hands could fit around his neck. The heiress wouldnt be so different, would it. Shed squeeze, just like that, and watch the life drain from the girls eyes. Mother scanned up and down her body. You look disgusting, she said. Tragor felt the dried blood caked between her scales. Good. I like it. Tragor growled. Her voice boomed off the concrete walls, low and guttural. I like being disgusting. You do, do you? Mother cocked her head to the side. Her scutes crinkled. Are you going to attack me, Tragor? Tragor dug a claw under a scale. Do you want to hurt me? Do you want to leave me? Go on, if you so please. The scale tore away. She bit her own tongue. Mother drew her arms from behind her back. Tragor yelped and averted her face, but when no strike came, she looked. Mother simply signaled to the guards with a quick flick of her hand, turned up her chin, and whirled around. Follow. Tragor followed, holding back tears."
2,vulnerability,CPTSD,Partner of someone with recently uncovered C-PTSD - advice please?,1,i765ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/i765ep/partner_of_someone_with_recently_uncovered_cptsd/,2020-08-11 00:46:44,"My (35m) partner (33f) suffered physical abuse and emotional neglect from her parents as a child, the physical aspects she has no memory of, and was only made aware of this by a previous neighbour when she was 16 or so. Our first relationship started when she was 17 - she adored me, and poured herself into the relationship, with me in a saviour/parent attachment model. I, not fully understanding the underlying trauma responses or attachment models at the time, although being anxiously attached myself, broke up with her, feeling too much pressure and imbalance in our relationship, to much expectation on me to be perfect and a superhero. There was nothing particularly remarkable about our breakup, but the breakup was a deeply traumatic experience for her - after I told her, she literally balled up and howled inconsolably for two straight days. Looking back, I can see that not only did I break her trust (by breaking up with her) after she felt finally able to open up emotionally for the first time to someone, I was also the reason that she had to move back in with her (at the time, I was unaware of this) abusive parents. We got back together and broke up a few times after that, for a total of 3 years on/off relationship - always me calling it off as she seemed distant, then realising how much she meant to me and getting back together. I think each time we broke up and got back together, After 3 years apart in different relationships, we found each other again, and had a fantastic time going through a second honeymoon in our relationship. Fast forward 9 years, and were married with young kids, a beautiful house, living a beautiful life. Looking back, over the past 3/4 years, I was super stressed with work, being pretty much the sole earner, and remodelling our house, she was sleep exhausted from parenting while I was working away (half the week) and abandonment/worthlessness issues started appearing for her - in addition to the normal mum feeling trapped and without a sense of identity coming out of the end of high dependency childcare phase feelings. Depression set in, and she started pushing me away, closing off, and seeking more and more emotional sustenance in the children. She realised that she didnt feel happy in our relationship, and about 8 months ago we started couples therapy. As a result of this, loads more trauma has bubbled to the surface (including body movements triggering her, horrendous dreams, visual flashbacks of previously unknown abuse) having been suppressed for so many years, and in an attempt to protect herself from emotional hurt, she has decided that she wants to live separately. Almost three months have gone by since she decided she wanted to live separately, and were still going to couples therapy, Im staying at my parents a bunch, splitting our time between the kids and working so that we both have time with them individually, time to ourselves individually, and a day or so overlap with each other around. Shes talking about putting a tiny house in the garden and living in that, as she doesnt want to move out to rented accommodation. Shes very unsure of her decision, but doesnt want to give me false hope so doesnt want to exhibit any signs of intimate partnership or closeness, as its taken her so much courage and determination to get to this point. In working through therapy together and separately, shes realised that, due to our initial breakup 14 years ago, she feels similar trauma-informed tension and a need to protect herself with me as she does her parents, and that theres some transference of her parent attachments and abandonment into me - she doesnt feel able to open up to me fully. She recently starts to feel tense with me if we talk about our relationship, or past trauma, or if shes physically or emotionally close to me. This is a recent development - either realising that shes been masking her true feelings for all these years, and going along with it, or developing this behaviour/response to me as a result of her trauma sitting far closer to the surface than it was previously. Prior to the past three months, we were still sleeping in the same bed, still making pillow talk, still watching movies together - and had been doing all the good things couples do for all the years weve been together. She can rationalise that Im not currently a source of trauma, that I never have been even close to damaging to her in the same way her parents were, that being close to me emotionally carries no risk of emotional or physical abuse, and that Im a good person thats trying their hardest to help and address the superficial issues in our relationship and our practical lives. Weve kind of worked down to her inability to accept or forgive me for our first breakup by first working through all the practical and superficial troubles in our relationship. To address these tip of the iceberg things Ive either modelled behaviour to show that I hear and appreciate her concerns, or have demonstrated practically how the root causes of things can be solved - taking a job thats closer to home, paying people to renovate rather than spending all my free time doing it, spending more time with her and the kids (tricky at the minute, but now I know why she feels strongly about this due to her childhood, Im fully understanding of her wishes). She knows Im a good dad and a considerate, caring person, and knows that she does love me and enjoys my company, were a good match sexually, our sense of humour is similar, etc etc etc, but she struggles to decouple her trauma-informed response to me from the way she feels about me. On days where shes doing well, I can see flashes of the beautiful, strong woman I fell in love with, and shes able to be emotionally open with me - but other days, when she sets her jaw and drives the feelings deep down, shes distant, avoidant, and keeps me at arms length. Of course, Im not a saint - Ive prioritised providing for our family and renovating our house over her and the kids at times, Im someone that can think out loud fairly eloquently, so often dont give people enough space in a conversation. Ive not recognised the signs that things were going wrong soon enough, partly because they were minimised/unspoken, partly because if I was made aware, I didnt understand the trauma-related aspect, so I would defend myself from accusations as they seemed unreasonable, partly because Im a fairly blunt object when it comes to subtle emotional cues. Im working on my own issues with my therapist, as well as how these can exacerbate/trigger my partner. My partner feels that she needs to work through her childhood trauma before she can understand how she truly feels about me, but Im petrified of the limbo I am currently in, - wishing with every fibre of my being that I could help, that she could feel the closeness we once shared and take solace and comfort in that, but also not wanting to trigger her further or pressure her into furthering her therapy or healing. Im trying to be entirely passive, but present and supportive - to show my own vulnerability and hurt about being pushed away without making her feel guilty or to blame, to be present and supportive but not close enough to be triggering. Im spending all my free time with the kids, keeping on top of housework, and not pressuring her to work through stuff together, although I desperately want to understand and help. I feel I could be more supportive and kind if I wasnt also permanently tense because of the looming uncertainty about such an important part of my life. I feel bereft that shes hurting so badly and cant take comfort from me, and understand that its emotionally exhausting and petrifying for her to work through her trauma, but it still feels that shes at the very start of her healing journey, and some days wants to just push it all back down, pretend its all fine, and get on with life. Im scared of that, as its causing her so much internal damage to contain it. What am I doing wrong? How can I help her? What am I doing that I shouldnt, or not doing that I should? How can I, as a partner of someone with recently exposed c-ptsd, who is being pushed away as a defence mechanism, be the most supportive I can be, whilst respecting and honouring her boundary setting? I love her dearly, and have invested nearly all of my adult life in building a life together with her, and although I deeply wish to see out my years together, want more for her to feel happy, fulfilled, and worthy of love, even if that means not being together. Ive read a bunch of books about trauma, c-ptsd, attachment theory, dissociation, parts-based approach to trauma, TBKTS, CPTSD-FSTT etc, and while in the past Id share learnings of these with my partner, she got very frustrated with this, feeling that I was blaming her, trying to fix her, that i though she was broken (which wasnt my perspective or intent at all, I was trying to be supportive and helpful) - so Ive stopped doing this, but still feel compelled to learn about c-ptsd and trauma as her partner, so that in the absence of her being able to share what she feels without shutting down, I can learn about what behaviours might be triggering for her, recognise emotional flashbacks, whether some responses might be informed by attachment models etc. I realise that in many small ways (Still going to couples therapy, wearing her wedding ring, not fully moving out, still initiates hugs when we greet/say goodbye, setting boundaries rather than ghosting, and recently, with my encouragement, feeling able to let herself get angry at me, which seemed cathartic and helped her out of an emotional flashback) shes trying to make things work, but the few hopeful things I can hold onto to keep my head above water seem to be dwindling. It feels like the more therapy she goes through, the closer to the surface it gets, and the more she pushes me away, puts on her armour, and closes the curtains. Im scared, and can only imagine how scared she is behind it all. If anyone has some advice for partners of people with c-ptsd who are in the early stages of therapy, Id love to hear your input. Thanks!"
3,vulnerability,CPTSD,How to cope day to day if recovery can take years to see any improvement,1,i7vliu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/i7vliu/how_to_cope_day_to_day_if_recovery_can_take_years/,2020-08-12 03:07:11,"TW - idealization of death TL;DR - Im struggling trying to manage each day with a dwindling supply of hope for the future. Ive been in a bad state for a while, living with my emotionally and verbally abusive sister and emotionally neglectful mom is making me miserable. I learned about CEN and cptsd a few months ago and Im having such a hard time processing everything. Time seems to just pass me by on a day to day basis, since lockdown Ive barely kept track of what day it is, I still havent fully come around to the fact that its already half way through August. I have so many issues I need to work out and I keep discovering more, its becoming such a long list. It seems with every new discovery I make about my past and how it effects my behaviour today, I get more and more depressed. Im trying to identify and listen to my emotions, but all of them are so negative, they come at such high frequency that I just get overcome by them. I cant fathom the idea of living like this for decades to come, just existing feels like such a draining process. How is it that I can feel this way? Im only 20 desperately trying to prepare myself for adult life. I have no life goals established, I have troubles in knowing who I am in general. I dont know what Im naturally good at, I dont know what I genuinely enjoy doing. Adult life just seems so mundane, I dont want to be stuck in a job for 40 years where all I do is complain. I dont want my body to age, from what Ive seen and experienced growing old sucks. I see these people who live for 112 years and wonder how it is possible they tolerated 40,000+ days. Everyone says college years are the best years of their lives, but if Im feeling this bad in the best years of my life, logic dictates it only goes downhill from here. I really want to heal, I so desperately want to be able to enjoy life as everyone else seems to. I want to be happy so bad, but each day I wake with only hopelessness and despair. I called my doc for an appointment earlier today, but now I cant shake the thought of if I need medication just to tolerate life, is life really worth it? I know these are awful thoughts and Im trying my hardest to keep them out of my head, but theyre so sneaky and find ways in anyway. Im not suicidal, I could never do that to my family, but I just keep questioning the value and purpose of life, that plus hopelessness though can lead to bad things Im aware. I just dont know how to cope each day, I dont know what I can look forward for. Whenever I have a string of good days theyre always followed by a few bad days, the bad days seem to be getting worse. My defence mechanisms make me shut down, I have no one I feel comfortable enough with that I can open up to. I have serious fears of vulnerability, I hate the idea of me being vulnerable to someone, always have. This makes me isolate, but it then makes me feel alone. All of my problems are perpetuating all of my other problems, and I dont see a way out. I have no motivation to put in work to recover each day if results arent going to be apparent until years from now. When I calculate the risk/benefit of trying to recover, every time I end up with the answer its not worth it. I see on this sub and others the sheer amount of work and sustained effort over long periods just to see tiny improvements, they only make me feel worse. I dont know what to do, I feel stuck, I feel like I fell overboard from the ship called life and Im just watching it leave, I can see it pass me by each day. Will I ever not feel this way? Im just so tired of feeling this bad."
4,vulnerability,CPTSD,Mom's Avoidance of Acknowledging my CSA - Advice?,1,i8jq4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/i8jq4v/moms_avoidance_of_acknowledging_my_csa_advice/,2020-08-13 04:56:12,"I'm hoping some of you going through this healing process might be able to offer a bit of advice... I had therapy yesterday where we started delving into my relationship with my mom (this is only my 4th session). She was never abusive in the physical sense, though I am beginning to realize that she may be emotionally abusive, even if it's not intentional on her part. The feelings we were getting into were her dismissal and avoidance of the CSA I went through. In short, I was SA by a member of my family and did not tell my mother until after the family member had passed away. The abuse went on for years - I don't even remember the first time it happened or how old I was.. Anyway, I told my parents what happened when I was 12. I was obviously crying out for help, why would a child tell their parents after so long for any other reason? Well, nothing came out of it. The experience of telling them was awful in and of itself - a story for another time - but after that day, it's never been brought up again. Not once. I'm now 23 and just getting started on healing. This morning I woke up to a text from my aunt (mom's sister) asking ""How are things?"". Now my aunt has NEVER in the history of ever texted me. My head is telling me that my therapy has finally hit the insurance (I'm still on my parents insurance and my mother is very controlling - needing to know exactly what's going on, why I went to the doc, etc.). I feel like my mom is using my aunt to find out (I know my aunt went through similar trauma as a child, but we have never been close) rather than actually asking me about it for once. Now, with having opened up this vulnerability yesterday, I think I've been waiting for my mom to finally acknowledge what happened and to CARE if I was okay or not, so this is really affecting me emotionally... At the same time, I know I'm supposed to be working on not reading into people's ulterior motives in everything, and it's been going really well for other people, just not for the relationship with my mom. The kicker is, I'm right about my mom's ulterior motives 99% of the time, so it's just so hard... I feel like I'm insane, just trying to keep myself together enough not to break down into tears here at work.. Is there any advice any of you have to help reconcile this feeling? I just need to get through work.. I'm not ready to talk to my mom about it, and I'm not sure that this question even makes sense, so I'm sorry. Any advice would be so appreciated.. Thanks for reading."

The media is covering it none stop, and I just saw a report about it, showing footage of the teachers did (it was all recorded), and the children's parents speaking about how they felt, realizing what was going on in that place, and watching those tapes. t.w: &gt;!I felt sick to my stomach watching those poor kids being slapped and hit, things thrown at them and such!&lt;, but at the same time, I resent the way it's described in the media (the nickname of the scandal is ""kinder-garden atrocious""), and hearing the parents react to it with such grief and shame and horror, thinking through what those kids must have felt like, being in a state of terror and fear, with no one, no parent to protect them. and I ache for them, for all of them, but at the same time, somewhere in the back of my mind I keep thinking: I had it worse (or at least as bad) why no one ever felt such pain when it was happening to me, why was it ok for me to grow up like this, and why even if people knew now, no one would ache for me as those parents do. I also lived in fear, I also had no one to protect me, why no one apologized to me? why no one protests now against my wrong? and I'm in therapy now and I'm working on my issues, but even when I recall things that happened and my T puts on his most empathetic face, it's not the same as those parents, and I just now realizing how much I want this, that reaction from someone, to actually care, and to genuinely ache for me because hey I'm a person too, and I want to know that I matter somewhere to someone, but I don't. And through all of it, I hate how cold and bitter all of this is making me to, I want to care and be empathetic and sympathetic and kind, but I feel like I can't because every time I do I have to face the fact that no one was ever and maybe even never will be like this for me, and I used to just carry on regardless because I always thought ""well, it isn't about me, and this person is hurting now, it's not their fault you're in pain, so don't make them pay for something they didn't do"" and it worked, I pressed on, and on and on, but after so many years like that, I'm beginning to crack, and I don't know how long I can continue carry it all, and I'm genuinely scared of what will happen next time, if I'll god forbid show weakness (vulnerability or just a need) in real life and wouldn't get the empathetic,kind reaction I try so hard to give to others (and I won't, I lived long enough in my own skin to know that I just don't get this happy ending), I know it would break me in a way that maybe there isn't going back from, because tbh I already lost way too much of myself to begin with."

I love you as I love myself. Fiercely, unconditionally. Without question. Many years I suffered, many years I was lost to my love. All I have suffered, I would suffer again and gladly, if it would help me better find the words to express to you your own beauty. This is my purpose. You don't believe me? Let me count the ways. I love you in the late afternoon, the way the embers of the dying sun illuminate your face. I love you when the shy moon plants soft kisses on your cheek, steals admiring glances at you every time you're not looking at her. I love you when you are lost in childlike wonder at ladybirds and butterflies and puddles to jump in. I love you in the raindrops running down your neck, chilling your bones and washing your soul clean. I love you in your dreams, when you throw off the shackles of this existence to journey to other dimensions, other lives. When you wake, in that moment before you remember your troubles, when you are in your knowing. I love your inner smile, soft as butter and just as satisfying. I love you in the warmth of your flushed cheeks, when you stumble over your words, the way your voice falters when you fight back tears that prick the backs of your eyes, the lump that forms in your throat as you struggle for words that are just out of reach. I love the music of your laughter, the way your heart flutters sometimes like a tiny, secret bird, the way you stuff secrets deep down in your stomach only to feel them churning, yearning, as you lay in your bed, all curled up in your loneliness. I love you in your selfishness, in the lies you tell because the truth is far too frightening to contemplate. I love you when you drown in your grief, coming up only to snatch breaths between waves of despair. I love you when you are so red hot with anger you want to explode and take the whole world with you, and when you burn with silent shame, and when you freeze in the cold light of day. I love you in your numbness, your apathy, when you are so full of nothing you could become everything. When you stand proudly in your power, and when you cower in your unworthiness. I love you in your sweetness, your saltiness, your bitterness. I love you when you run from everything you are because it is just too magnificent to accept. I love you when the veil slips for a moment, and you are awestruck, aware of yourself. I love you in your unwillingness to step beyond that veil. I love you in your nakedness and your vulnerability. I love you when your jealousy hits you like a lead weight, and when you are overcome with lust, and when fear wraps icy fingers around your heart. I love the way you cannot hide your soul, how it shines out of you for anyone who has the right eyes to see it. I love your strength when you speak your truth, and your weakness when you punish yourself for simply existing. I love the very bones of you and the air that fills your lungs when you remember to breathe deeply. The dull ache of your regret and the joyful lightness of your gratitude. The self you present to the world, and the shadow you scramble to hide. You do not know me, but I love you. I love you with all that I Am, all that we Are, for there is truly no difference between us. There is nothing you could do to make me love you any less. I love the thoughts you push to the dark recesses of your mind, the feelings you run and hide from so effortlessly, the wholeness that you are, that you deny. I see you in all your glory. I see your perfection, your worth, your power. I see you in my knowing. You do not know me, but I know you, because I know myself. In my knowing, I am love. In my loving, I love you as myself. It cannot be otherwise. And So it Is. &lt;3"

I was really excited because it pertains to my interests more directly. But, when I signed up for the zoom meeting it didnt work and nobody responded to my requests for help. That was heartbreaking. At this point I keep contemplating suicide but I know theres more opportunities for connection. Im just afraid of the weekend, I feel like its gonna destroy me and Im gonna reach out to someone thats bad for me.

My mom's alive and well. But she's not there. She's not present. Not for me. Never has been. I've been clamouring for her attention, her affection, her connection ever since I was born but she doesn't respond. She doesn't reciprocate. She doesn't pay attention. I tried everything. I made myself her loyal slave. I repressed my wants and needs. I turned a blind eye to her injustice towards me. I became studious and industrious like she instructed me to. I didn't make myself available to anyone else like she wanted me to. I stayed under her ego's control. I let myself be her crutch as she wanted, and let myself be discarded as she wanted. Hell, I gave up the world. I gave up reality. I had no choice but to. None of it has been enough. And all of this has been covert. None of it ever spelled out. Never directly addressed. Not by her. Not by any other family member. I was coerced from the moment I was born and needed her to take care of me. And she pounced on that vulnerability. ""She had my number"". And my involuntary participation in being complicit to her toxic soul-sucking is just the beginning. She didn't just neglect me. Once her deep gut punch softened me to be preyed upon, she went above and beyond to deliver her crazy directly into my existence. And she roped in the entire family to maintain the facade. ""I want to go to my mom."" Not her. But a mothering figure who can offer me unconditional love, even if for a moment, and let me feel like the kid I have always yearning to be on the inside. But years of emotional and mental beatings forces me to rationalize right away. ""She's not there."" So conditioned to soothe my own pain that I can't even let the inner child's plight stand. It HAS to be followed up my own understood rationalization right away. ""I want to go to my mom."" ""She's not there."" ""I want to go to my mom."" ""She's not there."" ""I want to go to my mom."" ""She's not there."" Let the kid speak, man."

My life is not a sin. My mental health is not a sin. My skin is not a sin. My desire for intimacy is not a sin. My physical desires are not a sin. My existence is not a sin. *I myself am not a sin.* I was having some gender dysphoria earlier today, and when I calmed myself down and deconstructed why I was feeling this way, I concluded that it was because I was never comfortable being myself. I was taught that vulnerability was a bad thing, lest I get stabbed in the big red target that was my back. I never let my guard down around anyone until I started seeing my therapist. The major problem with these issues is that I wasnt able to be vulnerable with even myself. I never really looked at myself in the mirror in my most baseline form: without clothes on. So today and yesterday I did my best to take a look at myself without judgment. And you know what? I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I have before. And its a great feeling to have. So to anyone else who needs to hear this: You yourself are not sinful, no matter what you have been led to believe. No matter what the programming in your head says you are. Challenge those unconscious thoughts and say fuck you to them. The mere fact that you exist does not mean that you are a sin. You are here, and that itself is reason enough to love who you are. **Loving yourself is not a sin.** **Wanting intimacy is not a sin.** **Wanting to experience the finer things in life is not a sin.** **EXISTENCE ITSELF IS NOT. A. SIN.** Dont let anyone, especially yourself, tell you different. Write it down a thousand times to stick it in your head if thats what it takes. Take some time to do the small things you love, be it reading and drinking tea, watching Netflix, petting your animal friends, talking to your loved ones. Whatever it takes to make yourself feel loved **by yourself,** do it. You are not a sin."

After I returned to school I tried to go back to normal and just act like everything was cool with me but I had to tell the school therapist that I was in the hospital and why I was there. A few months into the school year my mom started getting calls saying that I was scaring the female students and becoming a liability. Then I noticed some of the administration following me to class and overheard them talking about me after class one time. Friends of mine started asking me questions about how I was doing and when I mentioned being followed around and watched they told me I was being paranoid. Around this time I started going home for weekends a lot more because I felt really uncomfortable at school and a lot of people I trusted randomly said I was Scary and making them nervous. One of the weekends I went home the school therapist took the operutunity to call an all school meeting, one that I wouldn't be there for and told the student body eve~~~~~~~~rything she knew about my time at the hospital but posed it in a way that made me sound way worse off than I was. And after returning back to my school everyone was very weird and people really started walking on eggshells around me. I ended up becoming a day student because I no longer felt safe sleeping their at night. It felt like I was in a lab being studied. Then eventually one of the only people I still trusted told me that the administration with the school therapist were calling people into private meetings to talk about me and seriously pushing them to say I was Scary and not fit to be a boarding student anymore. Years later very similar situations happened at my first two jobs where my managers would try to manipulate my relationships with other employees and talk behind people's back to start workplace drama that ultimately lead to me being fired. It feels like I'm some weird nexus for this kind of behavior and even friends who I trusted enough to live with have worked to gaslight me into doing all their chores and housework for them as well as pay their bills. It's like the second people see any vulnerability from my they take advantage and make plans to exploit the parts of my trauma I still have the hardest time handling. And I never feel like I can talk about it because people think I'm seeing conspiracy patterns where their aren't any. The level of psychological trauma coming out of situations like this make me feel unable to function in society And I can't trust anyone. I'm wondering if anyone else has dealt with something like this. I feel weird saying I was in the middle of three conspiracy theories and I totally get anyone who super doesn't understand or beleive me especially because I can't figure out a motive for any of it."

I'm just looking to share a brief version of my story. I grew up in a religious cult. My family left when I was 9 with pretty much nothing. It was a tough adjustment for my parents, who spent their whole lives in the cult and still had family there. Life was ok for a bit. Then my parents began fighting, and my dad stopped working as much and started drinking more, and my mom started becoming more absent. When I was 11 or 12 my mom up and left without really saying much. She left my Dad to take care of all 5 of us kids. I really cared about my dad. He was always patient and kind. He was really sad when my mom left. I would go to work with him just so he'd work. I'd let him cry to me about my mom. I'd take his keys so he wouldn't drive drunk. Then one night I just got this bad feeling, so I went and locked myself in my room, told myself it was all in my head. Life just got worse from there. My dad drank more and more and did other drugs. He barely ever worked. I did most of the cooking and taking care of my siblings. I'd steal school supplies for them and budget our food stamps and do the grocery shopping. We got evicted when I was 14. It took us a few days to find a place to stay. We stayed in a 1 bedroom motel, and I slept in the car with our cat. We then found a place to stay and things continued to spiral. When stuff got really bad, my mom would come back to try to fix it. My dad would work hard to keep her around, and I wanted her around because I felt safer, but she always left after a few months. One day I found out that my dad had abused someone and all my fears were confirmed. I slept with a knife under my bed and barely slept most nights. I remained constantly vigilant for myself and my siblings. I was so sleep-deprived, I had a constant eye twitch. I was completely torn between living with the monster I knew so I could watch over my siblings, or risk being split up. We were soon evicted from this home as well because my dad was not paying rent. We found a new place but had no furniture. Life was still shitty. My mom was still gone. Never really spoke to us. My dad was there and drunk and not working. I don't think I looked at my dad in the eye for over a year or had more than 5 minutes of conversation with him. Both parents were completely emotionally absent. No-one ever asked how I was or knew about anything going on in my life. My mom came back again for a couple of months, then left. At this point, I was 17. I found an eviction notice on the kitchen counter and asked my dad what the plan was. He said we would have to go to a homeless shelter. I called my mom and she said: ""Good luck, I'm sure it will work out"". At this point, we had also been living without water and power for a few days. I was fortunate enough to stay with a friend for a few months until I started college. While all of this was going on in my life I decided when I was 13 years old that I was getting myself and my siblings out of this situation and was going to have a better life for myself. I put on a happy face every day and went to school. I was fortunate enough to be going to a good public school with resources. I took honors and AP courses. I worked my ass off and was so good at pretending to be happy. I finished high school in the top 5% of my class. I got into a great college on almost a full scholarship and studied engineering. I am now 21 and working for a very well know company in a very prestigious program. The company is paying for me to get my master's part-time. So, I did it. I got myself out of the situation. But my life always hovers over me. I can never escape it. A little over a year ago I found out some more information about my dad. I decided that I was cutting contact with him once and for all. A few days ago, he was found on the floor of his apartment. He was rushed to the hospital and is currently in recovery. He had tried to kill himself. I decided to go see him at the hospital. He was pretty incoherent but just cried every time he realized how much time had passed and how little he knew about my life. He cried and told me he was sorry. He has been holding a steady job and hasn't been drinking for the last year. It was painful to see him that broken and helpless. I don't hate him. He wasn't always a bad person. I want him to be better and be happy. I'm just not sure I have room for him in my life. While some things can never be forgiven, it does not escape me that his life has been just as challenging as mine, if not more. I understand how complicated and hard life is and I think he just broke mentally. He spent over 35 years in a cult, left and didn't really have any family or friends, my mom left him after 18 years of marriage, and she left him to take care of 5 children. He had no more than a grade-school education and struggled to read and function in this harsh world. He was once very kind. I am struggling with how I feel right now. I feel confused and sad and angry. I don't like things I can't control. I don't like taking risks. I really struggle to trust people. I really struggle with vulnerability and intimacy. I really struggle with control and feeling worthy of love if I'm not ""perfect"". Lately, I've been struggling a lot because I feel so alone. Most of the people I work with/went to school with and am surrounded by have lived drastically different lives than me and no-one really knows how to respond if I tell them anything. Which is ok, I just crave connection on the basis of similarity. I don't really know what I'm looking for here. I guess just to not feel so alone."
13,vulnerability,CPTSD,Is this considered trauma for CPTSD?,1,ieycae,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ieycae/is_this_considered_trauma_for_cptsd/,2020-08-23 16:18:17,"So I've been wondering a lot about CPTSD but I don't remember many times when I felt like a ""traumatic stress"" in childhood. The only times I can remember that feeling were ""normal"" discipline spankings and yelling when parents were upset or we got in trouble, but I can't remember how often that would've happened. I guess I'm wondering if what I experienced (written below) could be considered trauma/abuse for CPTSD without it feeling terrifying scary or stressful? sorry it's all probably gonna be written pretty messy and leaving lots of things out, I can't think of everything right now (but it's still long haha). Im scared of making things seem worse than they are or being dramatic, cause I know theres worse stuff that others have been through. Im really indecisive about it. I'm scared of bringing this up with a psychologist in case it doesn't really qualify as trauma and I'm just being sensitive/overreacting, which is why I'm asking here first. &amp;#x200B; Possible child on child sexual abuse. My brother who is 5 years older than me used to do things with me in secret at home. My memorys not great, but I think it wouldve started somewhere between when I was aged 5-7 and ended around age 8, maybe 9. Im really not sure though, it couldve been going on for only a few months, or it couldve been spread over a few years. I also cant remember how many times it happened over the course of it. Some things that happened: * Kissing, and one time in particular I was really grossed out by him with it and didnt want to do it. Other times I went along * Rubbing himself against me/me against him * one time I was naked and he was fully clothed. He was trying to penetrate/insert a plastic object in me which hurt. Like I dont think it went in cause I dont think he was putting it in the right spot, if that makes sense * Showing me his genitals I really cant remember if there was much else. I think I remember feeling dirty/gross afterwards, and also being physically uncomfortable in my body, like embarrassed or something? And once when I was around 9, I had come out of the shower and was checking on my clothes in the laundry if they were dry. Two of my brothers (oldest and second oldest) started messing with me, cornering me and trying to pull the towel of my body. I was cornered into my brothers bedroom and they got the towel off me and I fell on the bed in a really bad way, like they could see everything. I remember it pretty well cause I remember feeling terrified at the time. &amp;#x200B; For a while (maybe over a couple years?) my brothers used to tease me and call me names a lot daily. It was mainly the oldest (the one doing the sexual stuff) and the second oldest brother who did it. It didnt really feel like the typical sibling banter, cause I know what thats like and this felt different. It was like they knew it annoyed me (cause I showed it) and they enjoyed it. They would also do other things that they knew would annoy me, just for the sake of annoying me. My oldest brother also used to harass me, like physically I guess? Not punches or anything, but like if I was walking from my room to the living room, he would start chasing me, and if he got to me he would either tickle me, corner me and not let me go, sit on me, or get on top of me and bend my back backwards on the floor (sorry dont know how to explain it). Like even if I just made eye contact with him at anytime he would do it. Basically he would just annoy me cause I guess he enjoyed it or something, idk. I know this stuff isnt extreme, but I think the length of time that it went on and the fact that they would enjoy upsetting me is what made it hurt the most. Like it wore me down mentally and I would just take it I guess. My mums reaction to all this stuff was boys will be boys and they do it because they love you/its how they show they love you. My dads response was basically to give it back to them/join in. Only after I blew up one time did my mum say to them that it was excessive, but from memory I dont think that changed much. Thinking of it now makes me pissed at my brothers, and I honestly dont think I have any love for my oldest brother. &amp;#x200B; I think I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My dads always been a heavy drinker (I dont know how much qualifies as an alcoholic) and depressed. Pretty sure hes kinda a toxic person and emotionally immature still. He was emotionally/mentally and I think verbally abusive to my mum, which wore down her self-esteem and eventually she had a breakdown. I think my mum couldve been codependent in the relationship, not trying to label her but shes definitely like a fawn-type person. She told me she knew their marriage was dead when I was 3 weeks old, but they didnt separate til I was 8-10. Im kinda angry that my mum stayed in the relationship as long as she did, cause during that time she experienced more abuse and us kids were in that environment too. She said we were her world and that we were what got her through it, like she would focus on us. Its hard to explain the home environment during this time, but I guess it was generally unhealthy? My mum grew up with a really abusive and mentally ill mother, and her dad may have also been a bit abusive but idk. She was parentified I think, cooking for her and her dad since she was around 10? She has OCD and worries a lot. My dad grew up with an abusive and misogynistic father who would physically and verbally abuse (possibly among other things) his wife (dads mum). My mum told me that the only female that my dads dad didnt dislike was me. &amp;#x200B; When wed stay at mums house after she remarried, I always had to act real happy and smiley (fake) around my step-dad and especially his kids and parents when theyd visit. She would get real nasty about it and its like just being myself wasnt good enough, like if I was feeling down and depressed (which I did a lot) she would get up me for not being happy and smiling. She wasnt this hard on my brothers about it either, she was mainly super critical of me about it. I know this doesnt sound like much, but I guess it was tiring always having to be a certain way and I was on edge a lot at home. &amp;#x200B; I dont know for sure, but I think there couldve been emotional neglect/abandonment as a kid (and maybe teenager). Like when I first heard about emotional neglect and abandonment depression its like something clicked in my head, but Im too indecisive to make up my mind haha. Im not good at explaining it really. &amp;#x200B; I was really depressed for a while as a kid, maybe around 9-10? My parents had a messy divorce around this time which probably was part of it, plenty of fighting before and after. I had some OCD tendencies as a kid, like checking doorknobs, light switches, washing hands, stepping over cracks, arranging things neatly. Nowadays though its all gone, it stopped when I was young (10-12) I was diagnosed with body dysmorphia when I was \~12 (i think thats the right age, cant fully remember). I havent liked my appearance since younger than that though. I've been an emotional and boredom eater since childhood. Then when I was 13 I was diagnosed with anorexia with comorbid anxiety/depression. The anorexia was the main diagnosis which I definitely did have, but the anxiety/depression was pretty much the doctor asking have you been feeling depressed or anxious at all? And I said yes and he said they commonly occur with anorexia. Like it really wasnt very in depth, and outside of anorexia related anxieties (food, weight, body) and moods, Im not sure I had proper anxiety. Like I wasnt worrying about natural disasters, car crashes, family, health etc and I dont think the worst case scenario if someones late for example. Idk though I was in and out of hospital between 13-15 for the anorexia and theres a lot of stuff that was going on with that, emotionally, and at home etc. I wont go into it cause its hard to put it all into words and explain, but basically it was crappy, treatment didnt help, I was on edge a lot at home, couldve possibly worsened my sense of shame and everything. I was also in foster care briefly when I was 15. Nowadays, the anorexia has turned into bulimia (purging through laxatives and fasting) and I definitely still have body dysmorphia. &amp;#x200B; I feel and have a lot of shame, but I dont know when or why this shame started. I also feel inadequate/less than others. I have a big fear of vulnerability and judgement which definitely holds me back and keeps me guarded from others, like scared of sharing passions etc. &amp;#x200B; I read some of Pete walkers book and some things really resonated with me, like emotional neglect/abandonment, the lost child, freeze-flight response, perfectionism, inner critic etc. When I first read about it it clicked but now Im not sure again. And also when I first learned about CPTSD, it seemed to make sense but again, now that some times passed Im really not sure how I feel about all this. &amp;#x200B; sorry this was pretty directionless. I'm seeing a psychologist soon but until then I can't stop wondering. I don't have many sessions with them so I don't know if I should go deep into all this stuff (plus other things I missed/left out) or if I should just focus on more current problems -- recently, I feel like I live out of fears, shame, guilt, and a big freeze response, like always daydreaming. I'm also a huge perfectionist which doesn't help. I would love to hear others thoughts xx"

So, I learned early on to be nonconfrontational and to fear rejection, and this has come to seriously fuck me over now later in life.

16,vulnerability,CPTSD,Just a big rant about gynecology.,1,ighl9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ighl9t/just_a_big_rant_about_gynecology/,2020-08-26 04:09:07,"I'm so fucking bitter about being expected to see a gynecologist as a 20-something year old female. Like goddamn, I'm angry. Everytime I think about actually going for an exam I feel overcome with rage. I guess I just hate the insinuation that me and the gynecologist in this scenario are meant to be aligned in some way. I know that's unfair to the gynecologist, seeing as they're just doing their job and they're ultimately trying to help their patients, but it doesn't fucking make a difference to me. I don't feel like we're on the ""same team"" or whatever. I feel like they're doing something insanely invasive, distressing, and painful to me without any sincere respect for what they're inflicting upon me. If I'm trying to put a finger on it, I suppose what makes me so angry is less seeing them as the ultimate villian in this scenario, and more that I feel forced to be a willing participant in what's unfolding. I hate that. I hate that society makes me feel like I'm not allowed to be openly angry and miserable about it, because, ""It's for my own good."" I hate that when I imagine myself in an exam, I know I wouldn't feel able to express any anger or bitterness at what's going on because I wouldn't want to make the gynecologist feel bad. I hate that if I stopped the exam, the ultimate outcome would be that I'd just have to resume it after a break or go through it all again another day. It feels like there's just this complete illusion of choice and consent. At the end of the day, I feel pressured to be complacent in a violation of my boundaries. I've tried to express this before on sex-related subs, and the responses I got just made me more angry. ""It's no different than going to see a dentist."" Except, you know, a dentist isn't fucking putting there fingers inside a place that up until now I chose to keep completely private, isn't causing sensations that I associate with sex, and isn't staring at my literal naked fucking body while they do it. Like what the fuck? ""You can just tell them beforehand you have difficulty with these exams."" Ahh, so I get the joy of also violating my emotional boundaries by sharing my vulnerability with complete strangers who I have no trust in. And the classic, ""They'll stop if you tell them to,"" as I mentioned above. When I try to vent about this people seem to think my issue is assuming that the gynecologist is experiencing something sexual during the exam or judging me in some way. It's really not. It's pretty much the exact opposite. I hate that I feel forced to share an experience that invokes sexual sensation in ME and feels deeply intimate for ME with someone who can't come close to appreciating the significance of that moment. The impersonality and coldness of the entire process makes me angry. I wish there was a program where your gynecologist was also your sex therapist or something, and you had as many sessions as you needed with them of just talking before you ever did the exam. That would be truly trauma-informed in my opinion. That would respect the time I need as a traumatized person to build trust and alliance with someone before being vulnerable with them. If someone isn't ready to get as vulnerable as possible in therapy, you don't tell them ""Well, sucks, come back when you are."" You work with them and acknowledge that vulernability exists on a spectrum, and that you can build to the extreme end over time. Imagine if instead when you went to a therapist you were expected to disclose your absolute deepest and most intimate experiences in the very first session. And if you couldn't, then the very next session that same expectation was put on you again and you were pressured into that discussion again. And if you couldn't that time, rinse and repeat for the next session, ad infinium. Seems like a pretty great way to retraumatize someone and destabilize them to me - so why is it standard practice in gynecology?"
17,vulnerability,CPTSD,Sharing with someone that you have anxiety is basically outing yourself as a person of trauma,1,ihu0ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ihu0ui/sharing_with_someone_that_you_have_anxiety_is/,2020-08-28 07:30:18,"I've been thinking about this a lot in the past few years as I have come to terms with my anxiety and triggers. Once I realized that I had CPTSD and trauma from my childhood and that this was not common with the majority of people I interacted with on a daily basis it made me really hesitant to share that I was having problems with anxiety. I realized that I had a lot more trauma and weird childhood memories that did not match up with my co-workers. I realized I needed to stop being a part of those kinds of discussions at work and keep away from certain subjects because my stories were really messed up. I then started to realize that even suggesting that I had anxiety was basically outing myself as a victim of childhood trauma. I realized over the last few years that I needed to keep a lot of my stories to myself and work through them with people I really trusted. I became more guarded and protective of my inner struggles. I only shared with close friends. I started to pull myself back from sharing what was going on inside. This made it really hard to handle work situations though. There was constant chatter about childhood things that just triggered me constantly. I realized that I couldn't even hint at a problem with anxiety because it indicated I was broken or different than them. Looking back I realize that most likely the majority of my co-workers didn't pick up on the clues. But the problem was that certain people will make the connections. When they see the anxiety they put the pieces together that I have some past trauma and possibly a messed up childhood with abusers. By showing anxiety I flag people that take advantage of this state. I was attracting narcissistic people that saw my weakness and how much I wanted to people please and used that to get me to work long hours, take a lot of work abuse and have really messed up relationships where the other person was in power and pushing me to do things for them. I realize by admitting to anyone that I have anxiety in the first place is admitting I have a messed up childhood and I just don't want to put myself out there like that with co-workers, strangers, people I met, conversations with strangers, etc. I feel really uncomfortable that I out myself like that to other people. I have learned that a lot of people I work with have happy childhoods and want to talk about their happy memories. I realize that at some level they can't even relate to people like me. They are usually very kind and understanding and I enjoy working with them but I don't feel like one of them. It's hard for me to be around them sometimes because I get so sad thinking about how much I missed out on. Hearing their stories reminds me of how much I missed out on that I didn't even know of until they told me what a normal childhood was like. What is it like having a healthy relationship with your dad? What was it like being raised with two parents? How was it like always feeling safe and secure and well-fed? Every time the holidays get closer I have to pull away from my co-workers and friends because it's some of the biggest memories of trauma for me. They all get so excited and all of the stories and chatter just make me feel so terrible I get very depressed for months at a time. I guess what I'm trying to say here is it's tough to give any kind of hint that something messed up happened to you as a child. Either people don't understand (even though they are usually compassionate) or it triggers them and you both talk about the messed-up shit that went down, or it triggers a narcissistic person to want to take advantage of you in that vulnerable state. Predators were often attracted to me as a child and young adult. Now I feel that showing any kind of vulnerability just sends out a message to everyone around me that I can be walked all over. Flagging all the predators in the room is the worst part. I have managed to deflect them now that I am older but I am still hyper-aware of where they are and who they are. Luckily for me, they don't see me as someone they can get something from anymore. I still hate working with them. You can tell when there is a toxic relationship going on with a narcissistic CEO and a person-pleasing manager. How do you all handle situations like that? Do you hide your trauma at work? How do you handle toxic work relationships that pattern old parent behavior? How do you handle it when everyone wants to talk about happy childhood memories? Or how you handle it when people want to play the game of ""who's childhood was more messed up""? Do your co-workers know that your anxiety means you have childhood trauma? Do we all just not talk about it at work or is it well known but just not addressed to your face? Do your co-workers know you take medication daily? Do they ask what the medication is for? Does popping pills at lunch out you as an unstable person? Does admitting to being anxious make you labeled as an unstable person and do your co-workers use it against you? How is mental health addressed with your workplace? I'm trying to get to a place I can normalize how I am, and talk about it if I feel comfortable. I don't want to be ashamed of what happened to me because it wasn't something I did.. it was done to me. Some of that shame is part of the problem of not reaching out for help when I was a kid and as an adult. So I embrace what I am.. I admit to having anxiety... and I watch out for predators constantly. Sometimes I like hearing my co-worker's stories of loving families because it makes me happy that there are families that live like that.. and it's not just in the movies. I am proud of my co-workers for being great moms and dads. I can sometimes live through them and see another world that I want to be a part of. I like working with them because they are some of the most understanding, mature and calm people to work with. I just feel like I don't belong with them. I feel like I'm the broken messed up kid that no one really wants to sit with at lunch. I'm sorry my stories are so messed up. I wish I had some happy stories to share too."

Firstly, I'm not sure if I ever even can be loved, since in order for that to happen in the first place, that requires an insane amount of trust and vulnerability. Being vulnerable with a man truly feels like I'm peeling my skin off. I've been speaking to this guy who is so incredibly kind-hearted and sweet. And he's made it explicitly clear that he likes me. But how do I explain that I'm like an apricot: sweet and warm on the outside, but when you cut me open, there are worms. I suppose that's what I'm scared of, the discovery of --worms. And even more than that- them deciding to stay even after seeing that. Gillian Flynn put it best when she wrote, ""a child weaned on poison considers comfort a harm."""

I will start this story before the moment for more context, scroll down if you like. A few weeks to a month prior my ex (let's call them W) had been withdrawing contact. I was worried about them and so was my friend, who just so happens to be W's housemate. Both my friend(D) and I agreed (in a very cathartic conversation) that it felt like we were walking on eggshells around W. One day I go for a walk alone to the bottom of the city where there is a wild field to walk on to clear my head. W messages me, says they are wandering town and wish to meet up. I go to them, walking all the way up from the bottom of the city. They mention they found out D and I had a chat, but they also divulge that they feel they are falling out of love with me. I kept my cool and tried to comfort them in that conversation, since their mental health was struggling. I come away from this confused, wanting to fix things, wondering if I should try with someone who can just fall out of love with me seemingly out of the blue. I still get ignored over the following weeks. My resolve weakens. They seem to be socialising with everyone but me, despite struggling with their mental health. I meet them for coffee one Friday, it feels tense, and I, in the moment, say I would like to step back from the relationship. (I should add here that I am polyamorous, so this doesn't have to be a breakup for me, but a reconfiguration, a step back to figure out where we are with each other, if we are still invested in each others lives.) They take it as a breakup. I respect that, eventhough over the next few days I find it hard to cut contact, I leave them be. This is the moment. The Tuesday after our breakup, after giving them space, W messages me out of the blue. Says they will talk to me. Says they don't want me at theirs, we should go for a walk (it hurts a little but I understand them not wanting me in their home). I turn up in the evening time they set. W turns up to the door not ready for a walk, and ushers me inside into their room. We stand. Talk. They say they can't be bothered to walk. They sit on the bed. I awkwardly perch on the edge. We talk, frankly and openly. It feels like the first time in forever we have been able to talk like this. I share that I've had this song keeping me company over the weekend. Ordinary People - John Legend (""we don't know which way to go, we're just ordinary people, maybe we should take it slow/This time we'll take it slow.) I play it. We cry together, they usher me over for a hug (they always made me come over to them, even in an argument.) Instead of a normal hug, they pull my legs over so I'm straddling their lap. When we separate, they play a song they had on their mind. It's from Adventure Time, it's called I'm Just Your Problem (""Sorry I'm not made of sugar/Am I not sweet enough for you?/Is that why you always avoid me?/That must be such an inconvenience to you"") I mean its a good breakup song, infact it's a good song for an abusive ex. (I still have the horrible thought I was abusive, but when I research it, its just so clear with was being gaslit, and maybe that feeling is a result of of that.) It was a contrast to my song to say the least. Somehow we went from that. To cuddling in their bed. Under the covers. Then kissing. Then they touched me. I said I just want to be touched I don't want anything more, just touching. I guess I just wanted the feeling of actually being wanted by them again. We somehow ended up having full on sex. We cuddled more. I went home. (It didn't feel like I was invited to sleep over.) After this moment, they started behaving like we were together but not. We didn't talk frankly about where we stood after that (we decided that night to try and reconfigure, to see where we stood.) They struggled again. I and my friend were walking on eggshells again. They started sticking their face out for me to kiss them, in public, or around my friend. One night weeks later I had an awakening that I felt uncomfortable not feeling like I had the choice whether to kiss them or not. So I told them, that I didn't want to feel like I had to kiss them when they stuck their face out to me, beckoning me to them. Especially not right in front of our mutual friend (I'm not one for PDA at the best of times, let alone when I'm still figuring things out with someone, it felt like a power move, not affection.) They blew up at this. They said they didn't want to be my friend any more amongst other hurtful things. They said they didn't want to speak anymore. We ended up speaking again. We ended up friends again. Me friend and I ended up walking on eggshells again. It all finished this January when they sent me something that offended me, and I thought, you know what - I'm going to let myself be offended. I shouldn't have to police my feelings around them, and tone them down to be consumable. In all honesty I was barely angry. But they blew up. Later on, they apologised, and on the same breathe said they didn't feel like I was their ""tribe"" anymore. I saw the manipulation infront of me so clearly for the first time. I didn't reply. We haven't spoken since. I'm safe now. I moved cities recently with my another partner. I never have to see them again. All I did today was saw their twitter name on my searches (I don't use twitter much, so funnily enough the only two previous searches that come up are the only two people I unpolluted for my own good) and I spiralled from there. I look back and cannot fathom how my life was so hectic. How disconnected I felt. How I had zero boundaries, and for almost two years have this person take my confident self and reduce me to someone that questions themselves everyday. I'm working on it. I am getting therapy. I'm building boundaries. I put a TW for rape, because eventhough in the moment it didn't feel like it (eventhough I zoned out) I look back and see that that whole evening was not what was advertised, and I see how much they broke down my barriers. How they manipulated me into thinking that forced vulnerability was love. I still can't wholeheartedly call it rape. I still can't wholeheartedly call it abuse because it was all so covert. I guess I wanted to get this out somewhere, because I my counselling is a few days away, and I don't want to trouble my loved ones with those thoughts today. I guess I'm also looking for some confirmation from others. If you gave your time to read this I am very grateful. Thank you. "

Firstly, I just want to say I appreciate all of your vulnerability in sharing your experiences so that others can learn and relate and not feel so alone when its so easy to feel alone. A little background - Im in an amazingly healthy, supportive, loving relationship with a partner who genuinely cares about me. Ive been described as a gypsy and love to move around, experience novelty and I get bored very quickly. I moved in with my partner in February and am feeling a very deep itch to move around. I asked my partner how they would feel if I left for a month or so to go work on a farm and replenish myself. They were not happy about it. It triggered their own abandonment issues, etc... I hate my job, and Im getting very bored with staying home so much (who isnt.) My question is, is this (partially) a trauma response? I add partially because I do think its my natural inclination to move and explore, but to experience this level of discomfort when that inclination is thwarted - could that be trauma? Ive been meditating for 10 years and dont have trouble being with myself in quiet(in fact I generally prefer to be alone), I just feel so incredibly bored and overwhelmed at the same time. Any input is greatly appreciated. Also, any resources where I can read more about this would be awesome. Thank you!!!"

I'm extremely careful with men and very wary of their intentions which is probably a smart idea, but it also makes it difficult to really make a connection with someone. I recently started dating a guy who I get weird vibes from, but he's also got some things about him I find interesting. The other day he kept telling me how innocent he thinks my eyes look and that he's drawn to that, that he kinda feels like I need him to help me keep myself guarded (he basically said that I have such a big heart and he wants to help me become just a little bit colder? lol like, I knew what he was trying to say but why say it like that?). I feel like I'm only seeing red flags and this one kinda creeped me out especially - it felt like he knew exactly what my issues were, even though I made sure not to share anything vulnerable with him (and I didn't!) So I guess I have two questions: 1. DAE sometimes feel that others can sense their vulnerability? I've gotten comments like that a few times and it's scary to think people can read me that well. 2. As someone who's never really learned to trust people, how can I differentiate between red flags and just my mistrust? The one thing above, from a naive standpoint I could say ""aaaw how nice, he's protective!"" but the way he said it made me wonder what his ulterior motives are"

I am trying extremely hard not to run from finishing this post. I have been reading the symptoms and a lot of posts and feel like I can really relate to a lot of things, but then comes a voice in my head saying that I'm being overdramatic, a hypochondriac, etc. I am just beginning my thirties and have been going to therapy for about five years now. Below are the things I think have contributed to feeling this way, but that I feel guilty for even bringing up. My parents both love me very much. My father, however, is an abuse survivor (and in my opinion, undoubtedly someone with PTSD) and from an early age, this would result in him flying off the wall and screaming at me out of nowhere over the smallest things. Such screaming fits usually were never followed by an apology, but rather some gift, etc. On some occasions, he would state things like, ""This is it, we're through. Don't ever ask me for anything again."" Another time, because my mattress had broken and I brought it to his attention, he swore at me and left me with said broken mattress. There are tons of episodes like that that happened at random throughout my childhood. At school I was bullied from first grade on. Children figured out that I was very sensitive and empathetic. It became a game of theirs to make me cry by lying to me. Things got a little better in upper elementary, but in middle school I was befriended by a girl with narc tendencies. She invited me to a slumber party only to tell everyone I was ""the dumb friend good for making fun of"" when she thought I was asleep. She also came over to my house, acted disgusted, and told everyone it was boring. I was at the same time ostracized in middle school for being ugly. If I tried to talk to certain kids, they would act like I was a ghost and simply walked away. In high school I had given up on making friends. I viewed school as a survival game where you mostly had to be quiet and keep your guard up, and try your best not to get hurt. Because I didn't try to trust anyone, I had a better time avoiding any painful betrayals of vulnerability near the end and did make a few good friends. My family then lost our house. We moved into an abandoned family home and didn't even have running water for a little while. We were beyond poor and our relative next door threatened to kick us out onto the streets constantly. My mother and father were both very depressed. Somehow I was able to get into college. I already feel like I have rambled on so much. I spent a lot of my university years blossoming as an adult and discovering what it is like to have friends you want to trust, but always struggled with self-esteem issues. At the age of 21 I moved overseas. I eventually fell in love with a man who after four years of friendship proved himself to be sadistic. His emotional manipulation of me resulted in severe depression on my part. I however had to move home because my father had terminal cancer. The cancer itself has been hard, but I'd like to stop there (five years ago) because this is when I started going to therapy. At the time, I thought I just needed help because cancer= hard and that I had been abused enough to fall into depression, but now, five years later, I am still finding that I have so many issues and not a lot of concrete answers as to why I have them. I guess I'm wondering if my father's behavior, the years of bullying, and the extreme year of poverty I lived in could even be called factors that create CPTSD. I am scared of claiming something for myself that does not belong to me and thus doing a disservice to those that are truly suffering. If you've read through all this, thank you so much."

""I got *boxes* full of Pepe!"" [URL Compassionate doctors and positive emotions stimulate immune system health: URL ""Loneliness and fear were associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes, which are associated with certain diseases. On the other hand, socially rewarding experiences, such as compassion and human connection from respectful care, shifted this gene expression and strengthened the immune response."" * Affective/emotional empathy - feeling what someone else feels in our body aka mirroring their emotions. Too much/poor boundaries can lead to burnout. * Cognitive empathy - understanding mentally how someone else feels aka putting yourself in their shoes but not being overwhelmed by their emotions * Compassionate empathy - understanding how someone else feels while remaining objective and actively imagining them feeling better/not distressed anymore, maybe also giving advice I think this is super important and fascinating. I think as a codependent or any kid raised to be hypervigilantly-empathetic we're too high on the cognitive empathy and too high on the emotional empathy (poor emotional, energetic and relationship boundaries especially when it comes to not feeling empathy for ourselves) and sometimes non existent on the compassionate empathy (for good reason - it can be dangerous to be compassionate towards your abusers while being abused) until we get older, away from them, and begin the healing inner work. I also think when codependents become micromanaging of others, they become manipulative and make themselves the Savior and this makes them low on cognitive empathy as they stop relating to others and start projecting more. When codependents dip too far into being micromanaging of others, it starts to appear almost narcissistic to others because the codependent thinks they know whats best for everyone and only they can handle everything. Which may have been true growing up in a dysfunctional family, but is an unpleasant trait as an adult relating to other healthy adults. I also think its interesting that people with the GG genotype, aka the ""compassionate gene"", give off different body cues that are easily visible to others within 20 seconds of meeting them. [URL Theres also studies that show people with bipolar are too high in affective (emotional) empathy and too low in cognitive empathy. I am not bipolar myself, but this does help me make sense of my bipolar family members and past friends who at times seemed very empathetic people and at other times seemed cruel, even narcissistic, in their inability to relate or care about something or someone. It explains the high emotional projection and lack of object constancy/emotional permanence too (which forms around 2-3 years old), I think. Like if I have a neutral face if I'm watching tv, theyll think Im angry at them if they're feeling insecure and pick a fight with me, not believing that I wasn't thinking something bad about them. Seems like they're projecting their emotional empathy but have low or distorted cognitive empathy because they can't separate my emotions from theirs? People with Borderline also do this to an even more extreme, volatile degree. Therapist Pete Gerlach who does IFS takes the perspective that bipolar is not a disorder or disease, its an appropriate set of adaptations they made to survive their chaotic and unempathetic families. He insists that the manic and depressive ""parts"" are highly reactive inner children subselves that get triggered *very* quickly and dont trust our Adult self to soothe them. But you can learn to do so with IFS. IFS, the truth about bipolar ""disorder': [URL Theres also some research on the GG genotype, compared to others like AA and AG, and psychopathy, BPD, autism, and schizophrenia (ALL of which possess empathy, but have trouble expressing it or processing it. Latest research shows psychopaths do have empathy, thats how they understand how to manipulate other people's empathy..they can just turn theirs off like a switch). Apparently you can have the genotype for psychopathy *and* lower empathy *but* if raised in a good home probably turn out a decent person. The people we typically understand and identify as violent psychopaths have the genotype for psychopathy *and* reduced empathy, *as well as* were raised in abusive environments. The environment triggered them into acting out the lower empathy genotype. Some studies show psychopaths that exhibit antisocial behavior and are in prison have lower resting heart rates. Other research shoes no link between low heart rate and psychopathy when other factors like age, sex, and lifestyle differences are accounted for. I think maybe this is not a marker for psychopathy or lack of empathy - I think its an indicator of hypoarousal/dissociation from trauma because its only present in the antisocial subset of psychopaths that ended up in prison. Theres something similar for these genotypes and Borderline PD. BPD people with AA or AG genotype, rather than GG, show greater vulnerability to developing more severe symptoms as they are more sensitive to their *own* pain but also are less able to accurately read pain in other people's eyes and thus their empathy is less likely to be triggered/mirrored for other people. BPD people with AA genotype and that grew up with depressed mothers have more pronounced BPD symptom severity. *GG genotype people are apparently consistently empathetic and socially open regardless of having a healthy childhood or an unhealthy one (maybe this is innate resilience to narcissistic traits, aka maybe the GG people are the family scapegoats/Empaths/truth tellers/black sheep?)* Also while both AA and GG types are sensitive to social rejection, the GG are able to better cope with the rejection and overcome it by being empathetic and prosocial anyway. Ironically, it seems the more empathetic you are the higher your emotional pain tolerance might be? [URL I know this is super science-y but I want to be clear that I don't think anyone is a prisoner of their genes or their environment (I'm not that pessimistic anymore). Its pretty obvious to me and people smarter than me that healing any kind of trauma is both a top-down process (talk therapy, journaling, biofeedback) and a bottom-up process (somatic therapies, yoga, meditation, TRE). You can start at either end and pendulate to the other side. We know neuroplasticity is a thing, we know epignetics is a thing. Nothing is set in stone anymore. No one is trapped by their genes or circumstances anymore! (Of course everyone still has to make the free will choice if they want to heal or not) I am curious about all these ins and outs, these comparisons and contrasts. Would love to hear your thoughts and anymore connections you all can make :) Edit to add: calling /u/infp-pisces and /u/TimeIsTheRevelator"

I sent him a text right after the fact asking if I could ever call him if I had a problem, to which he responded of course, which I knew would be the case. I got something out of at least texting him to reach out, but I can already feel it slipping through my fingers. I fucking hate this, I hate this. I now have to wait weeks, if not months, in this literal, actual hell of having no sense of time and feeling like I will just suffer for eternity. I had one small window of vulnerability to get out and I missed it. I can already feel this malaise toxic shame bullshit set over me again. I cannot take this anymore, I feel like my brain is calcifying. I dont know if hes going to be there for me the next time this happens. And it only works if Im in a flashback. I know I will torture myself for weeks with brain chatter over this until I give up and stop thinking altogether. It is the only way I can truly heal and I missed it. Im so angry.

If I was drawing, playing an instrument, singing, they would always have something to say like 'If you ever want to make a career out of that your gonna have to get professional help'. When I asked about joining a soccer team when I was 13 they scoffed at me and asked me why I would even wanna do that and dismissed me. Ignoring anytime I tried to be my own person, dismissing any interest of mine that wasn't theirs. And anytime I found a show or something that I enjoyed and they also liked? Suddenly I can't just enjoy it. Everyone else has to watch it at the same time as me and talk about all the things they don't like about it, or make fun of things that are directed my way. They have always done it in such subtle ways tho that if you were to hear them and have never met them before it would sound totally normal; but if you knew their history and how often they just put everything and everyone down you realize the pattern. Living with my bf for 5.5 years has helped me so much in counteracting this. He is always encouraging me to do the things I want. Watch or read what I want, do it on my own time, share if I want or keep it just for me to decompress. I'm encouraged to talk about the things I like instead of the things I don't. Talking about things you genuinely liked would always be a vulnerability in my parents house. And me and my 3 siblings were all raised in it. It took me moving away from that environment, developing a support system, getting on medication, and working on my recovery every day since I've left their house to come to where I am now. I still struggle some days. Each journey has backtracks and times where you lose the path you were following. There will always be days where it's hard and it doesn't feel worth it. But each month that passes, the days are fewer. And each year the dreams lessen in severity. It takes time, patience, and self-compassion to recover. No journey is linear. No path is a straight line. But if you take even one step forward, regardless of how many steps back, you are still moving forward. Even if no one else sees or notices. Even if you have to crawl, fighting your inner demons the entire way. I've come to a place in my life where I can accept my bad days and realize that that's all they are now. Just bad days. I used to suffer so much. And I still have a lot of inner child work to do yet. And I'm about to start going to therapy again as soon as I can. But I'm here. When I thought I never would be. I can enjoy my life and know the people around me want whats best for me. That I can try at anything and fail and try again and repeat as many times as I need to achieve what I want. I""m not afraid anymore of existing as myself. Like every year I find myself more and allow myself to embrace myself. Even when I have hard days sometimes. It takes time, support, effort, dedication, and a whole lot of self-compassion; but it does get better. Life gets better. You deserve a life you can enjoy. We all do. Every single person in this sub."

Today my father went on about the hell he has been living through because his kids have been with him him constantly thanks to covid. He did not say that directly but his ranting culminated in that point even they were unspoken words. My mum is no lesser. She loses her temper regularly and does not think twice about treating her adult daughter like a child and invalidating my opinions and choices and of course, making me feel like a giant burden. It's just so obvious, you know? It is so obvious that my siblings and I have ruined my parent's life and health. They make no secret of it. And I think its shameful that little kids have to grow up knowing that they are probably resented by their parents. In my case I KNOW I am resented. I know have given my parents immense woe. It's so hard knowing that I am one of the reasons behind their misery because despite all of this I still love them. My father also said that we dont compromise at all. That we dont try to make their lives easier. That we dont empathize. And I hate feeling like they brought me into this world to be an emotional servant of some sort, you know? Neither of them ever consider this fact: I never wanted to be born. I never asked for this life or the hundreds of problems that comes with living. None of my six siblings asked to be brought into this world. I have wished I was dead on many occasions but I know I dont wanna die. I just wish I was never born in the first place. He said that one day I'll understand how he feels when I have my own children. But I am never, ever inflicting the devastating ways I feel on another helpless human. I am never bringing a child into this world to resent it. I am never giving birth to a child to make it feel like a burden. Ever. I think the way I have felt like a burden,even if it was subtle, throughout my life has fucked me up. I am always, constantly worrying about how I am troublesome to the people in my life. I overshare because I am pushing their limits, i know I am only seeing how far they can go before they snap. But that's the thing. They never snap. They are always patient with me. They dont show behaviours that make me feel burdensome. And yet. Yet I spend so so so much time worrying that they are just tolerating me. They are pitying me. They don't actually care about me. I am simply a charity case to them. And I try to prove the opposite to myself by really testing their empathy. And they havent snapped yet but with the way I am being, they might snap sooner than later. I cant live feeling like this. I dont want to be constantly scanning for signs that someone is done with me. I dont want to be so fucking scared of vulnerability. I am so sick of over compensating. I dont know what to do. I cant form solid relationships in my life because I always always always feel like a burden. I cant be comfortable because I am always searching for red alarm signs. I am sick of needing so much validation and comfort. The amounts of these things I need is not humanely possible for anyone to give to me. I live in constant fear that one day my life will fall apart around me because these people will have finally had enough of my moping. I cant talk about this in depth with my friends because I am so scared of vulnerability. Gosh I just wish I had a therapist to talk about these things with. I wish I never fucking existed. Life is just not worth the living. I am so sick of it all."

Back in October I went no contact with my mother. (Ive already been NC with my father for years) Long story short, I had a rough childhood. It was your standard suburbia upbringing in that I was provided for however I had an emotionally neglectful mother and absent father who parentified me. Both were emotionally and verbally abusive. It was a chaotic home and I remember as early as second grade asking my parents to stop fighting with each other. They eventually divorced when I was a teen. Throw in some CSA and yeah it sucked. Ive been discussing this in therapy and it led me to a last ditch effort to discuss all the above with my mother. She ended up denying all the awful things she has ever said or done to me, and refused to apologize for any of it. So I went no contact. A few months later I ended up bringing up the subject with one of my younger brothers. He ended up defending my mother, saying that she never did anything wrong, and that he believes parents dont ever have to apologize to their children. I ended up having a panic attack at the table and he showed no empathy. What sucked is that he was engaged and I had said yes to being a bridesmaid. So I had to do all the typical activities not knowing if my mother was showing up, (and her ignoring me when she did) putting on a happy face so not to ruin my brothers wedding experience. Today he contacted me to chit chat about a house he is buying and I realized Im just emotionally done. Ive been on a rollercoaster of trying to put myself back together since I was a kid. Ive been in and out of therapy, hospitalized three times.. Never once has he ever cared about any of it. He has never asked me how Ive been doing mentally. I realized I dont have the energy for relationships where I cant be honest and say Im struggling.. I have a small circle of people where we have that with each other and it is so refreshing. Its not like I want to be mopey 24/7 to people. I just want a little vulnerability. Is that too much to ask for?"

It took so much vulnerability to share but I was just met with apathy by my friends. Well Ive also realized that those people are not real friends, not only for not believing me or trying to believe/understand me, but also because of other times they were just generally untrustworthy and backstabbing. Why do you think we are not believed? Whether its due to physical sexual verbal emotional abuse or other triggering events.

Only recently did she realize I am just genuinely very mentally ill, despite my being diagnosed with soldier grade PTSD. It has nothing to do with her. This is just the first place I have ever felt safe enough to process my abuse in my whole life. Unfortunately, I feel I can't trust her with me when I am anything but perfectly stable. She still assumes that I am out to cause her pain and I don't care about her or our family's feelings when I am having an episode. We are polyamorous, and she has a much easier time nurturing her other spouse, which is confusing and painful to watch because I know she secretly/not so secretly resents him for moving us away from her family. I guess what I'm asking is, after all her angry reactions to my vulnerability, how can I feel safe? Should I just stop asking for her support altogether?"

I often see references to empaths in threads or posts of a spiritual nature. Is this related in any way to codependency and over emphasising or is it something totally separate?

32,vulnerability,CPTSD,Every adult in my life failed me growing up,1,hyffrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/hyffrf/every_adult_in_my_life_failed_me_growing_up/,2020-07-27 07:42:13,"TW: Childhood sexual abuse, self harm, asshole parents I have this overwhelming rage that every adult in my life growing up failed me. This basically means my parents and teachers, specifically teachers that I was very close with, through middle and high school. I had a hard time connecting with peers, so I would spend a lot of time with teachers. Ive been self harming since I was 10. I'm 21 now, and it hasn't stopped. In middle school it was the worst. 6th grade I had a very unhealthy relationship where she and I would cut together, see who had it worse. I had an eating disorder, where I dropped from 160lbs to 113 in about a month. My mom's fav phrase to tell me (not my sister) was ""suck in your gut, suck in your butt!"" One teacher called me out ab it, but nothing came of it. I would cut in the bathrooms, go into stalls and dissociate. I had atrocious depression issues, where I was just constantly sad and in despair and I felt empty, or like this coldness would pass through my entire body. I had friends who thought they were heloing by getting me fresh razors. I accidentally cut deep enough once that I had to give myself stitches. I wore long gloves up to the elbows. Basically I had an ex who told my mom I was cutting, she took my razors and yelled at me for a few hours about it, and I wasn't allowed to have sharp things for awhile. Fast forward to 8th grade. I'd been clean from cutting for years, I started eating again. Something happened where she locked me in my room and I couldn't handle it so I took a pair of wire cutters (I was making chain mail at the time) and dragged them through my leg. And it started up again. I would dissociate when I cut, and I would watch myself do it from the other side of the room. I'd have 70, 80 cuts at once on my thighs. Razors, knives, I'd bruise myself, slam my limbs in doors, burn myself. I still have huge scars on my arms from eraser burns. I'd scratch my wrists until they were raw. Some of the easier ones to do were taking those crystal pens and snapping them so they were sharp, and I'd carve into my palms during class. The breaking point was when I started wearing sweatbands and hiding razors inside of them. I was cutting in class, and suddenly I was like, ""I've had enough."" So I gave the razors to my teacher. He brought me to the front office, I was sobbing. They made me sit alone in the hallway for like a half hour, and then let me in the VPrincipal's office, where I was alone for another like 20 mins. I remember along his wall were scissors, staplers, pens. My drama director popped his head in, asked if I was okay. I think I said yes, though the answer was no. More on him later. The VP eventually came in and said ""sorry, I was trying to sell my house."" And went on and talked to me ab his house. I dont remember what happened for the rest of the conversation, but they sent me to a counselor. She very obviously did not want me there. She said no one could hear us. I gave her the lowdown ab cutting, feeling depressed, etc. She said to me ""you know that just stops, right? When you really want it to, it stops."" Which I told her ""no,"" but she fought me on it and then left, and left me alone in her office for awhile while they figured out where to put me. While I was alone, this crow slams into the window behind it. And I heard through the wall, the other counselor say, ""everything okay?"" And we had a brief interaction, which means that she could hear everything i had said to this other counselor. This counselor, by the way, said in my sister's sex education class, ""when you CHOOSE to be gay,"" and when my sister argued her, just repeated herself and moved on. I hate these counselors. So they brought some psychologist in. I talked to him. He made me do homework and sit quietly while he did something, and ultimately nothing came out of it. Eventually I talked with the counselor who told me it stops, and they called my mom in. My mom has borderline and was my primary abuser. My dad enabled it all. I told them how I tried to kill myself in 6th grade, ab the cutting. My mom cried for awhile. We made a list on ""other things to do when I was sad"" and she gave me a card for Youthline. (I called Youthline once. It was some older woman who told me ""this isnt a chat line"" and hung up on me.) After that my mom asked me if I wanted a therapist. I said yes. Never happened. She basically didnt talk to me for a month, and then went back to constantly screaming at me. The school never did a followup, and eventually I got suicidal again and told them. I went into a room with both counselors and my director, and they told me, ""everyone feels that way"" and sent me out. I think they thought they brought my parents into it, so they would handle it. They definitely did not. My dad never talked to me once ab it. He has a degree in psychology. I tried to see a counselor after that. I couldnt afford it, since I was too young to work and I didnt get an allowance. I saw someone once, who talked to me like I was 6 and said I had anxiety. I told my dad, and he said ""I wish you would have told me sooner."" And went on the porch to smoke. The other times I tried, they turned me away bc I had insurance. It was really fucking dumb. By the time I got to senior year, I had started living out of my car. My mom cheated and they were either both taking it out on me by screaming / telling me how disappointed they were that I was failing calculus (I had a 3.8 GPA otherwise) or fucking loudly at all hours of the day or night. An ex best friend knew what was going on with me. I would sneak into his house to be with him while he had panic attacks, to show me his cuts, to be with him. He knew what was going on with me, the only one. Turns out he had borderline, and when I decided to move across the country for school, he turned all of our mutuals against me while I was trying to apply for college and disappeared for a minute to deal with that. So back to the original issue. I learned recently that I had been sexually abused by my brother and his friend when I was a toddler. When I told my parents, they both said that they always thought something had happened. My dad ""didnt want to disrupt my developmemt"" by asking. I'm 99% sure I told my mom and she beat me, bc sometimes I get hazy memories of that. You can go down a list of symptoms of CSA (childhood sexual abust) and I check off every one. I wet the bed until I was 10. Weird obsession with sex, lack of boundaries, fight or flight, all that shit. Again, my dad has a degree in psychology. He wanted to be a talk therapist. My mom used to work with troubled teens. She told me she knew I had an eating disorder. Not a single teacher picked up on anything. I told people I was living out of my car. That I was cutting. The mental health issues. This director went with me from middle to high school (budget cuts, he transitioned schools at the same time I did. I was in theatre since I was 10) and he never really did anything-- talk to a counselor, my parents, anything. He was there when I needed it very sparingly, but he had other shit to do. No one picked up on the CSA, even though in elementary school I was talking about sex constantly. They sent me to the principals office all the time for ir. I didn't learn boundaries until I was like 19, like how to stfu and not just constantly talk ab sex. My nickname in HS was ""the walking HR hazard"" because I couldn't. Stop. And it wasn't like I wasnt trying, I also have ADHD which I recently figured out, so that doesnt help either because shit just came out of my mouth. But no one. Fucking. Did. Anything. People knew I was living out of my car. They knew I was suddenly flunking classes. That I had a history of self harm, of mental illness. Or even better, that I wad actively self harming or had bad mental illness. My parents, to this day, still won't acknowledge that they fucked me up. My mom is either ""Im sorry I FAILED YOU"" in a fake show of ""give me attwntion and pity, I'm a victim"" in some waif bullshit, or ""well YOU weren't easy to raise EITHER"" and my dad is like ""well she loved you, and we did x y z so you were fine."" I don't know what would have fixed it. I don't know what anyone could have done. I guess I wish someone had taken me under their wing and said, ""it's okay. Let me help you be a person."" But that didnt happen. I didnt have a role model, or a guide, until sophomore year of college. I just suffered silently and dealt with it myself. Now I desperately want someone to care for me, but whenever people do something nice for me, I feel overwhelmingly angry / suspicious / afraid / guilty. I'm learning to overcome it. When I went to college, we'd ordered sheets and stuff that didnt come because the mail room wasnt open. I slept on a tapestry for the first 2 weeks of college, because for some reason my parents couldn't buy me sheets? Granted I didn't think of it either, but I had other shit on my mind, and I was broke from paying to get myself across the country. The last thing they did was smoke me out in the rental car and drop me off barefoot in the rain at my dorm and drive away high. My grandma heard that I didnt have sheets and said ""wtf"" and immediately bought me sheets. When I got them I sobbed. I know logically it was the obvious thing to do, but it still makes me tear up. They were cute, too, with whales on them. I'm just not used to having my needs met like that. What's worse, is my dad makes enough money that I don't qualify for a lot of federal aid or the pell grant or anything, but he's not helping me to pay any of my loans or give me any money to help out in my regular life. The most he gives is $60 a month for therapy, which covers 1 session, and I have to constantly bug him about it. I feel spoiled saying it, but I know he has money to help, at least pay for my groceries, but instead I work 20 hours a week as a full time student to pay for all of my own shit. I got food stamps and he got mad at me, but didn't offer to help. Somehow he can't afford me, but he constantly sends my sister money. We never had food at home, but they always had weed. We couldn't afford to buy new clothes, but somehow they could just drop money on a new ps4 for my sister? I don't know. It's a long post. I just feel so empty when I think of being cared about, and resentful of people who have a close family unit. It's not their fault, but I'm just jealous, and bitter. I just wish anyone could have cared, or helped out, without my having to beg them or get to some stupid level of vulnerability to just be like ""my home life is shitty just give me a break."" Or ""please for the love of god help me, just make me feel like someone cares"". My grades were too good. I was too optimistic, too nice for people to realize shit was up. Too functional. And I guess when I told teachers stuff was going on, I had to follow up on it for them to care, because I was so downtrodden the first time around I didnt bring it up again. I was too ""normal"" for anything to have been wrong. Now, I have people who care, but it feels like it's too late because I'm so independent I just do it all myself, and the expectation is that now I'm adult so I should be taking care of myself, even though I completely skipped out on someone taking care of me. It just sucks."

I have been seeing my T for nearly two years for CEN - he hasn't diagnosed cPTSD but I am fairly sure this is what I have. I have massive trust issues and have never had a relationship or let anyone get remotely close to me. I have always had anxiety issues since I was a child and in therapy we have mainly been working on trying to develop trust and the relational side of things. We have talked about my childhood fairly superficially, but my memories are quite vague and also I am totally living in my head and disconnected from my feelings. The last few months I have been having increasing anxiety issues, mainly relating to career issues but also general anxiety. Probably not helped by teletherapy, in the last 3-4 months I have been getting increasingly anxious about therapy. After each session I think how much I like my T, but when it comes to the next session I am an anxious wreck. I am completely scared of showing any vulnerability or crying in front of my T. This goes back to childhood when my parents would mock or ignore crying and I have always pretended that I am fine as I result, even when I am dying inside. I guess that I feel shame at letting my T see my in a mess, rather than the 'perfect' me. I imagine in my head being vulnerable with my T, but can't do it in real life as it feels too dangerous. I am not sure whether these anxieties are just a reaction of my traumised brain, or whether therapy is not for me. I am so close to giving up, but I would be totally on my own if I did so. I suspect that this may be my flight response kicking in and I need to persevere. Sorry for all the rambling, but I would be really grateful to know of anyones similar experiences or suggestions. I know that therapy isn't always best for cPTSD and I have considered looking into EMDR - however, I don't have any feelings and no clear memories of events and so don't know whether it would be for me. There aren't really any trauma specialists near me and I do like my T a lot. However, I am concerned that I am generally feeling worse than before I started therapy, possibly because I am starting to think more about the childhood stuff, that I have blocked out until now.

Once the lines blur its hard to separate my perspective from the context, my reasoning becomes superficial, I grow duller and more disconnected. I think about how Im a asshole thats probably a negative influence on others. I reflect more about what I say. I begin changing my words and filtering my opinions, slowly constraining my ability to communicate. Knowingly, I distance myself from people that I dont want to hurt, because I think their lives would be better off without my influence; then the weeks go by, and the months start and end, and I gradually get more comfortable being alone. Feels like I've been going down hill since I graduated highschool. I was accepted to study electrical engineering at at one of the best universities here where I live. And I quit after a couple semesters, around the time I got my first job. I was about 19 years old. My first job was at a call center. It was alright at the beginning. My boss was great and he did a good job to keep our team motivated. But the position itself wasn't rewarding enough. After a few bad calls, the days started getting shorter, and the routine started to get exhausting. I quit six months in. Would you rather be ignorant and resilient, or smart and gloomy? As I grown older I'm starting to feel more hopeless. When I was a kid I knew nothing about the world. I didn't care about the future. I wasn't taught to care. We were poor. And to me it seems like you get stuck in poverty unless you decide to make a change. Have you heard about ""third world countries?"" I hate that phrase. In most cases your greatest efforts might not be enough. Knowledge is passed down through generations. Behaviors are conditioned from a young age. Your opportunities are narrowed down before you even take a breath. I try to use that as an excuse to give up. But I can't quite convince myself. Because others have succeeded. I'm either hopeful or delusional. I turned 22 a couple of months ago. I'm currently studying business administration at a private university (which I don't feel it's right for me, but I'm afraid to quit). I'm still living with my parents. And I feel stuck. I'm a man, I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years back. But left it untreated. It's rather hard to talk about it. Because I learn not to show vulnerability. In school the ""weak"" kids get picked on the most. So I became a bully. And then stopped being one before I graduated highschool. I learned more about it. And in in turn, it made a change to my behavior. I take everything seriously now. I got bad at simple interactions. Like flirting with a girl, showing empathy for a friend at a funeral, and being interested and affectionate. When I was going to therapy, my psychiatrist told me that life is like a rollercoaster. It has ups and downs. But right now it feels like I'm free falling. Parachutes can't defeat gravity. I been thinking about the future. Trying not to be so impulsive. To come up with a plan. To ""get it together."" To be less ""toxic."" To be more self aware. To get another job, start dating again, move out of my parents house, and maybe, to another country. But I'm still afraid to take risks. Don't know if I can take another failure. It feels like nothing more than a fantasy at the moment. Coffee helps, I'm grateful for that. I'll stop rambling. I hope this wasn't dramatic. The world has more important issues going on. Stay safe, fight for what you deserve."

A breakup about 2 months ago really sent me reeling and although Im trying to work on myself, Im realizing that I have such little depth to who I am as a person; there is nothing there to really cement my efforts to. Im trying to chat up and hang out with people on Tinder and Bumble, but I keep finding I struggle to connect in meaningful ways. Theres a lot that goes into this, but one wall I keep hitting is that I dont have any passions to share with them, and I dont know how to ask about their passions without having any of my own to talk about in return. Plus, how can I genuinely ask them about something I dont even know how to ask about myself? I have interests, but whenever Ive explored these in the past, I just never felt that spark of passion. Maybe its because Im afraid to have that connection. A lot of the time, I see it as a vulnerability that can be attacked. I dont want to be made to feel stupid or like my feelings are insignificant, because feeling like that is *way* worse compared to any pleasure I ever get from my interests. So I just try to stop having feelings a lot of the time. I dont think Im ready to date or even be friends with anyone yet, but I am also scared to waste my youth simply running around picking up the pieces of my shattered self. I feel like I will be an old man before I realize it, and Ill have nothing to show for the pain of it except a fucking 401k. Im so sick of it. I just feel like I cant keep fighting this fight when I cant even find a place to belong. And then years of ostracism and loneliness have turned me into such a rotten person. I want to tell my poor hurting self that its okay to hurt and its warranted and that I will protect him, but I fucking I hate that person. I hate the shit he puts me through and I hate being cooped up in my head with him. I am NOT suicidal as Im paralyzed by a fear of death, but at least once literally every single day, I wish I would just drop dead without any warning or pain. Existence is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I dont know how to recover when it all just seems so meaningless. This post turned into a lame, rambling rant. Im sorry.

It is like there is too many emotions coming up with the boy that I like, and I dont know what to do with it, it is too intense and early to give to him, and I am a loose cannon so its not good! So? I feel like I split all the emotional energy into having sex or talking to other guys. Its a distraction and somewhat makes me feel safer, like he cant hurt me if I am doing this already. All while demanding monogamy from him. On the surface and in my most present self I feel like I am fully committed to him. This is a horrible fucking pattern throughout my whole life. If I dont like anyone, I dont have sex, I dont date. If I like someone, I need to date, I need to have sex with others. I just know Im too much for one person. I also have a dissociative disorder (unspecified), so maybe there are all different ""parts"" of me coming in. &amp;#x200B; The other thing is that he likes sleepovers, dates, watching movies. All of these things make me feel uncomfortable and I hate them. When we started watching a movie and ""cuddling"" I immediatly started coming on to him. It was like I needed a distraction from that emotional vulnerability and stillness. A survivor of childhood sexual abuse, maybe I jump right into sex for a reason. Then right after doing this, I went home and realized, I wanted to watch a movie with him. That is what I wanted with this guy.. to be more than just fuck buddies. But what did I do? Had sex, then immediatly got up, dressed, and left. I tell him I hate these things, I jump right into sex, and I leave right after.. so I am painting the picture differently and sabatoging myself and a chance at love and a real relationship with someone. &amp;#x200B;"

I used to have closer friends, but felt a constant state of anxiety about whether they would decide to break the relationship or leave (general distrust because of my moms treatment when I was little), and it became too much and was exacerbated by starting therapy, as it was hard to hide something so big and painful. Giving myself a break to process it all and do things on my own seemed like a great idea, and in many ways it has been. But there's been drawbacks, too. With the pandemic, I walled off even more and began to not let people in. Some friends have texted and I even had a phone chat with one friend, but it felt like I had to ""pretend"" to be someone else - someone stronger and more mature, who isn't allowed to complain or be honest or vulnerable. I just haven't been able to be vulnerable for some reason, which is strange since I used to be quite that way and had no problem opening up to the right people. Honestly, it's been a bit brutal to be so defensive and in retrospect it's kind of heartbreaking. I suppose it's hard to be vulnerable when the times you were in the past, someone might take advantage or say something hurtful. In order to be able to go out even to the store or for a walk, I've felt that I had to project strength and put up walls to protect myself, including being quiet and polite but perhaps aloof (out of fear of being laughed at or criticized). It makes sense given my history, as my mom (and later, certain people) seemed to notice vulnerability and tried to take advantage of it, as well as having moved to a new city for two years, which was even more isolating and to be honest, threatening. There's also been a few cases of people saying hurtful things, such as my mother in law, who cares but also says things like ""I would never want my son to be with someone whose parents didn't love them."" I live in fear she'll find out my mom hurt me so badly, and their family will shun me somehow. Yesterday, someone posted here about trusting others and how not everyone is not like my mom, and I could be loved for who I am. It really resonated, and I cried for hours because of the fear I've been living in, including the idea that there's something wrong with me and I deserved to be treated poorly by her and others, and I'm a terrible person. It hurts so badly to feel this way, but it's so hard to describe and probably hard for most others to understand. I'm even nervous writing this as I'm afraid someone will think I'm making it up for attention or being too needy/weird/dramatic. I'm afraid of people disregarding my emotions or telling me to toughen up, because that doesn't seem to work. But something has opened up, and it feels better to go for a walk and not be afraid to make eye contact. Having neighbors acknowledge me felt really good, like a little bit of the wall cracking so I can start to let some light in."

When I was a young teenager, I had a lot of intrusive thoughts that I was a bad person. A lot of it stemmed from my abusive upbringing. And my way of processing things is through verbalization. (Talking about it with friends, family, etc.) Mix that with a lack of boundaries and a ton of trauma, I was unknowingly surrounded by many abusers. I'd verbalize my thoughts to try to process them, and those in my life never said ""it's not true"". They'd agree with them. And they'd help me research, to prove it was ""true"" that I was bad. And find connections to my past, as supposed ""evidence"" of this ""fact"". I didn't know they were abusive, because I was used to feeling unhappy. I thought they were trying to help me ""come to terms with who I am"". SMFH! I ended up having one ""friend"" who always pushed the idea that I was a psychopath. She'd be emotionally abusive if I acted otherwise. (Withhold affection like my mother, since she knew about my past.) She conditioned me to act worse, by providing what I thought was ""love"" (using me sexually) if I acted how she wanted. My sense of self was fucked for years. Eventually I felt so bad that I impulsively cut her off, not realizing how much better I'd later feel. Now years later, I'm a completely different person, and it absolutely sickens me this shit happened. I'm no contact with all of them. I see how wrong it all was. I found out my intrusive thoughts were just OCD and trauma symptoms, and now it ALL makes sense how this ""secondary trauma"" happened. Abusers saw a vulnerability, and utilized it to turn me against myself. So they could control me. There was never actually anything inherently wrong with me?! Now I can **finally** stop wondering if I was the ""crazy"" one abusing them. (By ""secondary trauma"" I mean, trauma that happened after my initial childhood trauma.)"

I had a hard time really expressing the nature of the anger. I told her that it wasn't long-lasting, and when I sat in it and asked ""why,"" the answer wasn't clear. I explained that it wasn't because of our connection, and that me being angry felt like a good thing. In the past I would idolize therapists who were terrible for me - I would shut down any indicating emotion without thinking (why do I do that with toxic people? Is it bc I'm a fawn type?). This is the opposite of that. I told her I think it is because this is the most vulnerable I've ever been with a therapist, and my vulnerability has been taken advantage of in horrendous ways. She explained that it is an emotion that asks for distance, which I liked. She also said that I may feel anger when she breaks unspoken family rules - which is one of the reasons why I felt so mad when she pointed out my dad's responsibility in my abuse, destroying the rule that my dad is never to blame and I was completely responsible for my own actions as a child. Also, we discovered that for me as a kid being unseen was safe, so being seen is fucking terrifying, and it makes me angry. She also said that there is a psychoanalysis theory that a therapist sometimes represents a client's parents. That one feels a bit Freudian/out there to me, but as my friend once said, for as prolific as that man was he must have gotten something right. I plan on holding the latter for awhile and see if it fits. Maybe researching it too. I'm on the fence about it. &amp;#x200B; I said that I'm excited to experience a secure connection that stays secure even when there is anger involved. She said that she is happy I told her, and now it is another thing we can talk about. It was a good therapy session today. Anyone else laugh with their therapists?

They are closer to academic essays than journal entries - this week was 7 pages single spaces, with full citations. My therapist and I recognize that intellectualization is a habit of mine, a habit of my parents and extended family, but also a safe way of me exploring concepts outside of the safe zone of therapy. We have a big focus on my childhood and childhood trauma which has never happened before in therapy. We explored vulnerability for several weeks and the fact that I had no safe vulnerability as a child. One of my goals this week is exploring my shadow self and my inner child. However. I dont think I had a sense of self until I hit puberty. I am a twin and my parents wanted me and considered my brother a bonus kid, as gross as that is. And when I say they wanted me, they had a role and a script as soon as I was born. I was regularly called my mothers doll and wasnt allowed to choose my own clothes (either to wear that day or as a general purchase). I had a job to fulfill and thats what I was supposed to do. I was acutely aware when I failed at my role - whether by being disabled or having panic attacks or not getting the right grades etc. However I dont know I knew who I was, just that I wasnt doing my job. My parents are relatively affectionless even with each other. My punishments were relatively severe - losing the privilege to have a bedroom door was common until I left for college. Until I was about 10 or so I feel like I was just a doll for my parents. My sense of self came with puberty and with it, realizing I was queer and unsafe. (I am a gay trans man.) I dont think I had a true sense of self until then. I dont know how to reparent a child who didnt exist."

This was triggered by a questions that we are required to answer in our next meeting: What is the most difficult or important challenge you overcame as a child? Questions like this are complete and utter bullshit. The correct answer is that I completely lie, make something up that is digestible for everyone else around me, all while feeling extremely uncomfortable that I have to be reminded how disgusting my childhood is that I am unable to share it with humanity. Then I have to listen others who are either also lying, or actually had a childhood where the most ""Important or difficult challenge"" was learning to stand up to themselves against a school bully or learn the value of a hard earned dollar when their parents made them do chores to buy a gaming console. The other options is to tell me about my schizoaffective mother who had yearly bouts of psychosis and abandoned me or sexual abuse, which both taught me my most important lesson: Don't trust people. I've been having to deal with this bullshit for months now, slowly chipping away at me. Today, I stood up for myself. I reached out to my manager and said the following: I understand the need for vulnerability--but I am not comfortable with question 4. It is uncomfortable for me to try rewriting my narrative to be digestible for the team. Questions like this might make those of us with hard pasts feel that we need to redefine ourselves and our stories to be acceptable to the business world. Because answering honestly would derail the discussion and would not be comfortable for anyone, and it is something that I would not want to do in the first place. However, lying to simply satisfy the answer also feels disingenuous to myself and what I've worked to overcome. I am comfortable discussing this with the team if need be. He replied back something along the lines of ""the point of this discussion is to help break some of the stigma of corporate speak and foster discussion. Of course you don't have to share if you're not comfortable, I'm not going to force you to do anything."" I still feel pretty unheard to be honest. What would break the stigma about me recounting the most traumatic days of my life, and why the fuck is it MY responsibility to break the stigma? Am I not breaking the stigma my bringing it to your attention that those who have had traumatic pasts do not necessarily want to either invent entire narratives for themselves or expose the hardest moments of their lives for others to judge? I think instead of speaking about my past, I'm just going to reiterate this point in the meeting. It will probably derail the discussion, but if corporations ask this type of shit--they should understand what they are going to get back. Wish me luck"

He is healthy, insightful, honest, charismatic, sensitive, social, hilarious, spontaneous, assertive and easily vulnerable. I love him, and everyone who knows him loves him. I used to say that he was the one who really raised me. If I end up getting married, I want him to walk me down the aisle rather than my dad. But when we talk it feels like we have had two different childhoods. I will tell him things that my parents have done to me, and he is disgusted and shocked. How did we grow up together in the same house? How did he not see these horrible horrible things? I always looked to him and saw my parents treating him better, and I came to the conclusion that he is the favorite. I accepted it because, well, he was and is one of my favorite people. I was flabbergasted when my dad, years and years later, drunk and forcing me to sit and listen, told me that I'm his favorite and that he is disappointed in all my siblings. That he was disappointed in my eldest brother. But, then, why do they treat him so much better? Why does he get to have boundaries, emotional intimacy, help/urgency/care for his problems and clearly expressed love? &amp;#x200B; Today we had a long conversation. It was lovely. At the end, though, I told him that I'm finally confident and sure in my decisions and emotions, something I never felt at home because of our parents. I also said that I'm worried for our other brother (OB), especially the relationship between my mom and him. My brother said, ""Yeah, their relationship is... ehh."" And I said, ""I think Mom and OB is like Dad and me, and I'm just at a different stage."" My brother agreed. (Enmeshed parenting. I have forced a separation through anger, lots of fights, NC and moving out. My brother and mom still live together and have no boundaries.) I almost feel guilty sharing and talking about it because I feel like it might make him uncomfortable or angry. My parents forced a narrative (at least onto me) that life is happy, we have it WAY better than others, my parents are great and loving, unhappiness comes from not being grateful so we should never be unhappy, and our family is healthier than all. I know that narrative because when I accept another horrible fact about my childhood I automatically think, ""This wasn't supposed to be my story. It wasn't supposed to be this way."" And I know that I felt anger when that narrative was challenged by my therapist. So, I thought he would feel anger too. But he doesn't seem to. So, he knows. He sees it. But we don't talk about it directly, and he doesn't share examples. Knowing him, I would expect him to share if he had something to share. We have that vulnerability and connection. So... how can he understand it if he 1. didn't see it in my life growing up and 2. didn't have it happen to him? How can someone see their parents not only as humans but as emotionally immature humans so easily? &amp;#x200B; I think the next time we talk, I'm going to ask him to speak candidly and tell me how he views our parents. It's hard for me to wrap my head around everything. I am confident and sure enough in my experience that I don't feel invalidated, but I do feel very confused."

Im extremely ticklish and my ex found this hilarious. Even though Id told her to stop because I dont like being tickled. I actually really *hate* it -- it scares me because I dont feel in control of my own body or reactions. She still thought it was hilarious to tickle me all the damn time. We were young (I was an 18 year old girl still in high school when we started dating -- she was in college, not much older but much more experienced in life as I wasn't allowed to get many normal experiences thanks to my dad's isolating me and stuff) and learned from years of family abuse not to have any boundaries, so I never pushed it much. But I still remember one time when I suggested tickling her in return and she immediately shut that down, saying, I *actually* dont like being tickled. F\*\*\* you, \[her name\], for never once respecting a single one of my boundaries. For the numerous times you did things you knew I was uncomfortable with and pressured or guilt-tripped me when I tried to set boundaries -- emotionally, physically, or sexually. For using me, only talking to me when you wanted/needed something, for the majority of our relationship. The more distance from it I gain, the more I realize that she used my vulnerability and relative life inexperience to take advantage of me. For a long time I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but as I get older, I realize that at *best* it was from not caring whatsoever about my feelings nor respecting me, and at worst actively manipulating me for her own benefit. The saddest part is that I had been so forced to abandon my self-protective instincts as a kid that I didn't realize what a red flag it was when she actually told me that she that she actively, intentionally manipulates people. She told me that she basically likes to overshare way early into meeting people so they'll feel bad for her and obligated to like her. And in hindsight, that explains what felt so uncomfortable and wrong to me when she started oversharing from just about the day we met. It was obviously the manipulation of someone who doesn't find themselves likable and is looking for affirmation of their worth, not intended to hurt, but... it was a red flag that should have told me to proceed with caution. I have compassion for her, at the end of the day, because I know how she was struggling herself and she was still very young too. But she took advantage of my not knowing how to hold boundaries to treat me like garbage (in many additional ways not listed here as well), and guilt-tripped me every time I did try to set a boundary. I'm learning now that I can still be hurt and angry, even while holding compassion for her. I need to be. How she treated me was wrong, and I need to stop brushing it under the rug as ""she didn't mean to."" Maybe she didn't, but it was a pervasive pattern of behavior that took place over the better part of a year, and continued even when I expressly said ""This makes me uncomfortable"" or ""I feel hurt by this."""

Or they'll just leave me because understandably, it isn't manageable to see someone dealing with traumatizing shit regularly, even if I keep it in the right spaces, with the right warnings. My neck hurts and all I can think about is how my parents would shove me halfway off the bed to make me get up and I'd spend the rest of my day with pulled muscles. And then I think about everything else they do and did to ""make me get up"" and I feel worse and worse I'm terrified of tomorrow because it's church and I can't rest and I spent the evening hiding in the bathroom occasionally thinking I heard my parents knocking and they weren't i tried sh earlier and it didn't really help. that was a last resort after spending the day spiralling from one thing and then another and trying to distract myself with literally anything else and failing I don't know what to do because I know on some level I write out things hoping for an escape when I know the most people can give me is a response I'm just so sick of it. People talk about me being ""strong"" or ""tough"" or ""like iron"" but i dont want to be that and I feel fucking brittle. I don't want to be strong, I just want to be free from all of this, I don't want to be a fucking disgusting broken adult who people never gave a shit enough to ever help even when I was younger but the years go on and soon I will be I dont want to grow up but im not grown up. enough, I don't want to feel better but I want to feel better, im angry and I want to fucking strangle someone, preferably one of my parents, be able to fucking hit them back, but I'm fucking terrified and paranoid and begging for forgiveness for every perceived or real mistake i make towards anyone because i dont want to be hurt my mood never feels stable, except when i don't feel shit and im dissociating 5 hours in what feels like five minutes cant stop thinking about how much i want to drink the alcohol in the cupboard. maybe it would only make me feel worse but sh doesn't do shit and it's pretty much just desperation and substances are the only thing i can see significantly altering my mental state i just want to know if there's anything that can help. i cant get serious help and i have trauma with therapists etc anyways and my parents control shit to begin with. im stuck because of quarantine now, too. im trying and trying and it's just not enough. I'm not suicidal and my plan isn't anything but a last resort if I can't escape, but I won't say I don't think about it a lot every fucking day. I just don't know where to go, the only way I can talk about shit is when it's more anonymous because I can't bother online aquaintances with this shit and it wouldn't do any good anyways. I try the shit ppl recommend over and over and over again so why does it do nothing??? why have all of my attempts to get help failed or ended in people not even giving a shit or believing? ive started to form a belief that a god exists but they just want to fuck with us through bad events and then good events to bait us with hope before the bad slams down harder than ever until we fucking break. that's the only way i can explain my life so far"

Within my life , I've experienced extreme physical and mental abuse from most of my family (mom and father), was kicked out for at the age of 16 , not for anything outrageous but for defending a sibling. I became a homeless independent and moved in with a racist teacher to the state of Virginia. Later on, I cut ties with her in order to attend college and we haven't spoken since. During my Gap year , which was a gamble, I became diagnosed with a chronic lifelong liver clot that had honestly explained so much of my attention issues. I almost died from dealing with it and had surgery to address the issue a month before attending my University as freshman. This last summer, before my second year, my grandmother passed away and she was one of the few people I could trust. Now in University, I've noticed that although I've made strides, sometimes I've hyperfixated on my hobbies ( I do a lot of music, acting or standup) or romantic potential in the form of some friends. I'm well-liked but I always have this lingering feeling that it's just because I give so much and take so little. I love making people happy. But lately I feel exploited It's honestly robbed me from professional and academic success and I find that in order to face a day , I have to blast music in my head. My mentors , scholarship advisors know my grades suck and they give me so many chances to pick up the slack but I can't seem to sit in class certain days without zoning out or becoming incredibly self-conscious or just remembering events. I see my friends doing well for themselves and they don't struggle and I feel like I'm just stuck in my own personal hell of ruminating everything I've done wrong. I say I want to be a screenwriter but it's so hard to write when people say write what you know and all you know is pain and suffering. When people tell me they love me, I become incredibly upset and avoidant, often leading into a depressive episode. Because they HAVE to be lying. How could I expect anyone to love me when I'm essentially a sad Peter Pan African who's parents didn't love enough to keep me safe? If they hurt me? How am I supposed to foster that sort of strength? The only reason why I haven't ended it all is because of my siblings and the friends who would be most likely upset. And there have been many times I've been close but I've had to remind myself that people will be devastated. How can I believe in love , accept it and love myself enough to be vulnerable instead of hiding behind a dumbass smile, jokes or some art. tldr: cptsd makes my life suck, have trust and vulnerability issues. I'm inquiring for advice?"

I can imagine that being around someone who always acts like they just met you is weird and tiresome, and I really want to stop doing that. I don't consciously mean to, I think i'm vetting them to make sure they're ""safe"" for me to be myself around. Is it too weird to just act incredibly comfortable and familiar with someone when you first meet them, even if it involves faking-it-until-making-it a bit? My first experience watching this happen live was at bonnaroo two years ago, and it freaked me out so much that I had an ongoing panic attack for the duration of the four days I was there. I felt so incredibly out of place for not being as social and open as everyone else, and genuinely felt that I didn't deserve to be there because of the way I am. I'm introverted but I don't think that's an excuse to not be able to start up a conversation, or to barely respond to someone who makes a invitational comment about what I was wearing. I will never forgive myself for one-word responding to a guy who made a comment about a shirt I was wearing that was specifically designed to start a conversation, or at least an interaction. I feel like i'm beating myself up (especially since i'm still heavily stressing about the event as if it happened recently), but at the same time I can't baby step my way to through the rest of adulthood. I really don't understand how I was able to be a social as I was as a kid because at that age I found it so easy to be around people and be anyone's friend. Maybe it's the fact that I was a kid and had .01% of the worries I have now, but still. Is making new friends as easy as just acting as if they're already were your friends? I hope my tag makes sense, I feel like i'm making this so hard because i'm avoiding premature vulnerability that might hurt me in the future, even though that's in no way guaranteed"

53,vulnerability,CPTSD,The 5 domains of healing and how to know if you have the right therapist,1,gmyqy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/gmyqy3/the_5_domains_of_healing_and_how_to_know_if_you/,2020-05-20 08:23:56,"Hey guys! I wanted to share something I wrote about the five different domains of therapy. I know a lot of people struggle with knowing if they are with the right therapist or not and Im hoping this will help. Im specifically coming from the perspective of trauma counseling because thats my background. One of the biggest issues with many therapy approaches is that they will be singular in their healing approach: there are multiple important domains of healing trauma, because it impacts and damages us in all domains. These domains are: -Physical/somatic -Cognitive -Emotional -Relational -Spiritual and creative Trauma impacts our bodies in numerous ways, especially damaging our nervous systems and keeping us in an adrenalinezed fight/flight/freeze/fawn state. Somatic healing includes releasing all the tension and pain stored in body, reconnecting to body sensations and learning to be physically grounded, healing sexually and in relationship with food and sleep, and healing the traumatized nervous system so our bodies can relax. Trauma impacts our thinking patterns and creates negative, shame based core beliefs about ourselves and others. Cognitive therapy teaches us how to challenge negative core beliefs, develop balanced thinking, and shrink our harsh inner critics. Trauma impacts our ability to feel and express our emotions. We learn that certain emotions are unsafe or unacceptable to express, or that intense feeling is unsafe altogether because we were never shown how to regulate and soothe ourselves. Emotional recovery includes learning how to fully feel and express a whole range of human emotion and engage with our emotions compassionately and mindfully. Trauma impacts our ability to develop safe healthy relationships. Many of us recreate shame based traumatizing relationships; or we shut ourself off from the vulnerability of genuine connection. Healing doesnt happen alone. Relational therapy includes joining support groups and healthy communities, healing attachment patterns, learning assertiveness and boundaries, and practicing safe bonding. Relational healing also includes healing by verbally expressing your pain and story to safe listening people. Relational healing counteracts deep shame. Finally, trauma impacts our abilities to be creative or spiritually connected, because we are in survival mode and our brain never goes into ventral vagal which is the relaxed state where we can play, learn and feel freely. Creative and spiritual recovery is different for everyone, but involves finding a sense of connection with the greater world and meaningful expressive and creative outlets. Unfortunately, many therapists will focus only on one or two of these. Common approaches are cognitive behavioral therapy and some emotional therapy, but the physical, spiritual and relational aspects of healing are neglected. We need a blend of all five of these to recover! I dont believe all therapists need to be equally competent in all of these, everyone has different modalities and backgrounds. However if you are struggling to make progress it might be worth considering if one of these arenas is being neglected, or if you have a counselor who is will rounded in the multi-dimensional process of healing."
54,vulnerability,CPTSD,"My boyfriend has been reading to me at night, and last night he finally let me do the same for him.",5,gop8s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/gop8s7/my_boyfriend_has_been_reading_to_me_at_night_and/,2020-05-23 04:46:21,"This turned out to be a long post, but I hope it can bring a little bit of hope to some of you who have trouble with vulnerability. Last night, my boyfriend (31m) and I (26f) decided to watch Honey Boy, which is a film that is based on Shia Labeouf's life. (TW: if you have endured any sort of parental abuse, do NOT watch this film.) After it ended, we were both clearly affected by it, especially my boyfriend (N), who is still in the beginning stages of working through his trauma. His dad was a very angry person, much like the father portrayed in the film. My father was more neglectful than he was abusive, but some of the scenes were extremely distressing, even for me. N was pretty silent for the remainder of the evening. Lately when I've stayed the night at his house, N has been reading to me to help me fall asleep... well, he usually begins by summarizing what happened in the story the night before because I fall asleep too quickly to remember any of it. It's such a simple thing to do for someone, but has been profoundly comforting in a way that I don't consciously understand. It makes me feel very, very loved, and if you've ever been lucky enough to feel loved without stipulation, you might understand what I mean. N is the type of person who is ultra independent and *never* allows himself to be vulnerable to other people. I'm the first person he's ever cried in front of, and he felt terribly ashamed for ""letting"" that happen. He says he hates appearing ""weak"" in front of people, because then they have power over him. It's been something he's worked a lot on over the course of our year-and-a-half long relationship, but any kind of vulnerability is still a huge struggle for him. He didn't want to talk about how he was feeling after the movie, but I could sense that he didn't feel up to reading to me. So I suggested, almost jokingly, that I read to *him* for a change. To my surprise, he didn't immediately shut the idea down. I asked again, more seriously this time, and he agreed to it, which is HUGE. N has really bad insomnia and usually can't fall asleep until 4 or 5am, but he was asleep within five minutes, and he told me this morning that he didn't wake up at all in the middle of the night. In hindsight, we probably should have turned off the movie when we realized what it was about. But I'm not writing this post because of the movie. I'm writing it because of the tiny bit of progress that N and I made on our journey to secure attachment. None of us on this sub asked to have CPTSD. I know I'm not the only one who has a difficult time with romantic relationships because of the ways my parents were unable to love me. But last night after finishing the chapter, I looked at the cute human sleeping next to me, and I thought about how far we have come in the time that we've known each other. Our relationship has been tumultuous at times, but I have to remind myself that we are going into this blindly; neither of us knows what a truly healthy relationship looks like. I really like the inner child metaphor. I think of my trauma as my inner child who didn't receive the love she needed when she was young, and now as an adult I'm learning to love that part of myself. I always think of secure attachment as being present for someone else while they learn how to love their inner child. I can't ""parent"" someone's inner child, but I can love them and support them when being a ""parent"" feels overwhelming. And with N, whenever we are able to show vulnerability to each other, I always say it feels like ""little me"" and ""little him"" are playing together. We get to see each other be silly, and emotional, and to love that innocent little kid part of one another. So whenever N allows himself to be comforted like he did last night, or when we make it through a disagreement without anyone completely shutting down, or when I tell him something I've never told anyone before, it's a reminder that we're growing. Two people with severe PTSD, to whom ""love"" has always been synonymous with ""pain,"" are actually, truly learning to love in a way that feels safe and genuine. And let me tell you, to grow with somebody in that way is the most beautiful thing I've ever experienced."

I have slept a few hours over the past few weeks, nowhere near an adequate amount for my body. Initially i couldn't sleep. I had stopped taking kratom, a substance of which i had been using very large doses in order to help with pain and ultimatley knock myself out. I had planned to quit for a while as i did not like being unnecessarily dependent on a substance, but I didn't commit to fully quitting until it was out of the house entirely. I've always had issues with insomnia when I'm sober, but after a continuous period of sleep deprivation and poor self care/emotional regulation as a result, I'm afraid to sleep. I have been afraud ti sleep before, never really learned to turn off the belief that sleep will make me mkre vulnerable to potential harm and ultimatley leave me trapped. I feel like something awful will occur despite being in a safe, comfortable environment. Im in treatment and imagine the effectiveness may be closely tied to sleep quality, given the massive impact sleep deprivation has on the body. I couldn't think clearly enough to bring up things of high priority-- like sleep. I want to sleep so much. I feel like my body and mind have been ravaged by the loss. I feel horrible, i am consuming eniugh food for an elephant, gaining rapid weight and feeling increasingly uncomfortable. I cant remember when I put on this pair of socks or last brushed my teeth. My recall is poor, my attention span is poor, i just can't think. I hallucinste off and on. I constantly go into freeze or flight mode (I'm not much of a fighter) which makes trying to sleep more difficult for me. My whole body aches. Im in no condition to prevent any harm i am convinced will occur if i doze off, but still im irrationsly afraid of the vulnerability that will come with falling asleep. Before i kept snapping awake when i tried to sleep, now im just panicked beyond what i can cope with and waiting to simply pass out. It has to happen eventually, right? Oddly enough the past few times Ive managed to fall asleep were all times i was very upset over something and my emotions overwhelmed me. Maybe i should ask someone to scream at me until i doze off.. :/ This can't go on, i want to sleep in bed with my boyfriend my heads empty and i miss sleeping with him, i feep.safe sleeping with him. I feel alone and afraid, right now. Body tired, brain wired. I want to take a shower, go outside, feel better-- even my vision is blurry from sleep loss. The other day i spent 30 minutes staring at the full moon on the shower curtain in our bathroom while my boyfriend slept. I had just found the ""man in the moon"" on it for the first time-- despite knowing my hyper focus was relsted to sleep deprivstion i was captured by the blurry illision of a face i found to be significant in my stupid. Despite knowing the celestial face was composed of moon seas and mountains and i hadn't stumbled upon anything extraordinary aside from recognizing how bad my altered perception and ability to think had become-- i still stood there for 30 minutes and it was pretty weird. The ache that has become my body is getting worse and Im still terrified. Annoying and stupid, but experiencing enough panic to find a way to calm myself and do it. What can i do about this?"

Im constantly in their corner  supporting them when they have struggles, annoyances, reassuring them, etc. But as soon as I will mention just the surface of what I have been feeling, having felt incredibly lonely, anxious, scared to be living on my own and take care of myself during a pandemic while my body fights me, Ill either receive something dismissing or just half-assed. Like a single, I know what u mean. And then I cant even understand how to respond to that because no, they dont. Maybe I just dont have the balls to proclaim that. But receiving that as their whole response makes me feel like they couldnt care anyway. These are people I thought I was really close to. Maybe theyre struggling too, and I shouldnt expect so much. I feel so fucking lonely. Ive realized my flight response is strongest, in my tendencies for dissociation and isolation. But when I try to reach out in the smallest amount Im dismissed as if truly, I AM a burden to deal with. Even my roommates who are much older than me will be dismissive because of my age; thinking I couldnt be suffering much because not only am I good at hiding it from my childhood, but of course the life of a 20 year old must surely be MUCH less complicated than a real adult? Im not sure, I think I am not practicing enough vulnerability. I do have a therapist and were able to talk for just 30 mins every 2 weeks because of COVID. But otherwise I feel so painfully unsupported. Sometimes I feel that I have to talk to my parents (abusers) because at least they have always been sympathetic for physical sickness. It feels gross. So uh, DAE? How do you become more vulnerable to create stronger relationships? I dont know what to do."

I just asked a family member to explain their view of an interaction that they had with me where they used catastrophizing language to describe my behavior. With this person, if I am not 120% people pleasing I get dismissed or blamed for how the interaction went because I am more outwardly emotional. With my ASD (as a neurobiological difference this person has trouble accommodating or even validating) I have been trying to hold up responsibilities on my side of things for my stronger reactions. I have adapted my expectations from this person (working on getting better at that) , set a couple of or three new boundaries around when I can talk or do things, have a hand signal for overloads, and text them before I go to do a project or task with them so they know my state. I always communicate after the fact if I cannot in the moment to do repair after a bad/hard interaction, and let them know what I plan to do in the future or how I will work on it... (I am doing all of this more, but I need to implement it as if it were law for myself for sure) What I did for the first time in my life nearly as I get mentally more brave, was to express that is extremely hard for them to have an expectation of me to be extremely 120% docile all the time when we interact (this person has also gone to therapy with me for family therapy and to therapy ASD related so they know what they are up against and have been given suggestions). That I feel sometimes our timing of interactions during transition points is in a way setting me up for failure (not that they were doing it purposely and I clarified that) with me being more reactionary neurobiologically and they being placid most of the time. I explained how I hoped they could also use 3 'rules/guidelines' I am using for myself in our interactions on their side so we both feel more secure when we interacted and we could both walk away feeling empowered with a solution rather than them being sad for me having a reaction of frustration and me feeling hopeless because 'I can never do it right'.( Tail end of that unhealthy interaction type being them reiterating to me I just cannot handle things and they just shouldn't ever ask me etc etc. ...This whole scenario is the crux of my people pleasing borne in childhood, ironically with the same person who parented me and put it in place from the beginning..) * I also used 'we' language and said I valued our relationship and wanted it to be a safe emotional space for us both and explained I did not think it was their fault, but that we both have to adapt some. I also said I could write the three things on a card for them because it helps me when I do that.. (sometimes they don't remember things in the moment due to age) and I would be implementing them more strictly in the future.* It literally feels like I am not being balanced enough because I did not take all the emotional blame on myself. And I feel almost like my brain tilting with a new reality inside my head...I worry because I can hear the hurt and concern in their voice, and that they still seem to think I am saying they are setting me up for failure, when I said it was a setup for failure in general that we both engage in. (Which I also tried to clarify) But, I also know I am doing everything I think I can and it is not normal to take all the blame on for everything with everyone. I'm just quite terrified... I know I'm not perfect (as humans aren't) and I don't want to gaslight or invalidate someone else inadvertently because that is what I have been subjected and maybe I just cannot see it... But generally I am VERY conscious of my wording.. I thought I was assertive, but with the ASD I can ramble a bit so I even tried to cut myself off a little every now and then to see what he had to say, but it was still lopsided with regard to my speaking time VS his. Basically my ANXIETY and OVERTHINKING are on high and I just want someone who has been at this point to tell me it does get better, and things that may be patterns you may not recognize in your own communication can be overcome, and that there are people out there who will work with you on it if they see if VS shutting you out. I'm so worried people will say I am toxic as I am still unlearning some coping behaviors and untangling the codependent cptsd jumble."

When I was twelve or thirteen my father was yelling at me (he would insist that he wasn't actually yelling and therefore I'm lying and making false accusations) in the family therapist's office. I got overwhelmed and buried my head in my arms and implored the therapist to please *make my father stop*. The therapist told me, without any sympathy, that I couldn't just hide and I had to hear my father out. It was clear during the incident and from the later report that the therapist thought my distress was fabricated, an act. He wrote about my ""demeanor of a wounded girl"" and how I ""exaggerated my level of emotion."" He thought I was putting on a performance, acting like a hurt child so I wouldn't have to listen to my father. And I don't know whether he was right. There was part of my brain that was aware of how I was being perceived. I normally played the role of the mature-for-my-age precocious and somewhat jaded youngster, sharp edges and never vulnerable. I was desperate to prove that I wasn't a silly weak child. I was desperate to be heard and taken seriously. But in that moment I wanted my father to *stop*. I felt like I couldn't take it anymore. And with a third party there, a witness, I decided to play the victim role. You can be sure that I would never have reacted like that when it was just me and my father. I wouldn't give him that satisfaction. I fought back. I didn't back down. I'd die before I'd let him feel like he'd won. So I'm sure he knew my performance was for the therapist. I was seeking the therapist's protection from my father. I was the hurt child and I wanted him to make my father stop attacking me. Was that a lie? Was I faking it? Twelve years later, I still don't know whether my reactions are genuine. I'm consciously aware of how they'd be perceived by a real or imaginary audience. Does that mean it's an act? If I can choose to react like a hurt victim or shut down all my emotions and not show vulnerability, does that mean that it's an act either way? Is this all a performance? Is publicly questioning whether this is all a performance part of the performance?"

It's the easiest thing to do now that everything is done via videoconferencing. I don't really discuss this with either therapy modalities because it's too raw and I'm going to dissociate and quit if I bring this up to my private therapist (whom I don't trust with this kind of vulnerability). I've been literally sitting with one part that refuses to come out, for about a month, daily. I figured giving it airtime would probably help more than stuffing it down, which hasn't worked so far because it always comes back up at the most annoying and difficult times. Welp, now I'm struggling with background thoughts of suicide every day. This is the actor that disables everything else... it's not even a voice, it has no personality, it's best defined as ""unworthiness"". I tried describing it metaphorically a few months back in here to give it a face, but whatever description I gave doesn't cut it. So it's not like the inner, wounded child that is so easy to ""see"" and which most books say ""Learn to love it"" (which I can't); this is the part that feels ""This inner child is defective, just kill it, ignore it, because it's worth nothing."" I can't love my inner child before I get rid of this hidden monster. It's not the adult actor that's functional and gets things done... This is the part that tells the adult ""You can't ever catch up. Give up. Your life is worth nothing, you've accomplished nothing, you are nothing to no one, even you."" But it never speaks. I'm the one verbalizing what this part says, ""it"" just feels *at* me. That's how I know it's probably the sum of all my defense mechanisms back then; the need to be invisible to avoid constant rejection, the need to avoid doing anything because it might be done wrong, the impossibility of starting anything new because I'm always too late to become ""really"" good at it, so why even try... it's the sum of all my self-abuse: ""I am worthless, I will always be worthless, just give up, kill yourself now, die"". Does this make any sense to anyone, is this familiar in any way at all? For a different part of you, maybe? I feel like this thing is strangling me every day, every day is a losing battle because of this part. But it doesn't want a voice. It just wants to keep killing me, therefore I keep considering suicide nonstop. Or maybe the problem is that this is its voice, and I need to figure out how to shut it up for good?! Ugh. Any inspiration here? Please note, I'm just going to ignore comments that suggest I talk about this in therapy, because I don't want that to happen. If that's what you have to say, you can't help. Thanks."
60,vulnerability,CPTSD,Balance between asking others to accommodate my triggers and coping from within myself?,2,fv2f49,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/fv2f49/balance_between_asking_others_to_accommodate_my/,2020-04-05 08:12:02,"Hi all, Thank you in advance, I've asked so many questions in the last week since looking for online CPTSD forums and everyone has been so helpful and thoughtful. Anyway, something I've been contemplating is when to speak up for myself when I'm triggered and when to cope from within myself. For instance, my mother used to spitefully give me the ""silent treatment"" when I would try to get my needs met. So, it is triggering when today as an adult others make jokes--with harmless intent--about ignoring me, such as ""oh, do you hear something? Nope, I didn't either,"" not to mention being ignored or neglected in actual ways. That quote was a real life example, and I was vulnerable that day (psychologically un-armored, actually, which was a sign of progress) so that single moment triggered a cascade of deep sadness that lasted the whole day. So on the one hand, it seems unrealistic and counterproductive to my recovery to protect myself from something that occurs in everyday life--feeling left out or ignored--by advocating to others about my triggers. It might be better to practice thought-correcting and having distance on those feelings of hurt. On the other hand, however, being open and connecting through vulnerability is important to my recovery as well, and speaking up for myself is a strength. But then, maybe sometimes it's okay to just protect myself, even if it's not best for the trajectory of my recovery, just to give myself a break? I'm sure this is something all of you have to navigate in your daily lives, so I would love to hear your thoughts."
61,vulnerability,CPTSD,(DAE?) I don't know if I know how to show or feel care for others.,1,fwwep4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/fwwep4/dae_i_dont_know_if_i_know_how_to_show_or_feel/,2020-04-08 10:41:51,"I had this striking realization today. A but of backstory: I've been needing a lot of space from my romantic partner recently communication wise, largely because he triggers me more during the last month of so of intense cptsd healing/deeper therapy I e been going through. Memories come up and there's a lot of fear, and I think he gets why I need extensively more space. He is totally respectful of this and we have this understanding though I still experience waves of guilt, which I believe are tied to what I view as the status-quo/typical standards in our society of how to act in a romantic relationship (as a woman with a man, or as a partner in general). I believe I am going through this epic breakdown of letting go of these ideas of what a relationship must consist of... Ideas that came from outside of me and my experience, and likely don't line up with my lived experience, my actual needs and desires, and my capacities. *The striking thought I had today was that I don't know how to care for or about people. And this especially came up in terms of my partner. * It's simple but it's profound and it rung true in my heart, somatically speaking. In my life I have few relationships I am regularly or actively engaged in. I have 2-4 friends, a partner, and about 4 extended family members I'd include in that relationship group. And a smaller number of people than that are people I'm engaging with once a week or more. I went over in my head how I feel about this people, and how I show or experience my care for them... My two closest friends I care for. My partner... I am not sure I care for him. I'm not saying I'm incapable of care... But I see no reason to care (and it's weird to say that, considering how much he's given me and we've experienced together, but there's truth to it). Or is it the traumatized part(s) that sees no reason to care? If we have been together this long (a year) and I still feel heavily guarded and/or disinterested in experiencing and extending this care from my heart, what's really going on here? I have to separate my oft triggered people pleasing tendencies from the actual desire to open to caring for another. There is not only vulnerability in caring for others .. there is also a sense of the unknown to me, as a person who has struggled and been in alarm mode for so long. Joy is practically a foreign experience to me. And to some extent, so is (opening to) genuine, freely felt, freely given care for another. Is this a common CPTSD experience? Anyone else feel this? I'm curious what you e been through with it"
62,vulnerability,CPTSD,I'm coming to terms with it,1,fyf4ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/fyf4ec/im_coming_to_terms_with_it/,2020-04-10 22:36:41,"I got triggered a few hours ago. I think that was my first time after realising I have trauma. My first post on this alt was about it being hard to accept I'm a victim. My hands started trembling and I started feeling nauseous. My stomach felt hollow. Same stuff I've felt before but dismissed as just stress from conflict with my abuser. At first I kept telling myself I'm faking it, that I'm forcing myself to shake and feel sick. Poor dumbass. The trembling got worse and I kept tearing up but not bursting out crying, like in what I thought were 'real' episodes. Fortunately I had people on a Discord server comfort me. They really helped a lot. They told me to breathe deeply and squeeze something, and to treat myself like someone's who's vulnerable and delicate, like a child. And to drink water. It was really hard to do all of those things. I kept forgetting. I only managed to embrace the cat plushie I have but I kept forgetting about it and putting it back. But I got through somehow. Afterwards I made a funny meme to cope!! At first I made jokes about myself doing it for attention or placebo effect or whatever. As it went on I started to realise that no, I am not faking it. This is real. This is a real CPTSD episode. I have trauma and things don't 'just' make me uncomfortable, I get 'triggered' by them. And that this should be taken seriously and it would be best if people who are listening to me panic would be considerate of my feelings and my vulnerability to negative accusations. Typing that out feels painful. I feel like I'm selfish, overemotional or self-pitying, like I've been told by some people. I feel entitled. It feels gross. I feel unlikable. Anyways, going through that was very unpleasant. I've gone through this before but I just cried it out in bed because I thought everyone hated me and that I was overreacting. But for some fucking reason, this time I felt like I was starting to accept stuff. Confirming that it's not my fault, that I'm not faking it. It was real and I couldn't stop it. Typing that out stinged a little bit too. Glad I expressed that. On other terms, I've been insomnic. I don't think about bad stuff all night, I just can't fall asleep and I don't have the willpower to put my phone away. Could be because I messed up my routine. I don't know what's going on. I slept 1 hour last night because a neighbour's baby woke me up. The day before that I started getting heart pains from 3 hours of sleep. I just took a long nap (but not long enough) after I got home from therapy and stayed up all night chatting with people online. What do you think I should do? :c Thank you for reading!!"

Everyone I know is struggling, having meltdowns. And I havent cried or had a real bad time about it yet. Its like my brain prevents bad things from sinking in. Jokingly I told my therapist eh, Ill have a meltdown about it in like 2025. When everyone least expects it. So she was like why not now? What will happen if you have a meltdown? Ill lose control or scare my kids or upset my husband. And then what? Ill feel guilty for losing control. Once I start I might not come out of it. If I show vulnerability someone will take advantage of it. So this week I was supposed to be meditating to just see what would happen. Trying to release control. I got nothing. Some awful nightmares and a huge numb blank spot. I am wondering, since so many of you have done a lot more work than me... What put you back into experiencing things in the present?

I am trying to determine if this is an individual thing or something rooted in trauma. Mystery as in, ""I crave to be known but not seen."" I want to be rich and famous for something good in this world, but I dont want credit for it, or anyone to know its me. I fall in love with people over the internet, mostly because I dont see them. I dont want a photo of them, I dont think about it. I used to run away in high school and never wanted anyone to know where I was.. in college I learned not to share personal information or my vulnerability with my narc family/extended family because it is used against me. So mystery is safety, and it also gives me a sense of control. As a kid I remember, I buried a box in the garden of my absolute favorite things, hoping that someone years and years and years would find it. When I moved out of my family's house, I wrote a little message inside my walk in closet, in this area thats not easily accessible, hoping that someone that moved in next would find it. In alllll the rooms I sublet, I leave secret notes or hidden artwork or little things like that. I had a really good friend on reddit and we talked 247, he would often delete his usernames impulsively when he would get in fights on here or whatever, but would always message me on the new ones right after. When he deleted his username once, I deleted mine and changed it. So I never could find him again, its the mystery and wonder that keeps me from feeling sad or rejected. Just looking at the moon and wondering if there is someone else doing the same thing, at the same moment. Its magical to me. I keep lots of journals for when I pass. I think sometimes I am so effortlessly a mystery. The severe neglect, loneliness, lack of attention my whole upbringing.. Its just me. Ill be a regular at the coffee stand every single morning, then one day..... Im gone. I move around a lot and do this. Any thoughts guys?"

Im 21 and I dont even have a safe space to cry. I feel completely hopeless and alone. I feel nobody will understand me or be accepting of the way I feel. I feel no matter what lengths I go to to handle my own cptsd as maturely as I can Im told that I imply something I didnt mean to. I tell him over and over again that its not his responsibility to protect me and that we just need to find compromise and help manage my reactions within reason. (By that I mean sometimes it helps me to know why, which I feel is a fair thing to ask for compromise from a partner.) Its incredibly hard for me to tell someone not to give me what I need but I ask for them not to because my needs arent healthy. I tell him not to anyway because I know my needs arent healthy and theyre not right. I thought I was doing the right thing. I was honest with how I felt but I try everything in my power not to make him feel guilty, but when I do that he gets mad because he feels he cant take any responsibility. But when he thinks Im implying responsibility he gets mad because he doesnt want to feel responsible. Im so confused and I feel powerless because I literally have nobody else. No one. I hate myself for being born and I hate myself for who I am and how emotional I am and how sensitive. I wish I would die, I cant imagine how it wouldnt be better for everyone around me. My trauma therapist always says to call her if I need anything but idk how I would do that? I would also feel too rude and burdensome? Also even if I knew what to do I have nowhere to go where I can talk freely. He literally said I dont like that you got triggered. I cant help it. I wish I could. My last post explains the situation in more detail and also how I handled it. I feel like I was trying my best to be healthy about it? I didnt tell him no or guilt him I just said I just need understanding that this is triggering for me but I am trying to work through this the best I can. Like idk I feel thats reasonable? Im so so tired of being alone and Ive been alone all my life. The only time I havent felt alone was when I was with a man 30 years my senior who was obviously taking advantage of my emotional vulnerability. I feel pathetic and worthless. I dont see that anyone wants me or why they would. I dont mean on a romantic level. I dont really have friends either. Im only useful to people when I dont feel or I dont show my emotions. I am so desperate to talk to my therapist because I feel like shes the only one who has a chance of helping but again idk how and I feel bad because its her day off and even if it wasnt shed be busy with clients. Im tired of this, Im tired of myself and Im tired of working so hard in therapy, spending hundreds - thousands of dollars a year on therapy and psychiatric medication for nothing. Its not like Im not making progress but Im still miserable. Im still incredibly fragile. Im still worthless."

Others tried to creep on me. Friends would betray me. Nobody was safe. Nowhere was safe. Even when I tried to isolate myself and be alone, the time I felt safest, it was deemed wrong, strange, and it was actively discouraged. It's starting to make sense now. The hypervigilance. Anxiety. Depression. Paranoia. Isolation. Trust issues. Issues with vulnerability. Feeling like I'm always being watched. Feeling like my life is constantly falling apart around me, like I'm stuck treading water during a storm and desperately trying to drown despite growing more and more exhausted and burnt out. Children aren't born anxious. They aren't born depressed. They aren't born afraid."

But recently a friend pointed out that Im not actually vulnerable and it really took me by surprise because I never considered that I struggle with vulnerability, but I realize that I am extremely guarded with my thoughts and emotions and when I try to express something past the surface level, it feels like a literal pressure on my chest keeping me from revealing anything of depth. I started journaling and recording voice memos to try to get more vulnerable/in touch with myself to help but I feel like even in my own journals that no one but me can see, Im so blocked up. When I cry I get angry with myself as if I deserve punishment. I know this most likely stems from emotional abuse growing up but I really would love to know how to be vulnerable. I think its always kept me from having any fulfilling relationships or romantic encounters because I can never fully open up and just pretend to. Ive been in therapy for a few years and that hasnt helped me much with my vulnerability issues. Is there anyone whos struggled with this and has a guide or book or personal experience or anything to get past this hump? tldr: i dont know how to be vulnerable with myself or other people and its keeping me from deeper relationships. advice?"

Despite everything that he put me through, I tried hard to avoid the police route and opted for civil court for a restraining order because I didnt want him to have a criminal record, and I genuinely figured that it would trail off or die out. That route was harder, people were looking at me like I was just some silly girl because I wouldnt call the police, but I fought to try to make the least trouble possible whilst also keeping myself safe. We were together for so long and I didnt want to hurt him, I just wanted to separate like I had asked but it was like he was forcing his way into my life. The whole time that I was pushing for this and avoiding much easier routes out of worrying about getting him into too much trouble, Id get emails oscillating through fury, vitriol and begging, calling me disgusting and saying unthinkable things to me, then asking me to marry him again and the phone calls in the middle of the night were going past 100 back to back, I had to put my phone on do not disturb and change my do not disturb settings to even be able to use it because the calls were so fast that I couldnt use my phone or wait him out. Though I had already drawn a boundary by blocking his number, he would use different phones and any avenue to get to me. He knew where I lived and I was/am stuck there. It felt like some sort of entitlement to me, violation without caring about the impact on me because what do I matter? I was just an object, or an extension of him that hed earned. A lot of this stuff ramped up and continued for a full year, him doing things like showing up at night at first, telling me that I owed him a place to stay and Im awful and evil for not letting him in, letting him be here and then when he moved away (forcibly), telling me that he would be coming to me when he came to London on x dates, and me having to pack a bag and stay at hotels at short notice to avoid interacting with him. His presence in my life was completely forced despite what I wanted and inexplicably, it didnt wear off or die down. Youd think that after spending so much time knocking me around, hurting me and breaking my spirit, he might just call it an L and move on when I left, but he didnt. Recently, Ive been doing a lot of intensive self-work and self-evaluation, Ive been proactive about turning to face the hard reality of everything recently, how things had truly affected me and begin to change me, and have been focused on proactive work on trauma habit correction, cognitive restructuring and rephrasing, making positivity a habit, living mindfully and staying present, practising radical acceptance, working on my mindset, taking back my affinity towards vulnerability even under stress, etc etc. Ive been working hard every day, and eventually, I had begun to feel a lot more functional and open to seeing everything that I had protected myself from to survive. I mention the self-work because I dont think that I could have finally done this without it. For the first time in so long, I had enough self-regard to think, hey, I dont think that I deserve this. just because I can endure it, doesnt mean that I have to and one morning, I woke up to yet another thing from him, and I thought about how much grief he has brought me over the last decade, I thought about the time he took my walking aids from me and threw them over a steep drop over an underpass, screaming in my face on the floor when I tried to get away, I thought about the time he broke my nose and the police pulled him off from on top of me, I thought about him screaming at me about how worthless Id always be and telling me that it was no wonder that my mother felt the way that she did about me from birth. I thought about him taking my fears and things I hated about myself that I shared with him in a mistaken place of trust, and using them to hurt me out of spite, just because he could, calling me cold any time that I didnt open up and take it until I stopped resisting. I thought about how much more cruelty that he thoughtlessly brought down upon my life just because he could, how he took my trust and used it as a battering ram and I looked at this new correspondence from him, this newest attempt at manipulation and this veiled attempt at demanding my attention and before I knew it, the phone was in my hands. For me to have endured somebody forcing contact with me for over a year because I didnt want to hurt them by insisting upon my needs and boundaries was not okay. I called the police on Monday and theres still some residual guilt and turmoil that I think is just instinctual for me. That part of me that thinks that Im just making my pain everyones problem, and the part that thinks that I probably could have endured that instead of causing a fuss, it would probably have stopped soon when it was on an upwards trend, subconsciously erasing the fear, the panic attacks, the night terrors, the nights where I laid still in the darkness whenever I heard a sound outside because my brain was convinced that this is it, hes here, the nights watching my phone buzz non-stop for an hour willing it to stop for long enough for me to pointlessly block this number, and wait for a new one to flash up. Im starting to see another side of this. Its okay for me to have boundaries and to insist on somebody respecting my boundaries by leaving me alone when I ask. Im not just a receptacle for peoples shitty behaviour. Radical acceptance and living each moment as mindfully as I can have both helped me feel calm despite the temporary unrest around me instead of feeling like Im falling apart at the seams and holding myself together until I can escape, I dont feel like Im crawling through this part of my life on my hands and knees anymorebut I dont have to accept *this.* Im slowly understanding that. Its not okay to treat somebody like this and Im working to have that truly sink in. Im confronting my own management of my trauma and working at gently rediscovering my vulnerability and openness, I dont like some of the ways that trauma has affected me but basic respect isnt a luxury only available to me if Im perfect, so long as I treat others with respect/compassion and am showing up regardless. If Im kind to others, its okay to ask them to be kind or at least considerate to me and Im done with people using what they know about me as a way to hurt and manipulate me. I dont want to let him ruin me. Im starting to believe that Im an okay person again, and in realising that, Im realising how poorly I thought of myself and what I deserved before this because of him, and I just kept letting him poison me. Im sorry for rambling and ranting; I feel jumbled and terrified still, but I also feel more free and hopeful each day? Im just tired of other people treating me however they want and disregarding my well-being, but I can regard myself, and make my own experience soft and kind and I can say no when I need to. I dont fucking have to take this, and Ill say it 1,000,000 times to myself until every part of me listens. Im not expecting too much, none of us are. If youre trying every day to be a good, kind person despite everything that youve been through, its okay to pull away and say enough is enough if somebody is asking too much of you. So, I called the police and Im hard at work each day not to regret it, because I think that expecting me to just keep enduring and taking it is shitty, inconsiderate and cruel and if hes going to be cruel and inconsiderate to me, I dont owe him my protection. I still dont want to hurt anybody but Im not going to be a shield for my own pain to continue. I cant believe that it has taken me so long to see how not okay that is, but I guess thats being a survivor and having the misfortune of meeting people like this when youre vulnerable and malleable for you. I hope that this doesnt sound shitty and Im sorry if it does, Im just so done and this shouldnt be something that I should be ashamed of regardless of what that little niggling instinct tries to tell meIm hoping that I just saved myself."

Before I said anything, I used to get so anxious that she or my team would notice my puffy eyes or that I seemed ""jumpy"" -- I would be surprised that they didn't notice! Of course my depression made me insecure and worry unnecessarily. With her support and validation, as well as the empowering experience of rewarded vulnerability, I feel like I can be my real self at work.

I suddenly had this awareness of this untouched space in me that I never show to him and I'm not sure I show it to others either (not even sure I spend time there myself). It was cordoned off within me and he knows nothing of it, at least that's how I felt in that moment. What led to this awareness? Probably his extreme vulnerability and neediness he was showing to me while we were cuddling. He was so open in those ways maybe it led to me seeking the part of me that would express longing if it could or if I let it. I'm not really sure what that thing was I became aware of in me and it might even takes years to unravel more but it's part of this story. He also said something about how once I set my mind to do something, I can accomplish most anything. I relate to this and this is a quality I have, though I have had to temper it with patience and slowing down in order to really heal and process grief. We were talking about whether we would want to have kids and he showed some uncertainty about whether he thought I'd be a good mother... Which led to him mentioning how I have a lot of power when I set my mind to do a thing. And so he said, ""If you were going to have a kid, you'd have to choose it. It's have to be intentional. And then I think you'd be an amazing parent."" And then we went on to say something like, ""you are a person who really has to choose, just like you haven't quite chosen to be with me..."" He wasn't saying this in an accusatory way nor did i feel attacked, to be clear, but I actually really get what he's saying and there's truth in it and it is somewhat insightful to my way of live and being... At least for a long time it has been. So that might have been what triggered my awareness of that hidden, intimate place in me that I hadn't shown him at all. This relationship is the deepest I've had. I continue to face a lot of fear and resistance within myself about being so close with another person and continue to take everything very slowly. We've learned a lot together and separately while in the relationship. He is healing cptsd too and has actually been working at it longer than I have. Will I ever ""choose"" him, or should I stop trying? And hey, I get that maybe there's nothing unusual about this... Maybe it's just my slow process of building trust, and the only way to find that is to persist, continue exploring and building relationship with him. It just feels so incredibly unknown. Like many here, I have no models from my childhood of healthy, happy relationship - just distant relationships on TV or in other peoples' lived I couldn't really understand (but could be envious of or compare my relationships to, as unhelpful as that usually is). No roadmap. I do my best to check in with my desire, which can also be confusing and inconsistent. I continue to struggle with comparisons often, and continue to fear this relationship will never feel perfect and complete and like the ""right"" person or match. Does anyone relate to this challenge of really fully putting themselves into a relationship? Really committing, deciding to fully ""be there""? One of my cptsd related fears is that I will devote myself to something, like a relationship, and somehow simultaneously deny my own feelings, and end up deeper and deeper in self-denial and increasingly revolving around the other person, effectively draining myself of life energy and joy. That's because that happened before, both romantically and as a child with family. So, not seeking advice, but do you have similar experiences or stories? No need for solutions. And if you're in it now like me, and you are confused and scared sometimes too, I also welcome your sharing of that."

I recently made a match on Tinder, but due to social distancing, theres no way exactly to meet in person. Weve been talking for two weeks and last Sunday we had a text exchange that gave me a feeling Ive never felt before. She is literally a nearly ideal match for me. As we talk about stuff we like, I can just check off every box of compatibility. The feeling I realize Im having is Im falling for her. I dont want to share details, but there was an amazing vulnerability over text that happened to both of us that left us in tears on each side of the screen. We had to both admit it was powerful. I didnt know what to do with this feeling because my entire life, Ive never felt something like that. I told my friends, how the hell does this happen? I dont deserve to feel a love connection. I didnt earn it. But Ive been doing a lot of work on love being reciprocated not having to be earned. So I was able to kinda get over that feeling. I wanted to take the next step and see if shed meet up from, you know, 10 feet away because she said you never know if the chemistry youre having online will translate to real life. But she hasnt really responded to my invitation at all. Which I was feeling weird about because if theres this crazy chemistry going on for both of you, wouldnt you want to meet in person. I ended up telling her that I am falling for her. That worried her because she said she didnt want to hurt me. Managing expectations and all. And I understand, but this is not the first time Ive heard this from someone Ive been attracted to. In fact, Ive heard it a lot. It went over my head the first time, but when I went back and read what she wrote, I was like she was kinda warning me that something going on for her would hurt me. I dont know what the something is, but Im getting this picture of every single time Ive met someone Ive been interested in. I get rejected often because the person I have feelings for doesnt want to hurt me. And all I can think of (Im thinking way too much for sure) is that its because Im too nice of a person. Its easy to tell someone whos kind of a jerk to take a hike if you dont like them, but its harder to tell someone who obviously cares a lot about you. I think this is what shes telling me. Managing expectations so the both of us dont get hurt. Whatever comes out of the situation, I am realizing how much this dynamic has shaped my romantic interests. Its like I get rejected before Im even given a chance because no one wants to be mean to a nice person. It also explains why Id feel so hurt because after I get rejected, the woman Id be interested would go out with a total d-bag and then come back to get consoled by me after they had to break up with him. I put on my Tinder profile that Im the friend zone champion. Thats because Im too nice to date, but too nice to not be friends with. How common is this? I know Im not the only one, but its even harder when I find someone as wonderful as the woman Im texting with now, but who doesnt want me to be falling for her because she might hurt me. Feels confusing. Anyone got more insight on this?"

I am profoundly sorry we have all endured what we have, but thank you for your vulnerability and strength. It means so much to me! I guess I'm just looking for a bit of support right now. I don't have many people in my life whom I can turn to, and I'm desperate for connection and love. Last week, after trying to tell my dad I was not comfortable with the conversation (he was venting to me about my sister; saying hurtful) he said ""go f\*ck yourself!"" and hung up on me. The next day, without warning, my phone was shut off. I had previously been on his plan because it was a free addition, and although I am completely fine paying for my plan, this was intentionally spiteful and meant to hurt me. I had to get a new phone number and lost significant contacts because mine wouldn't transfer without his approval, and I didn't want to ask him for anything. Two days later, my previously sober boyfriend relapsed for the second time in two months. Our relationship has been fraught, as I struggle with severe abandonment and paranoia/distrust--and to be honest, he has been caught up in his disease, even when not picking up a drink. I had a panic attack, feeling as if he was intentionally hurting me--not caring that his actions made me sick with worry; feeling disregarded and insignificant. This basically culminated in him saying ""I didn't realize how damaged you were when we first started dating"" and wanting space so \*I\* could heal. He's still been talking to me every day. Even though our relationship has been strained, I feel so incredibly abandoned right now. I feel worthless, and that significant people in my life can easily cast me aside. I wonder why, even when people leave me questioning my worth, I still desperately crave their presence. I truly feel as if my heart has been ripped from my chest--I feel like I did as a child when, despite how ""good"" or appeasing I was, I never received the love I craved. I was abused and neglected and nothing I did changed it. I would love to hear stories of overcoming and healing. Of how I might reframe these situations in a way where I'm not thinking of myself as the inadequate girl undeserving of love. I feel small, terrified, and desperate to be seen. I fluctuate between hysterical crying, panic attacks, and depression in which i don't want to leave my bed. Please help me feel less alone &lt;3"

Thus: never ask for help/never have needs, because they will be met harmfully or not at all, because its your fault for having those needs/needing help in the first place, because youre broken. I observed other kids dads help them patiently with math problems, other kids moms give affection and respect their trust/privacy/autonomy. I observed other kids relying on their parents for advice and support. My parents bullied, made fun of, shamed me for having feelings, needs, wants, desires. When I voiced how the situation was for me they said it could be so much worse- look at what I had. Look at what these other kids have to deal with. It created such an unspeakable and alien feeling I couldnt talk to anyone about the guilt, shame, loneliness, which compounded, turned inward, and here I am. Badly burned, but not broken (as previously understood). It wasnt because of me, it was because they were incapable of raising children. It doesnt let them off the hook, it doesnt erase the damage, and it doesnt negate the work I have to do.

I had thought Id go process that with someone else in a case consultation. Today I realize that I feel so ashamed that I dont even want to share this with the most trusted person Ive ever had in my life - my therapist. And Im pretty sure its how CSA got intertwined with my sexual arousal, which I come to realize has been shut down for the past couple months. And theres also the alliance with the perpetrator because he was the only person who could see me. That was the only closeness I had. How awful that he saw me and used my aloneness and vulnerability to abuse me and others. No wonder I became afraid of letting people get close to me. I was abused and I was afraid to let anyone see how that all played out inside me. It helps to get that all out. You can bet that Ill be bringing this up with my therapist Friday.

But when I think about how I might have said something wrong to a friend (or other 'small' situations), I get the feeling that I can't possibly deal with all of these feelings.",1,ficwi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ficwi1/in_the_mids_of_a_covid19_outbreak_and_i_feel_this/,2020-03-14 15:20:18,"TL/DR at end. In the Netherlands we have 800+ confirmed patients and 10+ deaths on a population of 17 million (as a comparison: NY State has a population of 19 million in an area that is about 3,5 times the size). The number of cases is probably much higher, due to limited testing. There are a couple of confirmed patients in my town, of which one family lives in my neighbourhood. I am currently ill, as well as my husband (who is rarely ill) and a lot of our friends. Our health care system is likely to be overloaded soon. Like many of us I worry about the health of older relatives/ people who are at high risk (my grandma) and about our health care professionals (one of my best friends works as a nurse, and I also know some other people who work in hospitals). And yet, somehow I feel a unreal sense of calm, confidence, a sense of almost safety. I 'know' *we* can handle it, even if *we* really get into an (even more) serious crisis situation. Yes, I know there will be trauma, and pain, and loss. We will lose loved ones, and already a lot of people have. But somehow (where I live, at the moment) there is a sense of solidarity among people, that makes me feel like I am not alone, that we can deal with it and will get through together. And it's weird, how I feel this sense of 'safety' about something this big, and at the same time can get completely overwhelmed by seemingly 'small' social difficulties. I can stay present when I think about this covid-19 outbreak, and the difficult time I (we) will be heading towards. But when I encounter some 'small' situations I somehow feel like I can't deal with it all, that I can't deal with all the emotions, that I can't possibly work things out. I disconnect to my body and avoid feeling and thinking when it comes to something 'small' like the thought of having said something wrong to a friend. Or when someone I don't even know and whose opinion shouldn't matter criticises me or speaks to me in a harsh manner. When I bought something for myself that was a bit expensive. Etc. These emotional flashbacks are directly tied to traumatic situations in which I *was* alone, with a lack of support and in which I was shamed and invalided. But I believe I also experience *extra* feelings of shame, vulnerability and loniless as a result of the idea that people around me don't understand it, that I am the weird one feeling overwhelmed by these seemingly small situations. A few days ago I didn't feel this sense of calm about the virus. I felt alone in my worries, and I was doubting if I was overreacting. I was gathering information, as a means to feel prepared for what was coming and to get some sense of control. At that moment everyone around me seemed in denial. My friends told me ""it will be fine"" and went to a three day &gt;5000 festival, not washing their hands properly. In the bus people jokingly coughed without covering their mouths. Our national leaders seemed to act like we are already immuun to it, and taking only small measurements (encouraging hand washing, coughing in elbow). Now finally most people are beginning to take it seriously, and our government has announced some extra measurements. A lot of people are suddenly worrying, which is kind of validating. **TL/DR When it comes to something big like the current corona outbreak, I am not the only one who is worried. It feels like we are in it together, that we can handle it, whatever situation will come. I also feel as if my worries are validated. But when I encounter 'small' situations, like being criticised or thinking about how I might have said something wrong, I feel like I can't handle all of it and have large internal difficulties with seemingly 'small' situations. I also feel shame because it seems it is not validated to react this way, as most people don't really understand (except you guys, which is a great support!).** Thank you for reading my rambles."

Little things like forgetting to do assignments or bigger ones like falling into shame loops because I'm ""too successful"" at whatever I'm doing or believing I'm not love-able and pushing people away. I was just thinking about this after looking up the ingredients in the salt vape I've been using heavily recently (plus I actually did forget an assignment and it nearly triggered me last night). Part of me wonders how many layers it goes with me, how much of my potential was lost because of these psychological blocks. Like I used to fence as a spot, but I found that I swung wildly between manic and intense shame loops whenever I'd compete and i underperformed at literally every competition over the 6 years I did it. Or how I'd push away every chance at vulnerability (and still struggle) or how I stay up late nights nearly every single day to avoid... whatever it is in my dreams that makes me forget them all the time.

But I've found that the older I get, the harder it is to open up to people, even friends and family, and generally express myself in a genuine way. Basically, it was always somewhat hard, but when I was younger (in my 20s) there were people I was close enough too that I could let this wall down enough times for them to get to know me, maybe perhaps the 'real' me. Now I'm entering my late 30s, after having discovered cptsd and going to several years of therapy, and I'm afraid to be vulnerable even more. I think there's a few things going on, but a lot of it may have to do with expectations to behave more maturely, professional, and adultlike-and fear of being too needy and not self reliant. My fear is being a burden on others, but I really do miss having some level of honesty or vulnerability with people without shaming myself for doing so. It's a balance, but really struggling with finding it lately. I'm also lonely because the friends I used to have, I just can't connect with anymore. And my new friend relationships, as healthy and beneficial as they may be, feel very surface, like I can't ever share anything negative or I'm bringing others down. Maybe its all getting to me because this week, a family member came home from Italy and we are both quarantined in my house, with little to do besides work from home. My coworkers seem to be able to share what's going on with them, but I just can't seem to do it. I desperately want to talk to someone or express how this really feels, but fear I'll get called too negative or be ignored (my mom often would discount my feelings, both positive and negative, despite them being legitimate as a child, like I wasn't a real person). Tl/dr: I feel like a robot at work and in my friendships, and don't know how to open up as much anymore, including to people I used to be candid with. Not sure what's going on or how to overcome these walls I've put up lately. I feel so numb and even a bit depressed."

Tonight, and so often, I have gone into a state of defeat. I feel sorry for myself, and angry at the world.. I want this global pandemic to wake people up, but its like I want it to bring everyone doing better than me down to my level. I want them to no longer benefit from capitalism, to feel the monster that it is, to realise their own vulnerabilty.. and then to start to finallu value the vulnerable (me - us!) Its like this little wounded young me is saying join me, ive been sick, socially isolated and unemployed for so long now! Are you getting it now!? Do you want to stop your individualistic ways now and to start learning to care yet! and im almost most afraid not that i will die or that the virus will kill someone i love, but that it wont destroy the system ebough to bring people into the state collective care that i dream of... that i feel is so acutely lacking... that leaves me so lonely... that somehow relates back to my individual pain of chronic illness and loss of dreams and experiences of abuse and betrayal. Im 32 years old and 10 months ago I moved back in with my parents, leaving the city where id lived as an artist for years, finding myself in this wholesome regional area where i have all my family and abdoluteky no friends, all the security of parental material support but no indepence. This move was the result of compounding problems affecting my mental, emotional, physical health. In short i lost my world. The last decade of my life was overshadowed by years of domestic violence with my long-term boyfriend in my early to mid twenties, followed by another two abusive relationships, the last one ending with rape. Afterwards I became quite dependent on a small handful of friends/housemates whom i entrusted my vulnerability to. Other friendships were feeling strained or lost, some in ways related to the various abuses, some due to unrelated betrayals that hurt really bad. The few that were close, which included my best friend of 17 years, felt really like my family. Then conflict broke out between me and two of us in this small circle of friends/housemates.. and long story short i was exiled. There was little clarity about why i was being cut out, i kept trying to understand but still to this day it doesnt add up, to me or the less close friends who were watching on. Ive seeked guidance on this from three therapists now and they all came to the conclusion that i was scapegoated - i feel this ugly guilty feeling around writing it that i cant quite get self-awarness ok, *like am i not being self resonsible enough*, i twist myself in knots. Two of them were aleady a couple, but poly and then a new relationship formed with the third. The third being my housemate made it clear she wanted me to move out and whilst our other housemates were in dismay and did not stand for it, i hadnt the capacity to stand up for myself. Nor to go on living in the city in a new house, knowing that my three closest friends had turned on me, and i was still recovering post-rape, i eas unemployed, dealing with victim services etc. I knew i had a lot to rebuild and heal and I needed stability. I felt so terrorfied.. by my own fragility.. by the seeming incomprehendability of the betrayal. i collapsed, seeked refuge, fled for my life - literally that was how it felt. For at least 6 months after, up til early this year, i felt close to death. I surrendered completely to my helplessness and accepted any care from my parents and siblings that they offered, in other words i lost even more agency. I do not have great relationships with my family, it all looks pure to the distant observer and not blatanly abusive likr some people in this group who my heart goes out to, but it feels painful enough to find myself tonight crying with that impotent screaming under your breath feeling.. you fuckkkingg bitch thinking about my mum.. with the urge to slit my wrists, not acted upon.. I had quite unusual medical trauma as a child - mum (and dad, though he was working) followed drs orders with a treatment plan for me that involved puting a patch over one of my eyes (that was normal, seeing) to train the other eye, which was blind, to develope some vision.. i was patched and consequebtly blinf every waking hour as a baby, then gradually less n less til it was an hour a day til i was 10. My parents first had to use force, binding my baby hands to stop me pulling the patch off my good eye, then as i grew up they used coercion and bribery... from my earliest memories i was stressed - i remember having a stomach ache every morning as a child with drs only able to put it down to stress.. but there was never any stress-support brought into the oucture, like the guidance of a therapist or anythung. i remember feeling so sad and alone around it all, running away when mum would be trying to make me wear the patch, hiding in the bushes alone crying and feeling so wronged and angry, wishing shed actually come find me to comfort me, only to discover that now mum was off in her rook crying and dad telling me i had to apologise.. mum threatening to leave or that shell have a nervous breakdown.. i felt like a problem, a burden... and i guess i needed to put my invalid feelings of anger and sadness away and just be better. i remember being only maybe 5 or at the oldest 8 and them telling me i had a victim-complex. They called me bandaid-princess (because apparently i always expressed i was hurt?).. I was sick often, and as i aged i went through many auto-immune diseases (I currently live with some chronic-conditions that I spend a lot of time, energy and money addressing yet i continue to always be in some form of pain.) Still to this day I dont really know what to make of my childhood, or my current family relationships. Id never even considered it til i started some therapy for the later intimate partner abuse and despite all therapists seeming to see me as having significant childhood trauma i still dont really know how to go into it or what to say about it, beyond what i wrote above. But i know i presently feel pretty awful in my relationship with my mum (i think maybe she does crazy making.. i feel like i cant make sense of why i feel so fucked with her) and a bit triggered by my dad and brothers gendered ways and have had a lot of conflict with my older sister who bashed me relentlessly when we were kids, right up into teen years.. and whilst has we have been bonded all the way I also often feel quite alone in my struggles and life-experiences when im in her company. To put it lazily she is quite perfect, has almost never been sick or abused.. a few years back when I first acknowledged to her that i was experiencing suicidal ideation her response was what! thats disgusting! are you into guns? Nowadays she can often be more sensitive and supportive because she went through a year of anxiety issues and developed some capacity through that. And my parents can acknowledge that the patching was challenging for me, as was the abuse.. at first there was victim-blaming on both matters, and even though thats changing as they are getting their education on trauma and abuse via me (which is exhausting), i still feel their judgements and inability to see me seeping through their support... Now here we are in a global pandemic and Im struggling to feel into the advice thats coming at us all to reach out and call a friend, connect with a group online, check in on those you love and those you dont know but may need mutual aid... because i feel like a victim! i feek exhausted, defeated, fragile, alone, angry... all i can see is the ugliness of the system and the ugliness of other people, especially who i feel hurt by... and as for that collective care that i want everyone to crumble into come together in, i cant seem to lead by example. im busy hurting, sulking, angrily alone... feeling useless and turning on myself again and again and again... im so dizzy from the pain i dont even know what this post is really avout anymore, if any of you do, please help me out of this twist :/ pls help me understand what Im dealing with.. what do you see is going on here?"

Speaking of, [this](URL one reminded me of something... My imagination can elicit feelings from scenarios I haven't actually experienced - like an electric sensation originating from my abdomen when I picture kissing a guy. Embarrassingly, a lot of my daydreams involve having a boyfriend... I've noticed a few things, though... Typically, the guy in my dreams makes the first move, like leaning into kiss me. I think it's because if I initiated, it'd mean I was responsible. It's like emotional plausible deniability, if that makes sense. Recently though, I pictured a different scenario. One where a guy simply spoke to me about his feelings for me. I felt deeply uncomfortable and exposed... When I pictured him slowly shifting towards me to comfort me, I tensed up almost paralyzed *( la ""fight, flight, freeze"").* I felt like a terrified, abused puppy... It's as if my dream self held her hand over her heart in an attempt to protect it. The thing is, this hypothetical dream guy wasn't dangerous; he was kind, compassionate, thoughtful, and loving. Basically, the traits I'd hope for in a boyfriend. It felt like love itself was the danger. I'm not sure if it's because feeling loved is unfamiliar and a challenge not only to the status-quo, but to how I see myself? You know, like it's a challenge to the belief that I'm unlovable and unworthy? Maybe this is unrelated, but despite enjoying the thought of sex, when the subject is brought up in-person, I almost feel sick. Anyway, can anyone else relate? I'd really appreciate other people's input. **TL;DR: Despite wanting intimacy, hypothetical scenarios involving intimacy and vulnerability make me feel paralyzed or ill.**"

Early in life, especially in my circumstances, I subconsciously recognised that it was ""safer"" to never get too excited about anything, and to never settle into joy; I did this, because I understood that if my hopes were dashed I wouldn't be too hurt, and if something went well I'd be pleasantly surprised. I was now invulnerable to the despair of having my joy taken away, because I was largely preventing joy from existing. The only issue with this mindset: Stifling my joy does not protect me from the misery that I fear would take it away. The only issue with that is: I'm right to be afraid; all the thieves of joy my mind concocts could very well prey on my vulnerability. There is nothing to say that my wonderful dog won't be tragically run over one day when I take my eyes off him for a second. So it looks like a dead end; there seems to be no way to experience genuine joy because, honestly, anything could happen! Dr Brown asserts that the practice of gratitude is key to the existence of joy. Brown says that joyful people experience the same crisis; however their mind is 'wired' such that they immediately practice gratitude. To me this seemed bizarre at first, but after thinking about it, I believe that gratitude could in fact the key after all: If I can't be grateful, how can I be joyful? Gratefulness would be joyful that I even got the opportunity to be grateful; it isn't reliant on the object of the joy itself, but is rather grateful that the object of joy was able to be enjoyed in the first place. Without the gratitude, what is there to soak up the terror of losing what makes me joyful? I suppose it makes sense that I never learned to practice gratitude; it's not as though I was able to cultivate a life which fostered a sense of gratitude, even after the abuse - because I'm honestly just waiting for everything good that I currently have to be taken away. And it very well could be; one life-altering injury, one particular workplace bully, one personal financial disaster - and it's gone, baby! The only thing preventing my joy in the now, is the fear of what may happen to destroy it. Anyway, that's my current take on it; I suppose in time I'll be able to confirm whether or not it worked. I thought I would share my little discovery, and will direct you to the video that revealed it all: [URL"
85,vulnerability,CPTSD,I want to thank you guys. You've been helpful more than you know. Both your wonderful advice and the vulnerability in your own posts revealing your demons are powerful beyond words. You've helped me strip away all the superficial things to know what humanity really is.,1,frtlj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/frtlj0/i_want_to_thank_you_guys_youve_been_helpful_more/,2020-03-31 03:09:04,"You're all amazing. My experience on this subreddit can be summed up like this: a post snags my curiosity and I click. There are usually comments under the post with people giving gentle advice, understanding and compassion. I'll think, ""wow, that person in the comments has great insight and empathy! They must be healed! They must have other worldly knowledge of trauma and themselves!"" A naive halo effect subconscious assumption, I know. So I'll go to their profile and scan their comment/post history and be pleasantly surprised. That same person will have comments and posts where they don't have all the answers. They're not afraid to show confusion, stress and pain about the demons that haunt them. The rough edges and ugly truths. They'll detail their own personal journey of self-exploration they themselves haven't figured out yet. All this with a determination to face their own scars without knowing where that path will lead. No one here pretends to be a guru or an expert who knows everything. Everyone is here to survive their own trauma and help others if they can in the process. We are complex humans living a complex life. The duality of both being able to help and needing to be helped is a beautiful demonstration of humanity and connection. The vulnerability and rawness is inspiring and powerful. I see nothing but tremendous courage in the honesty and kindness here day in and day out. It goes to show we are all more alike than we are different, no matter how alienated you feel. It's never one side of the coin or the other. It's a coexistence of both, a mosaic. If we are to accept both exist, then it's no longer about flipping that coin to a desired side. In that there is hope."

Today was a pretty shitty day; I've been ruminating and googling about CPTSD and it's been putting me in a bout of anxiety. I don't know how to open up about what I'm feeling. It all comes out so processed and logical and intellectualized, and I'm aware that I feel terrible, and down and sad but when I try and let it out it just comes out with no release. It's so hard to find some form of release, and I know WHY I do this and it's because I'm fucking terrible at being vulnerable. And I get so upset at myself for it because I know that being vulnerable is fucking what I need to feel loved and I want to feel loved so badly. It's like I see the path to take, and I can clearly see the result it's gonna bring but I can't take any steps to fucking do it. And it's like even when I have those moments of vulnerability it never settles and makes me feel good. And I know that's probably my wired response because I've known that it isn't safe to express that I feel sad or good or talk about what fucking music makes me happy and genuinely with my heart express these things just because that's the environment I was raised in. And I don't want to blame my parents because they had their own shit to deal with and I get it and they fucking tried. They FUCKING tried and it wasn't enough. And my family was falling apart and I had to take on the fucking role of trying to keep everything together as a fucking 11 year old just because I didn't want to see it fall apart. I feel so fucking angry and sad just writing this out because my ""logical brain"" is telling me that ""No they tried their best"" but fuck dude. And I love my parents but I can't even open up to them about how I feel sometimes just because I'm fucking scared. I've been conditioned to be the child with no problems. The flawless one. And even when I'm with my family I feel so scared to just tell them that I'm lonely. Or depressed. Or Sad. Sometimes I don't even know what the fuck I'm FEELING and it's so FRUSTRATING. I want to learn how to feel whole and authentic, and not empty. I want to learn how to really let in love and give love back. This shits just so hard man idk. My parents tried their best. They didn't abuse me. But I put my parents and the cohesion of my family before myself. Idk what I am without this. Idk where this is going but I just wanted to let some of this out. Thanks for reading. I hope you guys are doing alright wherever you are."
87,vulnerability,CPTSD,Processing the passing of a childhood friend - a breakthrough moment in mourning many years later and finding compassion for myself,1,eyjq84,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/eyjq84/processing_the_passing_of_a_childhood_friend_a/,2020-02-04 14:38:10,"When I was a child, I had wonderful friend, Victoria. For years, we did everything together. We were best friends in every sense of the word and knew everything about each other. We would talk about all of our secrets and insecurities and validate each other and laugh together and challenge each other to be better. Her parents would often go away for work trips for two weeks at a time and she would come to stay with me, which were the most amazing extended sleepovers and we both loved. We were close friends from probably about 2nd grade, until 7th grade. In 5th grade, I moved from a small town where we went to school together, to the bigger city about an hour away. We were only able to see each other when our parents took us to each others' houses, which could only be on the weekends. This made it harder for us to be such close friends and I really missed her. I remember when she went to middle school, she started making a lot of friends. She was friends with popular kids, because she was really good at socializing and being friendly and kind to everyone. I was jealous about that and missed being close to her. I don't quite remember the full details of what happened, but she was grounded and didn't call when she was supposed to and I must have decided she did it to me to hurt me so she couldn't be my friend or she would keep hurting me. I sent her a short (rude) email something along the lines of, we can't be friends anymore and how dare you betray me like this. She kept apologizing and I made personal attacks like, go be friends with your popular friends - to which she responded, I know I have popular friends, but I know who I would go to if I really needed to talk to a friend. I didn't accept her apology. I missed her desperately, but I selfishly considered her a bad friend for not prioritizing me (and reading my mind) and felt righteous in holding my grudge. Both of my parents validated this belief, and told me I deserved a better friend. Over the years, she would occasionally reach out to me. She would write on my facebook wall, ""happy birthday, dear friend"", and send me messages checking in. These conversations would always peter out because I would center the conversation on me, and what was happening in my life. She moved to Texas sometime during high school, and I moved to New York for college. In our sophomore year of college, she went out with her friends one night, and spent the night on one of their couches. Her friend found her in the morning, passed out in her own throw up. They called an ambulance, but it was too late. She was gone. I found out when I saw her friends posting on her facebook wall. At the time, I was dumbfounded and shocked but I didn't feel much guilt. She was someone from my past who I shared many memories with, but I didn't process this. I let it go, thinking of her occasionally and feeling small pangs of guilt and sadness. Re-reading everything on her facebook wall. Googling her name. Looking at the pictures she posted on her social media accounts. Re-reading the few emails we exchanged that I still have. Over the past couple of months, as I've been exploring my inner landscape with more scrutiny, my guilt has magnified. When I think about the relationships that have been the most formative and fulfilling for me, the friendship I had with Victoria far outstretches any other friendship or romantic relationship. We just understood each other, and wanted the same kind of closeness and intimacy. I thought all the most meaningful relationships would follow a similar model naturally, and struggled when I forced these expectations on all my friendships and relationships and many of them crumbled under these expectations, either from my side or their side or both. Victoria had her flaws and we had our difficulties, but we always made up and forgave each other and gave each other compassion, until I didn't anymore. Even as I was pushing her away, she continued to send me lifelines. Reminders that she still loved me, and I could accept that love if I wanted to. And I still pushed her away. That knowledge, the full knowledge of how deeply meaningful and impactful our friendship was, the knowledge that she is gone and I alone hold the memory of how meaningful our friendship was, and the guilt for being responsible for its end, has felt crushing. But last night I realized something. Victoria modeled a beautiful healthy relationship for me, but once she was more distant and we couldn't see each other regularly, the best models I had were the ones in my life. How my parents treated each other. How they treated me. All I knew was defensiveness and entitlement and righteousness and lack of boundaries. Without Victoria in my life, I let these influences overcome me and gave them the power because that's what I thought was right. That's what I was taught. That's how I developed. Victoria's power was not strong enough to heal the deep wounds I had, and I couldn't do any better. Our friendship was not wasted. She taught me so much. We shared so much. We grew so much together. We gave each other love and happiness and comfort. And I know that Victoria made more beautiful friendships after ours. She had that power. She had many ""shallow"" friends and acquaintances, but she also had the power to cultivate meaningful loving friendships. And she never held my immaturity against me. She always believed in me, and hoped that one day her reaching out to me would result in something actually meaningful. It took me too long to realize, but I know that if she were here now, she would forgive me and share her love with me as freely as she always did. Her silliness and ridiculous snorting laugh when she laughed really hard. Her compassion and kind ear. Her vulnerability. All of the memories we have together, which I know she cherished as deeply as I do. The night she punched me in the face in her sleep when I tried to wake her up. The time she dared me to run around her house naked in the middle of the night. All the times we carefully and quietly disarmed the booby traps her parents set to keep us from getting into the snacks. The time we were playing Simon Says with her parents and her stepdad told us to yell our names at the top of our lungs, and I yelled at the top of my lungs, ""VICTORIA!!!"""

I left the job I am currently at about 2 years ago, it is an extremely stressful environment and I basically snapped and quit without finishing my two week notice which is not like me at all. My mindset after quitting got worse and i went to go talk to someone. I was diagnosed with cptsd and started my journey of working on things. I realized i had built up pretty strong defense mechanisms and when I started going to therapy it was like all of these came crashing down and i felt vulnerability i had never let myself feel. I am not going to lie, it made me feel weak and a lesser version of the person I was before. I still sort of feel this way, even though i was going through the same mental issues I was before i feel like I can't focus the same way I did before....cue a few years later and i took an easy retail job at a store owned by my former company. They always enjoyed my work and had no issue re hiring me in a new less stressful position. They are aware of my cptsd and told me they would be accommodate.....well 6 months in and someone left the office at my old job and they decided without asking that i was to assume my old duties in the position I horribly quit from....had i had the option i would have said no but i have kids and a mortgage and need to work...I just hate this shit...life could be so much worse I know but sometimes I need to vent and even though my family is pretty supportive of my and my struggles i know they don't know what it feels like.."

I had a bit of an episode with my dad and that day decided I had had enough. I packed up anything that was left at their house and left. That was 3 months ago. I had already not been talking to my brother for 3 months before that. My mother has consistently texted me to try to get me to come back. My brother was home for Christmas and I boycotted it because I just wasnt ready. Over the past few months I have dealt with a lot of guilt, but also started to find more of my voice and be more confident in my view of things and how I see my own life. I have started (but certainly not completed) to dismantle all of the gaslighting and the dismissal of my feelings and tried to come to terms with all that I really lost and how much I have been emotionally neglected. I got cast in a play and did two mdma trips as well as a lot of therapy. In the past few weeks Ive felt like maybe its time to confront the family. I feel guilty about not talking to them but also after my last mdma trip I feel like my progress will be limited unless I start to deal with this portion of my life so I can start to move on from it. But at the same time it is SO anxiety provoking. My mother asked me recently if I was coming home soon. At night I dont sleep well. Its constantly playing on my mind and I feel like my sleep is stressed because of it. I have trouble being at peace when they are unhappy with me. Something thats hard to admit or even see sometimes in a lot of these posts (of mine and others) is that even though in many ways I fear and hate my parents, I also care about them. The negative far outshadows the positive because they refuse to take responsibility, but if they would do that it would probably give way to suppressed feelings of vulnerability and hurt rather than just pure rage. I honestly dont know how Im going to deal with all this. I dont know what to say or how to approach it if I do confront them or if I even should confront them at all. Even though theres a strong chance Ill be dismissed and invalidated I feel like giving myself the dignity of having my voice heard instead of always just swallowing everything may be important for me.

Since this, Im now in this like... state of mind where I have completely disconnected from everyone, all of my friends and family and I just feel completely emotionless and robotic unless Im by myself. Its super weird, its like Ive got a strong protective bubble around me because I now perceive other people as unsafe and cannot show any vulnerability. I feel absolutely nothing for people that were previously close friends. It feels very much in my head as a me vs the world situation, even though logically I know it really is not the case and only like two or three people are aware of this situation and were involved. I also feel a strong sense of almost WANTING to be isolated, and I feel extremely uncomfortable by the presence/conversation-making of someone else, especially people I considered friends. Its like my brain has now decided that I am in immediate danger and shut off all emotional responses to prevent any vulnerability. Im pretty good at masking it and it isnt affecting my work, also Im taking steps to manage this and try not to let it affect my behaviour and hopefully overcome it. However, now I have a bit more self awareness, I am shocked at how quickly I completely emotionally sealed up and rebuilt walls around myself from others."

The next day, I apologized. They replied that not only was there no reason to apologize, but that it made them feel like we are closer, and that everyone is trying to heal their shit and we can all heal together with little moments of vulnerability. Their kind words took the edge off my shame for crying and airing my dirty laundry in public. But I still felt terrible, and more than a little scared of that person. While trying to think that through with my therapist, I had a separate, but related breakthrough moment about how I would feel the same as that person if the roles were reversed; connected, trusted, closer, and valuable. I have a safety plan. On my safety plan, there is a support network section, but the instructions say to list people you could ask for help from, who make you feel safe. My list was very short (one person) and seeing it always made me feel worse. This interaction has made me realize: 1) There are probably more people who would want to help me than there are people who I would want to ask for help from. 2) The way they help does not need to be obvious to them to be impactful for me. The idea of admitting that Im suicidal makes me so uncomfortable that I would not (and consistently do not) ask for help when I need it. But what I can do is send messages to find out about their lives or any other topic. The feeling of connection I get by being there for someone else, or making them feel loved or important with my interest and support... that feeling helps me. And there are loooooots of people who I can text to say hi, whats up, even if I cant say help. They dont need to know they are helping me for me to be helped. Heck, I even get that feeling by replying to messages here. Providing support can be a lifeline for me when I need support. 3) And... (smaller breakthrough) this safety plan is supposed to be for me, and its okay if I modify the content to be what works for me. The length of my new list makes me feel good. I dont have many trusted friends, but I do have lots of acquaintances. Having them in a list is useful for when I may have trouble remembering who else I can text if the previous person is unavailable."

On the other hand, I really struggle with actually putting myself in vulnerable positions. I value my own emotional safety so highly that at times I find myself paralyzed to even leave my house. So it seems that's the main struggle to try to overcome this year. Can I find it in myself to go out and *be* a good person? Or do I let myself stay paralyzed with fear, unable to leave the house? Who the hell signed me up for this trauma bullshit anyway? But being a good person in my own imagination is just that: an imaginary person, an imaginary me.

This might be a little long so please bear with me! TW: explicit discussion of sex, a bit of both sex-positivity and shame surrounding sex. My CPTSD is from parental and peer verbal and emotional abuse in childhood. I also am a compulsive overeater and have been overweight to obese my whole adult life. I am cis female and between the media and the conservativeness of my hometown, I never got the impression until basically my 20s that it was normal for girls or women to be, well, horny. It seemed that sex was only for hot people and people trying to conceive, and even then, women wanted it more for social and emotional reasons than physical reasons. That all boys masturbated, but only damaged girls did. I now know all that is completely wrong, but it's hard to shake off old thought habits, especially in moments of vulnerability. I also have always believed that I am horribly ugly, and not just because of the fat, that I'd be ugly even if I was thin (though the fat certainly makes the situation worse). To make matters worse, I am a pretty horny person. I love sex for its own sake and like to have it regularly. I didn't date, kiss, or have sex until I was 25 because I never thought I was worthy, that people were going to puke if they saw me naked. But I finally slept with a couple people and got into a long-term relationship with one of them. That ended last year, and I am finding myself pretty horny again. I am masturbating but it's not as satisfying as coming hands-free; it's more fun with someone else. I don't dislike being single, I have friends and a support network. I'm probably generally touch-starved in addition to being horny, but I'm not... feeling like I need or badly want a relationship right now. The logical solution to this is to try having (safe) casual sex. The problem is that I don't think I can. I am once again afraid that people will start puking or laughing once I strip down. That a potential partner will walk in, see my body and my face, and walk out. I don't know if I can bear the shame of that. I've been trying to date a bit, but like... am I lying to myself about being romantically interested in a potential partner when I really just want to bone down? Is that really ethical if so? And even if not, I'm *so impatient* and might doom a relationship by moving too fast! If anyone has experienced body shame getting in the way of their sexual satisfaction, and especially if you've found a way to get through it, I'd love to hear your thoughts and stories!"

I was such a perfectionist growing up and I learned early on that expressing anything subjective left me open for criticism. I was also heavily discouraged when I expressed any interest in the arts and made to believe STEM college and career options were the only smart choice. I noticed this recently, through workbook exercises for PTSD and in group therapy they often ask you to draw or paint stuff. And my reaction was to be angry that I would be forced to participate in something that couldn't be seen as correct or incorrect, only subjective interpretations. Creative self expression is a place of vulnerability for me because it means I will be judged on non objective criteria and that is something I have no control over. I wish I could just relax and dance but I feel too uptight and repressed to express myself most of the time. How do I learn to express myself when it feels downright dangerous to do so?

96,vulnerability,CPTSD,"Trauma, maladaptive daydreaming, lying and ranty confession",1,fa48tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/fa48tl/trauma_maladaptive_daydreaming_lying_and_ranty/,2020-02-27 12:31:54,"I originally posted this in the maladaptive daydreaming sub but it might be better here honestly. Just seeking some support and if anyone has any similar experiences or feelings. Or even suggestions. I have aspergers, OCD, attachment disorder, PTSD and CPTSD. TW: descriptions of abuse So Ive known for years now that I have had a maladaptive daydreaming problem. It was very bad for me after a bad trauma as a teen, years of fantasizing nonstop- sometimes made-up scenes with characters from movies etc but also a lot of ideal-me-future stuff. It made me make lists about all the stuff I wanted to do to get to be that person, who seemed so invulnerable, and try to hide them all the time because I was so embarrassed about fantasizing (I also have severe OCD, largely pure O). Pretty sure the problem started as a child though- constant nagging and school reports about being a daydreamer. I had a huge amount of emotional neglect at home and verbal and emotional abuse from my mother, but also had had an abusive childminder at around 5 years old- I only have a few memories, like being locked in her car, and being told my sister could pet and feed her birds but I couldnt be trusted etc, always telling me and treating me like I was a problem, and saying Id get in more trouble if my parents found out about my behaviour- you better hope I dont tell them. And she probably couldve convinced them, too. My sibling might remember more. She was apparently fired on the spot for being overheard being very cruel to me and kind to my sibling. Apparently during this time I became a very sad child, and once said nobody loves me, I may as well be dead, which I actually remember saying. So basically, I have a few questions. Did/does anyone else take their fantasies and bring parts of it into reality, especially where it doesnt seem to have much consequence? Or have a lying habit from trauma? Like, telling someone on the internet or someone you barely know that you have this one great hobby or you can play this instrument etc. Or even in general end up with a habit of lying about little things where there is no need? I dont anymore but I did a lot as a teen especially. It was almost like a shield, usually little things that made me or my life seem more interesting, usually from these fantasies. I knew they werent true but I couldnt seem to and didnt really want to stop because it made me feel safer emotionally- even though it raised my anxiety and made me hate myself (esp when I ended up with proper friendships with the people because how do you explain something like this?). The less open and vulnerable I was, the safer I could feel around people. I have a kinky friend (I am also kinky) who knew I had a lot of childhood trauma and ultimately I told him plenty about it, but I didnt feel safe going into my sexual abuse traumas so I said my sexual hang ups were from bad kink experiences rather than from the stuff thats really happened. And when I went into my childhood trauma, I said I had reactive attachment disorder (Im diagnosed with the adult form so yes obv I had it) but pretty sure I said or implied that it made me despondent as a v young child, like, a baby (not eating and interacting etc) when really the despondency and disengagement didnt kick in until after this childminder stuff. I know and have always felt my mother didnt bond with me as a baby and I was a very anxious child, but I think I said it cause I felt like... I needed to justify how I can be so fucked up. And I was still avoiding talking about one extremely clear memory I have never shared with anyone. And when my OCD intrusive thoughts/mental accusations and rumination were extremely bad, I told my doctor that it was a voice I could actually hear because I was afraid to say what was really going on in my head (shit like thinking Im a pedophile or that Im going to kill people dont worry, def OCD not psychosis although I thought I was psychotic at the time) and believed I needed antipsychotics. Which I got and which did put a soft fuzzy layer between me and the thoughts, and reality. But lots of shame, and felt I had to integrate what I said about the voice into my life, too. I just couldnt bring myself to explain what I was really going through in my head because OCD makes you believe you are a bad person and SURELY a pedophile and a murderer and I thought a doctor would side with the thoughts. In fact now that I dont do this, its harder to be around people as I feel so exposed (and intrusive OCD guilt thoughts and feelings dont help that). I have also lied as part of OCD testing- like, being so paranoid that something might be true that I start to get a false memory and say some possible version of it which could be true, to see how it makes me feel. But idk if that has anything to do with MD. And I codependently told lies to an ex- one where I exagggerated a trauma that happened to me to make him feel better about his own which he had disclosed to me (he was also pressuring me to go into detail, Id told him the truth about it and he kept insisting that he could tell it was worse and I should tell him), and to try to control his very risky behaviour like drug use and sale which was also, I felt, keeping him from treating me better (he wasnt exactly in touch with reality on a daily basis and there was sexual abuse). Instead of just, like, leaving. Or risking making him feel bad. And then Id have to repeat stuff to try to integrate it in my reality so I wouldnt feel so guilty. Ive just ended up with this self image of myself as such a manipulative person. Which is almost certainly worsened by the fact that much of my mothers abuse was her accusing me of lying and manipulating my dad when he would try to defend me from her. I struggle to process the childhood and other more recent traumas because of it all, Ive even ended up with paranoia that Ive made up trauma I know full well happened, which turns into OCD, and my brain takes every reason Im an awful person and uses that as evidence for it either being in my head or me making it up, ON PURPOSE, despite no memory of having done so. I feel like an incredibly flaky person and that if people knew about me using lies as a mechanism for protecting myself, they wouldnt believe my real experiences. Ive always known that Im telling a lie when Ive told a lie. Seriously, the guilt gets immense, makes me dissociate etc. I still occasionally repeat old lies as Im embarrassed. I know this is all, all, all about defense mechanisms from trauma and I shouldnt hate myself, and that its probably very common. But I still feel I would be so judged. Even though I hardly daydream anymore, thankfully, Im ashamed and would like nothing more than to start over with a new life and a good childhood, but I dont get to have that. I avoid almost every single person Ive told even little lies to- even forgoing some decent friendships out of guilt. Some lies were taboo even if I was just a teen and people would be upset and offended and hurt. And it would be so fucking horrible to have bad things happen to me but because Ive lied as a coping mechanism to deal with a terrible self image or vulnerability, or under pressure, not be understood or believed or be able to get over them. Especially as my OCD and paranoia tell me that I could get in legal trouble if people start to think that I have made up the trauma from my ex based on this stuff, because so many people from my small hometown know about it even if I never went to the police, and I think some of it even DID get to a policeman on accident (brain fart) even though nothing ever came of it. I knew I couldnt go to the police right from the start because I felt I wouldnt be believed based on all this when they start to dig into my character. I feel like if anything ever happens to me (like more sexual abuse or even anything where there could be a chance I made it up) I will never be able to go to the police and have any justice at all, which makes me more paranoid about making absolutely sure I dont get in any situations where I could be victimized again. So I just keep the habit buried in the past and live in guilt and shame and dont feel like I deserve kindness about stuff where Ive really suffered. So has anyone else had this symptom? Im trying very hard to get self compassion that its all come from a very damaged core and doesnt mean I am awful and deserve to die. Sometimes when my OCD is bad I obsess on this and feel like Im going to go insane. In fact, Im not even supposed to be doing this. Rumination and confessions are apparently OCD compulsions that you shouldnt give in to. But I just feel so........ diseased. Like I could infect people with my awfulness. I dont want anyone to look at me. Toxic shame and OCD have caused all my behaviours and problems in the first place other than the stuff that has happened to me, and theyre keeping me so trapped. I dont need the world to know, but I cant make true true friends unless I share this stuff with them, its my life, I feel like a fraud not to. Im so isolated."

I hope everyone's having a year full of healing and happiness so far, and that it continues to grow in that way. I'm writing this because I think about you guys a lot throughout my day. This sub feels more relatable than any other, and the compassionate support I see every day is sometimes overwhelming (in a good way!). I just wanted to let you all know how fucking proud I am that you keep on trying, and that you're here, reading posts, posting comments, and sharing deeply with us. It can be so overwhelming living a cptsd kind of life, and I'm sure there are times you feel like you would rather not (I know I do). I really think it can be such a strength, though, and this community is proof of that. Not only are we more empowered to share our struggles and empathize with each other, but with a little self-love and self-care, I think we have the ability to live so deeply, understanding how deeply people can feel, and how abstract and volatile the inner world can be. Being here, sharing stories, relating with others, supporting people who need to feel loved (I totally love you, by the way) - that is an enormous strength. Honestly, not everyone is able to do that. It's definitely healing me, and I hope it's healing you, too. I hope you walk proud in your strength - the strength of vulnerability, of empathy, of compassion, and of gentleness. I hope you survive and thrive! And most of all, I hope you love yourself as much as I love you, because no matter where you've been or what you've done, you're absolutely welcome in my heart."

99,vulnerability,CPTSD,DAE have shame attacks rather than panic attacks?,1,fd16tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/fd16tl/dae_have_shame_attacks_rather_than_panic_attacks/,2020-03-04 07:45:50,"TL;DR at the bottom. A little bit of context: I had a therapy session today and came in highly activated. I had gotten my period and just felt highly ashamed. Ashamed of me, ashamed of my pain, ashamed that I might only for a second show a bit of pain and vulnerability. This is because my parents always completely ignored the pain I went through during that time, never took me to an OBGYN, never educated me, never offered meds or anything. They completely abandoned me. I was so ashamed that I was hot, panicky, close to tears and dissociating. In my trauma response, I was either fawning, or in flight mode. When I told my therapist, she told that that sounded like a 'shame attack'. Shame attacks seem to occur when parents shame children from a very young age. (Which my parents did, earliest memory is from 4 years old). Which remains as a response in you. I have this everyday, at least once, but more likely in the double digits. I will be ashamed at things I've done or thought, things I have not done. Things somebody has done but there's nobody else to blame. So now, I know. And that honestly is great. I am starting to see my shame when it arises and I also see the associated responses. However, I don't really know what to do now. Telling my SO what I am ashamed of has worked pretty well, but that poor woman has a life of her own and I will not run to her every 10 mins to share the latest on shame news TV. Any advice would be very welcome! TL;DR: I have shame attacks. I get hot and ashamed and start dissociation. Good to know, but what do I do now?"
100,vulnerability,CPTSD,2020 has been hard so far and it's only been a week!!,2,ekarfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ekarfv/2020_has_been_hard_so_far_and_its_only_been_a_week/,2020-01-05 20:13:30,"Christmas was ok but my mum was staying with us and I've had to work through as well as do family stuff. Then there was an explosion of bizarre behaviour from my mum followed by my son doing typical teenage stuff (lying, going to party when he was grounded). Usually I can cope with this, I took my mum home to save myself further frustration and put in place consequences for my son to match disobedience/lies). But tye whole ordeal lead to an outpouring of hurt, memories and yucky feelings that I couldn't repackage. I felt alternately numb then extremly raw and so very tired. I had to take time off work coz I felt I'd probably cry the whole time. Missing work puts financial strain on me but seemed the best choice out of bad choices. I watched a lot of you tube until the darkness in me shifted and I felt my emotional vulnerability somehow rearrange itself tetris style to the place where I store everything until there's a safe place to unpack (usually therapy and lately just holding everything down until I go into in house treatment for CPTSD in Feb). I have sort of been watching myself remotely through this acknowledging that many years back I would cut or use drugs or fck someone to try to ease the pain. I am curious as to what exactly is the part of myself that holds onto all the hurt is and if this part of myself is what is reffered to as resilience. I can see that my main goal is to function and these hurts can stop me from functioning hence why I put those feelings somewhere else. But also this last week I just didn't have it in me to shove it all down in the holding place. Twice this week I considered going to ED and begging for a spot in their psych wards coz I really just wanted to die. I'm so over everything and so very tired. I didn't go to ED because I actually work in one of the psych wards and would feel humiliated being a client there. I could go to a hospital out of my area if I really needed to but the prospect of unknown facilities also scarred me. I rang my bestie one night and told how I can't go on and she reassured me that I will and that I'm the strongest person she knows. I'm very tired of being strong. More you tube and tv shows until I could actually sleep, it took about 48 hours. Lots of dreams. When the dreams aren't nightmares they're actually really good, amazing adventures. Finally the Rupaul dream. It's a reaccurring one for the past few years. Sometimes I'm auditioning for Dragrace, sometimes Rupaul just happens to be in my town and we catch up (I'm a straight obese female by the way). This time I'm dressed in gorgeous sequins and colorful make up and about to stand in line to audition for the show when Rupaul sees me and tells me I look gorgeous and that I'm nearly there. While his advice may be referring to nearly being on Dragrace, I take it to be nearly there, the other side of resilience, the stability of healing, past dealt with, hurts truly healed, functioning without repressing but rather just being able to flow with demands of each moment without being weighed down by past or hypervigilant of new threats. I love the Rupaul dream and when I wake up I know this painful week has finally past and I'm going to be ok."

I turned to my six brothers and said, did I tell any of you she was drinking? None of them said a word, even though I hadnt said a word to them about my mom. I finally lost it, and said something like seriously? shame on you all for enabling her and allowing her to treat me like this my whole life, shame on you for ignoring it for your own selfish benefit. I never expected you to stand up for me or stand up to mom but when you see her talk to me like this, the least you could do is ask if Im okay, or tell me youre sorry it happened, or at the very very least, not make me feel crazy when you deny any of this ever happening. And then any tome she fucks up, you all expect me to pick up the slack and clean up her mess. Youre a bunch of selfish assholes. Fuck you. I looked at my parents and said Mom, Im done with you.

102,vulnerability,CPTSD,"I've always had a super strong sense of smell, my parents have always been smokers, and I apparently cried very rarely as a baby.

Fear became the childs hard-wired response to separation from a protective adult, and linked automatically to the fight response so that the infant and toddler would automatically cry angrily for attention, help, cessation of abandonment - even at the briefest loss of contact with parental figures. Beasts of prey only needed seconds to snatch away the unprotected child. "" Which makes sense. Here's the thing though... Cigarette smoke burns my eyes, nose, throat and makes it painful to breathe in general. So if my super strong sense of smell made my survival instinct categorize my parents as hazardous to my health, it makes sense that I wouldn't cry much to call them for anything other than the absolute most essential things for survival. I mean... imagine a baby being literally dependant on people whose mere presence causes pain. That has got to be traumatic in some way, right? Anyone know of any research or info somewhere about something like this? I tried Googling a bit but didn't turn up anything useful. Mostly just stuff saying how children of smokers are more likely to smoke, which in my case is a huge gigantic HELL NO!"
103,vulnerability,CPTSD,"Emotionally detached from my past and future - I believe complex trauma is the root of my ADHD, perhaps the key to getting a grip on it",1,ekpwny,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ekpwny/emotionally_detached_from_my_past_and_future_i/,2020-01-06 17:09:57,"This is going to be long. I'm posting a personal theory that is the culmination of months of successful EMDR therapy, CPTSD topic delving, and my personal struggle with ADHD. I'm basing most of this idea on the books _Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving_ by Pete Walker and _Taking Charge of Adult ADHD_ by Dr. Russell Barkley, but there are several other influences. __TLDR at the bottom.__ ___ # My personal truth about the disconnect I feel like I am emotionally stuck in the present. There are many aspects to ADHD that affect me; the emotional combustibility, the working memory problems, distractibility, etc... The most defining aspect, the core mechanism of my ADHD, however, is __by far__ the time blindness described by Dr. Barkley in his book and in many of his youtube videos. I'm 31yo and just got diagnosed, but have been a complete archetype for ADHD since early childhood. Several months prior to my diagnosis I began tackling CPTSD, however. I was clearly emotionally walled up and have posted on this sub numerous times as I worked through those issues. I've spent _a lot_ of time looking inward and consuming all the information I could, and this is my working thesis for my disorder: __ADHD is alexithymia. It is the inability to feel anything outside of the current moment.__ Just like my inability to feel certain emotions before, ADHD is a condition that prevents me from even conceiving emotional worth in future goals; said another way, my brain is incapable of pairing future emotional rewards (or consequences) with the actions I choose to do now. This is essentially identical to my first wake-up call that I was affected by CPTSD: My mother died, and _I felt nothing_. ___NOTHING...___ I had known before that incident that I was emotionally different, but until something like that happened, I didn't realize that I was just straight up not feeling things I should be feeling. Even numbness is a sensation. This was different. It was as if her death wasn't real, or perhaps as if she was never real. As disturbing as my response sounds to me now, it took years for me to understand how alarming it should have been. Now as I work through getting a handle on ADHD, I've been looking inward using the robust toolkit of personal assessment that I've developed through my struggle with CPTSD. One of my most productive days, unsurprisingly, was when the ADHD meds did their job, and my biggest take-away was this: __The things that I logically acknowledged as being important before suddenly _felt_ important now.__ What a profound distinction! It was like.. that assignment that is one week out _needs_ to get done, so I am going to do it. There was no need to psych myself out or torture through it. I wanted to graduate so I did the thing required of me to meet that goal. It was that simple. But the meds rarely work. And now that I know what it feels like to not just understand something to be important, but _feel_ it to be so, I know that __once again, I am not feeling something I should be.__ It's alexithymia. All. Over. Again. I've posted a few times on this topic and the ADHD sub. It is important to remember that this dysfunction is ___neurological___. Many peer reviewed papers and brain imaging scans confirm that the ADHD brain is physically different. In short, the issue isn't simply cognitive. ___ # The science of time blindness To grossly paraphrase Dr. Russell Barkley, ADHD is an impairment of the prefrontal cortex as well as a few other areas of the brain linked to it. In [this video](URL he explains that the rational part of the brain and the emotional evaluation part are bottlenecked in their communication. &gt;You cannot make decisions unless the cognitive context you're thinking about has some effective or emotional valence welded to it, otherwise it is _purely_ rational information that has no personal meaning to you. It is the personal meaning, the _emotional tone_ of your thoughts that helps to decide among the various options.. As Dr. Barkley describes it, I am impulsive because I cannot see the reward or harm of any choice of action if that reward or harm isnt immediate, so I do things that are stimulating right now. I am literally incapable of -logically- connecting the emotional experience of failure, guilt, accomplishment, validation, etc to anything. The calculation of what I should be giving my attention to is carried out before Im even consciously aware there is an option. The real kicker is that when I evaluate the options, the rational correct thing has no weight. Its flimsy. Effervescent. It slips through my fingers. Imagine being clinically tone-deaf, a condition where music just sounds like noise to you. Would you listen to it? Probably not. This is ADHD, except instead of music, we dont get, or understand, consequences and rewards. ___ # Connecting ADHD to CPTSD ### ADHD is __neurological__ and __genetic__, so what does CPTSD have to do with anything? _(this is almost complete armchair conjecture, Im not a doc and these are just some thoughts)_ Well we know the brain is incredibly plastic, especially while we are children. And we also know that kids who experience early neglect, abuse, separation, etc, known as Adverse Childhood Experiences or CPTSD, have a much higher rate of becoming neurotic later, including adhd bipolar, borderline, npd, ocd and many others. Pete Walker boldly asserts that many, if not all, of these disorders are expressions of complex trauma. __So how can it be both?? Its either a genetic thing or not, why would ACE kids grow up with these symptoms at an increased rate? How can we possibly hold those two ideas in our minds simultaneously??__ My idea is that some people have a genetic marker for __resilience__ or __adaptation__ to complex trauma. ADHD may be an adaptation to negative environments. Essentially, __I am extremely well suited to being disappointed regularly because I have no expectations and I dont remember feeling like shit.__ Im blind to time. I see whats directly in front of me and Ive gotten damn good at making the best of that. Probably the best/worst characteristic about this?__I _DO NOT_ FEEL STRESS ABOUT TERRIBLE THINGS ON THE HORIZON!__ Of course this means that I am incapable of understanding deadlines or even the passage of time, but hey, silver lining, right? Does that make sense? If a kid is profoundly disappointed over and over and over again, or if they live in dread of 5pm rolling around because that means their tormentor will be getting home from work soon, the part of their brain that is supposed to develop forward thinking instead bottlenecks that brain activity in order to mute emotional torment. # The key to some kind of recovery maybe? _(egregious conjecture with no basis, save for personal experience)_ My recovery from alexithymia is the main thing that spurred developing this concept. In essence, the adhd is no different. I knew when my mother died I was supposed to feel something, but I didnt. When I think about failing a course if I dont do an assignment, or think about graduating with my bachelors degree, I know I should feel something, but I dont. Recovery took a lot of EMDR therapy to get myself to start attaching emotions normally again, and Im hoping for some success with ADHD as well. The whole function of EMDR is to establish new neural pathways. Ive already begun the work of _forcing_ myself to attempt feeling consequences and rewards. My day starts with a meditation on things I value and goals Ive set, and then I attempt to marry those things to the tasks I have ahead of me that day. I dont say I need to write that paper anymore, I say I need to graduate. Im not going to the gym, Im hitting my target weight. Whatever task I am doing to reach some distant goal, I restructure it to actually be that goal, and it takes on new meaning for me. These things, the meditation and rephrasing, they dont always work. The medication doesnt always work. EMDR might be a total flop. But Im really happy with the way things are going since I started infusing tasks with meaning in this way. Rewarding myself is bogus. Setting alarms and to-do lists and posting signs all over are all superficial solutions. But this may result in building new neural pathways that allow me to understand the worth of distant objectives. ___ # Last note The brain is a really complex and poorly understood thing. The important thing is that if some framework helps you deal with your symptom cluster then what is factually the case is not especially relevant. We all have to come to terms with this disorder. How we do that is deeply personal. Also, sorry for the length. ___ ### TLDR ADHD has both nurture and nature aspects. I acknowledge my ADHD is genetic in part, but this offers few treatment options. Treating it as CPTSD has been somewhat beneficial already, and may be more-so as I move forward with EMDR therapy. The goal is _allowing_ myself to have feelings, both positive and negative, about things to come, as it had been previously to allow myself to feel sadness, loss, grief, and vulnerability."

This is the first time that I've let someone all the way in and my anxiety is off the charts. The last relationship that I let someone all the way in it was with the narcissistic sociopath that is behind my cPTSD. So this, this is hard for me. How much do you share with your S.O. if you are being triggered by something? What happens if your S.O. doesn't understand and responds with passively shutting down the conversation? How do you share, if you share at all? It seems like a lot to ask of someone, to be there while I am working thru facing something from my past that I havent had a need to face because my relationships havent been deep until now (e.g., feeling safe with telling him that I want intimacy without a fear of rejection or if he isn't in the mood, not freaking out).

I read comments that say ''once you deal with the underlying trauma, fawning disappears by itself.'' My book suggests simply doing the opposite of what someone wants from me. One exercise is literally ''stop being passive agressive.'' But I don't know how to apply any of that to my own life. It's too vague and simplistic, for me. I feel like I need examples of what people say in specific situations. Personal experiences. Yesterday I sat with people who know I have CPTSD, minding my own business, making things, when I started having period cramps. I just quietly doubled over in my chair and stared at the table for a bit, waiting for a wave of pain to pass. And I could feel someone noticing and watching me - don't ask me how - and then everyone's attention was on me, suddenly. When that was the last thing I wanted. ''Are you okay?'' Yes, fine. Then questions to distract me: ''How was your vacation, did you get presents, what are you making for dinner?'' In those moments, I feel angry that I'm being treated like a child. I'm a 30 year old woman, I don't need you to distract me from my feelings, I need to feel them. Because I just want to be left alone, I pretend to be happy and fine. Spent the next few hours doing that, because I didn't want this woman to get too close or make it into a big deal. Underneath that, I'm so pissed off - which I know is a sign of boundaries being crossed and not standing up for myself. Writing this, it feels like maybe I'm just doing anything I can not be vulnerable - well yes, obviously, me, because that has everything to do with fawn and boundaries. I want to be vulnerable on my terms. Being asked what's up when I'm clearly not okay feels terrifying! I don't want the entire room to know what my uterus is going through. I don't want ten people to know I'm not okay. It feels like honesty is demanded of me, because that's my mother used to do. She'd just keep pestering me until she had an answer. And I feel like such a child for not knowing how to handle it now. It's such a small moment, that takes over my day. Trying to be kind to myself and hopeful that I can do better is so hard. It feels disheartening. It's not obvious to me, what to do besides dissociating a bit and pretending a lot. I try to remind myself I've made it through so much healing already, and that looking back, I regret panicking and thinking I'd never grow or learn in a particular area. I always did. I will tackle this too. But holy hell, this is a big one. Fawning, boundaries, having my own personality and life, vulnerability, agency - it's everything. And I think this is the last big thing I have to deal with, that I have to heal. I felt grumpy, irritated, having to go back to normal life after two weeks of being myself. Literally haven't felt that way the entire vacation. I don't want to lose me. I want this year to be the one I dedicate to standing my ground, feeling what I feel regardless of what anyone thinks of it. But I'm at a loss, every situation feels different, confuses me, it feels impolite to say what I want to say. I don't know what the ''normal'', well-adjusted, healthy thing to do is. What I wanted to say was: ''No, I'm not okay, but I just need you to leave me alone for a while.'' Is that okay? Is that rude? Or perfectly normal? &amp;#x200B; Writing this like I'm writing in my diary working through something - so sorry about the chaotic nature of this post, ha. Normally never do that, but I just feel so alone in this, and confused. I don't want to sit here and drown in it by myself right now and hope for it to magically figure itself out.

107,vulnerability,CPTSD,"To connect with others, you have to be vulnerable with yourself first.

Healing really did come from a lot of inner child work and slowly coming to forgive myself unconditionally. A lot of introspection, journalling, reading on trauma, and ultimately, that manifested as me embracing what I loved to express myself and thats art and writing (though it could be different things for anyone). By accepting myself I also accepted my flaws and the mistakes of my past, and when I could be honest with myself it let me be a whole person instead of the person I was pretending to be. And when I let myself be a full person, that was when I was able to be vulnerable with others bit by bit. In the past I sort of just projected this version of myself that I created to survive, and since I wasnt vulnerable with myself or other people, I could never really connect. Something was always missing. But by letting myself be vulnerable, talk about my past, and express genuine affection to others, I could create authentic connections instead of ones built from a self on survival mode. It was a combination of reconnecting with my hurt self, unconditional compassion for where I was and am in life, creative self expression, and vulnerability, that became the foundation for a lot of the love I cultivate in my life today."

In this flash back I feel I must have been evil in a past life to deserve to be so low in society... I know I can make it out of this but I might take 5 more years...Ill be 40 by then...smh"

I was sexually abused as a child and lived in a volatile household with my parents failing marriage taking most of my childhood up. Love has always felt weird. My mother would guilt trip me into telling her I loved her so she could feel better about herself. Sometimes I still do to appease her, but I dont truly love her. Ill hug her sometimes to get her to stop whining as well but it never feels good. My father is emotionally distant and I usually end up taking care of his needs as well. We dont tell each other we love each other and rarely hug. My father likes to criticize me a lot so I just assumed thats his way of showing some sort of strange affection. I had an abusive LDR where my partner needed me to tell him I loved him constantly or else hed try to kill himself. Enter this fucking guy. Weve been friends for years throughout highschool and one year he admitted he loved me. Hes a funny guy, caring and sweet. Hes not the problem, but I assumed he was at first. Any person who loves me must just want to use me, that was my thinking. I was actually just terrified of being hurt more and I began avoiding him for a looong time. Hes reached out to me again and... well hes super patient. Before, Id freeze when I was alone with him. We met up recently and I was slightly better, more present but still obviously a bit stiff. I cant stop thinking about when he put his arms around my waist and held me for a bit. I was getting upset over something about my mother, and he did that. I calmed down lol. More importantly he touched me without me recoiling, feeling intense fear or triggering a flight/freeze response. Ive been more open about my trauma, triggers, and other problems plaguing my inability to express intimacy or vulnerability. He doesnt seem to mind, I hope. Like I said he seems very patient. Ive been reveling in the feeling of just being held in a kind manner because thats never really happened before and it felt nice. Frankly, I love him, but part of me is still very scared. I havent been able to admit those feelings fully though. Another part of me is very happy. ...augh"

Ill probably end up deleting this because yknow vulnerability Anyway in 6 months I will be turning 21 a big birthday. Holidays especially birthdays always terrify me and I always feel abandoned. Ive never had anyone bake me a cake (my standards are v low lmao) Ive never had ppl rlly celebrate my birthday or go out of their way to make it a special birthday (which is completely okay ppl are busy etc). But it always ends up making me feel shitty and existential and either take it out on others or myself. And now thats it a big birthday theres even more pressure to have a party or go out or be surrounded by friends. Im terrified I just dont matter enough for ppl to get gifts or take out. I also for obvious trauma reasons dont love alcohol and get rlly anxious and hyper vigilant about going out because I dont want me or my friends to get hurt. This is a birthday Ive been dreading since 18 and Im so scared of how Im going to react. Im just scared that Im not doing it right or its not enough and Im going to be lonely. Does anyone else hate the pressure of holidays? Especially if u never got to celebrate them as a kid
112,vulnerability,CPTSD,Being in cars is triggering but necessary,1,erodex,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/erodex/being_in_cars_is_triggering_but_necessary/,2020-01-21 13:56:16,"I have immense anxiety around riding in or driving a car, but its not really something I have an option about. I was in a couple car crashes as a kid (drunk mom driving) and my dad would swerve in front of oncoming semi trucks and at the guardrails of cliffs to threaten to kill us. Its a little better now that Im the one driving and I can pull over and get out if I start to get panicked, but every single ride all thats going through my head is how it would feel to crash into this or that or how if I turned the wheel a bit by accident thatd be it. I often get the sensation that the car is going too fast, like warp speed, and sometimes I beg whoever is driving to slow down because theyre going too fast. It took forever to pass my drivers test, a couple times I had a panic attack during the test. I get friends and family teasing me or chastising me when they see me shaking in the car, and explaining that I have a lot of anxiety and trauma around it rarely does anything. I wish I could figure out how to calm down, but the fear and helplessness just takes me over. I dont go places I need to go because it would require driving. Does anyone else experience anything similar? How do you deal? And as an aside, I just wish people would take trauma and anxiety seriously. At this point Ive practically stopped trying to explain myself to people because my vulnerability is returned with condescension or doubt."
113,vulnerability,CPTSD,People scare me. But I crave deep connections. So I'm stuck.,1,esgld6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/esgld6/people_scare_me_but_i_crave_deep_connections_so/,2020-01-23 06:12:20,"I started journalling the last few days of 2019, and god, so much of what I write about is my insecurities when it comes to interpersonal relationships. I feel... decently comfortable with myself when i'm alone, but as soon as other people get involved beyond basic pleasantries (I work a service job, I can do small talk well), I am deeply afraid. Like, DEEPLY afraid. The difference is tone while I was on winter break and when I started this semester is staggering. I can't tell if it's one huge, long, triggering flashback or a series of short, strong flashbacks. I don't feel good enough for people. I have never felt good enough for others. I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety. That, combined with the ever-present childhood trauma lurking underneath the surface, makes me feel like I have to hide whole aspects of who I am so they don't notice all of that. But that makes all of my relationships shallow, because I can feel myself dancing around the fact that I'm in massive amounts of emotional pain basically daily. I feel like if people truly knew the extent to all of the shit I have to deal with, they will leave. And I can't blame them, who wants to deal with this? Even I don't want to deal with this. But here I am, with all this baggage. Why would anyone put up with it, *willingly*? Despite all that, I really am trying to be more vulnerable. If only to prove my depressed, trauma-riddled brain wrong, because despite everything I've been through I do truly believe most people are good. But I am deeply wounded by even the slightest perceived rejection. So any social missteps that involve me opening up about something new will shut me down for the rest of the day, sometimes for multiple days. Bigger rejections are devastating and can very easily destroy my self esteem. For example, recently, someone told me the only reason why they talk to me because they need me to help them with their schoolwork. That's it. This is someone I wanted to be close friends with, so I was helpful and supportive. But I was *too* eager probably, and didn't notice that this person ignored a lot of my attempts to bond more closely. So I'm in the process of distancing myself from them. The fact that this person doesn't care and is letting me do this... is sad. I felt like we had something, like I had someone who I could be myself around. But they just wanted to use me. I've been grieving a lot because of it. I wish it didn't hurt me as much. There is just so much I don't know socially. I don't know who to trust, when it's appropriate to be vulnerable, how much is too much vulnerability, etc. I have issues with boundaries and self-esteem, which definitely doesn't help either. If I just knew the type of people I should be putting effort towards, I'd have more friends. Putting in the effort isn't the problem. It's finding the right people. The people who seem to be the most eager for my company seem to just want something from me in the end. I know I am only in charge of myself, no one owes me anything, and I need to work on myself... but I'm hurt. I feel guilty for hurting so much. Like, even now, despite knowing this community is safe, I still am afraid. I am afraid to make posts or comments. I'm afraid that my experience and understanding isn't enough. I am afraid my voice is just... wrong. Like, I'm afraid to post this! I've been writing this on and off for hours and I think it's too long, no one is gonna read it, or if they do, they'll tell me that I'm just being dramatic or that ""it can't be that bad"". And that fear probably means I need this more than anyone, ironically enough. I don't even know if this ramble makes sense anymore but I've read and edited and proofread this enough and I just. Need. To. Post. It. People need to see me to be understood, so I need to take the first step. But some days I just wish I didn't have to try so hard. If you read this, thanks for reading. Advice would be appreciated, as well as commiseration. Life is lonely sometimes."

A few months ago I found out that I was raped as a 12 year old (by a peer, unrelated to family) which I completely blocked out till now, and have gone into therapy for it. In that journey a lot of childhood memories have also come up of emotional abuse and neglect (from step-parents I no longer have anything to do with), and has landed me here in CPTSD, where I'm still exploring and trying to figure everything out, and get an overview of the scope of things. I care so hard I break down when thinking of how to explain to my family and friends that I need time. I worry so much about delivering the message to my younger siblings (I've got 7 younger half siblings) in a way in which I can show openness and set a good example for them. I worry about my mother who I've been open to throughout the process, but now she's struggling with the realisation of her neglect. I know it will break my dad's heart when he hears there's more ways he has disappointed as a father (he left when I was 4, low contact until I was 16, now I'm 24 and we're as close as our different personalities allow - he's uncomfortable with vulnerability and openness about mental health, which that's a big part of me being me that I take pride in). I want to be open and honest with the world about my trauma, and be able to set an example and help others who go through similar things... But I don't know my own feelings about it yet. My (lovely) therapist has pointed out that I focus more on other people than my own actual feelings about the trauma, but I don't really know how to begin. The people I've opened up to until now have been amazing and supportive (for the most part) and asked what I need, to which I've just asked for time, cause I honestly don't know how to proceed, or what emotions or memories to explore, and I figured time for that wouldn't hurt. Now I got the time, so what comes next? I'm for certain overwhelmed and stressed about the whole ordeal, but the individual issues are more like objective stated facts where I haven't been able to unlock the emotions for yet, and I don't know how to proceed."

I do try to reach out to people when I need to talk, but it just sounds so forced and awkward because Ive become so used to dealing with things alone (or posting on Reddit). And the responses I get tend to not be very satisfactory, probably because they can sense that Im forcing it. The friendships I have tend to be quite superficial and I can tell that it makes them uncomfortable when I try to talk about difficult things, so I dont do it. Its hard because where do you draw the line between seeking emotional support and love (which is a biological need), and being an emotional vampire? Like everyone has their own problems. I always just feel like Im being depressing when I try to talk about things, but maybe Im not. I hope this post makes sense."

117,vulnerability,CPTSD,(Article) When Your Parents Have Mental Illness: Healing Childhood Trauma - Phyllis Rittner,1,evpqny,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/evpqny/article_when_your_parents_have_mental_illness/,2020-01-30 04:11:48,"As a mental health advocate, I've listened to many brave souls share their stories about living with mental illness. I've also chatted with concerned parents who are seeking help for their recently diagnosed child. But what do you do if you have a mental illness, and you were raised by parents who *also* have mental illness? Maybe youre a young adult still living at home or maybe, like me, you've been on your own for some time. Maybe youve spent your childhood watching your mother or father struggle with anxiety, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). My dad suffered from what I now know was severe OCD with psychotic delusions, and my mom struggled with depression and dependent personality disorder (DPD). But in 1970, I had never heard the words mental illness. Ashamed and frightened, I was convinced no one would believe me, so I hid my chaotic home life from everyone. I was the family mediator, calming down a frightened father and comforting a sad, lonely mother. I lived in a permanent state of hyper-vigilance, constantly attuned to my father's erratic moods and my mother's helplessness. Determined to please them at all costs, I became obsessed with fitting in. I blamed myself for my new-school-nerves, my bed-wetting, my lack of focus; I convinced myself I was defective or different from other kids. For years, this self-shaming helped me dismiss my father's abuse and mother's neglect. As a young woman, I chose to stay close to my emotionally unavailable, controlling partners and swallowed my needs to gain their approval. I repeated this pattern until my late-40s when I found myself in a paralyzing depression while living with a man who behaved just like my father. It took a skilled therapist to help me realize that, due to my childhood trauma, I was suffering from complex posttraumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD), and that I was unconsciously replaying a familiar father/daughter dynamic. When I finally accepted the truth about my parents' mental illnesses, I realized that the shame and perfectionism that helped me survive my childhood was no longer useful. So, I started learning and practicing daily self-soothing and mind/body techniques to alleviate my symptoms. Soon, I could let go of several toxic relationships, a demeaning job and even start my own business. I still live with C-PTSD, but now I can recognize my triggers and thought patterns and practice self-compassion. I speak publicly about my experiences and what others can do if theyre in a similar situation. So, what can *you* do if you grew up with parents or siblings experiencing mental illness, or in a family with a history of abuse or neglect? ### Seek Help If youre a teen, you can reach out to your school's guidance counselor, a teacher, relative or friend. Books can also be great resources; I recommend [I'm Not Alone](URL Adults may want to find a therapist who specializes in trauma. [Internal Family Systems or IFS](URL is a treatment modality that addresses all parts of ourselves, including the unhealthy behaviors and thoughts that kept us safe throughout traumatic childhoods. For example, my need to play the family mediator and be perfect. These were necessary behaviors when I was young, but they arent vital for my survival anymore. ### Learn To Self-Soothe Self-soothing is very individualized. Enjoying a delicious meal, listening to your favorite song, sipping tea in fuzzy pajamas or finding a fun hobby you can commit to weekly are all self-soothing activities. ### Is Your Family History Repeating Itself? Are you a people pleaser? Do you avoid conflict? If youre engaging in a frustrating/painful dynamic with a friend, lover or coworker, ask yourself if you might be repeating a relationship pattern from your past. These patterns *can* be broken. With the help of a skilled therapist and careful awareness, you can identify and stop participating in abusive relationship dynamics. ### Engage In Healthy Relationships Healthy relationships have an equal balance of power. Try to engage with people who make you feel safe and respected, who listen well and are emotionally available. Shared vulnerability is true intimacy. ### Calm Mind, Calm Body The mind-body connection is real. Studies show that negative thoughts or feelings can actual create changes in our brain chemistry and even affect our immune, digestive and other physiological systems. There are a variety of mind-body practices to choose from to calm an anxious mind, including meditation and yoga. ### Finding And Coping With Triggers Everything may be going smoothly and suddenly, you find yourself furious, panicky or tearful and you don't know why. Your physical body may be reacting to an old trauma trigger even though your current situation is not life-threatening. Connecting with others, using grounding techniques, noticing and observing feelings without judgmentthese are all techniques that can bring you back to the present moment of comfort and safety. I've found Emotional Freedom Techniques ([EFT](URL especially helpful for physical symptoms or fearful thoughts. ### Let Self-Compassion Replace Self-Judgment As a child, shame and self-judgment probably protected you when you couldn't protect yourself. Thank your shame for protecting you and ask it to please step back. Your childhood was not your fault. It is now safe to love yourself Go ahead and compassionately do so."
118,vulnerability,CPTSD,Were you unable to play genuinely as a child?,2,ewct18,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ewct18/were_you_unable_to_play_genuinely_as_a_child/,2020-01-31 08:38:59," I wrote a thing after thinking about why it is so incredibly hard to feel like other people get it when I try to start opening up about my trauma and mental health, even with others who have experienced some trauma or their own mental health issues. Does anybody else relate to feeling like you never really played as a child, even if you technically did? Does anyone else not really know what you are supposed to be like after healing because of this? ""I realize that I did not experience a very fundamental process that I think others who are more resilient maybe did get in some capacity. I did not play. Play requires a sense of security. It requires an abandonment of being vigilant for potential dangers. It involves risk and vulnerability. It requires a certain level of engagement and socialization. A baby in normal, functional circumstances should have a basis of months of feeling protected and secure from birth until they are old enough to start playing. They should not have been exposed to anything they deemed life-threatening, like abandonment or violence, and if they were, they should have received enough comfort from parents that it lessened the severity of the effects. It is vital for young children to not have a learned extreme fear of death or violence in order to play. When trauma is experienced before or during the toddler years, the child never experiences the developmental benefits of play. Play only becomes performative when the child is mentally preoccupied with assessing risk. Play is calculated based on what the child believes others would want or enjoy. Play is a game where the child has to make other people laugh to prevent them from being harmful toward the child. With these constraints, the child does not experience pure joy in play. The child does not expel pent-up energy through play, and often play exacerbates their stress. The child does not confidently experiment with self-expression. The child does not allow themselves to be vulnerable through uninhibited, silly self-expression both with others and themselves because the child cannot emotionally afford the risk of rejection. The child is also unable to stop defensively guarding during play because they are not confident that their boundaries will be respected or are unable to voice a lack of consent. The child is unable to create their own stable personality. The child is unable to practice healthy relating with others through play because they do not have a basic knowledge of healthy relationships. The child cannot take physical risks while playing because they are certain that any resultant injury would not be properly cared for by their parents. Physical injury is also overwhelming on top of the childs emotional stress. Having a safe space for play is a fundamental human right for children and a required process to develop properly. Not being able to experience true play impacts all relationships. Play is fun because it reinforces a sense of safety and confidence as well as connecting us with others through shared vulnerability. The dynamics of play exist in all of our adult relationships. A person incapable of being playful and vulnerable will seem unapproachable to others, weakening their connection. A person stuck being performative seems disingenuous. That person is incapable of voicing their preferences or needs to others. That person is caused extreme distress when forced to take a risk. That person often remains performative during sex because they dont want to be criticized or rejected. There is no mutual, uninhibited self-expression between this person and others, which makes close relationships difficult. There is no basis of ever having felt free, open, secure, joyful, confident, and connected, and instead there exists a complex defense and risk-assessment system. It is assumed that everyone has had the experience of play at some point, and so those who have not are asked to tap back into positive feelings they never experienced while treating their mental illness. This in turn encourages the person to perform the behaviors they think others want to see while theyre in treatment but without actually experiencing a benefit. I have a huge gap in my development, and it makes me feel immature, shameful, and embarrassed. I dont really know how to fix this an adult. I dont know how to allow myself to play with ideas, expression, and vulnerability in a physical space, but I do know that this ability is vital to processing pain."""

I consider myself pretty well-adjusted adult, most of the time. I've been getting by without any sort of therapy. But I seem to have a hang-up around situations of vulnerability. I think I'm pretty well practiced in avoiding vulnerable situations in general, but it still happens sometimes, and I'm usually left feeling stupid and embarrassed for how I react... Example: One time at an annual physical, I had some minor concerns to ask my doctor about (occasional mild headaches, trouble sleeping, whatever). I couldn't even finish explaining what my concerns were without practically crying by the end. Even though I knew perfectly well that my concerns weren't a big deal, and even though I felt totally calm about it in my own mind... Somehow the act of verbally acknowledging something that I had no control over, and needing to ask for help, triggered a teary physical overreaction. Recently I had a similar reaction when I had to make some calls to resolve a payroll issue. Again, this was a situation where I had no control and I needed to rely on someone else to resolve the issue, in order to get my money. Does anyone else experience anything like this? Or has anyone learned any skills that might help to manage/address an issue like this?"
120,vulnerability,CPTSD,Fear of receiving love from others,1,ewiqqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ewiqqw/fear_of_receiving_love_from_others/,2020-01-31 15:22:26,"When I first started therapy, I liked my therapist well enough and I trusted him on a surface level in that he understood trauma well and seemed like he was good at what he does. But there's a deeper kind of trust that took a really long time for me. The trust that's required to be vulnerable and peel back the layers of yourself in front of someone and show them the ""real"" you that's been buried under a lifetime of trauma and abuse. The kind of trust required to let someone guide you to places within yourself that you didn't even know existed. A trust so deep that you can let them see the raw wounds and mirror those hurt parts of yourself back to you for you to face head on. The process of trusting my therapist was long and painful. I reacted in anger and pushed him away quite a bit for the first year and a half or so. He would say the nicest, most encouraging things like ""I think what you are doing takes so much courage, and I'm honored that I get to help you."" and ""I appreciate just how much vulnerability was required for you to share that with me"" etc. That kind of stuff used to just bounce off of me. I could feel myself shutting down as he said these kind of things to me. I just couldn't wrap my mind around the possibility that he could genuinely mean that stuff and think that *I* am brave, worthy, lovable, or whatever else. But now after nearly three years, I do believe that he means what he says when he tells me that he loves helping me and loves how I am vulnerable, sensitive, and willing to go towards painful places in order to better understand myself and heal. I can just feel the love radiating off of him towards me. I can see it in his facial expressions, and his attentiveness and presence. I believe his kind words that he extends to me as we're wrapping up our sessions, and his encouragement. I've realized recently that it's not that I don't trust that people can love me, it's that I feel like I'm not allowed to let their love in. I feel like if someone is sending you love, there's supposed to be some kind of receiving on your end. And that receiving terrifies me. Like if I let it in, something bad will happen. What would happen to me if I let myself fully feel into the absolute joy that arises when I feel seen and appreciated and loved by someone? I know that the love extended towards me by my therapist and other people I have in my life is genuine, and that I am deserving of it. But there's this wall that has always been up, and it's never really come down before. Some of that love does seep through the cracks. One time I showed my therapist something I'd written in my journal, and he said ""Wow, you have really nice handwriting. This is very readable."" and for the rest of the day, I kept looking at that page in my journal just because it was some tangible connection to that nice thing he'd said about me. I feel like that is the closest I've ever come to just reveling in the good feelings of love coming towards me. I feel like it's ""wrong"" to let myself feel that joy and good feelings of someone loving me and caring about me. And I feel guilty, because there are people who clearly do love me. They really see me, and I can tell they respect me. But I have this wall up, and I feel sad because I want to be seen and loved, but I just can't let myself feel it. I feel like I'm letting them down, and I'm letting myself down."

You will learn this from my words and actions--the lessons on love are in how I treat you and how I treat myself.* *I want you to engage with the world from a place of worthiness. You will learn that you are worthy of love, belonging, and joy every time you see me practice self-compassion and embrace my own imperfections.* *We will practice courage in our family by showing up, letting ourselves be seen, and honoring vulnerability. We will share our stories of struggle and strength. There will always be room in our home for both.* *We will teach you compassion by practicing compassion with ourselves first; then with each other. We will set and respect boundaries; we will honor hard work, hope, and perseverance. Rest and play will be family values, as well as family practices.* *You will learn accountability and respect by watching me make mistakes and make amends, and by watching how I ask for what I need and talk about how I feel.* *I want you to know joy, so together we will practice gratitude.* *I want you to feel joy, so together we will learn how to be vulnerable.* *When uncertainty and scarcity visit, you will be able to draw from the spirit that is a part of our everyday life.* *Together we will cry and face fear and grief. I will want to take away your pain, but instead I will sit with you and teach you how to feel it.* *We will laugh and sing and dance and create. We will always have permission to be ourselves with each other. No matter what, you will always belong here.* *As you begin your Wholehearted journey, the greatest gift that I can give to you is to live and love with my whole heart and to dare greatly.* *I will not teach or love or show you anything perfectly, but I will let you see me, and I will always hold sacred the gift of seeing you.

And I'm scared he will come back and harm me. I'm scared my vulnerability will be exploited. I share how much he hurt me, but why should I write that, when that's what he wanted all along? I thought about being more simple in discussing the abuse like: you sexually, physically, verbally abused me on top of neglect. Because then he can frame me as crazy, just throwing accusations out there. But if I explain these incidents or give examples, people will believe me. He will know, I remember everything. I'm not stupid. I'm not scared. And I dont want him. I'm sick of him framing me as ungrateful, bad, bitter, revengeful. And I am sick of them acting like nothing is wrong, that they are the victim, and that I don't speak to them cause he divorced my mom. PEOPLE HAVE NOOOOO IDEA HOW MUCH HAPPENED. Anyways, thoughts? I will share it to someone if theyd like. But I'm just stuck on whether to share my story in his email rather than making it more emotionless. It could backfire both ways."

I dont NOT speak to you because of the divorce. I dont speak to you because having you in my life makes me feel unsafe and sick. I dont speak to you because you sexually, physically and verbally abused me for years on top of neglect. You casually email me every few months asking to meet for lunch like nothing happened. People seem confused as to why I have distanced myself. I will be showing this to others. People see a happy little girl, with all the toys and clothes she could dream of. They see parents with nice homes and clothes that do ""soooo much for their kids"" and think how could they do this? All the fun activities, experiences, trips. I am grateful. Those things may cover up the reality on the outside, but it doesn't make what you did okay. Money doesn't fix abuse. You speak of us being spoiled but that was your doing out of guilt. I don't like pretending like everything is okay. Some people have parents like this and accept it because they are doing the best they can. We only have one life. I am not settling for this in my lifetime. You are not in my future. I value myself and know my worth. The family dynamic and what you did to me is unacceptable. The closest thing to forgiveness is understanding why you did the things you did. My education helped with that, I know you a lot more than you would like to believe. You and my mother should be in jail. You don't know how I feel, to know you felt the same way towards your father. You do not know me. You have no power over me. Life is short and that is why I made this decision to cut contact. I always knew things were wrong but I didn't know how much brighter life is away from you. I have found my happiness. I have created my own fulfilling life with healthy and supported figures. You are dead in my mind. It may be hard for you to understand that there is more to life than you and \_\_\_\_\_. It shouldn't be hard for you to understand why I want no contact with you. &amp;#x200B; You do not know me. **Response to a manipulative email from sociopathic father. I ghosted them all years ago. I am ready to share my story. Extended family thinks I am bad, ungrateful, mean, vindictive because I distanced myself and cut contact without explanation. So he uses ""the divorce"" as the perfect cover up as to why i dont speak to him, and why i hate him, and so he can play victim to extended family. No one knows about the abuse. I want my aunts to know. And brothers. Im sick of him writing my story. The only thing i cut out from above is my specific memories of the abuse. I didnt write EVERY memory, but i gave examples of the abuse in stories. I gave my thoughts and insights and feelings on them. I am scared to show my vulnerability, but if i only state that he generally abused me, people wont believe me. If i do show my vulnerability, im scared to be exploited and im scared he will come kill me. Guys, im really blowing this fucking whistle.**"

My PTSD developed when I was in middle school, when my fathers Schizophrenia started to show. Nothing ever happened to me physically, and I was never abused in the classic sense, but I guess in all the tumult you could say I was neglected. And since I was scared, confused, and so many terrifying things were happening (including the sudden raging hormones of all those middle schoolers), I put up a lot of walls. I became terrified of trusting anyone, and lately Ive been thinking that the reason I havent dated is that I view it as the ultimate act of trust. Its a vulnerability Ive never truly attempted, and it has the added factor of sex now that Im older. Only, Im still a virgin, and I have no idea how to be vulnerable physically or emotionally. I went on a date last night, with full plans to not invite the guy back to my house, but I was surprisingly having a good time and he was still game when I told him I didnt want him staying over. I did not suggest it, he did, and I didnt want the night to end (but also I did because I was overwhelmed? Emotions are confusing), so he came over. We came very close to having sex, and the whole experience I was mentally not present. I couldnt enjoy myself because I was struggling to communicate. I failed in a lot of ways, and genuinely feel bad about it. But also Im a little frustrated because there were instances where he ignored me or pushed back when I tried to set boundaries. I felt kind of emotionally overwhelmed, but also very calm. Eventually I did get him to leave, even though he wasnt particularly happy about it. When my roommate/bestie came home, I tried to talk about it with her but I still dont know how to feel. I just know that Im a little depressed, confused, and feeling a bit of self-loathing. Im not sure why. I didnt do anything wrong - logically I know this. And for added fun, my OCD is also flaring up. Idk. If yall have perspective or advice or can relate, Id really appreciate hearing from you. I dont want to be alone when Im older, but Im afraid thats where Ill be headed if I dont start trying to date."

The three emotions are: \- **Anger** **- Fear** **- Shame** I wouldn't admit I feeling **anger** because it made me feel **fear,** I didn't know what to do with the anger when it came up, it felt like it could turn dangerous. From growing up in an emotionally suppressing family anger was a taboo emotion that I learned was very risky and that could upset the fragile balance of the family. Nobody dealt with anger in a constructive way so I learnt to feel **shame** about being angry, I didn't want to be one of those angry people because anger = bad and dangerous. There was no point to express anger in my family because it would just backfire and make things worse. I wouldn't admit I was feeling **fear** because it would make me feel even weaker. I was all ready so self-critical and avoiding a lot of things. To admit to myself that a lot of the things I just ""kind of didn't like"" actually made me feel fear, made it even more sensitive and I would **shame** myself and push myself down even further for being such a weakling to be afraid. Fear could also launch me into **anger** as a defense, because I didn't want anyone to notice how fearful I was, that I couldn't cope with a lot of things and that I was ashamed about this. There was no point to express fear in my family because nobody seemed to care and showing vulnerability made me feel even more fragile. I wouldn't admit I was feeling **shame** because I was ASHAMED of it. I was ashamed to loose control and get **angry,** I was ashamed that anyone couldn't handle things better, I was ashamed to have needs and wants, I was ashamed to not be easy going. I was ashamed to show how **fearful** and scared I felt a lot of the time. I was too ashamed to let down my guard and show that I actually wanted someone to care about me. I was ashamed to intrude upon my parents and have wishes, preferences and needs. There was no point to express shame in my family because we were all steeped in it and nobody wanted to admit that that was the case. As long as everyone is pretending to be OK, showing that you are not is too vulnerable. I still find it hard to believe it took me until the age of 32 to see this, but I am grateful that I do now finally."

I know that my father bullied me in my teens (and not my sisters.) I know my sister from the middle bullied me until she got engaged (her BF is her new punching bag). She was my mom's favorite and still is. My youngest sister has another mom and had the royal childhood. I know for sure my mom never validated my feelings. She seems to like me less and less as years go by (i'm in my thirtees.) They all deny of course and they do the DARVO thing. In the whole we all had good moments and it doesn't look THAT bad, and today the abuse is not what it used to be. But since my CPTSD has been HUGE lately (self-harm, cry and scream for the slightest thing, triggered on bad make-up/hair days, etc., I don't even recognize myself) I look like a total PTSD in crisis. I need to go very low contact with them since my breakdowns always follow their visits, their calls, etc. I used to say that Christmas and family gatherings were the most important things to me, but I didn't realise how bad it was on my mental health. And I don't know how to make them swallow the pill and avoid the backlash. I know I don't owe anyone explanations, but in the reality, it's easier said than done... So, should I... 1) Be avoidant, find excuses and lie everytime I need to avoid gatherings? 2) Tell them a semi-truth (that I struggle with my mental health without specifying but I'm not sure it's a good thing to show my vulnerability?) 3) Tell them the whole truth (I have CPTSD because of yall jerks!) 4) Any other suggestions?

It hit me today that I can be more open about how I feel about myself. This is progress even though it doesnt feel like it. I can bring this stuff out in the open and share it.

I had one therapist that I confided in about my frustrations with my father and proving my masculinity. But in passing he called me a nerdy little dude and it was pretty hurtful. Another time I talked about my frustrations with seeking my fathers approval and instead of encouraging me to detach from it emotionally he encouraged me to continue the behaviors I was engaging in. Essentially I had forced myself into a career to meet my fathers esteem needs but my therapist saw it as prestigious just like my father. I always faulted myself for not getting far with that therapist but how could I? He wasnt much different from what Ive experienced the rest of my life. Another time I had a therapist that I relied upon for love addiction. But she would sexually tease me and then deny it. I thought it was all my in my head but she jokingly used a seductive tone of voice, drew attention to the fact that she wasnt wearing a bra, and encouraged me to think wishfully  only for her to say that she was being friendly, and implore me to stay as her client. The irony is that she would always tell me to beware of predators or women/men who preyed on peoples vulnerability. In my case I found myself drawn to women with addictions and enabled them. What made it difficult to leave these relationships was the denial of the addiction. Lo and behold this therapist turned out to be just like other abusive women in my life and I mistook her familiarity for closeness. I couldnt even address her specific behaviors because of how often shed say its all imagined. When I left she was really pushy about coming back to visit her. And i hate the myself for feeling tempted to do so. My last therapist I relied on to address the wrongs of my last two therapists but he refused to validate me after speaking with his supervisor. I had a run-in with her and she was short, rude and bossy. He told me that he was the youngest in his class so I understood how he could still be enduring abuse similar to mine and be unable to recognize it. I cant help but hate myself for tolerating others bullshit. Sometimes I oscillate between the fawn response and this rebellious fight response and neither are healthy extremes. I was in class today and someone said something that reminded me of my therapist and it made me reflect on how often I assume all these terrible experiences are my fault. And they arent. I dont deserve that. Moving forward I need to validate my distrust and discernment because I often feel like Im being mean/judgmental/sinful for evaluating someone negatively. I should love everyone unconditionally at all times :) I also have a hard time validating my anger because they were all occasionally supportive and nice  but they were also occasionally invalidating assholes, and theres no justification or excuse for it."
134,vulnerability,CPTSD,"Why is it that I only rarely feel able to properly engage with my issues, and most of the time, even when I do try, there seems to be no weight of meaning or emotion in any of it?",1,ecd4xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ecd4xv/why_is_it_that_i_only_rarely_feel_able_to/,2019-12-19 01:12:16,"I'm certainly aware that it can be the result of defense mechanisms such as dissociation or avoidance or denial, not to mention complete lack of awareness of the problems, or mere tiredness and a natural need to put it aside occasionally to let the brain and the soul (for lack of a better word) rest, but I'm wondering about this on a more fundamental level. Every time I read about people in their sessions, I find it incredible how much of an interest and capacity to engage they have. There seems to be a fundamental engagement with the thing that I just don't have that often. I feel no sense of urgency, although I've had my moments of desperation and of feeling completely lost. Even that doesn't seem enough to make me want to go to therapy. There's a lot there stopping me and I don't quite know what it is. It's a lot of things. I often feel discouraged about my inabilities, especially of expressing this verbally and out loud to another person, and having the courage to step up and just do it. But there's a lot of ignorance too. I think there's a deep shame of being immature, very limited and astonishingly ignorant about some really, very crucial basics. I'm also incredibly discouraged when I think about something for months, where I think I've understood it, and I read something and I understand that I haven't covered any ground in understanding myself, that the problems may have deeper roots and are much more complex. One of my biggest fears contributing to me not making a move is not being able to engage with the thing in a way that the therapist would find necessary. One of my nightmare scenarios is my therapist telling me that I'm clearly not in the headspace and mindset or at a level yet to engage with my issues and that I should come back when I am. I understand that this could be seen as an unreasonable fear, but when one feels and sees evidence of an incredible lack of capacity and/thanks to an astonishingly limited life, something like the mere desire to engage and wanting to do it, and wanting to do it with another person, can seem like a mountain to cross. It gets too raw, too real, too fast. I'm afraid they'd say something like, ""If you don't want to be helped, there's nothing I can do."", even though I do want to be helped and want to engage, though it's very hard for me to feel that vulnerable and land on that with any sustainable honesty and vulnerability. I have this fear that it'll lead to confrontation and dismissal because so much is left unsaid by both of us, undiscovered by both of us, unexplored by both of us, and misunderstood by bot of us. How do therapists approach an issue like this right at the beginning? This very serious inability to engage, to really land in things, an inability to speak about oneself, etc, just because of life and very innocent choices. It's not denial that I'm talking about, it's this deep immaturity as a person, so big that they don't even know how to do what a client is supposed to do on a very fundamental level. ""There are no right answers for a client"". But there are productive attitudes, surely. What if a client doesn't even know what it's like to have a ""productive attitude"" but somewhere in there does care? Wouldn't a lot of the effort have to come from the therapist initially when the client is this limited? And yet I feel like therapy asks a lot of the client right off the bat. What if the therapist assumes he's dealing with an adult, but they're dealing with a 12 year old inside an adult's body? What if the client doesn't even know how to explain that? Another ""fear"" of mine, or source of great discomfort, is their efficiency and capacity to engage and be interested in the process and setting goals. There's something kind of frightening with how fast and efficiently they're operating that I'm almost sure I can't keep up, that I'll crumble in tears a hundred times because I'm missing so much on so many levels. It gets too raw very, very fast for me. It makes my lacks apparent immediately when I've worked so hard, but unconsciously, to hide them. Having to constantly verbalize for things to slow down and how I'm much more behind than they think I am wouldn't be easy, because I wouldn't be able to explain or explore with any presence of mind why am I that incapable, and because of what I've mentioned above; and it's much harder in person to situate in the moment what may be my deeper fears and shames, of being seen as incompetent or too ignorant about how to be a person who knows how to work well with another. It gets too raw very fast for me. It touches on too much simultaneously. The power differential, just in terms of knowledge and experience, is a big obstacle too. I have major issues around that as well. In other words, how the F\*\*K do you people do it? lol And spare me the ""oh but I struggle with a lot of this too."" I know you do. lol But what the F\*\*K are you doing *when it's working*? What has your therapist done, what have both of you done, *to get you to that point*?"
135,vulnerability,CPTSD,Anyone else struggle with being passive aggressive?,1,edtrw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/edtrw7/anyone_else_struggle_with_being_passive_aggressive/,2019-12-22 05:58:42,"**self harm TW** So there was a post on this yesterday and it was really hard for me to read. I completely understand why it's unfair to those around me, and I actively work to change that, but the original post and most of the replies didn't seem to show any understanding of why someone might be passive aggressive, and it felt like it just reinforced my belief that I'm shameful and bad. I felt admonished and ostracized and like I'm unwelcome. Yes, that's largely projection, and others are allowed to be triggered by my behavior and express that, they're not obligated to include an understanding of the harmful behavior. I can't help but wonder if anyone else felt the same way, or can relate to being passive aggressive as a direct result of their trauma. For me it's a major way in which my CPTSD manifests, and one of the things I work on in therapy. My mother didn't like sentimentality and vulnerability. Those things were met with derision and scorn. She would respect me less if I admitted that something mattered to me, if I asked for something directly, if I openly expressed emotional wants and needs. So I had to leave myself room for plausible deniability rather than making myself vulnerable like that. If something hurts me I feel like I can't admit it directly. It sets me up for the possibility of rejection. To admit that something hurt me is to admit that I let it matter to me. That's terrifying. What if I don't matter to the other person? If I admit to something mattering and I don't matter to them, that would feel humiliating. By being passive aggressive, I'm forcing the other person to show their cards before I show mine. If they don't care about me then they won't notice or care that I'm upset and sulking. It's only if I matter to them that they'll notice that I'm hurt and care. I leave myself an out, I can pretend I never cared in the first place, that it didn't matter to me. And, as much as I hate to admit this, there is sometimes the thought that if it makes them feel guilty then they won't do it again. Of course, then I feel guilty for wanting someone else to feel guilty, and decide that I shouldn't want them to know I'm hurt. This leads to passive aggressive behavior because I tell myself that I shouldn't *tell* the other person they hurt me, but I'm still showing my hurt through my actions. Growing up, I was also told that my feelings didn't matter, both directly and indirectly. I insisted that I didn't want to go back to my father's house, that it filled me with dread, that I felt unsafe and attacked there. And yet everyonethe legal system, family therapists, and even my mothertold me that he didn't hit me, so I should just suck it up and try to tough it out. I begged for protection and was sent back anyway, over and over, week after week. Of course I learned to expect that my feelings wouldn't matter, that I would be ignored. It was only when I *showed* my distress through actions like self harm that it was taken seriously. So I learned that I had to demonstrate that something hurt me, that it had to have actual consequences for me to be taken seriously. Unfortunately the medical/insurance system has reinforced this, with my ""extreme"" self harm getting me access to care that I wouldn't otherwise have. Therapists and insurance companies take my distress a lot more seriously when I end up in the ER. The idea of expressing my wants and needs openly fills me with fear and shame and humiliation. It's much easier for me to show that I'm hurt and hope the other person notices and cares. I know it's not fair, and I'm working on not doing it, but it's certainly not because I *enjoy* being passive aggressive or because I don't care about others' wants and needs."

Sit with them and acknowledge that theyre feeling poorly. Comfort them. Im still not sure if this is some unrealistic fantasy scenario Ive gotten from tv? Or if those few families of my classmates I saw growing up were some super rare ones that are like 1% of the population..? Growing up, I always felt like me getting sick was a nuisance. Thats still how it is today. No matter how miserable I have felt, I am pretty much left to deal with it by myself, emotionally. My mom would bring me painkillers or food etc if I asked, but she can seem distantly annoyed or strangely uncomfortable about it?

(And yes, I get that Im an adult now, but this already happened when I wasnt, too.) She might acknowledge my sickness on the surface level, but it still wont _feel_ like she has. The feel of it is very: Oh, ok., and thats that. It feels like my sickness and vulnerability is an inconvenience. Maybe Im naive but Ive kinda thought that a sick person should focus on healing, and the people who care about them help with the practical stuff so they can rest? Why would my mom get annoyed and frustrated with me having a cold? She sometimes keeps asking me to do things I dont have energy for, and whenever I repeat that I dont feel well, shell just kinda dodge it with an I know, yet still keep asking or assume I do these things, and get passive aggressively grumpy if I dont. Reminding her that Im sick and too tired is always kinda stressful too, because it creates such obvious tension. I might end up doing things even when I dont feel too great, because shed stress me out otherwise and Id feel bad for letting her down. Everything is always really subtle, she would never outright say that its annoying or that Im a burden or anything like that. And I dont think she thinks that either. Its probably some subconscious behaviour... But either way, I can tell shes uncomfortable with it and shed rather have me functioning and not needing something from her. I guess shed prefer I had my colds without actually having them, hide the symptoms and pretend I have all the energy, just so she doesnt have to deal with it? Itd just be nice to have some comfort for once, when already feeling horrible. Instead I feel like Im annoying and Im expected to just deal with it out of sight while managing to do everything despite how bad I feel. Be sick if I must, but dont show it. This kind of things have made me really independent and self sufficient, and I just do everything on my own. If I can do something on my own, how could I justify asking for help? I think theres something off with that statement, but that is the feeling I get when Id _like_ to have help but I dont _need_ help, not really. Even writing this, I worry that I sound weird and needy and too expectant for wishing for help with something like having a cold... Whats the deal with this kind of parents? Or maybe I am just needy? I dont know. Isnt it literally a parents main purpose to take care of their child? Why, instead of their nurturing side getting activated when their child is sick, they just become vaguely distant, annoyed, dismissive, and impatient, instead...?"
137,vulnerability,CPTSD,All of my trust? Gone!

Like crazy, to the point where I don't even live there anymore. I had someone tell me to stop worrying my best friend so much so they could focus on their studies - with that person probably more realistically wanting more of their time to themselves. This person said they know 'how shitty home could be'. I wonder how many suicidal thoughts they've had today! Or how many times they've thought about how their family's acceptance relied on the assumption that they were straight (we love closets). I was already having an extremely difficult time reaching out to my best friend since trust and vulnerability is something I struggle to do when I'm back here. I texted them saying I would give them space. Part of me knows that I would normally be more confrontational with the person who told me to stop reaching out to them, to maybe stand up for myself in a way that wasn't gross and begged for sympathy. But trust? Reaching out? Did I want to do that in the first place, anyways? Who needs to trust other people? I can be miserable alone. Happy holidays. I am sorry. tldr; I am mentally ill and gay and in the closet to my family who thinks I am an asshole for hardly coming back. Person told me to stop reaching out to my best friend so much, which I already struggled to do at all. I have no trust in anyone. Holidays suck. I am counting the days down until I can go back home."
138,vulnerability,CPTSD,Anyone's CPTSD Healing lead to Divorce?,1,egltin,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/egltin/anyones_cptsd_healing_lead_to_divorce/,2019-12-28 14:57:41,"My husband and I both have CPTSD. We didn't know it when we married. I only figured it out because of my love and dedication to being a mother. I did everything to try to be the best parent I could to our son, now 16. That resulted in me finally finding the right therapy and therapist for me about 4.5 years ago. My husband is in a similar therapy but I got him there and he has a slow, lackadaisical attitude about it. It's changing him a teeny bit but heck I've been in it two times a week for 4.5 years and he has been going every other week for a few months. I doubt that he'll ever be able to form the attachment bond so critical to healing. His family upbringing made sure of that. Plus, that's a scary thing for anyone with trauma for pre-verbal age like both he and I have. You have to really, really want it. There are two reasons I'm still living here: 1. Chronic illness has kept me out of work 2. Healing gave me the capacity to not storm out and turn my life upside down. Well, maybe three reasons, I've never been out in the world as a healed person. I only know myself with all the crazy coping mechanisms I used to use. Never stayed in a job more than 2.5 years. Stormed out of two other marriages. And a fourth, somewhere deep inside, I blame myself every time he and I fail to connect. I'm calling that out right now. I just want out but I don't know where to go. I only have old friendships from before I had the capacity to connect so the friendships aren't very close. I haven't seen anyone for at least a year if not two years. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area which is very expensive. My therapist is here. My son is here, though he's all about going out to eat with Dad and then they spend most of the rest of their free time on screens. Coming to terms with the fact that my son is an addict. That's part of his life path. I have worked so hard and done as much as I could. He's all about idealizing Dad and dissing Mom as is his legacy on both sides of our family. I'm pretty sympathetically aroused right now after an argument with my husband. He is so disconnected that he can't pick up the tone of communications so he can't get the signal when I shift my tone to vulnerability. Plus, when you can't tolerate interdependence, you can't acknowledge your partner's family contribution in any real way. Anyway, knowing that that is the state of my nervous system, I can do what I need to do this evening and eat and get myself to bed and know that I won't be able to think clearly enough to make any decisions. It's probably going to be that he takes legal action at some point. He's so convinced that I'm just too impossible and needy. And he's very moody and irrational about money so that's going to be a delicate path to walk. I'm slowly building my healing practice and hoping that I can come up with more faith in myself soon. I think I'm also reeling from the contrast between a special two-hour session with my therapist mid-day today and what it feels like here at home. Interesting, that the same thing happened after I did a client session yesterday. I'm getting used to being connected. I'm motivated to learn how to connect on a socially appropriate level, too. I'm going to get through this. ATM I feel a tremendous amount of grief. Please let me be safe. Please let me continue to have food to eat and a roof over my head. Your support would mean so much to me at this time. And if anyone has been through a similar situation and out the other side, your hopeful story would mean the world to me."
139,vulnerability,CPTSD,I found what I needed,1,dtqclc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/dtqclc/i_found_what_i_needed/,2019-11-09 14:03:31," Some background: I go to a very small private technical college, with no more than 250 students on campus. Many mental illness cases can be found at this school. I am in a leadership position because they introduced a higher education level program, which I am in, and its the first year it exists. So my class is supposed to be the class that the others follow.  I have been feeling very empty lately, I live an extremely busy life and I do not have much time to spend for self care. I am only home between 10 pm and 8 am everyday, and sometimes its less than that. This school is extremely demanding (its one of the best so it is worth it) and I have to work full time to afford living expenses. I figured this is what has been causing my emotions to be so awful lately. I just kept telling myself its only two more years, youll get there. Ive been very easily triggered and very down. I feel like Ive been missing a huge thing in my life, and I just thought it was time. But I realized I have been missing a outlet. I have been missing a place for me to help others and for others to help me. Ive been missing close friendships. I love giving, I love helping, and Ive not had that. So Im starting a trauma/mental illness support group at my school and I am absolutely so excited. I messaged the Vice President of the school about this idea (again, a very tight-knit school), and she emailed back YES YES YES. I have never had a day where I have felt pride for a long period of time, but ever since we decided this would happen I feel so very proud of myself. I feel like Im going to make an impact, and create a safe space. This group will, hopefully at least, create new relationships that are not superficial college friendships. I feel like I found what I needed, I can hopefully help others, and I know it will help myself. Since Im viewed as a leader in the school, it will give me a place to express vulnerability in order to make others comfortable sharing. Vulnerability is one of the biggest things I struggle with, so doing it for others will help me. It will give me a chance to help others feel like that have people to fall back on. I know its small, its a small college and its not going to be many people, but I am overwhelmed with excitement. On Monday, the Vice President and I are meeting to discuss it further, and hopefully we can start it soon!"
140,vulnerability,CPTSD,Hit a wall with shadow work as hsp and defining what 'abuse' is - (cultural differences as well). . .,1,du0com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/du0com/hit_a_wall_with_shadow_work_as_hsp_and_defining/,2019-11-10 06:18:36,"Being a visual learner, I usually like to draw out a brainstorm tree to make sense of the mess known as my mind, and so far I'm happy with the results - except for one thing, which I will describe as best as I can: On one side of the 'diagram tree', my problems occurred due to 'emotional neglect', now that's obvious enough. So finding out my 'core' wound there was fairly simple. ...but there's another side of the 'diagram tree' I drew, and I don't know what the core wound/trigger is. I said to myself it was caused by 'Threat of conflict'... but then I tried to find online some definitions and it led to 'emotional/verbal abuse' and well I am not so sure if that's the case. So in the first row I have: - Fear of self-expression (lack of safe space in house - I am only hsp in house) - Fear of 'envy' (yeah weird I know but I had to be honest) The top two joined together as 'minimisation of self' as a result ([fawn](URL tendencies) And this led to Idealisation and Devaluation...which explained my crazy BPD like tendencies of 2018 lol. And also: - Fear of being shouted at, threatened - Fear of being attacked The top two joined together as 'lowered self boundaries' (fawn) - for both I was left guessing whether the 'threat' was real or not so it led me to feel very paranoid at home, even when my mum assured me 'nothing will happen'. . . when something DID happen before. Eventually my brothers picked up my dad's behaviour and also did the same to me. And these two (fear of being shouted at/attacked) led to Loss of identity (due to suppression of anger/emotions because of fear ) and Self-neglect (both caused by people pleasing fawn tendencies in trying to 'appease' angry and irrational father and to 'keep the peace' by not being my usual loud chatty and weird self) Also for those unaware of what fawn is, scroll down [here](URL Now simply put, I did feel 'threat of conflict', but in different ways....I think I felt fear of vulnerability on one end, because my core self (hsp) was attacked so many times as disruptive and annoying, or even a threat - by teachers, students, and family alike, causing great early toxic shame, and an early developed inner critic - and on the other hand I felt fear of actually being hit (my family has a culture where beating kids to bed is normal...but it stopped in adulthood but I still feel the fear ofc) but my parents aren't what I consider abusive physcially, and to my siblings they are all considered 'normal' expect me...I think only kids with parents from non western countries will understand this hence why I put 'culture' in the title. It doesn't really help then that I also have hsp so the threshold for trauma and 'hurt' in general like being shouted out or being threatened makes me over analyse like crazy and shakes me to the core, or that I have two emotionally neglectful parents and a mum who, although great has hurt me many times by invalidating my emotions and past so much it scarred me. She doesn't even realise or remember most of it, and regularly quotes 'how diffcult raising me' was and 'how hard it was' to do so, which I acknowledge, and it was because we weren't rich (working class but barely). Most of what I consider 'emotional abuse' would be from my brothers and dad who made me guess when I was in 'trouble' but for what reason I only found out at the last last minute...so I felt unsafe in a house I felt safe in all my life. And for the 'verbal abuse' I would solely believe it may have happened as an attack towards my core personality by my sibling and also mind games of 'I'm gonna hit you if...blah blah blah' by brothers and dad...but 80% of the time they followed through with the threat so I was left guessing most of the time. When I tried to 'make sense' of it and my inner irrational fears, the only person I trusted, who was my mum minimised my issues and said that 'why are you angry' and used to get very upset when I was so I swallowed my anger over the years but sometimes I have an outburst. When I try to talk about deep emotions to my mum she runs away, but recently had a change of heart, but sometimes reverts back to 'invalidating' self. So I can't really tell since I'm isolated a lot if I'm overreacting...and since I'm hsp and my sibling tends to say I overreact a lot (and I do), I'm left to believe her. The reason why I'm so confused is that I checked a bunch of articles online for emotional and verbal abuse and the word 'abuse' just makes me think I'm overreacting and when I read the other symptoms they seem to be more serious then what I experienced. Also to those who wonder or say 'you need to go to therapy' I have already applied myself and I'm on a waiting list. I'm trying to figure out my core wounds/shadow self before then To those confused by shadow self [here's](URL a good video which set me off on my self-work journey. So I've been brainstorming and nulling over, writing down a whole bunch of stuff and I've essentially hit a wall. At this point I simply cannot tell if I did deal with verbal/emotional abuse from my sibling/dad or if I was making it up and it's simply paranoia and 'trust' issues. Just to clarify I wasn't: A) Hit 'abusively' . . . like I would say it wasn't physical abuse in a malicious manner because my parents have zero emotional awareness and didn't (and still do not know) I am hsp B) Verbally abused by parents (only sister - attacked my core personality regularly as a child hsp and had envious remarks towards me which developed a core fear of envy in me over the years) C) Neglected physically D) Denying the possibility of abuse...but the word seems so strong...and I can't seem to find another descriptor for what happened to me. It's confusing and hard to accept. Trying to find my core trigger proved to be a steeper trek that I wasn't ready to climb... Anyways if anyone has felt a similar experience as a hsp with emotional neglect and a cultural background with parents who like to threaten their kids with the belt (sadly so), please help me to figure out where to move on from here."

143,vulnerability,CPTSD,Anyone else ever have the urge to go feral?

When I got raped by my ex boyfriend when I was sixteen, and I came to it (dissociated so hard I lost concious cuz of the rape) lying in bed, and he lying next to me in it asleep - I got the strong urge to take a cushion and to press it into his face to kill him with. Like, I had the cushion in my hands and was basically about to push it into his face when he woke up. I felt like often, society made me suppress my fight survival-instinct, while society let my rapists get of the hook without really punishing them for what they did to me. And that often gave me the urge to go fucking feral, cuz if they wont help me, ill help myself. Its like, when people realize I was raped they will push stereotypes on me, or just go ""oh okay"" cuz its so normalized, but when I talk about having had the urge to kill my rapists and sexual abusers people go ""oh thats fucked up of u"" but its like, dont rape me - then I wont have the urge to kill you? It aint that hard or complicated. I dont understand why to be a valid victim I basically have to lay down on the floor and beg for help and cry for help and act like the damsel in distress, my actual feelings I have for these violations are yes, vulnerability, helplessness &amp; disgust, a lot of disgust for what they did to me, but also a shitton of anger, a really really strong urge to violence. Like I am obviously not going to act on any of that lmao, I got into safety, got my ex bf out of my life even if the fucker continued to stalk me for years (which was hard, like each time he did it I had the urge to run out and to stab him with a knife, but I didnt wanna go to jail, so..) got away from my dad. Moved far away from my birthtown, I am somewhere where they will not find me, of their radar. Im building my existence now, in so far I dont even have the urge to rlly harm them now. But its like, I guess I quite often get the strong urge to still somehow express my anger, and also my anger against society that wants to act like the only valid rape victim is the one that basically acts very outwardly fragile for it, like I sure as hell was that fragile the year after the rape, cuz I was suicidal and had breakdowns a lot, but I still was brimming with anger allthroughout this. And its like.. they act like its a bad thing to have that anger? And I dont get it, somebody disregarded my boundaries, somebody literally invaded my body against consent, violated me, of course I am going to be fucking angry?"
144,vulnerability,CPTSD,CPTSD and surprise gender dissociation,1,e2oe1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/e2oe1v/cptsd_and_surprise_gender_dissociation/,2019-11-28 09:54:09,"I just discovered this sub, so please teach me if I'm doing the thing wrong. I've had a recent experience of having to make a giant amends to myself and my companion, and am curious about whether anybody else has had similar experiences. What strikes me as astounding about the whole situation is that I have 7 years of recovery, I don't regularly dissociate anymore, and I'm in a loving relationship, but I found myself dissociating *long-term* in an area near the *core of my being* in a manner that *threatens my relationship* and I'm pretty shaken even as I clean up the mess and move forward with a positive attitude. Context 1: I was gender-nonconforming as a child and experienced a lot of bullying from boys. I did not experience a lot of gender-related trauma at home (the bad home stuff was in other areas), but I was aware that my mother saw me as vulnerable because of my gender presentation and relationships with both boys and girls, that vulnerability was to be avoided at all costs, and that my stepfather gradually withdrew from relationship with me as I reached puberty. Context 2: I spent my 20's recreating childhood trauma through abusive relationships. As a male-socialized nonbinary person I had a complicated relationship with gender during that period. At 20 I conflated my femininity with my sexual orientation. By 27 I had learned to distinguish the two enough to specifically claim nonbinary identity, but I did not take steps to socially separate from maleness until just this fall, now 37. Context 3: I've had one positive, affirming relationship since breaking the cycle and embracing recovery. We're four years and change into that relationship now. Throughout the period of our relationship I have been up-front about not identifying as a man, although we do talk about our relationship as a gay male relationship. I have also been up-front about dysphoria relating to various parts of my body. Context 4: A year and a half ago I took a full-time job that has me at a desk 40 or more hours and behind the wheel of a car 10 or more hours a week. I gained weight. I grew out of my clothes. What went wrong: I enlisted my companion's support in building a new wardrobe, knowing that he was attracted to the idea of me shifting towards a more boyish presentation. I told him - and myself - that that was ok and I wanted to shift in that direction for him. What I did not know - because dissociation - was that I didn't want this, that my inner child was going to get hurt, and that I was ultimately engaging in self-harm and asking my companion to aid and abet. So in the wake of this I feel like I can't afford ambivalence anymore. I've taken big steps towards the kind of femme presentation that feels right to me. I have crossed what to me feels like the line between gender-nonconforming and visibly trans. I've told my companion what went wrong and how I owe both him and myself a huge amends. We're working through it. It's still scary. Again, the basic point here is a quest for relatable stories or just hey-I-see-you-I-get-it feels. I wish I'd found this sub years ago when I was first discovering my CPTSD. I absolutely love every single one of you. Thanks!"
145,vulnerability,CPTSD,Dating when you've recently uncovered your cPTSD and admitted to your many dysfunctions,1,e3fu65,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/e3fu65/dating_when_youve_recently_uncovered_your_cptsd/,2019-11-30 02:05:13,"Intro: So, I'm a 32 years old heterosexual man. My last relationship ended in a catastrophe about a year ago. Long story short, I had taken acid and went into a kind of psychotic episode and she finally kicked me out. A bit beside the point perhaps but in hindsight I see how that incident and our entire relationship in many ways mirrored and managed to uncover very strong emotions in me from growing up in emotionally numbed out dynamic with my neglectful parents. My mother has a bipolar diagnosis and has been withdrawn and with her feelings flattened out by psych-meds since I was 9, my dad worked too much and was never really present. I had nobody to feel safe with or talk to about anything, so ended up stuffing away my emotions and dissociating a lot (mainly through video games, online browsing and pornography) This chaotic break up with my x proved to be a turning point for me as I finally had to face my childhood and all the emotional insecurities and fears/inabilities I have due to all the things that did and did not happen. (You know the deal.. it's complex...) Current situation: So as I am now working on my recovery by going to therapy, occasionally attending support group meetings (ACA), doing physical healing modalities, reading and absorbing a lot of material, talking to friends and trying to get to know myself and take better care of my own needs. (Yup, we all know this feels like a full time job and practical exam to pass every day) What has come up lately for me is that I am super scared and hesitant and nervous about dating and potentially entering another relationship. There is a few major reasons for that and in a way it's gotten worse the more I get to know myself and figure out why I feel and act in the ways that I do: \- I'm actually really really scared of intimacy, vulnerability and commitment. \- I have what I think is an unhealthy pull towards sexual intimacy for the sake of validation, excitement, physical release and to take my mind of all my difficult thoughts. Now that I see that in a clearer light, I don't want to do that anymore. \- I feel ashamed and sensitive to judgement now that I know all these things about myself. \- Now that I am more in touch with all the feelings I used to run from I feel so sensitive and fragile. Even just non-romantic socializing is harder now that more of me is always present. \- I worry that I am a bad person who just wants to be comforted, validated and pleasured by someone else's company for my own sake and that I will ""use"" someone just because I am feeling lonely. \- I worry that I will reach a point with this person where it becomes clear how immature and emotionally stunted I am in a lot of ways. \- I worry that I won't be able to be honest, have boundaries and act in an authentic way. \- I worry that I will be honest, have weird boundaries and be authentic but be rejected for it. \- I'm afraid I will hurt someone because I still don't know myself well enough and my wants and wishes and unstable a lot of the time. \- I'm afraid to feel inferior in regards to my date/partner because I still feel like a child and I have parts of me that are so sensitive to criticism or even to be out in the open. \- I am afraid to be obsessed with someone and hinge my happiness on that other person because I'm just dying for something to distract me away from the hard work of healing. \- I am afraid that my particularities and difficult temperament will be a too big part of any relationship for it to work \- I am afraid of falling in love again \- I am afraid to be open and honest about who I am because if someone still likes me, I wouldn't know what to do next, I've always kept so much of me hidden \- I am afraid that I only attract dysfunctional women and that we will end up making each other's lives even more difficult \- I am afraid that I attract really emotionally healthy women. That they are kind and loving towards me but my self-hatred and discomfort of being at the receiving end of love and support will find reasons to grow cold and push them away. \- I'm afraid of the above scenario but that I will find more joy than I can handle with this imaginary woman and then eventually she will still realize that I am too much work and dump me and I will be left longing even more for real companionship. Wow... seeing it written down on a list like that actually gives rise to more self compassion and understanding for myself. Right now I'm kind of seeing this woman. We haven't been physical yet, not even a kiss or any excessive hugging, but I am starting to like her in a way that stirs up all these fears listed. And by her actions and words I'm starting to think that she really wants to be with me. What makes me even more uncomfortable about it is that I've known her for almost 18 months now and my usual way of meeting a partner includes sex if not on the first date then shortly after. For me having sex early on have had the benefit of both making the sex more relaxed but also it often times have helped me to relax around emotional intimacy. My only other experience of knowing someone for a long time before sex happened ended up in a total mess. In this case with this woman I feel extra vulnerable and almost like a virgin, approaching someone with this huge added self-knowledge and ability to feel my emotions. I feel like I relate to sex completely different now and I don't know how to behave or calm down should the situation arise. Phew... that's all my ramblings for now. If anyone can relate, would like to add something, share your experience or offer some advice or encouragement I'd greatly appreciate it. Men, do you feel like this? Women, how do you feel about what I am writing? Thanks ya'll for letting me rant. Love"

Would I think that was okay? I don't think so. I think I'd be thinking ""good for her."" I wouldn't find her righteous anger stupid. I would want her to keep that spark. I would be rooting for her. Would I be able to watch myself ask my mom to defend me, have her not defend me, and be okay with that? Would I still be making excuses for her, seeing what she saw, through an adult's eyes? How could she watch that happen and not intervene? How could she watch a man twice her daughter's size scream inches from her face, waving his arms around to be as physically intimidating as possible, and not stop it? But when he asked me about watching that same child, crying in bed at night because she wanted her mom, all I feel is disgust. Watching ten year old me cry would make me want to throw up. I would want to *hurt* her. I hope someday that's not the case. I hope someday I'll react to that with the same sadness and compassion that my therapist does.

The sort where most of the bad things didn't happen but none of the good ones did. My only worth came from academic success, like so many of us here. I studied music at a major university and was paired with this guy as my composition ""mentor"". An hour a week for two years of being broken down, having my soul crushed and having the broken remains shat all over, now I'm way older and still stuck in that stupid office. I think about him every day, whenever my mind wanders, along with a couple other people who kicked me while I was down. I'm not a perfect person but I never deserved all of this. I'm not going to send this to him because what's the point but I hope by writing this out here I can start to let go of some of this. Here's what I'd love to say. Sorry for the language: Hi John, I want you to know that I still think about you on a daily basis. You are an absolute shit person and an abuser and you set me back YEARS. I arrived to your office as a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed youngster and you left me broken and suicidal. You're fucking awful and you need to retire before you do this to even more helpless students. I was in a very vulnerable position when I began studying with you and you used that vulnerability to live out your own abusive childhood. What kind of a piece of shit stops his art student from doing anything creative or enjoying any of their own ideas until they conform to your shit outdated teaching style. Even if I did conform to it wouldn't be good enough because you would just move the goal-posts, because that's what abusive pieces of shit do. What kind of a piece of shit justifies the way they treat their students by saying ""listen, you need to understand that my parents never let me do anything as a child."" Then fucking deal with that instead of passing it on to the next generation - or rather like 3 or 4 generations past you given how fucking old you are. You've had tenure since the early '80s and you've never challenged yourself to do anything more. You're a failure. I take comfort in knowing that you'll be forgotten. You don't even have a fucking wikipedia page and nobody under 60 cares about your music. Your reputation is shit and I wish I knew that at the time. You did everything you could to undermine me, and, guess what, it worked. It's been 6 years now and I still get horribly anxious and dissociative when I open my notation software or try to set my creative ideas to paper. You broke me in a way that shouldn't be allowed. I almost wish you had tried to touch my body so that people would actually care that you did this to me. All I want now is you out of my head so I can experience a healthy community and some collaboration for once instead of being nitpicked and told not to do anything at all creative or innovative. Enjoy your fucking Order of Canada, you piece of shit. Go to hell. Cordially, --------"

Im 2 months out of a shitty relationship and 2 weeks out of taking a month off work to get myself right again. I think I figured out self care in that time. I gave myself a leg massage last night and affirmed the shit out of myself and I keep waking up with this feeling??? Its like I am interested in what the day brings, like a faith that something important and beautiful might happen. It doesnt replace my day to day bothersome feelings, it like underlies them, encourages them to validate themselves and seek a solution instead of shutting them down because I feel like I cant be any happier and itd be better to be numb than happy. Like it feels like I have faith in my ability to tolerate negative feelings and come out okay and can weather the wave gracefully. I also have had a welling feeling of love for all the people in my life, instead of feeling that love and then a subsequent whoosh of anxiety about whether the love I have for them is a risk of vulnerability and rejection. I thought I might be manic, because having been depressed for literally years and years this feeling is WAY out of normal duration for a regular fleeting moment of happiness, but Im not nervous or doing crazy shit impulsively, Im just... smiling. And it feels like its growing, not that its a momentary flame that the slightest breeze will blow out, and Im not shutting down to protect it. Im just experiencing it and its so fuckin wild!!"

The build up to this day was several weeks, more than enough time for my brain to sabotage me, but I kept telling myself that I am not afraid, I'm fully capable, and I can do hard things. I can't believe it worked. I had to leave my last job in early 2018, so going back to work is a really really big deal. Back then, I was so frozen every day, I cried in the bathroom nearly hourly, couldn't show up at least once a week, and would spend the whole day dissociated or panicking. I know the first day being over doesn't mean I'm in the clear, and it will be a bumpy ride the upcoming weeks, months, etc. But I'm still very proud of myself for showing up and being friendly and doing my best to stay present. This presents a lot of new challenges but I can do hard things and I can handle it, and I will do my best as who I am to make this work out. I don't give a fuck that it's a minimum wage barista job at a major chain restaurant and not very impressive for a 22 year old. It's a step, and I'll gain momentum, and someday soon I'll be looking back on today as an astoundingly brave and vulnerable step towards what I want- independence, contentment, economic freedom. Money, or lacktherof, is such an impossible barrier to healing. I am so lucky to have been in a position where I could take 18 months off from working in order to heal enough to get to this place. I know this isn't the case for most of us here. I just wanted to post here in order to celebrate how far I have come in a short period of time, through my own hard work: grueling daily introspection and mindfulness, a sporadic yoga practice, 2 hours of therapy a week, intense vulnerability, reading all of the recommended books on CPTSD and highlighting the heck out of what I need.

I self-advocated when I was pretty sure a person and situation was shady. Someone in a position of authority had been friendly to me for months before they asked to see me privately. I froze and agreed. Still, I told someone I trusted, and they further advocated for me. I felt extremely grateful, and yes, still vulnerable because this was one of those situations where the outcome was uncertain. I put myself in the chair and expressed what happened, leaving my fate in hands outside my own. I didnt let things escalate or keep quiet out of shame... Yet, as it stands, a person I would rather not interact with is now going to be forced to go to my weekly stomping grounds if they want to continue being in a position of authority over vulnerable people when they are clearly a f$@(&amp;!g predator. I dont want to concede to the no contact interaction in place when this person has the dead eyes most of us know too well. I want to run. I want to hide. I want to scream. I want to unclench my jaw and thighs. Freedom is vulnerability for some people and right now I would rather feel bound. I dont want to pay the price it costs to be fully seen. I want to take all the classes that teach people how to fight and yell fuck this from the top of a mountain. People wonder why no one speaks up until its too late, or maybe never at all, but this is why. Nothing happens. Nothing changes. The places have different names, but the outcomes are the same.

With my ex, I learned that vulnerability can be used like a wip. For people who only seek reconnaissance and attention, vulnerability can be used to attract people like me, who are more than willing to trust and care. Who are vulnerable themselves but willing to help others. She pushed my boundaries subtly, always requesting more attention. Always had a good escuse too, even if she created most of those.

Ive lived 18 years in total and absolute silence - like a doll. Ive been empty and absent from all forms of emotion - like a doll. I never had a chance to express myself until I got away from those who had traumatized me repeatedly, dismissing and destroying any sign of self-expression or self-confidence or self-love. It took me a while to even realize that I didnt have a normal childhood, and that I had severe anxiety for the majority of my life after experiencing so many traumatic things that I believed to be normal... for example, I used to think that everyone had suicidal thoughts at 12, or cried just thinking about ordering food in front of your family, or sometimes had so little energy that you couldnt physically move. This last session has brought up a lot of sadness for my past and younger self, where I feel like my body essentially just needed to feel the pain of the horrors I have lived through. I unfortunately started going in and out of dissociation later that day, and have been fighting flashbacks and nightmares ever since. A horrific wave of depression has washed over me, and I feel stuck. As much as I have come to accept the fact that I cannot change the past, I think that learning undiscovered truths about your past causes a lot of emotions to move through you - and as someone who has essentially detached her emotions from reality and is currently trying to undo that, feeling such intense things is making me start to panic I think. My fear of abandonment, vulnerability, and even love has become crippling. Ive become so sensitive to triggers that didnt really affect me in the past. I however think that this may be a sign of progress throughout the process of EMDR, where I am basically breaking down and feeling what I need to feel so that I can recover and become more function with my disorder in the future. I just hate how hopeless it can make me feel."

159,vulnerability,CPTSD,Bren Brown and the limits of Vulnerability,12,docfny,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/docfny/brené_brown_and_the_limits_of_vulnerability/,2019-10-29 04:56:12,"I'm a big fan of Brene Brown. She's a social worker and psychology researcher who interviews hundreds and hundreds of people about their lives and then figures out big Life Lessons from it all. Her main theme is vulnerability, which means being authentic and expressing your true feelings even if people are going to judge you for it. The flip side of vulnerability is shame, which isolates us and pressures us to be less authentic. See her TED talks [here](URL and [here](URL and she's written several books too. She draws a clear distinction between Guilt and Shame. Guilt is ""I made a mistake"" and shame is ""I *am* a mistake"". Guilt is when you realize you did something wrong so you have to apologize and make amends, but you don't hate yourself. Shame is all about self-hate and self-destruction, and really accomplishes nothing. (As CPTD sufferers, we all know about Toxic Shame and how it drags us down.) But while Brene's work has helped me a lot, I find that there are limits to her ideas which she doesn't fully acknowledge. In one book, she defines vulnerability as ""emotional risk"". What she doesn't say clearly is that some risks are actually not worth taking. In one case she gives the example of a guy who was vulnerable enough to confess his feelings to a girl he liked, and she turned him down. He went through the pain of rejection, but it was still good of him to be brave and express himself, and anyway now he knows where she stands and he can try to find someone else. There are all sorts of situations where it feels risky to be authentic, and there is indeed some risk, but it's still way better to be vulnerable than to stay silent. On the other hand, keeping abusive people in your life is an ""emotional risk"", and therefore it's technically ""vulnerability"", but it's also a horrible idea! It's also ""vulnerable"" to *leave* an abusive environment, to assert your boundaries when you're afraid you'll be punished for doing so, but that kind of vulnerability is actually super helpful! So it depends on the situation and what choices you're considering. It also depends on your own mental health. Vulnerability is *exhausting*, especially for people with CPTSD. Recently I've been vulnerable by sharing my creative works and by applying for new jobs. Both of those things trigger the fear of rejection. And while it's brave of me to face my fears like that, it's also emotionally draining. I've got tabs open for 3 more jobs I want to apply for, but right now I just can't do it. Pushing myself into it would only burn me out. Brene Brown never fully acknowledges these kids of situations. And when she does semi-acknowledge them, she changes the definitions. In her Netflix special she says ""Vulnerability minus boundaries is not Vulnerability"". Um...yes it is. You defined it earlier as ""emotional risk"". Now you're re-defining it as ""Emotional risk with reasonable boundaries"". The whole idea of healthy boundaries is to make you less ""vulnerable"", not in the sense of being less authentic (hopefully), but in the sense of being better protected from harm. And if you use ""gray rock"" on an abuser, you become less authentic (in their presence) but also better protected from their abuse. Of course in the long run you want to get away from the abuser entirely, so you don't need to ""gray rock"" all the time and you can actually be vulnerable with people who appreciate your authentic self. But Brene doesn't make it clear how situation-dependent this is. A moment later she says that vulnerability is measured by how much courage you have to ""show up and be seen when you can't control the outcome"". But here again we have a problem. If I speak my truth to an abuser and then leave myself at their mercy, if I have no tools to defend myself or escape the situation, then I am clearly in a state where I ""can't control the outcome"", but I'm also making a bad move. Boundaries involve asserting control, not in the sense of controlling the other person per se, but in controlling my own life course. I can't force the abuser to be nice to me, but I can make plans to get the heck out of there if they continue to be cruel."

Some background: I grew up with a profoundly abusive father. Each day was it's new terror, and in addition to living in constant fear, my mother would take off--leaving my sisters and I to fend for ourselves. Present day: I'm currently in therapy with a therapist specializing in trauma. She's helping me immensely to both understand what happened, process everything, and give me tools to cope. While she's a rock in my life, I'm in desperate need of others who ""get it""--as I've been putting everything on my boyfriend. I've been with my bf now for nearly a year, and in the last 7 months I've had intense panic attacks triggered by hypervigilance, perceived cheating, and the fear he doesn't truly love me. I'm 31, and it's my first intimate relationship. He's gone with me to therapy, and supported me through weekly panic attacks. There have been times when he's worn a new hat, and I've convinced myself another woman bought it for him; causing me to cry hysterically, and sometimes hit myself in the face. Most recently, I learned of a close friend's stage 4 metastatic cancer diagnosis. While he tried to comfort me as I broke down over the news, it quickly escalated into me having a panic attack. He left with me bawling, saying, ""you're better off without me."" Typically after these things I hear from him in a few hours, or the next morning. An entire day went by (yesterday) with radio silence, and it's sent me into an obsessive, fear of abandonment spiral. I tried to reach out, and he left me on read. I fully understand how draining this is for him--I feel intense shame over my reactions, and I would never intentionally try to hurt him. But right now I'm obsessively thinking he's going to disappear, and I finally pushed him away. I guess I am seeking perspective, or possibly similar experiences to make me feel less alone. My therapist has told me I've made major progress, but then these things happen and I feel like I'm 9 years old and the creator of my own pain. Thank you so much in advance &lt;3"
161,vulnerability,CPTSD,Social difficulties being based in fear and what I (try to) do about it,11,dqzx5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/dqzx5k/social_difficulties_being_based_in_fear_and_what/,2019-11-03 23:46:09,"I wrote this as a comment in [another thread](URL and thought it was worth sharing as a stand alone post. //// I always viewed myself as a shy person. I would routinely feel that I had to filter everything I say and kind of stay away from topics/situations that I couldn't compute or when I couldn't figure out how to present myself quick enough. It wasn't until I reached a level of spontaneity and being able to relax slightly that this changed. I became more able to give more authentic reactions with people I am comfortable with. At this point I could also finally see that previously I had been inside of this bubble of having to really think before speaking and how much of an obstacle it really was to self expression and connection. I didn't know it until I came out the other end enough and could see my former self in the rear view mirror. Even though I am still really uncomfortable with a lot of situations/dynamics/topics and often times with specific people, this scope of being able to let myself just be unfiltered to a greater extent has increased with the years. I am very certain that many people still perceive me as inhibited, stiff and odd, but for me there has been a lot of improvements. However there are so much still for me to work on. I think it helps to really have a look at the social struggles you have and pinpoint and make more concrete what is going on and how. The more self aware you can be in a compassionate way (!) the more you can break down what you experience into smaller segments and work on those. For example I've been extremely uncomfortable with eye contact. By paying close enough attention to myself nowadays I am more able to catch myself when it gets uncomfortable for me and also sometimes why. If it's about the situation, the other person, the topic or something else. I then sort of know what the limit of comfort is right at that point. Then I can allow myself to relax there, or see it as practicing by moving a bit more into unknown territory and stretch my comfort zone slowly. Another thing I noticed with myself and that I think is somewhat a general thing is that the social anxiety / clumsiness we experience is based in fear. I had many forms of defense mechanisms, avoidance of different sorts that would keep me safe by staying distant from sensing the fear as it is in social settings. *For example this would be fear of judgement, fear of uncomfortable silence, fear of certain topics, fear of showing up honestly, fear of other peoples strong emotions, fear of having to enforce boundaries, fear of showing vulnerability, fear of talking to people I experience as ""more"" than me, fear of presenting myself to beautiful women and so on.* By more noticing that underneath the sort of vague discomfort and awkwardness that is messing with us in social settings, there is the feeling of being afraid, I could be more compassionate with myself. It helps me to see that when I get in any of the fear inducing situations, my brain and whole organism kicks into danger-mode. Then of course I feel like I have to get away from there ASAP. Or, I freeze and become suddenly stiff and weird, which I in turn notice and feel the other person react to and then the snowball is rolling. With time more fear is associated with whatever made that mechanism kick off, basically I'm enforcing a phobia. I have to say also that at first this realization and refocus on noticing the actual fear made it a lot worse. The dissociation and defensive behaviors that previously would make me steer away from consciously noticing what I actually felt was stripped off more and more. It got really raw at first but at least it gave me something solid to work with, instead of always sort of fooling myself. This whole thing of becoming suddenly steeped in fear and having your body and mind kick into fear-gear affects our ability to process and interpret information, and certainly our ability to respond appropriately. Even more it stops us from accessing the more serene part of ourselves that we want to use in order to connect with others. What is happening isn't strange at all! This ties into trauma too. To use myself as an example: it's very understandable that I have difficulties feeling safe and comfortable with other people, given that even the people I spent the most time with as a kid and had known for my whole life (my parents) were still not safe enough for me to just be relaxed. If I can't let my guard down with them, then who? In my case: no one. I'm sure many here felt the same way. Trying to force yourself to act in your ideal way even though your whole system is flooded with fear and gridlocked into fight/freeze/flight is a very difficult task. If you expect that to ever work to the degree that you wish it would, chances are you keep being disappointed and ashamed. Your inner critic will keep saying it's not enough and if it's not enough it's a disaster, every single time. I think it's the wrong approach to take. Rather than beating ourselves up and obsessing over the particulars, I find it helpful to focus on sensing the fear instead of letting it push us around in reactive states. I believe that only by disarming the fear, for example by learning to tolerate it more. It has two parts, the fear itself and the fear of the fear. If we can allow ourselves to be afraid without making it worse, because fear is scary, we've come a long way. Even if it's only slightly better in one specific situation, can we help our bodies and brains to re-code that situation as not exactly so very dangerous. Then another biological mode of being kicks in which in turn helps us to relax with what is and act more in the way we wish we could I'm sorry if I sound like a smarty pants and like I mastered this, it's not my meaning to pretend that I'm teaching the supreme truth.

162,vulnerability,CPTSD,"Attachment theory, the secure base, and its implications on our adult selves",25,druqvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/druqvx/attachment_theory_the_secure_base_and_its/,2019-11-05 16:25:25,"A bit of an A/N: I've been in and out of counselling and doing a lot of healing/recovering the past few years. Along with that has been a lot of reading and learning about psychology and attachment - which lead to me writing stuff like the below, so hopefully it can connect with and help others too. \- It has been many years since [John Bowlby first proposed the idea of attachment theory](URL which developed and grew into a theory that proposed that the attachments and relationship patterns we have later in life are reflections of the original attachment we had with our primary caregiver as an infant. Since Bowlby, a ton papers and books have been churned out about the subject. Countless studies have been done, including the famous [rhesus monkeys study](URL We usually visualise attachment styles with the XY axis of view of self and view of others. Do you see yourself as good, worthy of love, or no? Do you see others as trustworthy, loving, safe, or no? And where you fall upon on these two dimensions can reliably place you into different adult attachment types: secure, anxious/ambivalent/preoccupied, avoidant (including fearful and dismissive), and disorganised. There are several different names for those types, but theyre essentially referring to the same patterns. Studying psychology, attachment theory has always interested me  particularly the idea of a secure base. Ideally, when we are young, our primary caregiver (does not necessarily have to be a parent), are a secure base, a safe home from which we comfortably explore the outside (sometimes scary) world. We cry when we are separated from them, we are comforted as soon as we are back with them, and with them around, we know we are safe to venture further and further out of the den, so to speak. However I argue that at least half of people (at least in modern Western, middle class society that Im familiar with) did not experience a perfectly secure attachment in infanthood. There are many ways attachment trauma can manifest in childhood. A caregiver may be inconsistent in their providing of love: at times, they are caring and nurturing, other times, they may be angry or distant. A caregiver may be consistently negligent (and this includes emotionally) to a child entirely, ignoring cries for help or comfort. A caregiver may never respond positively at all. A caregiver may abandon or leave the child. Sometimes, its not deliberate, sometimes an unfortunate result of unfortunate circumstance, but nevertheless, they are impactful because an infant doesnt understand why anything is happening. Maybe you grow up and logically understand why some things happened, but that doesnt change the fact that when you were 3, 4, you didnt  and you still carry that child who was scared and had no idea what was going on. When youre a baby, love and nurture from a primary caregiver is not only wanted, but needed for survival. In the olden days, a baby without a secure home and caregiver around is a dead one. There is a primal need in us as social creatures to be cared for and to connect with others, and as babies, there is really only one place initially where that can be found  a caregiver. So, when a caregiver leaves, when a caregiver reacts violently, when a caregiver ignores our pleas entirely, when theyre unpredictable, this isnt just an inconvenience for a helpless toddler, but a threat upon survival and life itself. Its no wonder that early childhood trauma can extend far into adolescence and adulthood, even if the memories dont, simply because they were so impactful to the baby at the time. I ponder whether or not the formation of our self esteem and ego is an almost perfect extension of how we attached to our caregivers. In most modern models of attachment, one of the dimensions is our view of ourselves. But I posit it goes further than that  it isnt whether or not you like or dont like yourself, it is whether you are securely attached to *yourself* as a secure base from which to form connections to others. That many symptoms of various mental illnesses such as perpetual emptiness, a consistent lack of identity, terror of abandonment, disillusionment, and more, may sometimes be able to be traced back to attachment theory  of never being able to mirror a loving caregiver to establish your own secure base. A childs identity is formed at a young age, and is more or less learned through interactions with caregivers and the environment. It makes sense that a disruption of this identity formation period can lead to a weak sense of self and chronic emptiness and disconnect with the self as an adult. A childs growing self esteem is a cyclical relationship with their environment growing up. Every behaviour of theirs elicits a response from a caregiver, which impacts the growing sense of self, and so on and so forth. Ideally, if a caregiver is consistently responsive, warm, and caring, a baby begins to build up an internal model of the self, a [looking glass self](URL that the self is someone worthy of warmth, care, and love. And it is through this consistent push and pull, reinforcement of values and behaviours and internal beliefs, that a growing childs self esteem is moulded  that their identity is moulded from. And this is a self esteem and ego that may be so steadfast it remains far into adulthood  at least its foundation does. On the other hand, a neglectful, abusive, hurtful, distant, or inconsistent caregiver sends a completely different message to a (helpless) child. The child learns that they are not worthy of love and care, and that reaching out will only backfire. They may develop a sense of self that is hurt and self defeating, or a sense of self that is fiercely self isolating and fearful of vulnerability, or a self that lashes out just to survive. And all of this may occur at such a young age, at such an unconscious level, that left unexamined simply live onto adulthood without any conscious recognition. However, every interaction at a young age is a lesson that is internalised. Just as one example; a caregiver lashes out at one year old you for crying, you learn that your hurt will not be recognised and that expressing yourself will be punished. Its akin to a form of conditioning  if a babys cries is met with anger, creating fear and anxiety, then a baby will not cry out for an adult anymore. They associate reaching out with pain and violence. These lessons, if they are never unlearned, can easily carry well into adulthood. It may be that self esteem and ego are essentially the secure bases we return to when we are alone. At the end of the day, we only have one self we consistently come back home to each and every time  the self. When we do not have that secure base within ourselves, thats when problems begin to arise. Its like coming back to a chaotic or neglectful or violent household every night  except this time, physically, its just you yourself, and all of that is carried inside, and not in the environment. If youre internally treating yourself in the same negative patterns that caregivers might sometimes have (sometimes very unconsciously), the pattern of not feeling safe and comforted, of feeling lost or afraid, is continuously reinforced. Youre continuously parenting yourself  more often than not in the same ways learned from caregivers actions and behaviours. After doing a lot of reading on the above subjects, I think that we can find so many answers in our childhood  though of course, its never that simple. There is still a lot to be examined. Recently though, more and more, research is showing that it isnt just acute trauma from childhood that can have negative impacts on someone growing up. This growing area of interest can be reflected in all the research on [adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)](URL the idea of [an inner child](URL (associated with the idea of a hurt and traumatised child essentially piloting an adult brain and body), and [schema-focused therapy](URL Its not about simply fixing self esteem. Its not about forcing yourself to suddenly snap your fingers and feel good about yourself. Its about creating a secure attachment to yourself, and to the hurt inner child inside. Its reconnecting with your younger self and providing that love, nurture, acceptance that may not have always been a given growing up. Ill end this with an example that can probably reflect this idea better than my continuous rambling. Think of that scared child you still carry, and tell them, *You did not deserve what happened to you.* *You were just scared and confused, and you did not have the tools to cope with what you were going through. It was not your fault.* *Im so sorry that nobody noticed or helped you.* *Even if you did not get that help, it doesnt mean that you didnt deserve it.* *I forgive you for everything you did, born from desperation and a need for survival. I forgive you for everything.* *I see you now, and you are safe now. Im older, Im wiser, Im with you, and you will never be alone again.* *I still carry you with me, I always will, but this time, you are safe.*"

People talk about dates like they're things that just *happen*, just naturally. A friend or a relative suggests that you go on a date with someone, so you give it a try. Or you set up a dating profile online and sift through an apparently *endless* supply of suitors who are quite happy to meet with you. And I'm like, WTF? How does this happen? Nobody has ever tried to set me up with anyone else. No one has ever said ""Hey, I think you and so-and-so might be a good couple"". And as for online dating, forget it! *Nobody likes me!* I can spend weeks on a dating site, answering questions and sending people messages and stuff, and nothing ever happens! Once in awhile I get informed that me and Person X both like each other, and then I message Person X...and they never reply. *Ever*. On a few occasions someone has reached out to me first and said ""Hey, you look interesting! Would you like to meet up?"" and then I get all excited and reply ""Sure! Where and when would you like to meet?"" and then they *immediately disappear off the internet forever*. And I'm just waiting patiently and I send an occasional follow-up message and I hear nothing back. I've been informed that these people are probably just bots, enticing me to stay on the site. People say that you have to have a lot of first dates before you find someone special, and I'm like ""Where are you getting all the first dates?"". People will say that dating is hard and they haven't had a long-term relationship in a while, but in the next breath they'll mention how they actually had a bunch of short-term relationships that filled the gap. People who are currently not dating tell me that they could get a date at any time if they just logged back onto their dating profile, where, again, they apparently have an infinite number of suitors just waiting around. And I've read all the articles on how to do better with online dating. I've read the lists that are like ""10 horrible things that you should never do"", and I've never done any of those terrible things, not even once. I've read things like ""First figure out if you want short-term or long-term relationships"", and I know what I want, but it seems a moot point when no one has interest in even talking to me. I know well enough to actually read people's profiles and to message them with something specific (""I like that movie too!""). And I've read advice that says you should set up a date within the first 10 messages with someone, but again that's a moot point when *nobody ever talks to me in the first place*. I even had a friend (who has had great success with online dating) look over my profile, and she said it looks great and she has no idea why nobody likes me. My friends all tell me that I'm a great person, and also an *attractive* person, and I deserve to have someone special in my life...but they have no idea how I might *find* such a person. My therapist is likewise stumped. There was one occasion where I met a girl in public and we started talking and I was bold enough to get contact info and *we actually started a relationship*. And that was great while it lasted! But it's over now. And before her I went 5 years without a date of any kind. (Not ""5 years without a long-term relationship"" or ""5 years without any short-term relationships""; I mean 5 years without a single date!) So now I'm worried that it'll be *another* 5 years before I find someone new. Maybe it's partly a function of where I live? Idk. I tried speed dating a couple times too, way back when. On one occasion I got zero matches. On another occasion I got two matches...but when I reached out, I never actually heard from them ever again. So really, zero matches. I just want someone to hold. Is that too much to ask?? And yes, I know about openness and vulnerability and communication and respect and all those things. Even my *ex* says that I'm a good person. But she has no idea where I might find someone new. DAE experience this?"

he's a good man and always has been. to find out that his marriage ended and how it ended and knowing him just made my heart hurt for him too. fast forward to 3 months later after my life is back on track and i am rebuilding, and i ask his aunt (my best friend) how this man is doing and she shared that he was struggling. so i sent him a note on fb, we exchanged phone numbers to stay in touch, and every now and again when i would see him posting depressing songs on fb, i would text him and check in to see how he is doing. clearly depressed and i could feel the pain in the words he wasn't saying, if that makes sense. we talk on the phone and he starts coming out of his shell a little and laughing and texting. then he tells me that he had always wondered ""what if"" with me and while the statement seems obvious, i still asked him what he meant. he said that he had been in love with me since he was 8 years old, in spite of the fact that we would wrestle and he would throw me to the ground and i would pull his hair (i was a tomboy). i was floored. i had no idea. certainly as an adult man, he is everything that i could possibly want in a partner and such a good-hearted man. the conversation turned into one a bit more romantic. the next day he booked a flight out from NE to CA and would be arriving in 2 days to stay for 2 days. he said that he ""needs to see if this is what he thinks it is"". his family in CA was happy to see him and he made it a point to tell them that he came to see me, which still has me flabbergasted because no man has done anything like this. he and i are both very much ""low-risk"" and low drama people so him flying out here so suddenly as well as making the announcement to his family - even his grandmother - that he came to see me made my heart break open. at the end of this week, i am flying to NE to see him. he has been living with his brothers in NE for 3 months and the job there isn't panning out so he is looking at transferring within his company and moving back to CO or CA. he knows that i need to stay put for a year and then can work remotely; he told me that he wants to talk about our future together, he wants us to talk about where we build our life together. now, i am loving all of this and i am falling in love with a man where we know each other, we know the person we are inside behind the walls and there is no mask, no pretense. honestly, it feels like coming home with him. he wants me to meet his dad and of course, his brothers. one of his brothers is very much a naysayer and vocal about it. i respect opinions but it still hurts. i recognize that i need to focus on rebuilding my life but he's made it clear that he wants me to be a part of his, and i recognize that he may have some stuff come up that he needs to process. right now, i can feel the fear of being vulnerable coming up for me. the fear of rejection. wanting everything that he is saying. but i am so scared, this feeling of vulnerability is different - normally when someone comes into my life, i let them in in layers and even then, it is a rare person that sees all of me. he sees all of me and with us having known each other for decades, he is already there and passed all the layers. i don't remember ever feeling this vulnerable. i feel like i am on the verge of tears and i don't know exactly why i am even scared. any feedback, guidance, insight is welcome and thank you in advance."

But above all, she was jealous my dad could give me attention and not her. She screamed until he turned the car around to go to her favorite restaurant. My dad wrote to me that he remembers that day too. How much he wanted to make me feel special. And hes sorry that my mom was like that and he wasnt there for me. Its weird because I remember he was there, but to actually hear him acknowledge that memory that has haunted me for so long is so fucking relieving. Its like I finally feel the mutual validation from someone about my mom. I knew 99% I wasnt crazy, but there was 1% of me that wasnt sure if I was crazy or not - like my mom had told me.

Today I went to a festival where one of the themes is Harry Potter. I watched all the movies and felt very good about them, though I never got around to reading books. (I lack patience for focusing on books generally, though today at least I finally finished Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving.) My enthusiasm about Harry Potter is something I don't share with others. It's due to a sort of instinctive fear of others responding with negative emotions, condemning and shooting down my enthusiasm. I feel safe and okay with that enthusiasm in my mind and in isolation, but don't feel safe with it among other people. I could even say I fear that interaction with other people could poison various enthusiasm with negativity. Since I just finished Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving, I thought about the inner and outer critic. It doesn't seem like I think my enthusiasm for Harry Potter is somehow wrong. I know I might experience a lesser joy than others due to loneliness and psychological issues, but that's not something which bothers me too much. Also, it doesn't seem like I think many other people are assholes who would crush my joy. It simply seems to be a fear of others expressing negative perspectives, which I then at least temporarily accept about myself, and feel seriously bad about. Weirdly, it's as if they can express perspectives which are at least temporarily stronger than my own beliefs that my enthusiasm about Harry Potter is okay. I say temporarily, because I assume it would take many repeated negative experiences to crush my enthusiasm in a lasting way. Seems like I'm basically saying I don't know how this fits into the paradigm of inner or outer critic, because of the temporary nature. It might be more about lack of self esteem. Maybe part of what's wrong here is difficulty labelling others as bad when they're behaving badly towards me. That seems like something which should protect me, by making me take their perspective less seriously. Anyways, coming to the festival was worth it. I did enjoy various parts of it. Not expressing myself much is normal, and not something which totally ruins experiences. It's important to feel safe just being and observing, even if I'd like to be more involved, and I'm glad I can at least do that."

And it is tempting to disown the self who wanted to believe what was promised to her, because to disown that self is to absolve myself of the grief over the loss of what never truly existed. It is easier to say I've changed. That I was dissociated, and stunted, and desperate. That the person who experienced the trauma is not who I am. These things are true. But it is also true that some element of my personhood was sustained throughout my history. And sometimes, when I experience memories of what happened, I whisper to myself: I was there. I was there when I hugged my parents tightly. I was there when I wrote a blog post about how grateful I was for their tough love: how I could never thank them enough for training me to be ""good"". At that time, I was not free to feel what I truly felt, to express what I truly felt. I was stifled, and desperate to align my inner experience with who I was thought to be (which, in my mind at the time, was who I ought to be). And yet: I was there. Quietly, feeling ashamed and frustrated, I was there. I was there when I betrayed myself. I was there when I preferred a glimmer of external validation over honest self-evaluation. I was there when I thought I was infected by Satan. I was there. I was there later, too. I was there when -- after the childhood trauma became known to me, and the religious trauma unveiled itself -- I trusted a partner who took advantage of my vulnerability. I was wounded, and he was lovely. Until he wasn't. I was there when he was lovely just like I was there when he wasn't. I put an old playlist on shuffle today. A song came on that reminded me of that painfully beautiful instant that I trusted him. I wanted to turn it off. I wanted to sneer, because it was all bullshit. But it wasn't bullshit, because I was there. He was full of shit, and my parents were full of shit, because they are broken humans with broken motivations. And I was broken too, in a way -- but I was there. It is painful to acknowledge that I was there. it makes me feel small, and responsible. But it shouldn't. The fact that the emotionally intelligent and self-compassionate part of me existed all along is incredible. That I have experienced all of this, and am who I am, is incredible. None of this is my fault. It is not my fault that I could not fully love myself until I had the space to love myself. The fact that I continued to exist until I could love myself is incredible. I was there. I was there. I am here, and I can still be proud that I was there. Because, despite all the bullshit and abuse and dehumanization, I have survived. To see my current surviving self as disparate from my past repressed self is uncharitable. It is painful to recognize that what happened to me happened to ME. But I was there all along, and I am here now, and that is incredibly powerful. I was there. I am proud that despite being there, I am now here. I am grateful to myself for unfolding and growing. I am so very grateful and proud. Not because I'm not there anymore, but because I was there, and now I am free. I was there. It is incredible to be here. "

It's just exhausted and even though I have isolated myself from everyone in my life....it's still not enough. I hate how I look, how I speak, how I can't just get in with things. The nightmares and paranoia etc is just another added punishment to the fact I should never been here. I used to have so much hope that maybe things would get better. But not anymore. I'm just a waste of a person. I have tried the therapy and medication route. It's still ongoing. But I am so fucking scared of showing anyone a hint of my vulnerability that it doesn't work probably.

173,vulnerability,CPTSD,How do I handle interacting with my mother when I hate her and dont trust her?,9,ddoosl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ddoosl/how_do_i_handle_interacting_with_my_mother_when_i/,2019-10-06 01:30:29,"My mother is visiting the city I live in. Shes staying in a hotel, thankfully not staying with me. Ive met up with her once for dinner and just met up with her at an art gallery and showed her where I live. Ive deliberately kept the conversation surface-level, because I dont trust her at all. She is an incredibly judgemental and surface-obsessed person. She cant handle me not being ok. She just wants me to pretend everythings fine and if its not she does her poor me, Im a terrible mother act. Last time I opened up to her and showed real vulnerability, during a breakup, she used it as an opportunity to try to convince me to quit my job and move back home with her and my father. Thats absolutely the worst thing I could do. She clearly doesnt like the fact that Im tired, I have a bad cold, am angry at her, being distant in conversation, and am really really sad. I can tell she wants me to play some kind of role I used to play, but Im not going to do that any more. Just now when she was leaving she said something like conversation is hard between us. I feel like with a healthy person I could say something like, yes, to be honest Im angry with you because x, y, z. But I am so exhausted. I am so low on self care right now. Is it OK to not confront her, to not say, yeah, Im angry with you because I had a terrible childhood and you were abusive in this way and this way and this way. Theres part of me that wants to call her up or go over to the hotel and just be honest. But it will probably lead to a shit storm of denial. This stuff is really really hard. Honestly if I had enough money saved up to be financially secure, Id be done with dealing with my parents ever again."

I just glanced through some chapters from the book and still need to read thoroughly, but have a feeling that the book has a lot of chapters analyzing what's going on in an adult survivor's inner world, but doesn't have much information on how the outer world can easily exploit them and how to protect themselves from the danger of overt/covert narcissism. Since I was diagnosed as PTSD in 2010, I visited a lot of hospitals, doctors in private practice, public services and so forth, in all of which I encountered narcissists.

The probability of discovering narcissists' true faces may depend on various factors. I believe your attribution can be one of the major factors: your gender, color, social status, in addition to where you live and belong to. Pete Walker might not have encountered as many narcissists in his life as I did in my life or he may have; I never know, but I, as a trauma survivor, would say the following, based on extremely horrible situations in my adulthood that I have experienced even after I had started my healing journey. : &gt;no matter how benign or generous they look, in fact, they can be narcissists I can even imagine a saint-like person in front of Pete Walkerwho is a Caucasian male Ph.D. holder living in a developed country where individual rights are more respected than where I livewould severely abuse me who is a colored female living on social assistance. My views may sound pessimistic to some of you, but this is my everyday life. People change their attitude, depending on what social status their interlocutor has. For instance, a number of doctors don't give me proper treatments because I'm on social assistance. One more thing Pete Walker writes that I feel is incomprehensive is: &gt;The child who is abandoned in this way experiences the world as a terrifying place. To me, the world IS a terrifying place full of narcissists, their flying monkeys, enablers, and bystanders who are overt/covert agents of abuse and neglect, who act as a mobbing force against me, and who are often authority and institutional figures having tremendous power and control over me. Some self-help books gave me the impression that once I recognize and learn what my family has done to me and how my inner world is dysfunctional, I'm good to go (Although Pete Walker writes healing is a lifelong process, I still feel he much focuses on telling the aftermath of traumas). But in reality, it's hard to not repeat similar traumas, because I can try my hardest to change my inner broken parts, but I can't change bad people out there. Perhaps, I develop better strategies to deal with them, but I'm sure I still get traumatized by their badness, because no one can come out of narcissists' controlling situations in full possession of their faculties. I could even say just being alive under the power of the status-quo political systems is traumatizing. So this is my way to read self-help books. -Negotiate with the text -Don't be docile -They may be a doctor/therapist and have experience in treating thousands and thousands of patients, but my case may not apply to his theories or claims.) -Take in their knowledge as much as I can (After all, they are a doctor/therapist who has acquired tons of knowledge through their practice) -Don't depend on a few books; read a wide range of ones"

They're not perfect, but I don't believe they're the cause of my CPTSD symptoms. There was something that happened years ago that was pretty messed up (in an nutshell, an adult in a position of authority who was not a member of my family behaved inappropriately toward me when I was 10-15 years old). Even though I tried many times, I was only able to get away from him for good when he started losing interest because I was no longer a child. I thought it was grey area for many years but when I discussed with mental health professionals, they said it wasn't. My family did not know about this until many years later. The strange thing is, I was emotionally disturbed even before this happened, for no apparent reason. That's not even what I'm struggling with most now, though. The thing that stresses me out most nowadays is various forms of secondhand (and some firsthand) medical trauma, all of which happened when I was an adult. This is the source of most of my fears, traumatic memories, emotional flashbacks, brain fog, and stress related health issues. I'm so torn up by this medical trauma stuff. Most ""normal"" people would probably consider it stressful but ordinary life adversity, but I'm not coping with it well at all. I've been reading a lot about trauma and nervous system dysregulation. It seems valid for the most part, but there seems to be a gap when it comes to accounting for the effects of innate temperament. The stuff I've read assumes ""environment failure"" is responsible for traumatic reactions. Implicit in that assumption is that with the proper environment and upbringing, these things can be prevented. I have a lot of doubts about that. I know that trauma doesn't have to be obvious or extreme to have a lasting impact, but I think that if it's caused by something objectively minor, there must be some underlying temperamental vulnerability and lack of resilience that should be acknowledged. I see it as a spectrum rather than a binary. I wonder if the appropriate treatment (or prognosis) is different for symptoms stemming from more from temperamental vulnerability than objective external adversity. It just seems like an odd thing to gloss over. In my case, I would say that at least 80% of what I'm dealing with is due to innate temperament. There's nothing in my life that fully accounts for it, and I refuse to shoehorn my lived experiences into a theory."

After realising how out-of-touch Ive been from my emotions for most of my life, Ive begun diligently observing and recording my reactions to events in my daily life that elicit strong emotion in me. Heres the most recent example (interpretation in brackets): Last week I was grocery shopping for my grandma. Whilst I was carrying the shopping back to her house, oblivious to my surroundings, I was hit by an egg thrown from a moving car. After the initial confusion, my brain defaulted to keep calm and carry on and I kept walking, I tried to hide the fact Id been egged from passers-by. (I was following a learnt behaviour pattern from being bullied in school: retaliation or reporting the bully to teachers would just make things worse, so the best response was to act like nothing had happened. Dont give them the satisfaction of knowing they provoked me.) Soon after that I experienced feelings of irritation, resignation and exasperation (why me?). Subsequently, for the rest of the day I would periodically experience feelings of anger and depressive rumination bubbling up, with my mind being unable to let it go. (I felt angry because I had no means of seeking justice, just like my experience at school. Someone acted with unprovoked malice towards me and there was nothing I could do besides just take it and try to move on.) (The purpose of the rumination, again learned in school, was to try to understand the motivation behind the egg-throwing so that I can avoid being targeted in future. The rumination continues and leads to depression because Im unable to find a satisfactory explanation or motive that would allow me to feel like the world makes sense.) When I reached my grandmas house I explained what happened in a light-hearted way (didnt know what the correct reaction was and didnt want to show vulnerability). She reacted with anger towards the culprit but I felt a bit put out by her response because it didnt really show concern for my feelings. (I decided the response I would have liked to hear was: Im sorry that happened to you, you didnt deserve it. I would feel upset if that happened to me. A hug would also have been appreciated, once Id cleaned my shirt!) So, thats my story. I hope its interesting to somebody out there - its my way of making sense of myself and the world around me!

The relationship is going well, and I love my partner very much but I have this difficulty with knowing what a healthy relationship is even supposed to look like sometimes? When I was younger, I remember being treated badly (yelled at, eye-rolling, mocked), or told I was being manipulative when I cried, and now I get this intense worry/fear that any time I express a negative emotion or ask for something I need or want in my relationship, that I'm somehow being manipulative or toxic or abusive for doing it? For example, if I feel slightly sad about something my partner does, I feel so guilty if I tell him, even if I try to say it in the most calm and reasonable way possible and let him know that I just want him to know how I'm feeling? I KNOW it's not really true and there must be some middle ground, but I feel like my only two options are to be a manipulative, toxic person who's emotions control everything, or completely repressing my negative emotions. I need to get back into counselling to talk about this issue I guess. Just want to see if I'm the only one."

I finally got a right diagnosis and start treating it as such. The therapist told me that I would start remembering stuff, but oh.. boy did I not expect this. :D The last few days were pretty much in a daze and a lot of dissociation. Pretty much a lot of old addictive habits came back (alcohol) and of course less sleep and problems with eating. He used to tell me I ate too much. Now at least, when I have dissociation, I don't go complete void and terror, at least I managed to ""watch"" some of the events. After the dissociation has stopped, I even managed to remember some chunks after. I will write it down here. Ha.. I feel like a fraud, though. Like it didn't happen. But it did... Just some context. There is a a trigger warning in the title. So, this is well the triggering parts begin. When I met him, I was already raped once (for my first time) and there are some signs of earlier childhood events. Also, my family is abusive and they don't respect my boundaries. I also found out no long ago, when I reached out here and when I reached out to an old friend of mine. I know the difference between pressure and support. I am the ""crazy child"" of the family. My sister is the poster child. My sister also disregards my no a lot. The last time I told her, I have episodes, I don't to talk about them, please, I need peace and quite, she asked ""what episodes? tell me more about them"", but this time, I stood my ground. This is not the first time. The last time we had a fight and I was visibly upset and I asked to leave me, she didn't, I started yelling to leave me alone. She scolded me for yelling. She did leave me alone eventually. My mother is the classic narcissist. She would lose control, when she sees vulnerability, she would blame me for all with heavy words, she would neglect my attempts to explain what and after some time she would become super sweet and apologetic and I love you and stuff. It worked till now. I am starting to see it now. We are close. I am hatching now some plan of escape. But all in due time. This is not about this. My father is also blaming me quite a lot. Like when something bad happens to me, it's my fault. For example last time the flight was overbooked and they refused me, during the whole ride home he was ranting about how I wasn't 14 anymore and how inappropriate of me. Next morning he apologized and during lunch both my mother and father were upset that I was still upset. I mean, you know we love you, that's just the way we are. You know... ugh... those tricks are starting to lose their essence. I will get out. Eventually. This is not about this. This is about my ex. Who was a psychopath. We were together for two months. I remember maybe 3 or 4 occasions, the other ones are still pretty void. So, I decided to not erase the memories any more and share with you. You see, this is all real and I don't believe it. I feel a fraud, but I decided I will start changing anyway. If some psychopath crosses my path again, at least I will know that I set up some reaching mechanism in place... So here it goes. The first time I met him, I was already in dissociation and not feeling good. I didn't know what it was at the time, it was anniversary of the first rape. He engaged me and charmed me very quickly, very attractive, cheerful smile and quite polite. He was really nothing like my first lover, who was unstable and was also abusing me. My first lover was more like my parents, really trying, but failing at the end. This one... this one was very different. I don't remember our first date, but my first impression was just that, polite, had a nice job, well integrated, no emotional instability. All surface. I do remember the first night together though. We were together in bed, I was putting the condom on him and I freaked out and I said ""No, I don't want to, let's stop."" \[hm.. great timing the neighbors at it again with the domestic violence. :D fantastic sound effects\] I blacked out from the memories. Next thing I remember he is on me. So, he pretty much knew exactly what he was doing. He knew he was hurting me. There were no remorse really. I didn't register it. In fact, I kind of forget the next morning that it happened. Funny thing with my dissociation. How memory works. Also, he also chose the positions that would be hurting me the most. I remembered that when I told him that a certain position was hurting me, he would start using it most of the time. I was bruised most of times. I didn't register it. I still remember very little. Also, I remember one time I was on top, I was starting to enjoy myself and he switched immediately and put me in the bad position, I don't remember after that. He would pleasure me orally, but just so I can get further in dissociation and not register it, I remember how he was looking at me, not with mutual pleasure but with some sadistic spunk in his eyes. He was actually amazing at it. I would lose my mind every time, so he knew exactly the difference between pleasure and pain. During intercourse though, he didn't have patience for pleasure. One of the glimpses I have of his face during sex was how it changed, it was nothing like his face during the day, it was so cruel. I didn't register it. He would always do exactly the opposite of what I asked of him. I would say slower, he would go much faster, till I went totally blank. When he saw that I was getting pleasure from it, he would slap me or pull my hair, or push me down or somehow trigger my rape memories, I told him about it and how it happened. He reenacted it. There are more... worse I remember. One time we had dinner with his neighbor, it was a nice and fun dinner, we were all joking and having fun. When we went back to his room, there was a switch and he asked me ""would I fuck the guy"" I said ""no, what are you saying? Why would I?"" and he kept pushing and made it like I was shallow for not wanting to fuck the guy or something, I don't remember, whatever it was, the end result was that he got enraged. I fought him this night, he got really mad, when I fought. I don't remember exactly what happened, I just remembered how he managed to subdue me in the end and fucked me. He was quite stronger. There are more... I will remember in due time. So, he was a sadist, a psychopath. The whole goal was to see me suffer. It was deliberate and calculated torture. And yet to this day, I feel like a fraud, like it didn't happen to me. I mean, those people they are only in movies... right? haha nope. It did happen, whether I decide to process and accept it is up to me. I just wish, I didn't feel like a fraud so much. It will get better! For the first time, I am telling my story. He is in the past now... And I am looking at the future. I know I will survive and do my best to thrive. I want to keep reaching, telling my story and one day I might just believe it.

I remember maybe 3 or 4 occasions, the other ones are still pretty void. So, I decided to not erase the memories any more and share with you. You see, this is all real and I don't believe it. I feel a fraud, but I decided I will start changing anyway. If some psychopath crosses my path again, at least I will know that I set up some reaching mechanism in place... So here it goes. The first time I met him, I was already in dissociation and not feeling good. I didn't know what it was at the time, it was anniversary of the first rape. He engaged me and charmed me very quickly, very attractive, cheerful smile and quite polite. He was really nothing like my first lover, who was unstable and was also abusing me. My first lover was more like my parents, really trying, but failing at the end. This one... this one was very different. I don't remember our first date, but my first impression was just that, polite, had a nice job, well integrated, no emotional instability. All surface. I do remember the first night together though. We were together in bed, I was putting the condom on him and I freaked out and I said ""No, I don't want to, let's stop."" \[hm.. great timing the neighbors at it again with the domestic violence. :D fantastic sound effects\] I blacked out from the memories. Next thing I remember he is on me. So, he pretty much knew exactly what he was doing. He knew he was hurting me. There were no remorse really. I didn't register it. In fact, I kind of forget the next morning that it happened. Funny thing with my dissociation. How memory works. Also, he also chose the positions that would be hurting me the most. I remembered that when I told him that a certain position was hurting me, he would start using it most of the time. I was bruised most of times. I didn't register it. I still remember very little. Also, I remember one time I was on top, I was starting to enjoy myself and he switched immediately and put me in the bad position, I don't remember after that. He would pleasure me orally, but just so I can get further in dissociation and not register it, I remember how he was looking at me, not with mutual pleasure but with some sadistic spunk in his eyes. He was actually amazing at it. I would lose my mind every time, so he knew exactly the difference between pleasure and pain. During intercourse though, he didn't have patience for pleasure. One of the glimpses I have of his face during sex was how it changed, it was nothing like his face during the day, it was so cruel. I didn't register it. He would always do exactly the opposite of what I asked of him. I would say slower, he would go much faster, till I went totally blank. When he saw that I was getting pleasure from it, he would slap me or pull my hair, or push me down or somehow trigger my rape memories, I told him about it and how it happened. He reenacted it. There are more... worse I remember. One time we had dinner with his neighbor, it was a nice and fun dinner, we were all joking and having fun. When we went back to his room, there was a switch and he asked me ""would I fuck the guy"" I said ""no, what are you saying? Why would I?"" and he kept pushing and made it like I was shallow for not wanting to fuck the guy or something, I don't remember, whatever it was, the end result was that he got enraged. I fought him this night, he got really mad, when I fought. I don't remember exactly what happened, I just remembered how he managed to subdue me in the end and fucked me. He was quite stronger. There are more... I will remember in due time. So, he was a sadist, a psychopath. The whole goal was to see me suffer. It was deliberate and calculated torture. And yet to this day, I feel like a fraud, like it didn't happen to me. I mean, those people they are only in movies... right? haha nope. It did happen, whether I decide to process and accept it is up to me. I just wish, I didn't feel like a fraud so much. It will get better! For the first time, I am telling my story. He is in the past now... And I am looking at the future. I know I will survive and do my best to thrive. I want to keep reaching, telling my story and one day I might just believe it.

182,vulnerability,CPTSD,i got a job interview!!,66,cs5492,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/cs5492/i_got_a_job_interview/,2019-08-19 04:37:09,on friday - i got a call to schedule an interview for a job i applied to almost two months ago. i had 100% given up hope after so much time had passed so i'm still pinching myself!! it's an absolute dream job and i can hardly believe i'm up for it. vulnerability is one of hte things i've been working on in therapy lately. and i very much agree w the brene brown theories - you have to put yourself out there in order for like-minded people to find you. i did that w this app. i put myself out there. i told a personal anecdote and even showed my hand re: my political leanings. not to mention! the week the app was due - i had a family member visiting and had to ask her to leave so i had enough time to finish before the deadline. i shared so much in fact that i had a bit of a vulnerability hangover afterward. when i didn't hear from them - i assumed i'd taken too many risks and they'd thrown out my app. and now here i am almost two months later about to take a phone interview. for the last three years - i've been freelancing while i heal and go to therapy and try to get my life on track. this is the first job i've applied to in three years. and i got the call. i'm so happy w this strange turn of events. i haven't stopped smiling all weekend. regardless what happens w the job - this has been such an unbelievable confidence boost. and really truly illustrates to me that putting yourself out there is the best policy

I suspect this is part of why I haven't responded to trauma treatment. I have serious doubts about the validity of a lot of trauma therapies I've read about (I just don't buy into the ideas they're based on), and I haven't had much luck with the one's I've tried. I can't blame the therapists, they are all trauma informed and I've responded positively to other modes of therapy (supportive therapy, psychoeducation, and IPSRT) from them, but what we've tried so far (mainly somatic experiencing, some EMDR and hypnotherapy) hasn't made much of a dent in the trauma stuff. I'm planning to continue with other treatments (meds, self care stuff) and doing art. Not art therapy, just doing art on my own. I wouldn't rule out trying some form of treatment again in the future if I thought it could help me, but for now I'm taking a break from it because I'm kind of burned out and it's just making me feel more hopeless. Have you been in a similar situation? Did you find something that helped after trying many things that didn't?"

I'm 29, have never been in a romantic relationship, have hard keeping friends around. Selfless acts feels extremely unsafe and are terrifying. I can't help someone if I won't gain anything out of it, because then it would show that I care for that person... and apparently I don't want people to think that I care for others... it's scary!

She made me cry a couple of times by her simple presence. I love who she is, I love how she cares for me, but is it love I feel for her? I mean, I'm only giving her poor care comparatively, I'm being selfish, because of what I said above, so there is this feeling of unbalance: she is giving me a lot, and it really makes my heart beats strong, but I'm not, it feels unfare for her."

I have been doing some self-IFS lately. And as I was curled up on the floor, slowly coming out of it and feeling a numbness spread over me, I got into a bit of an exchange with the part of me that protects me from my trauma. The part of me that pulls me from my flashbacks by numbing my emotions, and puts an imperceptible and yet impenetrable wall between me and most other people. ""I can't do my job if you're going to keep doing like this right now. There's nowhere for any of this shit to go."" And I finally understood. This part of me is not ""bad"" or ""sick"" or ""disordered."" It is incredibly strong, and doing the impossible every moment of my life, for the entire 30 years I've been alive. It has never failed me. And the reason it won't stop is because it *can't*. Healthy coping mechanisms rely on a having a support network, and moderate pace of ""bad stuff."" You can get through anything with your mental health intact, as long as you have people you can reach out to, and the bad times, well... stop, at some point. Processing is contingent on having people to process *with*. Moving on is contingent on being *able* to move on. In other words, healthy coping mechanisms aren't just something you have within yourself as a lone pillar. They are something you have in concert with others. Like many of us, I grew up alone, with no one I could rely on, with ""bad stuff"" happening every single day of my life, and outside of my ability to escape. For decades, without pause. Having healthy coping mechanisms is completely impossible in that environment. It literally can't happen. The conditions are not there to allow it to happen. So, my mind found a way to survive the unsurvivable. My brain found a way to contain an unlimited amount of pain that *could not* be processed, and allow me to keep functioning no matter how enormous the pile got. My Protector is fucking superhuman. Doing the goddamn impossible every moment of every day. Shielding me from a depth of pain that would kill me in an instant if it ever hit me full-force. And most of the time, I don't even feel it. Incredible. This realization allowed me to accept that, right now, I cannot do processing work and need to focus on building distress tolerance instead. It is not because I'm ""too broken."" It's because my Protector is doing SUCH a hard job that NO ONE would be able to take all that on in a healthy way. Healthy coping mechanisms are only capable of handling a small fraction of that pain at one time. Our protectors have found ways around that -- at a price, of course. But what was the alternative? My Protector is not trying to stop me from being around people. It's telling me that it needs help, before it can allow me to access that vulnerability. I can't do it where I am now -- I'm not stable, and it's not safe. And its job is to make sure I'm always safe. And that realization reframed the picture. I am not ""weak."" I am coming to the rescue of my Protector, who has been working at full-tilt non-stop for decades, no matter how battered they got. I am coming to save them, and let them finally retire. It will take time. But I know they will keep holding down the fort as I work away at their caseload, one piece at a time. And I know they will not quit until they are no longer needed. Because they love me, and want me to stay alive. Inside most of us is the shamed child, with no regard for themselves, no sense of self-respect. But also inside most of us is a protector, who loves us so much that it has bent the rules of the human psyche to allow us to continue living in the face of unimaginable suffering. And that deserves my thanks."

I searched it on reddit and found this community. Looking through the subreddit it was crazy how much it resonated with me. I always figured that I inherited my fathers behavior because I tried to mimic him as a child, and because I had grown up learning how to mimic and camouflage to hide my autism. My mom sent me to someone to be diagnosed years ago, and she only diagnosed me with depression because I camouflaged so well, although my later trip to an inpatient mental hospital due to self harm diagnosed me with autism, severe anxiety, depression, sensory disorders, and possible bipolarity (still unsure 3 years later). But looking through the subreddit on my feed for the next month continuously I started to believe more and more that I suffered from CPTSD. Ive always suffered from multiple mental disorders so Im never sure where a symptom is coming from. But memories that arent absolutely essential are blanked out, a therapist two years ago asked me what the inpatient hospital was like and I couldnt remember a thing, I panicked. Im calm in the face of severe stress but any small issue can leave me upset for days. Im always on guard, high alert to the point I get migraines. I have invisible boundaries that once someone passes them I lash out and scramble to distance myself any way possible. Ive lost several friends. I dont feel like I can trust anyone but myself. I always keep everyone at arms length anyways to avoid pain and vulnerability. Parents screaming, the mention of self harm, a classmate that bullied me, or someone treating me anyway similar to them twists my insides to the point I need to vomit. I keep all of it inside. If I express it at all Im invalidated by my parents and I doubt myself. My siblings and I ignore the tension and violence around us. Woke up to my parents screaming, got ready for school with my insides screaming and a poker face, packed my lunch just feet from them throwing things, ate my breakfast as my father threatened divorce and slammed the front door. My brother and I exchanged subtle looks as my mother threw the coffee pot and machine out the window. We got on the bus and sat next to each other for comfort, wordless. Then we went on with our day pretending it never happened. Me working 10x harder than I should have to camouflage, to deal with the anxiety that leaves me broken out in sweat. If I confront her the response is always the same. Stop pretending things are worse than they are. You dont have to play the victim every time.

I want to destroy the people who hurt me and I want to destroy the next person who tries. I'm losing faith in the idea of compassion. I don't think people actually care anymore. Everything has an ulterior motive or benefit. Love is a farce used to manipulate others or otherwise take advantage of them. Authority figures will always, undoubtedly, without fail, abuse their authority, even if they deny it. They will not help or protect you because that's not what authority is about. It's all about power. Parents don't love you for you, they love you because they parented you. You're an accomplishment. Friends don't love you, they love what you can do for them. Mercy and kindness is just used to make a person feel better about themself. I'm so disgusted with the human race. I'm disgusted with myself. I don't want to feel anything at all. Everything is fueled on selfishness. I'm fueled on selfishness. I hate being tender and soft when people urge me to open my shell, only to get stabbed in my insides. Trust feels like stupid weakness.

I'm using appropriate terms and time after time he's picking his jaw up off the floor as he realizes just how bad my childhood was.

My anxiety is the least of my worries. And I've worked on that. He was responsive and agreed to refer me to another therapist, but for now I'm triggered again, sitting in my basement hiding from the world. Any tips on how to better handle these interviews?

In turn, sending that judgment constantly has been a source of painful feelings for a long time. Positive self talk wasnt enough. I just wasnt able to let go of how much it hurt to know people were judging me, and judging me harshly and incorrectly at that, even when I knew their thoughts alone couldnt really hurt me. I just didnt know how to let it happen on my watch without being upset. Until today, when I realized it makes people feel good about themselves to judge others. And in the middle of a crowded train, without caring what vulnerability other people would see in my overt happiness, I smiled big. Because I feel like I unlocked it for myself: let them judge you. It makes them happy but t cant hurt you. Happy for the wrong reasons, maybe, but its not your job to police that or make them better people. It makes them feel like they know something about the world. It lets you become the target of their misdirected insecurities. Havent you survived worse? Havent you been actually abused and attacked in environments you were stuck in? Youre strong enough to spread a little love. Be yourself. If it upsets them, theyll self soothe by judging you. It makes them feel better and cant hurt you, so why worry what they are thinking? If you need to correct them, you can, but they probably dont have anything you want. Let them.

You learned from a young age what happens when someone has emotional power over you. This is how I felt for the first 90% of my life. Vulnerability wasnt an honest expression of myself to improve my bond with another person, it was a tool to be deployed at just the right moment to maximize my social power and status. In fact, the idea of connecting with someone didnt make sense to me until I was in my mid 20s. All I wanted out of my relationships was a feeling of emotional influence over other people. That, I thought, was where the pleasure of socializing lied. I dont want to be like that anymore. I want to connect with people. I want to be honest. But its hard. Not just because its scary, but because those circuits just arent there in my brain yet. For my whole life, if I said something to you, the only thing I cared about was what it made you think of me  if it gave me a little more power over you by making you like me more. I never even thought to ask if what I was saying was true to me. I wasnt necessarily lying, but I was bullshitting.

I used to cut words into my stomach whenever I was triggered/dissociating. Worthless, pathetic, fat, ugly, burden. Sometimes others, but those five came up the most. I always figured this was just my fucked up self-loathing stemming from my childhood trauma (bullying). When I was 16 I tried to kill myself and finally got treatment for my anxiety and depression as a result. Mainly, my therapy was focused on me getting over how much I hated myself. My psychologist regularly made me identify how other people perceived me, to combat my belief that I was all of those five words I mentioned above. So if I said, Im worthless he would be like but youre clearly not, because youve told me people come to you for advice, so you must have value in that way. If I said I was fat, hed point out that I was a size small-medium in my shirts, which was totally normal. If I said I was ugly, hed point out that so-and-so asked me on a date, so clearly I wasnt objectively ugly. Etc. And it worked! The longer it went on, the better I got at noticing when peoples perception of me didnt align with how I perceived myself. I realized that I had a skewed sense of how other people thought of me. I started combatting my negative thoughts about my personality and my body by pointing out all the evidence that people didnt see those things. My depression improved dramatically, and while I still get super depressed I no longer ever feel suicidal. My social anxiety disappeared entirely. And if you asked anyone who knows me today, theyd say Im one of the most confident, secure-in-myself people they know. Problem solved, right? Except, not really. I still cant allow myself to be vulnerable with anyone, ever, no matter how consistently good and supportive theyve been. I still have an untreated eating disorder which I refuse to even acknowledge with any therapist Ive ever seen, because they might try to stop me. I still dissociate entirely the second I see a photo of me taken from a bad angle, and beg the person who took it to delete it immediately. Why? Because I never stopped believing that I was inherently worthless. Because when I was cutting fat, and ugly, and pathetic, and burden into my body, it wasnt to punish myself. It was to keep me safe. It wasnt me telling myself I was those things. It was me reminding myself I could NEVER be those things, because if I was, people would hurt me. Thats why seeing insults on my stomach felt comforting. Because it reassured me that I was aware of what was dangerous for me to be, and it strengthened my resolve to not give in to any temptations that might lead to people thinking those things about me. I cant be vulnerable, because my emotions are pathetic, and my problems would burden others, and if I need support then how am I valuable to the people around me? I cant get help for my eating disorder because then I might get fat, or if I get fat I might not be able to get skinny again quickly, and then I wouldnt be attractive and therefore not valuable. I cant handle bad photos of me, because then I look ugly and someone might see, and realize Im not desirable and therefore not valuable. All of my issues with intimacy and vulnerability can be whittled down to this simple belief: I have to be valuable or people will hurt and/or abandon me. For 6 years Ive been thinking I have made great improvements regarding my self-esteem. But this entire time its never even crossed my mind that someone could care about me, even if I am not offering them something. Despite my own unconditional love for other people, I still see their feelings towards me as transactional. There is a quota of valuable traits and interactions I must meet, and if I dont they wont consider me worth their consideration at all. So yeah. This was a revelation for me. It explains a lot of things. Not sure where to go from here though. It feels unfathomable to think about trusting that someone isnt keeping score when they care about me. Anyone else realize they fooled themselves into thinking they were okay?"
193,vulnerability,CPTSD,Reconnecting with others after flashbacks?,7,cfttxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/cfttxd/reconnecting_with_others_after_flashbacks/,2019-07-21 11:56:41,"I wonder if anyone else experiences this or has thoughts about it. My emotional flashbacks are most often triggered by interpersonal situations and cues, mostly revolving around being ignored, being stuck in a group yet not feeling like a member, people not being reliable, etc. During the flashback, I forget about my friends and allies and will take a very long time to eventually seek help from and reconnect with them. I know I need to do this, usually as soon as possible. Its the fastest way to end a flashback in a few hours/days as opposed to letting it go on for days or weeks. This is the strategy my therapist and I have decided is the most effective. Even though I know Im supposed to reconnect with people, it is always immensely difficult. Not only does the shame-induced isolation compel me to withdraw, but I also get very angry at myself during these times. I get angry at myself for being weak enough to need other people in my life; I resent my desire to relate to other people. The vulnerability of being seen in such a compromised state feels disgusting and unsafe. So my initial inclination is to withdraw and assert my independence, to somehow grasp the feeling of control over myself that I need to feel safe. But its a very lonely way to live, and I know I feel better when I can connect with others. The concerning thing to me is that this withdrawal flight/freeze response is the strategy I used to protect myself during childhood. I removed myself from my family emotionally and eventually almost physically as early as 10. I thought I was smart and mature for being able to protect myself in this way. I thought it didnt hurt me. Now I can see how it affects me to this day, and I can extrapolate back to how my child self must have felt incredibly scared and lonely and angry. And yet I still almost unconsciously find myself going back to this withdrawal strategy over and over again. I have to fight it every time, and I wish I could say that it gets easier, but it hasnt. I think Ive gotten better at escaping the flashbacks, but the desire to withdraw is always as strong as its been. I just forget emotionally that its not productive, even though I know intellectually that its not useful. Its like being thrown into a pitch black room and you cant see the door, but you know the door is there. So you crawl along the floor, feeling with your hands, searching for the walls and a door handle. When you open the door, the light illuminates the dark room and everything is so obvious; duh, of course there was a door. Until the next time youre in a flashback and youre back in that dark room and maybe theres not a door this time? You cant see it. Why bother looking? And then when you cant tolerate being in the dark room any longer, you start crawling on the floor., feeling with your hands...This happens to me over and over again, every flashback. Its almost like it takes a Kierkegaard-esque leap of faith every time to get out of this black room. So this is the situation Ive been in recently. Ive started to have more concrete flashbacks in addition to emotional ones and Im stuck in this self-induced isolation that I know is only prolonging my pain. Does anyone else relate to this?"

Like just the dependency and vulnerability of being pregnant, of c-sections resulting in wound infections and sepsis, of being trapped breastfeeding and pumping 24/7 for 2 solid years, enslaved by love, anxious and terrified for their safety. Ive never cared about anything so much, its really scary. And how do you explain emotional flashbacks and profound trauma to 2 innocent perfect little tiny girls who are scared of whats happening to their mom when I get badly triggered? Im so petrified of this world tearing apart their beautiful little souls the way it did mine. And Im horrified that my own trauma is probably traumatizing them despite all my efforts at being a nurturing mother. Im trying to teach them the skills I failed to learn. Im trying to subtly equip them for the evils of the world. Im trying to shelter them from my pain. But Im so scared."

The first was a few weeks ago, I was so sick of feeling like my husband's and my meal choices had to align, that if they DIDN'T align, that meant we weren't bonded. I had a freak out over the fourth of July about all of the takeout and junk food. And then two days later, I'm cutting up chicken for dinner and just got really nauseous. I used to be a vegetarian long ago before we lived together. And since about July 6th, I've gone back to that. I feel incredible. We've been contemplating a big move recently. A few days ago, I had lots of tears and vulnerability, then went mentally and physically limp, had a lot of negative self talk about being scared. It felt like a huge setback in my healing work. And then yesterday I felt myself ""wake up"" and not be afraid, of looking forward to change, of feeling safe within it, and alive and all of that. I think part of it is listening to my inner child and saying that those emotions, fears are valid. I listen, and then we all (all parts) can take a big breath and move forward, feeling empowered. Before therapy and all of this, I never honored that inner child speaking. I didn't understand and just felt ashamed. Even saying ""meltdown"" -- I want to think of it more like a cry that needs to be heard. What's incredible to me honestly is that once is had been heard and honored, how easily and how relaxed I can fall into a new and healthier way of thinking. Like it feels effortless. The food thing, I couldn't choose my own food as a kid. I couldn't say to my mother, all of this sucks, let's actually eat healthy. And I didn't think I could say it to my husband because to survive meant erasing my needs. I'm becoming my own person, choosing for myself, how I feel, what I put in my body. I guess I hope that these ""meltdowns"" don't happen as often because I'm more aligned and listening to my inner child and so all of those strong emotions are bottled up."
196,vulnerability,CPTSD,Shame for having emotions,23,chrh8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/chrh8i/shame_for_having_emotions/,2019-07-26 04:22:50,"Been reflecting on why I have a tendency to hide my vulnerability so much and I think it's because I am ashamed of ""not being able to handle my emotions"". Which really isn't the case at all. I'm actually pretty good at it due to counselling and being introspective, but, of course, am not perfect at it. I was taught to hide my emotional needs from a young age and as I grew older and began to express myself, I'd get in trouble for expressing emotional needs. So I learned to keep them within. Looking back I can't believe how unhealthy this was and how depressed, anxious, and trapped I felt because of all this. I know a lot of things now, but I can't help but feel like if I let people know more about what's below the surface that they'll get mad at me, leave me, or think poorly of me. I think this is mostly and internal judgement of myself tho. I'd never think this of anyone else, but I can't stop feeling this way about myself. I don't want to feel weak or lesser than. I want to embrace all that is me. I don't want this shame to be carried over me, but I don't know how to let it go. What have your experiences been with overcoming shame and embracing yourself for all layers of you?"
197,vulnerability,CPTSD,Why it's not your fault even if you fell out with multiple groups of people,32,ci1nws,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ci1nws/why_its_not_your_fault_even_if_you_fell_out_with/,2019-07-26 21:26:46,"I used to think that because I had been through so many different people and ultimately ended up having to leave them, there was something wrong with me. The reality is a lot more sensible. When you're vulnerable all you want is safety and distraction. So you make yourself as nice as possible so that as many people as possible will like you. That's really all you know to do. When you're vulnerable and not aware of it, you will get sniffed out and preyed upon by those who are very skilled perpetrators. At first they will be super nice to you, then will start testing your boundaries to see what they can get away with. Given enough time they will continue to increase the abuse. The more safety you seek, the more abuse you will get. You've fallen for the trap. So going back to the title of this post, that's just to say that this can happen many times. Often you think it's *your* choice that you *chose* to get in with a group of friends. But I highly doubt that you made an informed decision. What's more likely is that you were putting yourself out there, like a sitting duck and someone came and picked you up and you were happy to go with them because you had no one else and you needed people. We all need people. What's happening from their end though is they've chosen you specifically because of your vulnerability and lack of awareness around it. And of course they ran rings around you repeatedly until you didn't know what was going on and for your own sake ended up having to leave. Unaware of this vulnerability, you moved on to the next group thinking that they might be safer. And they weren't. There's always people out there who are good at sniffing out vulnerability. After a few times of this happening you conclude that there's something bad, wrong inherent within you. Because how could this keep on happening? But if you look back at all your actions, all you did was just be nice and friendly? Maybe you showed a little anger from the building resentment, but that kind of perfection in compliance isn't even something any of us should be striving to achieve. Yet we did. What you don't realise is that they were taking advantage of your openness to their energy and they took your attention and led you down their road without you realising that you were going into a trap. Instead of helping you connect to yourself, they kept you away from yourself, at first being nice to you and then slowly turning against you because that's the kind of people they are. That was the intent all along, they just needed to take the time to slowly get you under their thumb. There is always a motivation, if you look closely it will be clear as day. A club president who could do with an extra vote, a girl who could do with someone who looks like her friend to boost her popularity, a guy who wants to get into your pants, a miser who wants you to become their personal sounding board... the list goes on. The thing is, when you look back at all the time you wasted with all these people as they took your attention away from yourself, from supporting and connecting to yourself, and instead catering to their needs - not being able to see the full picture you just think that ""wow I can't make friends."" And that's a normal conclusion to have if you've spent years of your life having your attention redirected and dragged into other people's bullshit. Basically if you've spent most of your life *being controlled* by other people without realising it. And they know that you'll blame yourself, so they'll purposely show you their anger whenever you rise up and stand up for yourself, because they know that if they just ride you a little hard, you might take on the responsibility of their stuff and might be easier to mould. They will only reward you for your submission, otherwise you are given heavy energies and silent treatments or outright insults. Yes, they are perpetrators. It's emotional abuse. Instead, see that these perpetrators are very skilled at sniffing out vulnerability and doing what they can to make you believe you're in the wrong when all you've ever tried so hard to do is just be nice. Shit like this can drive you insane and make you believe there's something bad inside you. Don't buy it. And when you do go back into the world again, this time don't let anyone arrest your attention. Your attention is entirely yours to do with what you want. There will always be perpetrators who sniff you out and want to drag your attention away from yourself and divide yourself against yourself and will treat you in all kinds of ways to get that control over you. So it's very important before you get out there that you know what you're about. That you get really clear on that. Your energy is for you, for yourself, no one else. Most people won't let you believe that because they like you a lot better when they can control you. Most people won't support you being connected to yourself. Honestly, it makes them a little jealous. Because the way they get their needs met is to manipulate others, not to use their own self-connection and ask for help when they need it. Unfortunately that is the society we live in. Most people are broken off from that self-connection in one way or another. Yes even the seemingly virtuous people - yes your instincts are right about them too. But if you ever find the ones that do support your own self-connection, and they stay consistent with it as your relationship evolves over time, that's when you know you've got someone who's worthwhile and will probably be a lifelong friend. It can be an ugly world, but you can make your own nice little nook with like-minded people in it. So be careful who you give your attention to - there are many many traps in this world. And some can take months or even years before you realise you're slowly being suffocated. It's okay that you've fallen in before, even that you've fallen in before so many times, and that you may do so a few more times, it's okay to make mistakes and learn about the world through them. But the real art of escape is reconnecting with yourself again and taking the steps to decondition yourself and see the perpetrator for who they are so that you come out all the wiser for having fallen."

Mostly, that they scare me to death. And they confuse me. And I find a lot of satisfaction and fulfillment in them, but also a lot of hard feelings. I have many long term friendships that dont have these qualities, and Im a little confused as to why. Im in my mid 20s and only in the last 5 years have I had the ability to relate with people on a closer emotional level. Ive always been able to talk to people about their emotions and many of their most vulnerable aspects, and sometimes share mine as well. But even though I was a considerate and loyal friend, I didnt really feel anything about the relationships. Even if I highly treasured them. Something happened about 5 years ago where I feel like my emotions about other people turned on. All of a sudden, I could be hurt by others, I could feel the emotional pain of missing them, the desire to interact and relate to people who I cared about. And its great, but it also kind of sucks. I know that being close with other people involves a particular vulnerability that leaves me open to being hurt. Yet, I am suspicious of these feelings I have about my close relationships. Sometimes my emotional experiences seem very disproportionate to what is actually happening, and Ive come to recognize this as indicative of an emotional flashback. Im very concerned that just feeling close to people is a trigger. That maybe theres some kind of transference happening from my unsatisfied childhood desire for closeness from my parents that Im bringing with me to every new relationship that I feel close in. Im afraid that closeness in relationships will always be a trigger, and that it will make it very difficult to have emotionally intimate relationships with people. Ive made a lot of progress on this matter over the past few years, and Im much more aware of whats happening now. Will it always be like this? It just seems like a problem that not many other people in my life seem to experience to the extent that I do, and makes me kind of pessimistic about the future. Can anyone relate, or has anyone dealt with this issue?"

I've been writing songs to help process my traumas and validate myself. I wrote a mini album/compilation over the last few months that I'm calling ""Voicemails from Hell"". The title comes from my reality of how hard it's been to change my trauma-informed belief system. I'm trying to learn/practice trust and be vulnerable so I can actually experience true, dialogical intimacy with a partner. But, metaphorically, no one's answering, and my vulnerability/effort keeps going straight to voicemail. So, the songs are these ""voicemails from hell""...lonesome, frustrated ballads from a stuck place. I really just wanted to express how much of a role writing songs has played in shrinking my inner critic. I underestimated using art as an outlet, even though I'm an art student haha. When I listen to my own songs, I feel like a real, valid human, and I/my younger self feels heard and acknowledged. It's kind of trippy but really therapeutic. I don't know if this is allowed but I'll put some links to the songs if anyone's curious. The lyrics don't contain any specific details or anything that would warrant a trigger warning.

Oddly enough what made me first realize how different I was, was seeing posts on reddit where someone would not attack someone who demonstrated vulnerability, but empathize and show care and concern! And it would be upvoted in the thousands! To this day I still do not understand comforting someone who is in distress, especially online, where you are faceless and can tell them what you really think, that they are weak and deserve what they got! I hate myself for this sometimes. I know how awful it is. The psychology is pretty obvious, right? I've felt weak my whole life but I contain it. So if you fail to contain your weakness, I am better than you. I feel so fucking alone."

I'm still grappling with the revelation that my therapist, who I greatly respect as a role model for recovery, still has a part of him that blames himself for his mother's death, and as a result still feels depressed sometimes, despite being 75 years old and having been through three courses of therapy. Last night we had another conversation on this topic, and I wound up asking: If this tendency to blame ourselves is a matter of biological egocentricity, of our brain simply having not developed the capacity to *not* blame ourselves, then do adults who lose their parents wind up free of that kind of depression? And he answered yes, of course. There really is a special vulnerability for children that we have to honor, and we do have to shield them life's hardships. That idea always used to annoy me, I think because a part of me wishes I could go back in time and shake myself awake, and tell child-me that I was experiencing trauma, that my family was a damaging wreck, and that it wasn't my fault. Instead I stayed in denial until my late 20s, which adult-me was pretty angry about when I figured it out. That anger was sometimes externalized, and I resented the idea that people wouldn't tell their children difficult truths, that they would rather keep them in ignorance for as long as possible. I thought it was sheltering and over-protective, more for the parents' sake than the children's, which reminded me of my mother, and so I resented it for that, too. I was wrong, and I'm very grateful to have figured that out before having kids of my own. Children biologically can't handle the worst parts of life without sustaining permanent damage at the very least by permanently blaming themselves, and so we have to protect them from it, at least until their teens. Happy, ignorant childhoods are the result of good parenting. That's a shitty truth for me, because it means that even with time travel I could never save myself from CPTSD, not unless I snatched myself at the moment of birth. I was only a toddler by the time permanent damage had already been done. This just struck me with such significance that I thought I'd share it with you all. Thanks for reading."

None of the conditions I've researched has ever really fit me but the symptoms have always been very intense emotions and avoidance of those emotions in various ways. I never thought of my childhood as particularly traumatic but looking at my current symptoms it seems I may have been in denial. I had a severe stutter growing up and I felt and still feel immense shame about that. I'm very uncomfortable around other people. I'm constantly worried about them disliking me or even attacking me. I know cognitively that people generally don't attack other people for no reason but I have such an intense feeling of vulnerability around other people that I find myself avoiding them, disassociating or constantly checking that they like me. I need almost constant reassurance that I'm acceptable or I feel utterly worthless. It's a horrible way to live and my life is extremely circumscribed. I am currently attending therapy and working through some of my issues but I feel stuck reliving trauma every single day unless I engage in almost constant distraction or disassociation. Whenever I meet a new person, my automatic thought is ""Is this person a threat?"". This is especially so with groups of young men. I feel like my whole personality has been constructed around avoiding trauma and I feel so empty when I stop distracting myself with games, books, movies and other interests. It feels like there is no 'me' there. I'm just an extension of the mask I've constructed over the years. I don't know how to move forward if I don't know what I want. I'm currently just trying to survive but it feels like it's an immense task to ever feel safe and secure. I want to recover but I just don't know who I am. I have no friends.

Granted it could be worse, but I am struggling in my life right now, and it is hard for me to be outspoken enough about my needs to take care of myself. I feel like the majority of the time that I am either people are dismissive of it. Or I tell them once and since I try to not be negative and have a hard time admitting that I am having trouble, they assume I am fine again when I am not.

Anyways, I was wondering what everyone here turns to for comfort? I was trying to think of what is really soothing to me on my way home today. Here are my things: - the album Somewhere Different Now - Live by the group Girlyman -sometimes I think their music is a little sappy depending on what mood I am in, but if I am sad or feel like I need any kind of comfort, they seem so pure and listening to it feels like someone is hugging me. The recent Paddington Bear movies - watching Paddington bumble about and make his way through the world, and find a loving family feels very soothing to me. I never actually really read these books as a kid, but these movies really speak to my inner child and just feel so lovely. The tv show Master of None - I watched this before everything was going with Aziz Ansari, and if I were to watch it now I dont know if I would appreciate it the same. But aside from any thoughts on him, I remember watching this and loving how close he is with his friends on here. I had a friend who was abusive to me when I was younger so I have some trust/vulnerability issues with even being friends with people at times. When I watched this, even though its not my life , I remember that there were scenes were watching him and his friends on the show be emotional supportive to each other felt very heartwarming to me and healing at the same time too. - being in conservatories, outdoor gardens etc. there is one that I visit that has a large weeping willow tree - when I feel overwhelmed, sometimes standing underneath it with the branches hanging overhead feels like I am somewhere that is physically supportive and safe, and it ends up being a good place for me to process some of my feelings"

For example, my father got sexually abused when he himself was twelve years old, he never admitted to himself that it traumatized him. Because hes a ""Big strong man"" right? Because he just got ""seduced"" he got ""lucky"". Nontheless, hes cyncic, paranoid, cruel and always was in a lot of emotional pain - his entire life. He had all the signs of cptsd himself actually, but he let that make him bitter and cruel. He kept passing it on, unable to allow emotional vulnerability. So he reinacted the sexual abuse on me, just for far longer and far earlier than it happened to him. He started sexually abusing me when I was six, and it ended when I was thirteen - but only cause I cut ties to him and permanently banned him from my life, otherwise it would have continued for whos know long. I just wish there was a way for all of it to stop. I wish the legal system was better, I wish mens experiences with sexual abuse would be taken much more seriously, I wish people wouldnt instantly go to acting like the woman somehow provocated the guy into sexually abusing her. I just wish people would grow a brain honestly, and would stop being in denial about all of it. I just wish people were capable on a broad sense, of that really, actually basic decency and empathy. If someone is already traumatized, you dont hurt them worse. You dont dismiss them. You dont make them feel guilty for having been a victim of a crime. You put the blame where it belongs : with their abusers, with their rapists. Just why is that so hard for society? I really, really hate it. It frustrates me endlessly. And it keeps me up at night. I want these things to change so badly, but I dont know how to make that change real. Like, I obviously have put a stop to my personal cycle of abuse.

It's amazing the clarity just talking and writing can bring to feelings and problems. Sometimes you just blurt out things you intuitively know but have never formulated into words in order to analyze it. I'm sure many of you can relate to the empty feeling inside from neglect and trauma. It's part of the core feeling of inner wounding. It's the place where shame, depression and hopelessness intersect to create a whole complicated mess of emotions. It mostly just annihilates anything good. But for me it really comes down to filling that emptiness with vulnerability, belonging and connectedness. That well has run dry for so long that the foundation has cracked and dried. And it seems like no matter how much it gets filled, which has been a very slow dribble, the ground just sucks it all up and the well never begins to fill. So there's that part of me that desperately needs and the emptiness hurts. But the opposite to the receiving side of this (attachment? not sure) coin is giving. And it's overflowing. I can ease the pain a little bit by constantly trying to connect with other people but it's never enough. It fills up too fast. And I'm afraid that if I let myself overflow onto someone else that it will be overwhelming for them and they won't be able to handle it. I think that's why I have so many fantasies about breaking down. Just letting the dam break and spill out all over the place. Having some big cathartic release of grief. I have to find some way to balance these two desires. It also makes sense of why so many of us are co-dependent. We find someone that just needs constant taking care of so we can dump our excess of empathy into without regard for ourselves. Emptying our reserves of giving numbs the pain of our emptiness in receiving. The biggest problem is going to be my self-worth. And I feel deeply unworthy and broken. I can only accept as much love as I think I deserve. But I'm not sure how to repair that perceived brokenness. The problem is that there's nothing to repair. I *know* I'm not broken, but I *feel* that way. Worthiness is not earned, you just are. And most people are just instilled with that feeling from childhood. There's a void in all of us when we're born about our idea of worthiness about ourselves. And we just learn to accept that we either are worthy or are not worthy. True self worth is not conditional and thus does not require a reason. The paradoxical problem is that if you feel no self-worth you're constantly trying to justify your worth. I'm not sure that this is an endeavor that one can travel alone. I'm sure it's been done but I think it necessitates deluding yourself, in a good way. Meaning you cannot rationalize your way out. You need unconditional and thus irrational, maybe arational, acceptance of yourself. I'm not completely sure but I'm assuming this is where the therapeutic relationship comes in. It's easier to believe something about yourself if someone else believes it about you first. In fact that's how we all first developed our sense of self worth. Another part of me is so exhausted from metaphorically dying of thirst my entire life. I've learned to just accept that pain and thus able to minimize it's effects on my life. To contort the well metaphor beyond it's usefulness, at least when the well has run dry, the foundation has hardened. In a way it's more resilient to trauma. You start asking me to try to fill it up, the foundation becomes malleable and soft and is very easily damaged. The transition period between having run dry and having it filled up an inch above the foundation brings simultaneous relief and terror. Relief because I get a small feeling of what it's like to feel accepted and connected again with other people. But terror because I'm so sensitive to loss and rejection. I want to be anywhere but in that emotional no man's land, even if that means feeling empty. I just hate it. I don't want to open myself up to this kind of wounding again but I know that's not a life I'd want to live, quiet desperation."

But always remember that it's something you learned from a stranger on the internet, so if it stops serving you, drop it. * * * ##Background I was telling my therapist about a feeling from my early childhood that returned to me about how it felt to be neglected. He interrupted me mid-sentence to say the word ""Empty."" I stopped. I wasn't about to say empty, but when I rolled that around in my head for a second I could feel that it had resonance. Yes, it did make me feel empty, but I hadn't realized it until that point. ""I'll have to think about that,"" I said, and went back to what I was talking about before. In the following days, I looked for and found a feeling of emptiness. It turned out to be a deep, vast, painful pit. It has been there all along, and I've been spending energy every day of my life covering it as hastily as I could. Many of my mundane ""little vices"" have been hurrying me away from it, keeping it covered or out of view. And filling it has been surprisingly exhausting effort, even in the context of something as persistently tiring as therapy work. Stuck between therapy appointments, I was pretty desperate for a quick hit of answers, and I searched this subreddit for info and found surprisingly little, so right away I thought this would make a good post once I had figured this out. I've had two therapy appointments since then and I have some time to write, so without further ado ... ##Why we feel empty The first question that came to my mind when I started thinking about ""empty"" was the word ""filled."" What am I supposed to have inside of me that's missing? The answer, my therapist told me, is unsurprisingly ""Love,"" but what we're supposed to have as a child is a specific kind of love: Maternal love (delivered by either parent). Maternal love is nurturing and supportive without conditions. The image that comes to my mind is finding a bird with a broken wing, nurturing it back to good health, and then setting it free, understanding that you will likely never see it again. It's loving someone while expecting nothing in return. It's extremely liberating to receive this love, and it is what most of us didn't get, and will never receive. You'd be right to feel cheated, angry, and/or heartbroken by that idea, but dealing with it is a whole different post on its own; what's important here is that without maternal love, young children feel empty. Side note for my fellow covert incest survivors: Some of us may have received a different, confusing kind of love, which I would characterize as romantic love without sex. Romantic love is inherently covetous, and so is very different than maternal love. It involves some nurturing, yes, and some support, but it's so that each partner can keep the other. You want to keep them so you can have sex with them, and so you can create something beautiful with them (not always a child). You *expect to get something in return.* For young children, the burden of providing something in return for love is far beyond their capabilities. It's too much pressure, and it does not allow them the freedom they need to properly grow and develop. Further, and this is direct from my therapist, the child spends a lot more energy suppressing the very Freudian Id impulse to covet their parents. Needless to say, when child-victims of covert incest reach adulthood, normal sexual relationships can be very confusing. Straightening that out is also a separate topic, but for our purposes here, understand that receiving romantic love later in life does not make up for a neglectful childhood, because it's not the same thing as maternal love. ##The ways we avoid feeling empty Most people on this subreddit are familiar with the ways we run from and avoid difficult emotions. Denying that the emotion exists or trying to drown it out with some vice is a short-term strategy that prevents you from having to acknowledge the pain, anger, shame, or fear associated with the emotion. For emptiness, what we're avoiding is a sharp emotional pain, combined with life-sapping despair, and probably some secondary fear (that it will never go away) and shame (that I feel bad when my environment is good), and hell, maybe some anger to boot (it shouldn't be this way). While someone ashamed of their anger may avoid confrontation or aggravating people, and while someone who can't take any more shame may deny they've made mistakes or have flaws, avoiding emptiness means avoiding all of the best things in life. In order to be fulfilled, you first have to recognize that you're empty, which means every time you seek love to fill yourself, you have to process a little more of the deep pain and despair of childhood neglect. I'm speaking from personal experience on this one; I expect the specifics here to be highly individualized. For me, any expression of love, whether it's for people, my job, a hobby, anything, has caused me to have an avoidant reaction. The things I reach for to get me away from the pain are a series of small vices I've carried around for a long time now, most of my life. Coffee, Reddit, and social media in particular scoot me away from the big empty pit very quickly. It causes weird behavior like checking Twitter in the middle of watching Netflix, which is one of my standard normal coping mechanisms. The sad part is that this can happen *if I like something too much.* When things get good -- books, movies, or the people around me -- I check out in a hurry, because in order to be fulfilled by these things, I have to recognize that a big part of me is empty. ##How to get rid of a big empty pit First I'll talk about me, then I'll get more general. Even through 3.5 years of therapy, it's been hard for me to see this big empty pit, and I think that's because since my early 20s I've been doing a lot of the things that adults do to fulfill themselves. I've had hobbies that I've become successful at, reached new peaks of physical fitness, had a handful of relationships (only my current one is at all healthy, but still), built a pretty decent career, moved to a new city, made friends, etc. etc. So when I ask myself about my life right now, it doesn't feel empty at all. The big challenge, then, has been splitting open the wall between my present-tense fulfillment and my past-tense childhood emptiness. When I did find that old, horrible, dark pit, it overwhelmed me. It's the first time in a couple years that a part of me has ever convinced me it was the whole; I thought for a couple days there that all of my progress was a charade, that my reality was a hollow life. My therapist was there to realign my vision: It's an a vast, empty *part,* and the main way to fill it has been to get it into contact with my present-day fulfilling activities. That is pretty painful and difficult, but is working well so far. I'm still in the midst of this work, but I expect it to continue smoothly. So, more generally: What if you don't have any fulfilling parts of your life? Or, how do you know what's fulfilling and what's not? Again, the key is **Love,** specifically love for other people. I asked my therapist bluntly how one goes about this, and he said ""Bit by bit. You love someone a little bit and see if they love you back, then a bit more, and a bit more, and so on."" So for this, a romantic partner *can* help, because you have someone to practice love with. But various hobbies and professions also present opportunities to love. My therapist insisted that doing something like playing an instrument, even if you're practicing alone, is a fulfilling action because your unconscious mind is transferring an audience onto the empty room. You may be imagining playing for a friend, a parent, or even a group of strangers without realizing it, so playing a song beautifully alone is still packed with fulfilling love. And even something as simple as posting a supportive comment on this subreddit is an act of fulfilling love. Again, the key is to allow the damaged, empty part to be the one who does the loving. This is absolutely terrifying, and requires extreme vulnerability. It will be bit by bit because anything else is just *too hard.* But bit by bit, the pit fills. The result is that the pain and despair wane to nothing, and those annoying avoidant habits whither away along with them. Some words of warning about this process: This is a truly exhausting exercise. It is by far the most tiring thing I have ever done for therapy, even though it isn't the worst/hardest thing. I've found shockingly strong emotional pain buried inside of me, and that tired me out less than this. I don't know why that is, but my therapist confirmed that this in particular is especially tiring. Also, my little addictions do not want to let go. I have never felt like more of a typical addict than when I refused to let myself go get a cup of coffee. Having coffee every day slowly gives me IBS, so it's important that I stop when those symptoms start. The part of me running from the emptiness *begged, pleaded* with me for coffee. It bargained and wheedled and wouldn't let up. Behind that begging was panic. Pure panic. Dealing with that helped me resist, but I only made it a day and a half before I had some mercy on it. There's only so far you can push something like this cold-turkey. ##Conclusion In my last post, I wrote that I could be facing the final boss. Then I wrote *Even if this is the final fight, well, if you go back to Lord of the Rings, the next chapter after Sauron is defeated is called ""The Scouring of the Shire."" So there may be more to do, maybe much more.* For some reason, this does feel like the scouring of the shire. It feels like an old, deep, vulnerable place has been dug up, and i'm dealing with the terrible pain it suffered. Of course it's impossible in therapy to know if there's more in store around the next corner, but in any case, this has been an extremely significant event in my therapy. My hope is that this is one of the last major root issue I have to deal with, and that it'll be cleanup from here, but this is wishful thinking and I've hoped that about a lot of things in the past, so we'll see. Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you found this post helpful; I got a lot of positive feedback last time and it was wonderful, and it sure would help fill the empty pit if I knew I helped someone today. :)"

I had mentioned I wanted to be a better partner. There were a couple of responses, one person in-particular used my responses to arrive at the conclusion that I don't open myself up to intimacy with friends even, and that I should be focusing on something like this as it's more healthy to do so, rather than romantic intimacy. I noted that I'm 31 years old, and I've insecurities around the fact that if I allow myself to be behind on romantic intimacy any further, I'll be further dragging my feet. This is frightening to me, because I feel like I'll be 35 or 40, and I'll still possess issues with romantic intimacy, and I'll looked down upon even more than I had been the last few years. They didn't really understand that point, instead pining for the limitations of my toolbox. They're not wrong in suggesting my toolbox is limited, but only by expressing this am I able to see how others would relate to my circumstances. I'm grateful for the response, but I can't help but feel that this is what life is going to be for me ... and endless struggle to feel human around those that are human, of which there can't be any relating, because I'll be stuck within my head conceiving of ways to avoid any abandonment and / or vulnerability whatsoever. If I am hurt, I'll hide, just as I had done before. He / she aren't wrong. I just felt very down. I left the conversation after I determined my own boundaries were being crossed, even though it was unintentional. I just feel like if I communicate with anyone, they'll look at me *differently* and see me as an emotionally stunted 30 year old that needs far more help than he realizes. I'll never be seen as a human being."

It's one of those ""how did I luck out and get such an amazing gig"" type jobs. I feel fulfilled, supported, and valued. It's wild y'all. I'm lucky enough to have amazing coworkers. They give a crap about me as a person and everyone in the office is incredibly open. One coworker and I have bonded over both having anxiety. My boss is basically my new dad. I've shared more with them (and they've reciprocated) than I ever thought possible among coworkers. I work in a medical field and they're all trained in psychology. It's a cool place. It's strange to see them model great parenting. It kind of hurts sometimes. I wish I had a family like them. Hearing the hard conversations they're willing to have with their elementary-aged children is really eye opening. So story time; we had a happy hour yesterday. My first one with the company. I'm in a relationship with a large age gap, and that garners a lot of questions. I get it. I'm used to it. However - dad boss started prying in front of two other coworkers about how we met. We met following my SA. Had it not happened, we would not have met. I've disclosed my SA with dad boss before because it was important for my line of work. I'm almost positive he put the pieces together and realized what had happened. He pushed more than I was comfortable, but I was able to eventually change the subject. It was uncomfortable for everyone; I could see it. Thank you constant hyper vigilance amiright? Today, he has been completely apologetic. I - whatever. I know he means it. Alcohol was involved and I'm good at making excuses for people. I'm not mad. I'm nauseous as hell. My head won't stop spinning. I'm queasy and shaky and I just want to forget about it, but I'm so new in this office and I'm terrified that it will cloud their opinion of me. I'm just so uncomfortable. I was already uncomfortable at work because I feel so hard like I have to prove myself. I haven't told my partner. I don't know if I will. It's upsetting that for the rest of my life, any time people ask how we met, my head goes back to that dark place. I don't want to be here right now. P.s. I'm venting to the void, but any and all thoughts/advice/whatever are totally welcome. I don't even know what there is to say but I'm hoping that by typing this all out, my brain will slow down the spinning a little."

Then I started crying and sobbing. And the pain started to fade. And I've been teary eyed ever since then, and my shoulders have loosened up and my back no longer hurts. I've just been pure emotion for a couple of hours now, I believe triggered by the emotional vulnerability with my husband. Nothing sex related, btw. Literally just talking with him.

It literally feels like I've taken molly or something. Like I'm sleep and relaxed but everything that normally would trigger me is still triggering me, only instead of storing it I'm feeling it fully exactly where it hurts (stomach, chest, etc) Literally thought I was having a heart attack or something for a bit, it was so strong and I felt so engulfed in raw FEELING. I just took a quarter of a Xanax and still feel this way. I might take more. I don't know if I should live with true feelings. It is so raw and my cognition isn't ready for this sensory overload. I've experienced this once before after taking psychedelic drugs, like the day after, and it lasted for probably a couple months before I started taking downers again and it slowly went away. I am not on any street drugs. I took a Wellbutrin this morning but that's not anything that should have changed my whole experience of reality literally hours and hours later.

Now, I'm getting complex feelings and social nuance for the first time in well over a decade and everything's different than i thought it was. It's beyond weird. My relationships are changing at what feels like lightspeed, even though it's taking weeks. My relationship with the world is changing, places are getting a feeling of identity again. It's weird how much stuff I thought was just a part of growing up actually turned out to be me shutting down. Turns out the world losing all it's magic and comfort isn't normal. I don't know. It's weird. With people i know, I mistook silence for silent acceptance. I'm noticing more and more that people seem to think I'm full of shit.

It's like I've left/leaving the sunken place but now there's my actual disaster of a life to deal with. I love so much of it. I love having feelings, I love being able to do things for the first time in over a decade. I love how much life there is in life, it's like i never noticed. I love and hate it. I hate discovering how I've let myself be treated. It's weird, it's just i was operating in a different world. I was navigating threats that it turns out don't exist. I was following rules that no one else does. A complex game of never showing emotion because that's a vulnerability, never opening up myself to a line of attack. I don't know. Still rambling. Everything's changing and it's confusing to experience. It's like I'm coming into a brand new world filled with soft corners and few sharp edges. It's weird, it's new and it's odd to feel in your mid-late 20's."

Its such a weird paradox. When someone (romantic or not) touches me , part of me enjoys it because I NEVER receive touch yet part of be cringes and screams. This results in me NEVER initiating touch. I honestly feel like when I initiate touch romantically it shows my vulnerability to someone. It shows them that I want to touch them.. and I know it sounds weird but it scares me to want physical contact so badly because part of me is thinking that they dont want it as much as I do. So I dont touch. Then that creates problems because affection is necessary. I will only be comfortable with touch if the other person initiates it AND Im very comfortable with them. Even sometimes then my body wants to reject it. But why is this? Why do I want it SOOOO bad but I dont allow my self?"

In the beginning, I was like her little pet. I was used to oversharing with her and feeding off of her toxicity. So when I grew up, I overshared with everyone. My early 20's were a MESSY time, but I didn't realize that at the time. I was comfortable diving into relationships. If I wanted to say something, I did. If I was in therapy, I told them ALL the dirty details because listening is their job. At this point, I am afraid to even open up to a THERAPIST, and I have been in therapy for 10 years. I spent last year living with N-mom for financial reasons. While there I found out she stole my identity and committed tax fraud. She and her husband were always screaming, threatening suicide, and calling the police on each other. I had been raped that summer and was told it was my fault. I slept on an air mattress in a storage room and was not allowed to hang out in other areas of the house. It was worse than any abuse I grew up with, and I ended up cutting contact with my mom when I moved because she was continuing to abuse me over the phone. So I've been gone for 6 months, and I am now a student. When I first moved I met someone I feel head over heels for. I've definitely been in love before, but I've never been afraid of a relationship and this person TERRIFIED me. I ended up getting played, and we were never really together. In January I met someone else, and it sort of seemed like it'd just be a surface level relationship. We moved slow and in the last few weeks, it has begun to feel more connected and serious. I feel scared again and absolutely trapped by my emotions. One aspect of my PTSD makes it difficult for me to speak. I developed a stutter after I was raped and I have nearly gotten through that. There are other times my mind goes blank. I am actively listening and processing someone's story, but cannot think of ANY response. Or in order to prevent stuttering, I have to form the response in my head before speaking, which makes me look slow. Having a conversation feels like a game of table tennis and is tiring. The other half of this is just that that ""blankness"" has overcome my life. It took a huge effort to get out my mom's house, and the effort it took to get back into school was not acknowledged by anyone in my family. I am self employed and always very worried about money. And from there, I don't have a lot of room to relax. I don't know how to share of myself or show who I am, beyond acting ""cute"" and squeezing conversations out of my mind. He knows a little about my family, but honestly I don't want to tell him more. I wish there was more present-day-me to show him, but I don't know where she is. I just feel so vulnerable and don't really want to be ""known"" if this is all there is to know of me. I know I am a likable person, but I am starting to feel sick of myself because so much of what I say is thought out and formulated."

Can't make a bad decision, need to understand everything, fear of hurting others, etc. I guess it's a form of anxiety. Fear of things not lasting, being responsible for things not lasting. While I've dated a moderate amount, I've only been in one long relationship and one short one. The most sure I've ever been about someone was the one time where it was unrequited. And I'm currently dating someone where we are very compatible (probably the most compatible I've ever felt with someone), and I struggle with the balance of being both vulnerable and guarded."

I need help from people who might actually get it. I'm going to my baby sister's graduation in 10 days. My anxiety has been through the roof for almost a month now because of a falling out with my other sibling. I'm the oldest of three, on the wrong end of my 20s. Backstory: I have spent my entire terrified of her. She has mental health issues as well, and unfortunately my parents didn't get either of us help. I'm in therapy now, she is not. She spent her entire life bullying me, with my mother enabling it. I grew up with lots of comments like ""Well you're the big sister, you're supposed to know better"" and ""She's really sensitive to your tone of voice, you need to work on that"" and ""Be the bigger person and turn the other cheek."" And on and on and on. Everything about me is a problem to my sister, and the solution has always been to change myself. I had a breakdown two months ago at my mother (picture screaming and tears on a busy sidewalk, 1:00 pm on a Sunday. Ooof.). She has been unaware of how deeply my identity has been destroyed. I sobbed about the abuse from my other sister. There were a lot of really upsetting realizations that came out of that conversation. My mother said ""Your sister always had a way of getting under your skin. She had so much power over you and we didn't know how to stop it."" So she knew. She effing knew. And did nothing. And even worse, she enabled it and still does. I've been working really hard with an amazing therapist to get past the abuse. I struggle to feel anger but I want to get there. I have so much compassion towards my parents and my sister. It's not compassion they deserve. Despite being told I'm a bitch my entire life, I'm actually a very compassionate, kind person. I'm learning to rewire my brain to see that. My sister is going through a lot right now, and we've had some great conversations lately about our empty, dark childhood and our mental health. A few weeks ago, she blew up at me because she couldn't understand why I worry about her. She took my vulnerability and threw it in my face. I'm exhausted of the ups and downs. I have to start taking care of myself. I often go home and shut down and relapse to really destructive coping mechanisms and I can't continue this. TBH I've already started tanking and I'm trying to stop. I need boundaries. But I will not ruin my baby sister's graduation. Middle sister ruined both of mine and I will not do that to baby. I'm terrified, because middle sister can often sense when things are off. She will show up in a great mood, and it will be MY fault for being the bitch. As usual. I'm already being told that I'm the difficult one. I'm being told I need to suck it up and wait to take a stand until later. Every comment that my mother makes causes me to question myself. Maybe I really am the problem? I really do owe it to my sister to forgive her, again? Am I imagining how bad things were because my mental health is through the toilet? I feel like a bad person- I'm going to upset people. I know ""It is ok if others get angry"" (thanks u/Squish_90!). Setting boundaries WILL make others angry. For everyone's sake, do I suck it up and pretend like everything is fine? Take the mental health hit that I always have in order to keep everyone else happy? Am I a bad person for trying to quietly have boundaries if that may detract from my sister's big day? I'm really struggling with that. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR: I am trying to set boundaries with abusive family members, only to be criticized by the rest of the family. How do I manage my sanity and keep the attention on my sister's graduation? Any advice/help welcome."

I stopped telling my family about the fucked-up things that were happening to me at school, because I gradually learned that I was going to get no support or safety at home. Occasionally I have a lapse in judgment and decide to share little bits of my past, thinking that if maybe they actually understood just how pervasive my torment was, they'd understand me a little better. And like clockwork, someone comes along and completely tramples on my attempt at vulnerability. I should know better. This is why I don't tell them shit. My in-laws are honestly more supportive."

I do improv comedy, and sitting in the back room before the show there was some jokes made at my expense. As social dynamics go, folks will pile on until they find the limit. I suppose it's human nature. Once they smell blood in the water, the teasing usually gains strength and I end up going all the way into emotional flashbacks that can last for days. But this time, I picked up on subtle social cues that I would have missed before in my life. I could sense that they weren't necessarily actively trying to harm me, but that maybe they're used to comedians having tough skin and returning this kind of banter, and that a ""wounded"" response from me could actually take them somewhat by surprise. It's obvious to all of us, I think, when someone's not holding up under social teasing. I don't doubt folks could see my vulnerability and weakness in that moment. However, I didn't descend fully into the familiar flashbacks I'm used to. I didn't feel totally alone and worthless, and then have a bad, unfocused improv show afterwards. I was mildly triggered, yes. And it did affect my performance. But I held on to my inner experience as best I could, instead of automatically absorbing the emotions or facial expressions of others, or using only external cues for my own self worth rating. I had a decent show despite all this. Got some good laughs and came up with witty ideas. And my team mates and I had some great rapport. I'm sure I was analyzing things at light speed compared to others who are probably used to just relaxing into this fun hobby together. A new thing happened on the drive home, too, and it was really beautiful. Something that's happened more lately and I hope to it happens a lot more ... I felt really proud of myself for noticing new social nuances. And for fighting to stick to my internal experience and not completely abandon myself. I shed some grateful tears of self love, and let myself know I could be proud of me. And I did feel proud. Really proud. And I felt it deep down for some time. Because I'm the only one on earth who knows the full story of me, and who would fully, deeply appreciate how much I've gone through to finally chip away at CPTSD like this. So I can be the proudest of these small things more than anyone else in the world, and that's ok. And I can tell you folks, and I believe you'll understand. Thanks for existing, r/cptsd. I love you folks."

229,vulnerability,CPTSD,Help understanding trauma defense mechanisms with pushing away love interests (with mutual attraction),3,bk3yae,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/bk3yae/help_understanding_trauma_defense_mechanisms_with/,2019-05-03 13:34:40,"In a nutshell, my father physically and emotionally abused me growing up. Abuse was specific to expressing my opinions or contradicting him. My mom did nothing and when I was a teen she revealed that she felt I deserved this treatment. My siblings dealt with significantly less of these issues. The world in my childhood home revolved around my dad and I had to learn to anticipate his abusive triggers and counterintuitive thinking, and was also emotionally on my own. I always hated and did not trust my father, those feelings came later for my mother. I haven't spoken to either in over 10 years, it's the best arrangement. I spent the last 4 years in therapy making great progress. I got over my fear of expressing myself (I'd get panic attacks), started being vulnerable/open with people (appropriately with strangers, friends, that sort of thing), starting experiencing emotions/feelings other than extremes like anger or sadness, started taking care of myself and caring more for and about others, set boundaries with people that empower me, and overcame of a lot of other childhood baggage that came from having absent parents and parents I couldn't trust. Anyway, all these changes have led me to crave, or realize that I crave, intimate romantic relationships, and I feel like I'm at a place where I can do that. In the last few years, I've met women where there's mutual attraction and the women are sending signals loud and clear (I'm a lesbian so there's usually a hurdle with ""is she into women?"" and then the hurdle of women being super passive in expressing interest, so a clear signal is an accomplishment) and I consistently push these women away. I will be in the presence of someone where there's mutual attraction, and in the moment it feels right, i.e. comforting being wanted and nice being attracted to them, but out of no where some unspecified trigger interrupts these feelings scares me into avoiding them, which in turn pushes them away. I get distant, avoid their sexual or loving gaze, get cold, ignore them. I will try correcting the behavior afterwards, then it reads as mixed signals, which further pushes them away. Usually, I just abandon the relationship after enough self-sabotage and rationalize the loss with an excuse. For the last 10+ years I have been engaging in distancing behavior. Up until recently, I've unknowingly made excuses for my conduct. I'd blame circumstances related to the other person or my life for me creating distance or being rude, rather than recognize that these behaviors are a defense mechanism stemming from trauma. Someone I've been attracted to for the last six months has been escalating things and I'm excited about it, but I'm struggling to reciprocate. I caught myself falling into the same pattern of pushing away, but this time I got frustrated with the feeling of fear getting in the way of me asking her out and started to think through my reactions, which lead me here. I feel like I don't know how swim. My experience of this fear is hard to pin down, but it's like an acute fear of vulnerability and extreme discomfort with being wanted so much by someone. I am trying to work backwards to process these feelings, but need help finding my way. I've found a few pieces on what is going on [section 1 on this site](URL and [section 1 on this site](URL but neither really explain how to work through this. I am going to follow up in therapy about this, but I usually like to have something to read to help on the side. Any advice, stories of personal experience, or resources others have used would be extremely helpful."
230,vulnerability,CPTSD,"The more comfortable I am, the more I dissociate: understand why I do so.",5,bkcel9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/bkcel9/the_more_comfortable_i_am_the_more_i_dissociate/,2019-05-04 05:25:46,"Wonder if others can relate to this. To explain, if i get into class and have a hold on the material i freeze- lose my ability to speak and have a panicky, frantic look on my face. If i understand something, i feel like no matter how i will put it others will find a way of it to be offended or find fault with it. I know this comes from my outer critic enforcing what has happened the innumerable times i tried to converse with my parents; their view being ""missing the point"" or ""talking back"". My outer critic projects that onto other because of its past prevalence and proliferation of frustration, pain, anguish that was never addressed. The pain of the past leeches into the future. The emotions may be addressed and released by accepting why i was frustrated. As an example it could be that i couldn't communicate to my parents in a way that they didn't see as a attack on their superiority or seen as trying to ""one-up"" or otherwise showcase disrespect. Accepting the lack of control, the lack of knowledge, and/or the lack or power. Since i was the child and they were the parents, at least in our household, their word was law so any other discussion or deliberation was considered blatant disrespect regardless if it was previously addressed. As a result of these things, no standards were enforced or dependent on the parents limited memory, i.e. ""I cannot remember everything!"". With responses ranging from: ""this is the first i heard of it!"", ""that has nothing to do with me!."", and my favorite ""go complain somewhere else"". Unless it was an appointment, then nothing was written down. The lack of understanding appropriative discourse led me to fall back on previous limited standards of communication. What i knew at the time was communication is scary, but expected by the party who is the accused to get better, and if they don't get better then there is something wrong with the accused. The lack of self reflection haunted me. The lack of understanding communication is a two way street. The fragility of my parents self-esteem and their fear of self-advocacy. The view that seemed to hold that my parents needed to be right and they needed to be seen as ""having all the answers"". This is some of the innumerable problems that caused controversy and friction in my household if not my entire family. The answer will never come from their fear of showing vulnerability or looking weak. This is what caused the disconnect and dissonance my family structure why we ended up enmeshed and authoritarian. Emotions were one sided, only one side had all the power so the kids weren't heard; even the father exploited the kids to feel better using his power over them abusing adages, such as parents know best, sticks and stones may break my bones but words will need hurt me. Then to make matter worse, my dad started to lead me to believe that this understanding was wrong. That i must be the problem. That if i cannot change what is going on, i am not changing enough or trying hard enough. It wasn't their absurd and one sided standards or their obvious lack of ethics. Like letting my sister stay home since she didn't complete her homework because she wouldn't get into the car. Then my dad saying, ""but she has better grades"" as an excuse why she should is able to. When she threw a hissy fit before hand. This was high school to out in perspective. Maybe my dad's abuse of using electronics as a reason i was not succeeding in school or as a tool for proving my disrespect, if i took my phone back without his knowledge and would say that i am acting must better because of not having it. When he would find out he would claim instead he didn't say that and instead would say that ""no wonder i was acting so disrespectful"" or something similar to that. Not accepting that technology has no bare on my ability to do homework. This dismisses his actions of yelling at me, demeaning me and criticizing me for every percieved slight even to the point of throwing fits in my face (sports, work, personal) by utilizing electronics as the means i am not succeeding in life. These bereavement was not even close to the percieved slight. It could be something as simple as forgetting a homework assignment would lead to my dad lashing out. If this wasn't already bad if i happened to tell him i failed a test while his team won in sports he would tell me that it was okay that things like that happen time to tine and i now understand why i did wrong so i can improve next time. This paralyzed me and confused me for the longest time until it hit me on the head- my dad's yelling at me has nothing to do with me. It bad to do with my dad cannot deal with his own frustration. This is why he projects it outward because of his lack of coping mechanisms or previous trauma. Instead of communicating some vulnerability he uses abuse tactics i believe he learned from his own parents from understanding they are only valid if he is in power of the situation or at least seen as. That is why I have mountains of resentment. I have released a lot of self doubt because of this and starting to speak my mind slightly better in public and class. I hope this might be helpful for others. If anyone has a better explanation of this, i would be appreciative."
231,vulnerability,CPTSD,My journey so far....,10,bm5cwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/bm5cwu/my_journey_so_far/,2019-05-08 23:35:54,"TL;DR- cptsd ruins my life- Go to therapy if you can ASAP. I used to be a very functional member of society. I had to drop out of school at 16 so I could work to eat, moved out on my own at 17 and while working full time I took my high school classes via correspondence and graduated with my class in 2006 as if I never dropped out . I was SO PROUD of myself. It was a shining example of the person I wanted to be. Strong, fierce, brave - smart af. I thought I had grown into EXACTLY the person I wanted to be and I felt invincible. Then I got sucked into a toxic relationship and my whirlwind crashed. Suddenly I was living like I was at my parents again, Walking on eggshells. I was such a terribly toxic person at the time and didn't realize so most of the start of the relationship downfall was me. He didnt love me enough, he didnt want me enough, he didnt make me happier and everyone in love in my books were DELERIOUSLY happy so clearly HE was doing something wrong. It wasnt me, it COULDNT be me. I was awesome! I was smart ! I was younger and just turned 18 and lost some weight so I was feeling hot and wasnt he JUST SO LUCKY? Why didnt he ACT like he was lucky? How could he think of anything but me? I had no concept on a real good relationship. How could I? My parents hated each other and my books were clearly fake. I was so afraid of being hurt I didnt open up at all. There was no trust. No vulnerability. Plenty of sex, but no intimacy. Jealousy was rampant on both sides. I didnt give in an inch. I was arrogant and narcissistic and so selfish. I tried in my own way to be what kind of girlfriend I thought was best. I cooked, I cleaned , I made lunches. I did all the physical stuff I read Moms do. I ""showed my love"" in acts of service, running myself ragged to have a spotless home. Unfortunately, my bf at the time appreciated none of this which fed back into my cycle of ""I'm the best gf ever, I do all this stuff for us - you dont deserve me"" mentality. Now it wasnt all me. He is narcissistic too, and hurt really bad by exes and 7 years older than me so he thought he was wiser/smarter -so he brought his own baggage to the table- but this is about my mistakes so we dont need his detail there. Then I got pregnant and shit hit the fan. Our fights were worse, I wanted a baby like I wanted a furby at 12 and he seemed not to care about us at all. I went on mat leave. He got fired and refused to find new work. He would only watch the baby if i was drinking, so i started drinking pretty regularly. Our fights get worse, we say horrible things to each other. I left him when the baby was 9 months old. I'm 21. Left my fiance with a small baby in tow. Shared custody. It hurt to leave SO BAD , but I was putting baby first . Baby deserves better. I'm going to make DAMN sure my baby grows up better - so I move into my own apt, get a FT job. Sometimes I'm watching my baby AND working a call center job from home (which was so hard) but I'm doing it. I'm strong. I'm fierce . I'm independent AF and need no man. I'm drinking ALOT when baby is with Dad and drinking a bit still when i have baby. Not alot, but its sliding into daily. I had learned nothing. I blamed my ex completely. Nothing was my fault. He was mean and didnt love me and I WAS SO PERFECT TO HIM , he just didnt appreciate it etc etc Years go by, I slide further into denial and alcoholism. Suicide is an ever present thought but I could never do that to baby. Few boyfriends, nothing really permanent. I'm miserable but very good at pretending happy. My nightmares pick up, sleep paralysis. Everything just builds and builds until the thought of death is my only comfort. I plan on waiting until baby is 18 and make it look like an accident while on vacation. My life is empty except for baby two weeks a month. I'm drunk every night. I'm a total slut when baby is gone- just trying to feel SOMETHING. I got myself into situations I'm not proud of , shameful , embarrassing moments that other people witnessed. I didn't realize it, but I think I had given up. I thought if I could just do (x) , I'd be happy but I never got there no matter how many times I chased X . Baby made me happy for a little while but ultimately it wore off. Drink was my happiness and that was so short lived. Met a wonderful man but by now I'm DEEP into drink and suicidal thoughts. I manage to snare his interest with my fake persona of having my shit together and we start dating. I can hold it for a while , but bit by bit I expose my real depressed self - expecting him to run. He doesn't. I tell him true stories of my past. He doesn't run. I break things in a rage. He doesnt run. I tell him my dirty little secrets that make everyone a little horrified and he doesnt run. I expose that I'm NOT actually that happy, vivacious chubby cutie he fell for. I'm full of darker stuff. Still no running This is where it gets good right??? Happy ever after??? WRONG. IT GETS WORSE. I now have someone there for me, someone supportive I can turn to. I've never had that before. Its.... nice. I start to share thoughts of inadequacy, things I'm afraid of. Instead of holding it against me he shows me love and understanding. This happens several times over a year or so and somewhere along the line my brain said ""Oh look you have support now , guess it's time for ALL THAT TRAUMA TO COME UP "" and I unravelled completely. My alcoholism is insane levels. I find it hard to get drunk anymore my tolerance is so high. I cant function with these nightmares and flashbacks and intrusive thoughts. Im throwing up every day from drink and stress. There's blood in it. I'm sneaking shots before anyone is awake so I can tolerate going into work .I buy a house with credit with SO. Now I'm in debt . I think baby will be cared for by the ex , I can kill myself in 2 years and end this miserable life and give this wonderful man a beautiful house in the deal (insurance on all our products). I'm ready. I'm planning to die in less than 2 years. Amongst all this support I find myself wanting to leave good memories for my SO. Who has seen the *literal* worst of me and still been there, loving and amazing. So I try to quit drinking for him. Hardest thing I've done recently but EVENTUALLY it stuck. I'm now even MORE miserable because i dont have my temporary happiness through booze. I can barely get out of bed, I'm numb. I feel like I'm already dead and walking. My work suffers, I switch jobs. Still missing too much work - luckily get an amazing job offer with mental health coverage somehow- but start to miss too much work. Not making those good memories I wanted for him. Start therapy. I hate it. My unravelled bits, then start to disintegrate. I feel literally insane. I cant work, I cant go outside all the time, I'm a mess. (Yet somehow I still feel like I'm faking). My trauma is so overwhelming, so pervasive it's like it takes over everything . Which it does. In the 10 months since I've started therapy I have had alot of bad days, some of them awful. But since starting therapy I have also had genuine good days which I never had before. I'm learning to love myself and be kind to myself. I've had days where I ACTUALLY relaxed a bit. My sleep is better. Not drinking is easier. I'm making those memories with my family. We got a dog. I'm engaged and planning a wedding for 2020 instead of my suicide. I still feel awful MOST of the time. I still suffer through alot of the above shit but my life is already SO MUCH BETTER. I have hope now. I have joy now. It's hardly ever but it makes it worth it. My therapist says eventually I'll feel good like that MOST of the time. That seems unreal to me but its something to strive for. That's where I am now.

232,vulnerability,CPTSD,Can I really trust anyone with healthy boundaries?,16,b24u7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/b24u7u/can_i_really_trust_anyone_with_healthy_boundaries/,2019-03-17 23:49:43,"Ive been wondering lately- am I right to not trust people with healthy boundaries? In my experience people with healthy boundaries just dont really care about me. Lucky them- they just look out for number 1. Sure when discussing my life theyll have an outsiders perspective which of course theyll be happy to share. But I dont think they can see beyond their own biases/opinions to truly try and understand what Ive experienced/how I feel? Not trying to bag the normal people- but I feel like part of my challenge is that I continue to review my beliefs and recognize my biases. I dont feel like non-trauma people would ever think to look at things the same way I had to is all.. Normal people seem to just gladly avoid vulnerability, maintain a level of self-righteousness and participate in a culture that I think helps perpetuate cycles of emotional neglect. I know this sounds like/is self preservation but I wonder if others have a view on it. Thanks for reading. Hope I dont sound too self-righteous myself."
233,vulnerability,CPTSD,I dissociated in therapy today,13,b3jyj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/b3jyj4/i_dissociated_in_therapy_today/,2019-03-21 11:43:21,"I began to fall into a type of episode I've had before - the kind where I lose any awareness of anything I'm not directly looking at and begin losing the sensation of being connected to my body. If I let it go I'll black out. I started losing time (couldn't tell how long it was between words). I was getting visual auras like a migraine and could barely track what I was saying from one word to the next. Honestly it's like being waaaaay too stoned but also like death panic at the same time. I let myself just kinda float a bit outside of my body and joked about ""This is why I don't do psychedelics"" as we continued talking. I've been seeing my therapist since last summer (but in therapy since I was 9 on &amp; off) and I trust this person enough to sometimes have feelings, but usually I don't because it's inconvenient to cry every time and go over our appointment time because she wants to make sure I'm ok so I try to just name that I'm having a feeling instead of letting myself feel it. Falling completely apart is really inconvenient. She was asking about my parents in a way I haven't talked about them before and I think I started to realize how my words must sound to someone who isn't me, and it was like there was this wall of cotton around my brain and probably some really big feelings on the other side of it but I couldn't even tell her what it was. It wasn't sadness or anger, it was just something I really couldn't handle. I expected therapy to involve a lot of homework and techniques but instead I'm paying her every week just to practice acting like a person together because I don't ever have any conversations wiith anyone where I'm not super guarded. I don't have friendships or relationships anymore so I don't experience vulnerability, and in most of my friendships in the past I'm the one doing the listening. I want this to feel productive and useful but the constant reinforcement that I'm too damaged to be around people is just....I don't know what to do with this."
234,vulnerability,CPTSD,I've created a therapy approach for Complex Trauma. Would love feedback from you all.,1,b3rrok,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/b3rrok/ive_created_a_therapy_approach_for_complex_trauma/,2019-03-22 02:20:11,"Here is the text of the approach. Please, any feedback would be welcome from those of us who struggle with this: **Complex Trauma Therapy Theory: A Take on Maslow** **Abstract:** The basic premise of this theory is that the only way to solve trauma is to undo it, and a practitioner must see the client as a blind pedestrian or a drunk friend at the bar. The client must be helped across the street, given direction for safe travel in their tumultuous world, and like the drunk friend, sometimes a practitioner must intervene and take away the keys for a while because a client living with complex trauma is, in a sense, emotionally drunk, and he or she is not in a place to make prudent decisions. Its imperative to remember that a client must only be challenged to do what they can reasonably do. But upon establishing some positive behavior, further behavior and learning can take place. But its key to first understand the skill level/emotional ability, shame, flashbacks, daily experience, isolation, etc. of the client before prescriptions are made. Essentially, the notion here is to build a person that struggles like one would build a house with bricks. Some houses are partially torn down. Some houses have been torn down to the foundation. Without understanding the unique place of the client, its impossible to constructively move forward. **Diagnosis:** The key with diagnosis is measurability. The patient needs to be questioned on basics that are simple, metaphorical, and measurable as to their state. For example, how can one determine a clients ability to take care of themselves? What are the key tells? In terms of fulfilling basic needs (or having basic needs met), where is the client? Where is the client in terms of shame, the wet blanket and/or cement shoes of emotion. This is the step where the practitioner must determine what the client can do and what they cannot do. Its also important to try to understand why these skills have gone or remain so the practitioner can directly address those issues moving forward. Without these basic elements, or an understanding of them, it would be facile to suggest the client take up some behavior. Example: if a client physically struggles to get out of bed all day, feeling a deep emotional weight, it would be futile and discouraging to the client to flippantly suggest going for a run. Indeed, it is up to the practitioner to determine diagnostic measurables because without them, there is no map. And its important that the practitioner be the adult in the room per se in terms of creating that map with the client. As therapy moves forward, these diagnostics must be regularly checked, and its important that the client feels safe enough with the practitioner to speak honestly on these points. Trust, like respect, is earned and cannot be assumed. **Needs:** Once the practitioner has reasonably determined the state of the client, its important to go back to needs. There are needs that transcend the individual, such as a positive social structure, safety, etc., and there are those that are unique to that client. Without basic needs being met either by the individual and/or the community, there is no chance for growth. Recognizing, validating, and intervening to help the client get back to basics is the cornerstone of wellness. How can a client pursue wants if they dont even recognize their right to have needs. Once the client and the practitioner agree on a basic set of needs, it is up to the practitioner and the client to determine a plan to enact skills to reclaim those needs. For example, a basic need for every person is a feeling of security. How could one help create that feeling with a reasonable amount of effort. One plan might be to do one specific thing to make their space feel more home. The more precise the plan, the better. Once the needs are recognized and skills to accomplish them are planned, the practitioner can move onto the next step. **Wants:** For every person to find fulfillment in life, they require a purpose, even if that purpose might seem insignificant. Unfortunately, many people do not know or have lost the capacity to think about what they want, or they feel as if they are not allowed to want or are hopeless to achieve their wants. This is a difficult process because it requires a modicum of hope, which meeting needs will ideally supply. This step will require engagement and direction from the practitioner, as, depending on the state of the client, their wants may feel distant and invisible to them. Suggestion from the practitioner, list-making, and ranking of wants is necessary, and, again, validation and intervention are required to move those wants from off the page into behavior. Again, the more specific a practitioner and client can make pursue these ideas, the better. Just like with needs, its important to select an attainable want, to plan and discuss skills, habits, and behaviors that will allow the client to make that step. Once this is achieved, its important for the practitioner to encourage the next step. Soon, what felt hopeless will at least provide a spark of belief in the client. **Socialization:** Humans are social animals, and being left in isolation, or as Jon Cacioppo termed, perceived loneliness, is a very dangerous position for any such animal. As Cacioppo points out, perceived loneliness increases the chances of early death by 20%. There are a number of health issues that correlate strongly with isolation including addiction, constant stress or predator evasion, and so forth. Finding a way to remove the client from this state is paramount, as this is perhaps the most fundamental human need. Yet, this is perhaps the most difficult step in the process for both practitioner and client. The task is simple, yet the variables working against it are multiple. Due to long-term trauma, the client is most likely in a state of fear, struggles to trust, and ostracization for his or her condition is extremely common. To that end, though socializing is an absolute need like hunger, it is not as if one can pull a loved one from the refrigerator as necessary. And of course, the weakness of this individual has made them more attractive to predators of any ilk. This is evident in rape cases for example. Those that have been assaulted are more likely to be assaulted. According to the NSVRC, More than one-third of women who report being raped before age 18 also experience rape as an adult. Social skills and the confidence that perhaps once went with them are most likely gone in the client, depending on his or her situation. If they do have basic support like a family member to emotionally process with freely, then that is a great boon for the client, but just as the rich get richer, it is very difficult for the person who does not have the luxury of closeness to any person. Of course, people are around people constantly, but that isnt the sort of socialization that is helpful. The client must have people in their life with whom they feel accepted, understood, seen, validated, and safe with. Its key that the practitioner and the client define specifically what needed connection looks like. Unfortunately, given the tenor or, perhaps, reality of emotional vulnerability for men, this issue seems to particularly affect them. So, what is the practitioner to do? Well, the first step for healing this lack in the client is intense and deep curiosity. Again, directly undoing the trauma. This is bewildering to the lepers of our communities, and will most likely be unnerving, but with openness, real curiosity, and validation or encouragement, it begins to increase doubt in the client about their unacceptability. Beyond this, one must come back to the basic principle of what one praises or encourages or rewards will lead to repeated behavior. Assuming the practitioner has basic social skills, its necessary for them to see the client as if they were a mirror. The clients self-perception is like looking into a fun house mirror: distorted, warped, and broken. So, the practitioner must be the clients eyes, and with that, must be able and prepared to create a plan based on what they know works. Aphorisms like Spend more time with your friends, or Join a group! or Have you tried X app? are frustrating and insulting to the client. One must be able to speak to their particular situation and help create a plan to break from it. Its likely that the client hasnt just lost touch with people but also with knowledge of the social opportunities that surround them. So, again, a precise plan of action formulated between the blind knower and the seer is the answer to this. Even one real connection can make all of the difference in the world to a client who has been starved of it for years. Essentially, the practitioner must take the struggle as real and profoundly difficult  if it seems like Oh, its easy! from the practitioner, the client will, and maybe must, shut down to protect themselves. **Good &amp; Bad Habits/Addictions:** Many therapists who deal with trauma victims refer to addictions as comorbid conditions, but that is just not so. This implies there is an even pull and push to the conditions, ostensibly preventing growth. But this belies the truth. Addiction is not a condition as much as it is a symptom, though it certainly can turn into a condition  but that is more physical than psychological. As has already been pointed out about social animals, there is a strong correlation between perceived loneliness (or isolation) and addiction. This can plainly be seen in studies like Rat Park and the Heroine Studies following Vietnam, both of them showing that social animals have an innate need to bond, and if they cannot bond with others, they will bond with chemicals, behaviors, etc. This is the appropriate time to deal with addiction and habits because it is at this point that the client has enough positive momentum and tools in their toolbag to replace the addiction or bad habit. To confront addiction before addressing the former points would be futile, not because the client cant actually do it, but that they cannot sustain it. And that failure, that inability to not give in to their urges, their bond, will likely do nothing more than strengthen the bond between client and habit. But assuming the client has begun to have needs met, has some basic elements going their way whether from an external or internal source, then the mechanism for appropriate motivation is activated. If it doesnt matter whether the client lives or dies in their own eyes (not suicidality but despair), then what possible motivation would they have to drop a comfort to them, even if it would kill them eventually? The only thing would be outside expectations, but that cannot keep a person motivated for long. No, it is only when the client believes that it does in fact matter if they live or die, if they wake up in the morning, if they exist relative to a community that there is the motivation to find a healthy bonding mechanism, healthier habits. It would not be a stretch for one to assume that if the client comes this far, they may already begin to dwindle or even remove an addiction or a bad habit from their life just by dint of forward momentum and the grounded skills to maintain it. **Transferring Wants to Purpose:** If wants are the grease to the individuals wheels, purpose is the motor. Assuming the client has learned skills about their own wants and has been developing them, it is imperative that the practitioner help guide the client to a purpose. It is a defining trait of an individual, and only through a clear singular focus can the client accelerate in their growth because the path forward becomes clear. But one of the key words in this step is maintain. If the client cannot find a way and the skills to maintain their purpose, they will flounder, and the downward spiral may strike again. If a client is in this place of need, it is unlikely that purpose has been paramount and consistent, which is reasonable. Still, the approach to the goal, the purpose, whether is it small or galactic, must be approached in a way that is different for the client than what they have experienced. Again, the guiding hand of the practitioner as a coach, as a pair of eyes, providing the gasoline of encouragement, must direct the client, and at this point in the process, the client must be willing to go in fully with the practitioner. If a client can learn to pursue a purpose consistently, even if just for five minutes a day, and track it, measure it, watch the goal become closer, it will help define the client as an individual and help to clarify that image in the mirror and the proper boundaries and self-respect they were never taught. **Defining Individually and Practicing the Fundamental Tenets of Happiness:** Finally, the client must understand happiness, and it is up to the client and practitioner to find ways to practice the five fundamental tenets of happiness. * A positive social support network: oxytocin, safety, emotional processing, acceptance, etc. * Gratitude: looking on the past with charitable eyes, the antidote to bitterness * Purpose: looking toward the future with hope, meaning, and a defined role for the individual * Joy: regular expected feelings of pleasure like bowling with a friend or eating a snickers bar. Essentially, I enjoyed that. * Bliss: the measure of emotional openness to the world, bliss is unexpected pleasure, a feeling of being overwhelmed unexpectedly with emotion. Example, the first time a person and their crush accidentally touched knees as an adolescent. The client should continue on with the practitioner until such a pattern of existence as laid out above has maintained, and reasonably will continue to be maintained going forward, barring catastrophic events. At some point, the parent must let go of the bike."
235,vulnerability,CPTSD,Using creative writing as a healing tool: How I decided I wasn't returning to my therapist before I'd even sat down,24,b4jwqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/b4jwqj/using_creative_writing_as_a_healing_tool_how_i/,2019-03-24 01:44:42,"I often find it hard to explain my reasoning to others, for example, when I visited a new therapist recently I decided I did not want to return. When contemplating why, all I could really come up with is 'it felt wrong'. &amp;#x200B; In an effort to understand my own thought processes and get better at explaining them to other people I decided to write my experience as if I was a character in a book. I tried to remember all the little things I noticed whilst there and what kind of response I had to them. Many more things came back to me as I started writing which has already made me think this is a good exercise. &amp;#x200B; So, here is my effort, read it if you wish: (this is the first piece of creative writing I've done since school, it's not gotta be very good sorry) \--- ""*bell not working, please knock!*"" commanded the small neon post-it. The door was open. Was this some kind of test? Tentatively stepping over the threshold I wondered if it was a very bad decision to bring myself into an internet stranger's hallway. Worn hardwood floor, covered in flecked paint and brick dust led me to two bare white doors. Bags of sand leaned lazily against the wall opposite, discarded rolls of frayed carpet, curling in on themselves, smiled at me from the corner. I knocked on the second door. ""Oh, you're early"". Words forever dipped in irritation. ""I'm so sorry - I can come back--"" ""No, no. Please, come in - it's just through here"" he said, gesturing towards the end of the entrance hall to a room glowing with soft, yellow light. Warm air thick with the familiar whiff of incense drew me towards his lair - it was the same scent we used at home. For some reason this bothered me. As we entered, the realisation that I had been here before, suddenly hit me. Not actually *here*, my version was a couple of streets down, they must have used the same blueprints. This was a house that framed my early childhood. Just for a moment, I was transported back to my best friends dining room. We were sat eagerly watching her mother create beautifully intricate figurines with icing, begging to join in. The familiarity should have eased the anxiety rising through my limbs. I should feel safe in my sanctuary, but nothing was right there. It felt like an invasion. I again wondered if I had made a bad decision. This room was cluttered and busy, built for functionality rather than aesthetic. Books were overflowing the shelves, stacked haphazardly on the dark brown floor and around the stone fireplace. Two scuffed leather armchairs sat facing each other in front of a large dining table, temporarily pushed to the side. Room in therapist mode. Then, my eyes fixated on the box of tissues sat on the, otherwise empty, aged dining room table. The tissues had been put there to comfort. To openly show tears were nothing but an expectation. The pre-pulled white sheet was an encouragement of vulnerability. It was cheering from the sidelines, eagerly anticipating the moment it would be brought into play. The tissues cannot win. I took my seat. The tissues sat tauntingly on the shabby dining room table. ""So, what brings you in today?"" \--- I've since understood that firstly, I didn't like that he was using my favourite incense sticks. A minuscule thing, but I burn those with my partner when we're having cosy nights in. It took me a while before I could use them again afterwards as every time I smelt them, I was back in the therapist's room. &amp;#x200B; Secondly, the fact that the layout of the house was the same to the one in which many of my best memories were formed made be feel unsettled. I didn't like the idea that this new house would then be linked to those memories. I wanted to keep them safe. &amp;#x200B; Thirdly, I didn't like the presumption that I would cry. I am a stubborn person and find it hard to comply with things I think are just expected from me. I will refuse to do them out of principle. I know this one is a bit silly, I'm working on it. &amp;#x200B; Fourthly, I did not like how confused I was when I arrived - I really felt like it was some kind of anxiety test (Also a bit irrational) &amp;#x200B; Fifthly, I wasn't even that early, ten minutes at most - I had actually been pacing up and down the street waiting for an acceptable time to go in for ages. This also immediately made me feel like I had 'failed' some kind of test. &amp;#x200B; It's really nice to find semi-rational explanations for decisions you think have been made irrationally. Now I know exactly why I didn't want to go back to that particular therapist - might try with a more hardcore memory next. &amp;#x200B; Sorry for the very long post - just thought I would share as this has been quite a nice exercise to do on a lazy Saturday morning. I recommend trying it - I think writing as if you were a character helps to give a more objective view. You're also forced to find words that precisely describe how you were feeling which can be illuminating and might help identify the patterns of emotional flashbacks - I often don't know how I would describe the feelings until I see the perfect word. &amp;#x200B; **tldr;** Writing out your memories as if you were a character in a book can help to dig up more details and find reasons for certain behaviors.

He was up here, he loves me, but he's back where he's going to grad school now today. I didn't see a lot of him, but I did see him. I don't think there's anything wrong with me for missing him, I miss my daughter, too, but we had more time together. Sometimes it's her I feel the ache for. Sometimes praying for them really does help, like you're doing something physical across the airwaves that fills a hole, meets their needs, and it physically helps me feel better, like God is doing his job I've allocated him to do. Like his orders from me :) I'm giving him my children, temporarily. Each day. He has to tuck them in at night, so to speak, say prayers with them, comfort them from a bad dream, or a hard day. Or send someone else who can. I also have CPTSD. I was abused by their father, I was verbally abused by my father, I've been a victim of crime. My mom died a few years ago. I do have a few friends, but sometimes it's really not enough. I need a further purpose. My son and daughter were my purpose in life, I was their protector, as much as I could be. So yeah, I still want a closeness to them, yet want them to be strong on their own, and find intimate supportive relationships with the people in their lives. For whatever reason, after my son left for school again, today, I felt so lost, I didn't see him enough, I felt so alone. But missing him as a son, also reminds me of my vulnerability. I don't know who I am without them. I know I need to find more relationships of my own, but I'm not good at it. I know men who've wanted to date me, and I haven't. I would like to, if I could trust someone. I don't know how to appraise them :) I felt so almost paralyzed today, like my grief kept me from going anywhere, it's like a great fear of being out there alone. I just couldn't go, I needed to feel my pain for a little while. I miss him and my family or friends. I know, mothers are supposed to let go, but really, you never really let go, they are your babies, in such a special way, you never stop loving them, you just kind of pass on your job to others in their lives. But you have a special place in your heart for them forever, you give your life for them. In heaven I think we'll all be the same age, but it will be childlike, and deeply intelligent all at the same time. We won't be constantly separating. That isn't normal. Relationships are meant to be cherished, continued, changed, but for the better. I still miss my mom, but I'm getting used to it, I'll see her again sometime. I feel better just posting. I wish I knew what my purpose was here. I actually do plan to move. I need to be near more family, others. I need to get away. What's odd is that when I'm around their dad, I don't really mind if he mildly flirts, but I feel very odd when he is serious. I feel molested. Even though, I'm very attracted to men in general, it's just I can't make myself trust him. Should I tell him him that? I want to be friends, but we never had a trusting relationship, I was always afraid of him. I don't mind a hug from him, but I feel like he's feeling me up, and from him, it just doesn't feel right. Some people can do that, and even if it's a little sexual it doesn't feel molesting. It's okay. I don't quite know who he is, as a person, even tho I tried to love him, while I was being abused. Maybe I miss my son because he was so good, raising a little boy teaches you so much about men, they're also sweet and vulnerable, but so beautiful, and trying to be protectors even from a young age. And you want to protect them from all the harms out there. You know they're growing up to be bigger than you. I miss holding him when he was little. So solid, soft cheeks, such a beautiful sweet spirit. Who would think that little boys could have such sweet spirits? I just want to touch and hear his spirit once in awhile, as he does mine. I've been thinking about him all day, hoping he's fine, willing my love to go to his heart. Amazing how much love a baby can give you. They have tremendous power. I miss my baby. My son, and my daughter. Sometimes I feel so alone here where I raised them, the town is empty without them here. I am empty. I really really need to move, but it's kind of a chore. I'm hoping some friends can come over and keep me company while I go through stuff. I keep wishing I had a mentor, an advisor, to tell me how to act, what to say towards my ex, how to safely date, because I'm obviously lonely, but I don't have a mentor. I want someone to tell me what to do. I'm also a Christian, but not one without sins, and I don't fit in here at all. I don't go to church because I can't talk to people there about really difficult things. I don't think they'd get it, thei have so many rules!! Don't ask, don't touch, don't love, don't be involved, don't be human. Don't ask for help, we won't give you any. We abandon you, we don't think you are good enough for us. Anyway, feel free to comment. And thank you. Have a nice evening. "

I've brought this up serveral times to my therapist but i feel as though she doesn't quite believe me, and when this happens I usually end up leaving feeling a bit retraumatized (specifically thinking of how my family wouldn't listen to my intense anxiety to the point of treating me as though i was crazy). Its also very difficult to express myself in therapy because I usually feel very depersonalized/dissociated and as though I'm not describing myself but someone else. Even in typing this, I feel detached from my own reality and as though I'm not quite all here. I've also been dealing with feelings of emotional neglect from childhood and feelings of helplessness I frequently experienced as a result of being treated this way by my dad, who I often felt powerless around and manipulated by as though he was sexualizing me in some way. This has led to porn use along with dissociation over the years which has made things even more confused. I also notice I tend to dissociate when being touched (recently this happened while getting a haircut). I often feel as though I'm not in my body and throughout childhood I began speaking in accents because i would feel so detached from myself (this may have also been a way to avoid vulnerability and occurred frequently in moments of fear, usually around my dad). (I'm now an actor and inn part I think this ability led me to acting). I also recognize that it comes from a place of serious depersonalization. Could these things be related to childhood sexual abuse? Has anybody who is a CSA survivor (or otherwise) experienced anything similar?"

Whether doodling or writing, I would love to create and found the act of making art very rewarding and cathartic. During the worst two years of my trauma, I lost it. It was 4 years ago, give or take, since I left that environment, but it still is gone. Maybe it is the vulnerability in baring your soul, maybe it is the toxic sludge of pain I feel when I try to put words to paper. It doesn't feel happy anymore, it makes me feel dirty and disgusting. Even if the act of writing brings happiness it's mixed with this dirty mud of filth and nausea. The stories are still in there, wanting to get out somewhere, but I've repressed far more important things that them, so I wonder if I'll ever be able to free them. Trauma finds the things that help you and give you life and takes them from you one by one. One by one we are all broken into submission in the end."
242,vulnerability,CPTSD,Maintaining Friendships during recovery is so hard,1,aonavw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/aonavw/maintaining_friendships_during_recovery_is_so_hard/,2019-02-09 11:55:49,"UGhhhh. I need to majorly offload now because I think tonight I have well and truly lost my last remaining friend which makes me doubt the road to recovery. The whole night I was getting vibes from her that made me uncomfortable. She's usually a 'nice'/ 'considerate' person- aka a bit of people pleaser, but I know she means well. Throughout recovery I could sense that she became increasingly uncomfortable with my 'vulnerability' and authenticity and I guess I became increasingly annoyed at how naive and set in her ways she is since she was 17 (double judgment I guess). She hasn't moved out ever and I feel that she just hasn't grown up. I know its kinda mean but I cant help sometimes feeling this way? Tonight I was out with her (Drinking and dancing) and the vibe was just off. She made a few comments that threw me completely off and then we had an argument when she accused me of giving HER 'bad vibes' and her reacting to MY anger, trying to go for the good old trope of being 'too sensitive' (and therefore crazy, which a prior person in the same friendship group accused me of. )Im sick of it. And I no longer have any friends now the more 'myself' I am? Like whats the point? Maybe everyone is right and Im the one with the problem? For further context- if anyone has the time to read such a long post, please see below: We were at the bar and at one point she asked me 'who do you think you are, in a movie or something' as a 'joke'. All I was doing was scanning the bar and dancing in my seat? I brushed it off completely and laughed it off. She then was like 'omg you're so drunk' when I was talking to her (she doesn't drink) and questioned my ability to get home and if I was ok. I told her that I was absolutely fine. Prior to that she asked if I was ok, that I seemed sad and distracted. I told her I was fine but that alcohol makes me feel a little spaced out. We then continued talking and at one point I started talking about something and she told me I was so mean. I don't even remember what I was talking about but I just felt a little sad. I used to try to always be perfect but Im sorry Im a human being that sometimes doesn't have perfect thoughts. We were then dancing together and she told me I was dancing too fast and to dance slower. We used to enjoy dancing together and this bummed me out... like what the hell? I'm just doing what I love and you're telling me I'm not doing it right? Who the F are you to tell me this? She also made other comments,, asking me to stop when I was encouraging her with our past yelling of ""eyy's"" at each other on the dancefloor.(Previous tradition - which when last time we danced together and I didn't do this, she pointed it out with disappointment saying she missed it). I just was made to feel like I wasn't enough the whole night and any authentic step I took as myself was shot down by her. Though everything I pointed above may seem small it was a buildup you know? We then went outside and she makes a joke about how her lipstick was all over her face and I didn't tell her. I felt resentment from her- because even though she was 'joking' she was inferring that I was being a shitty friend? and told her that I didn't see. I thought that I said this casually but I was also very direct about that, because what kind of joke is that? She then repeated it twice, which led to me getting more and more angry and repeating the same thing with admittedly some annoyance. We then attempt to change the subject and start talking about reggaetn music. I tell her that Im unsure if I even love reggaetn that much but London doesn't seem to have any good spots. She then comments that I sound 'very mad about it' and I ask her what she means, she then repeats that I sound very mad (but we both know that we aren't talking about the music anymore) and I eventfully confront her and ask her if there's a problem. Eventually she admits that she thinks that I HAVE THE PROBLEM AND SHE CAN SENSE MY ANGER AND IS WONDERING IF I HAVE AN ISSUE.... our argument consisted of her saying she didn't have a problem but was merely responding to my negative tone, even though she admitted that she 'grilled me' about the lipstick thing cos I seemed annoyed about it. Which she later took back as proof that she also was being passive aggressive. Basically the argument ended with her saying she wasn't being passive aggressive AT ALL\_ and was merely responding to my aggressiveness. I told her that two play a part in a dynamic and I only started getting annoyed with the lipstick comment cos it seemed uncalled for and very passive aggressive and the 'mad comment' was later a nail on the head. I also suggested I wasn't the only one with negative underlying feelings but she wouldn't acknowledge this saying that it was just me. I suggested maybe we both have just grown apart and she took this as proof of only me having underlying feelings. Im just so annoyed with being made to feel like there is something fundamentally wrong with me, and being gaslit by all my prior friends that I am the problem. But maybe I am? Maybe Ii am anxious.. I don't know. Therapy has given me more a sense of self but... has my life really improved? Is recovery all its cracked up to be when all its meant for me so far is repeatedly being misunderstood and rejected? &amp;#x200B;"

We are stuck living together for now. Where they are mentally is toxic to me and over the course of the last year, has been breaking my spirit. That strong spirit of resilience from dealing with abuse my entire life is shattering. I did everything I could to support them/ to help with their mental health. But being around them is breaking my spirit and triggering in so many ways. Weve been through months of therapy and not much improvement because they arent doing the work-which is why I had to walk away. We hardly fight(this is the first time in like a month) but when we do, we get nowhere. Since we are still living together we were trying to make the most of the time we have. I tried to bring up something that was bothering me, he got defensive and started reaching for things to retort to me with which did not pertain to the conversation at all. Example: Hey I am feeling taken advantage of lately, Ive been paying for a lot of things and I feel like you havent offered to pay anything yet . Can you be more mindful of making sure to pay sometimes or even just your share? Him: ...Well, you didnt take out the laundry this morning like I asked. Based on the stonewalling, the behavior today, and lack of emotion-I have been suspecting my partner has some narcissistic tendencies. Or something is really wrong with the way they handle conflict, vulnerability and intimate relationships. It just feels wrong but Im not a professional so I second guess myself. But just because he is a hurt person doesnt mean he can treat me this way. I can never get through to him when I feel things are getting out of hand. We even had a safe word I was told I could use when I noticed problematic behaviors. He found every excuse to not to listen or do something about how he was acting today. Ive been trying to communicate to him that we alone have to take accountability for checking our perceptions, communicating that perception, and how we react to a cause. How do I get through this next month without breaking? "

I feel like an alien because even though Im 25, I have the romantic experience of a 14-year old. Im *always* single, never have any hookups/flings, etc...unlike everyone else I know. No matter their age, gender, mental health, body type, etc...theyve all had what Ive never had. I feel out of place the older I get; I feel like Im missing something in life thats so important to everyone else and its also so easy to them. I feel like everyone else is part of this club that Im not part of, and have an insanely hard time trying to get in. I feel inept, pitiful, embarrassing. It makes me resentful of others for being so free, so confident, so comfortable in their sexuality. How dare they be free while Im here trapped by my own mind? Im not ugly, nor am I a bad person. I discovered that its a deep fear of intimacy and vulnerability...nice helping of social anxiety, and body dysmorphia. I isolate, sabotage, and starve myself. I also have a hard time making friends.

I struggle, a lot. Always have. Abusive and neglectful mother (may she rot in a hole), a father who was absent (he had to escape her). And then all the trauma by the bullies who recognized a bullied victim and jumped on board (starting as a young child - kids can be MEAN!) &amp;#x200B; I made a really good friend in college, AJ. I went through a rough breakup and the two of us ended up being through together - two completely different worlds and yet, we took care of and nurtured each other. Supported each other. They always thought I was exaggerating the abuse until they heard it (when mom didn't know they were there). Shocked does not begin to cover their reaction. &amp;#x200B; We were close for years, and because of a lot of their specific background, I worked hard to protect them - from the bad things in the world, from hate/racism, from the nasty. This is an incredibly sweet, kind, and humble person, and I didn't want to be responsible for... ruining that ""innocence."" (Which I recognize now as messed up, considering they were/are an adult, and keeping them innocent was and is not my job). &amp;#x200B; When I found out how sick my dad was, I called - they lived within a couple hours. AJ offered to drop everything and I said it could wait until the weekend. Then my dad died 5 days later, and it felt like... I dropped off the radar. It seemed they were impossible to get a hold of, talk to about any of the struggles I've been going through in the last year and a half. Because with someone so kind and sensitive, how do you send in a text ""so.... yeah... I was in a bad place last night, self-medicated with alcohol, hit some people and tried to drive drunk. how r u?"" (that's how I got into IOP!) &amp;#x200B; My other best friends, the ones who knew me growing up/were geographically closer for longer - they knew more about what was going on (harder to hide the symptoms in person!), so things like the above would seem less out of the blue. With AJ, how could I start with a text like that? Just jumping into my self-destructive behavior, and then having to explain the reasons why - all via text? Not so much. &amp;#x200B; So AJ just... has had no idea. As I've struggled with reliving the emotional and physical abuse, the sexual assault, the grief and loss of my father, the ongoing maternal abuse... I wanted to talk in person, but there was just ""never a time."" &amp;#x200B; So, for Womb Liberation Day, I sent a text saying that I really needed to talk. Because if AJ and I aren't friends anymore, then we aren't friends anymore, but I can't live in this ""AJ is my best friend and someone I can rely on in a crisis"" bullshit if we're not actually friends anymore. How can I call someone a friend, or a best friend, if we've spoken 10 words in a year, none of which felt meaningful?! When I felt abandoned? &amp;#x200B; Got nothing. So I called the last number I had, and left a 3 minute long VM with some details/emotion, and a short email to the last address I had, basically saying I was trying to get in touch. &amp;#x200B; Today, I saw a response - not even knowing if it was from them. Reaching out, asking ""are we even friends anymore?"" (essentially) was one of the hardest things I've ever done, especially considering I was emotionally abused and conditioned to believe that I was never enough, never good enough. That I am lacking in every way and push/drive \*everyone\* away from me, eventually. I've already been isolating the last few weeks - just hiding in a room and not wanting to come out, deal with people. Wanting to avoid my life, my bills, my physical and mental illnesses and diagnoses/attempts to get diagnoses. Just wanting to escape, escape my life, escape my fear that I'm going to be unable to function in society forever (can't currently drive, per doctors. Can't work.) I forced myself to open the email - not waiting until my partner came home. &amp;#x200B; Turns out AJ's spouse was transferred cross-country a year ago, and they've been bi-coastal, when AJ isn't traveling for work (which is near constantly), they are traveling to see their spouse. Apparently, their mom is also been quite ill, and a lot has been on AJs mind - AJ hasn't been coping well, and has been isolating/not reaching out/communicating. &amp;#x200B; So I responded, with a brief email at the top, with an apology, and a wish to be able to support them, as well as missing their role of stability in my life. That I missed them, that I was going to attach everything that they've missed out on - but to read it as they can handle it. That it's.... a lot. But that I can't protect AJ from the bad things anymore, because 1. adult but 2. if I continue trying to protect them from what happened to me, I am, in a sense, denying what happened to me. That I can't do that anymore. &amp;#x200B; So, after the direct response to their email, I typed out everything. How I was sexually assaulted by a romantic partner - how I was vulnerable enough to stay in the relationship and get assaulted more than once, by the same person. The depth of the abuse from my mother - that I even managed to surprise mental health professionals and myself. &amp;#x200B; I hated typing it out. Making it real. Making it real to AJ - someone that I've wanted and tried to protect for so long. It now lives in the ether of the internet forever, and we know all the same people from college - a lot of the same networking contacts (because I was never able to establish a career, it's more that AJ knows everyone I know), and AJ could end up telling.... everyone. Because AJ is going to be out of the country for the next few months for work... it was either email, or nothing. I chose email. It was risky and I'm afraid. I made sure to tell AJ that it was a ""heavy"" email, and to read it at their own pace, not to take on too much... &amp;#x200B; But this is the first time I've told someone I know when I wasn't able to control the situation. It wasn't in real time, where I could answer questions, etc. &amp;#x200B; I wrote, then edited, edited, and edited again. Then I hit send. &amp;#x200B; I want to drink. I want to dull the fear and nakedness I feel. The vulnerability. It \*is\* Fat Tuesday! But self-medication is not the answer. I reached out to AJ because I wanted to try and save the friendship (instead of catastrophizing and assuming AJ just didn't want to be friends anymore). I reached out to self-advocate, and to take positive steps - and I'm not going to take a step backwards. &amp;#x200B; So I'm here. Writing this, pretty much stream of consciousness. Not knowing if anyone will read it, or care. Just wanting to write (and thus make it true, and validated), that I'm making the smart choice - dealing with my feelings, as unpleasant as they may be. I'm facing them head on, after a week or two of avoiding \*everything\* and \*most people\*. &amp;#x200B; I took a chance, poured out my heart, and hoped that my best friend still wanted to be my best friend. That I was enough. The world didn't end. &amp;#x200B; Maybe someone reads this, and has the courage to take a chance. Or to take a stand for themselves. Or to show some self-love, self-care, self-empathy. Or maybe this just serves as proof that today, I did my best, and my best was confronting one of my worst fears (not being wanted) stone cold sober - no self-medicating, or prescriptions necessary. Today, that's my best. "

I feel worthless, I'm not that bad looking, but when I get sexual feelings, I get obsession and get worthless feelings when I think,feel about sex, or feel the intimacy around women. I stopped even liking a woman after that age in a romantic fashion, I was used to get crushes on my girl friends and ask them out and I would really into that stuff.

I went no-contact with her about half a year ago now. The kinds of things I did just to convince myself I was absolutely worthless, just to keep her away from me, have completely destroyed me. &gt; A young girl was standing in the doorway next to the staircase, clock at 23:47, a tinny laughter accompanied with an electric light stood between her and the silence and darkness. She was looking at her mother, who was occupied with the electric light. Just barely not shivering, arms crossed, face slightly down, she woke up from her sleep because of a nightmare. &gt; &gt; _""What are you doing here? It's night. Go back to bed""_ Over time, I lost my connection with my body. Avoided going home, never knew why. I thought all of it was normal. A friend of mine asked if I helped my mother with the groceries, as if that was the most normal thing to do, I replied with ""no"". He suspected I didn't respect my mother, but I managed to give him a convincing (true) answer, that I didn't need to, because we're only a family of three, and my mother actually worked in a grocery store back then... The actual answer is, _I didn't respect my mother_. On some level, I was ashamed of this, am I such a terrible person for rejecting her? Now though, I know why. I despise her, I despise what role she played in my development, no contribution she made to my personality is something I'm proud of. _nothing_. When I got a little older, from the age of 16-17 or so, both my sisters left home, I was left alone with my mother. Again, never conscious of anything being wrong, or anything being off about her; I knew she was depressed, I knew she was anxious, I knew she wasn't able to deal with her problems well, but she was my mother, I tried to help, talk to her, for as much as a suicidal 16-year old can help. &gt; &gt; ""Mother, I know you're incredibly depressed, but there're still things you can look forward to, things to work toward. I don't understand why you don't want to try anything to make yourself feel better, you can still make something of your life."" &gt; &gt; _""Don't you understand? I'm 54, I'm old, I can't learn any new things any more, I cannot grow anymore. My life is over!""_, she screamed to me in response. &gt; I never recall having made any conscious decisions, and I wasn't aware of what that did to me back then. It crushed me, _I believed her_. Her life is over, she has nothing to live for, life is worthless. Still, she was the only person in my life. I had no idea emotional support was an actual thing, or friendships beyond shared interests, or vulnerability, or well... emotions at all. I was already depressed for several years; sometimes on the edge of being bipolar, hypomanic. Despite the occasional upswings, depression struck again. &gt; &gt; ""Mother, I'm incredibly depressed, I have no emotions."" &gt; &gt; _""Yes you do, you have plenty of emotions""_ &gt; &gt; ""Maybe I do, but I can't feel them."" &gt; &gt; _""You know, I've been depressed a lot as well, I understand depression very well. Life is what you make of it, you shouldn't allow yourself to linger in the darkness. It is your responsibility to make something of your life""_ &gt; &gt; ""But how, what, why, where, when? For what reason? Life is meaningless, life is worthless, everything sucks. &gt; &gt; Even if that's just because I'm depressed, how do I deal with it?"" &gt; &gt; _""Stop talking to yourself like that, I don't think you're depressed, you're just feeling down right now, life does suck, you just gotta live with that knowledge, it doesn't get better.""_ So I went on, at least she understands me. We're very alike, she knows depression, and she gave me very valuable advice, even though I hate it. I have to take responsibility for my happiness and health. This is what ""inspired"" me to start running, jogging. I did that for several weeks, motivated myself to go, even when I didn't want to go. I went from not being able to run for 3 minutes, to running a full hour in only 30 days. I felt nothing. It did help with my energy, but I felt nothing. ""I'm not meant for life, I don't get what people like about sports, why does this come so easy to other people? I can't do it; that must mean I'm just weak, can't take responsibility for my happiness."" And my depression got worse, who would've guessed. I stopped running again, I didn't like it. I couldn't stand the feeling of walking down the stairs with my jogging clothes on, every single time I'd walk past her, and she'd see me. She'd see that I was doing something healthy for myself, and I felt _disgusting_. &gt; &gt; _""Where are you going?""_ &gt; &gt; ""Gonna buy drugs."" &gt; &gt; _""Don't say that, you're innocent, you don't do those kinds of things. DrUgS aRe eViL!""_ &gt; &gt; ""Whatever."" &gt; &gt; I wasn't going to buy drugs, I've only done hard-drugs three times in my life. Most of the time I just went for a walk, sometimes I went jogging, sometimes I walked to the city, get a few beers at the bar. &gt; &gt; _""Where are you going? Going out with friends?""_ &gt; &gt; ""."" I learned that I could just ignore her. It involved a sacrifice of my dignity, but I didn't care. &gt; _""Good morning!""_ &gt; &gt; ""."" &gt; &gt; _""Don't you say good morning to me anymore?!""_ &gt; &gt; ""."" She stopped saying good morning after a few mornings like this, it worked. She'd still try, occasionally, but I'd just ignore her. This seemed to offend her, that made me happy. During dinner, I'd stare, stare and ignore. Was I daydreaming? Sure, daydreaming. ... I wasn't daydreaming, it was dissociation. I began to slump. I sort of felt that it hurt, that it was uncomfortable, but who cares, the future only holds pain, why bother fighting against it? The more I ignored it, the less I felt it. It didn't matter. I didn't matter. Nothing mattered. I had succeeded, my mother ignored me out of contempt. &gt; _""You know I love you unconditionally!""_ She said that occasionally. I know she didn't. I see people wondering whether narcissists are capable of love. I think she felt the love, maybe twisted love, but love nonetheless. Although I'm still uncertain about whether she felt it, I know for sure that I didn't. And then, therapy. My sister had convinced my mother that I needed it, after 3 years of failed persuasion. I knew I did, I was really interested in trying. I recently started smoking weed, I'm certain the only reason she actually started looking for a therapist was because of that; weed. Drugs are bad, evil,. I must be fixed. &gt; &gt; **""Hi, nice to meet you two, I understand your son is dealing with depression?""** &gt; &gt; _""Yes, and he smokes a lot of weed.""_ &gt; &gt; **""Ah, why do you smoke weed?""** &gt; &gt; ""It's the only time when I can feel something. I've spent a lot of time thinking about why I smoke so much weed, because I know it is bad, but I feel like it helps more than it hurts. I have access to my emotions, I didn't even know I _had_ emotions. It also helps me relax, and music becomes so much more interesting as well!"" &gt; &gt; _""I think he's doing it to hurt me. Besides, you already love music so much, why would you need drugs to make it more interesting?""_ &gt; &gt; The therapist looked at me, laughed, and said **""I don't think you're doing it to hurt her, are you""** I wasn't. I definitely was hurting her intentionally, the weed wasn't part of it though; ignoring her was, taking sides against her whenever I could was, pretending I was a drug dealer was. That was meant to hurt her. Or... Well, not really. It was meant to hurt myself. If only I could pull off a convincing enough act of self-destruction, only then would she leave me alone. Hurting her in the process was never the intention, even though it _was_ necessary. &gt; As my mother was cleaning up the plates after dinner, I was just staring at the wall. I couldn't deal with life anymore, my depression was only getting worse. I spent most of my days in bed, the comfortable anhedonia was slowly turning to painful; serious depression. &gt; Just staring at the wall, my body was incredibly tense, just an inch from snapping. It snapped. &gt; In less than a second, I took off my glasses, and crushed them with my hands. &gt; &gt; _""Therapy isn't working, is it?""_, she said in a judgmental tone. I expected help, concern, perhaps even worry. All I got was more contempt; emotion is weakness. At this point, I wasn't doing well at college, I was in my last year, but I should've already graduated. I couldn't finish my last subject, and through the internet, I figured out I might actually have ADHD. Because of this, I switched therapists, got diagnosed (turned out I was already diagnosed when I was younger, ADD, not ADHD. I never knew, never got help). Finished school, started getting more serious therapy. &gt; _""Tell me about your mother, she seems to have a lot of control over you.""_ So I told her some of the things I felt were frustrating, how she told me I was a pansy because I expressed pain while doing the dishes with extremely hot water, my hands were red. Told her more, far more. Just tiny frustrations, just annoying, ""ugh"". &gt; _""From what you've just told me, I think I can make up that your mother is a terrible person, and will never be there for you. I completely understand why you've developed such severe depression along with dissociative symptoms. All I can suggest to you is to get out of there as quickly as possible, I can't do much for as long as you still live with her.""_ Perplexed I was. A terrible person? What? She's not normal? &gt; A young guy was standing in the doorway next to the staircase, clock at 23:47, a tinny laughter accompanied with an electric light stood between her and the silence and darkness. She was looking at her mother, who was occupied with the electric light. Just barely not shivering, arms crossed, face slightly down, she woke up from her sleep because of a nightmare. &gt; _""What are you doing here? It's night. Go back to bed""_ After this, I started becoming much, much more aware of my mother's behavior. It only took two weeks before I was completely done with it, and I decided to go for a full-on confrontation, why does she act like this? I recorded the entire three hour ""conversation"", she doesn't know I recorded it. The entire thing was classical malignant narcissism; she denied everything I said she did wrong. She was the victim, I tried my best to hate her despite her unconditional love. Not only did she not remember screaming at me, I was crazy for believing she ever did, yadda yadda yadda. The morning after, I packed my bags, took my diploma with me; very symbolic. I slept on my sisters floor for three weeks. So I talked to my sister, about mother. Shared some stuff I learned from books, therapy, Reddit, etc; ""I know she's never outwardly or overtly abusive, she doesn't scream often, she has never hit us, etc... But according to what I read, more damage has been done by what she _hasn't_ done, rather than what she _has_ done. Emotional neglect is actually more harmful than overt abuse."" &gt; ""I remember, in our first home, I was 4, maybe 5 years old, I had a terrible nightmare, coulnd't sleep. I was terrified, scared, lonely, afraid of the darkness. I managed to go downstairs, and I just stood there, in the door, looking at our parents for a little while. I didn't move, but I think I wanted to be seen, to be comforted, I was afraid though. So I just waited, until they noticed me."" &gt; &gt; _""What are you doing here? It's night. Go back to bed""_ &gt; &gt; My sister sighed, and responded, ""Yeah, that happened to me as well."". Happy birthday, mom."

I told some time, got my life in a semblance of order and very very casually started dating. About 2 weeks ago I met a guy I really like who seems to really like me. Last night we were out, talking, everything is awesome and the attraction and comfort between us was on fire. Until he mentioned that I have no virtual foot print. Couldn't find me on Facebook or IG (I had mentioned cell phone photography posts on social media, and we had briefly talked about our beliefs on using social media. I dont think hes like being weird or anything.) It was like a moment where a glass breaks. I could physically feel myself react. I got quiet, felt my body tense and felt myself dissociate from the situation. I felt like everything stopped and my heart started racing, I was nauseous and shaking for a moment. He was great, immediately picked up on the change, let me put my head against his chest and breathe for a minute. He apologized and said he didnt mean to bring up something I was uncomfortable with. He has no idea I was having a flashback or that I have C-ptsd. I was able to get control of myself and make words after a few minutes. I simply said, ""full disclosure. I dont have a digital footprint because I was in a really abusive relationship and my abuser used social media to keep tabs on me and frighten me. I had to disappear in virtual reality and move physically away to finally escape. So I am really hard to find."" He apologized that I went through something like that, I tried to push past with a live and learn attitude and it worked. We were able to get out of that moment together and get back into a headspace to enjoy each other's company. Maybe took about 5 minutes to navigate the entire chain of interactions. Biggest take away was, he didn't run away and he didn't push for more details than I was willing to give. I want to keep seeing him. But I also know that he will eventually ask more or there will be another trigger he might witness. I don't necessarily want to lay out every God awful moment that created my c-ptsd diagnosis nor do I want to create proximity trauma for him. I don't even really want to tell him my diagnosis because that always devolves into asking why in my experience. I guess I'm wondering at what point in a relationship do you have to share that part if ever? How much should really be shared? I dont feel like anyone needs to know every intimate detail of the horrific physical, mental, and sexual abuse I suffered for over 4 years. But I also know that a relationship requires some vulnerability... anyone have any thoughts?"

Vulnerability is terrifying to me, because I repeatedly had my trust betrayed and vulnerabilities held against me as a child/teenager. So when I sense some kind of threat towards my trust, I become cold, I ignore, I find reasons to not trust them, and sadly thats ended important friendships for me.. Its difficult to talk to friends about this when it happens because as said, my traumatised brain searches for more reasons not to trust them once theyve already triggered a sense of threat. Of course I absolutely hate being like this and I want to get better. Can anyone relate? In that case, how do you fight the instinct to run away?"

This is kind of a rant, but I'm wondering if anyone else has felt the same way and how to maybe get over my frustration. I first started seeing a psychiatrist about 10 years ago when I was 15. I was having severe depression and anxiety. I always knew it was from years of childhood abuse, neglect, exposure to domestic violence, sexual abuse, you know all the things that I'm just now finding out cause C-PTSD. This old psychiatrist put me on all kinds of things I was on for years - anti psychotics, bipolar meds, ADHD meds. Nothing helped For undergrad from age 18-21, I went to a pretty expensive, private school out of state on a partial scholarship because of family expectations. Psychiatrists I saw there did the same thing. My last year of school I developed a severe and mysterious case of Psoriasis that doctors couldn't figure out- and I'm now reading that C-PTSD causes a vulnerability to autoimmune disorders (Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder!). I was incredibly depressed, still medicated for the wrong things that actually made things worse, and to add to it self sabotaged myself with excessive drinking and promiscuous behavior. I drank so much that I finally ended up waking up in the ER. I don't know how I managed to graduate with my double degree. I made no connections or decent friends that everyone expects you to do during your 4 years in college, genuinely made an ass out of myself in social situations from always being drunk, and am so so in student loan debt. I can't help but blame this on my misdiagnosis when I tried to get help and feel so much shame and misunderstanding. It wasn't until I did a master's course and started seeing a psychiatrist in another country that I was introduced to the concept of C-PTSD. I saw a therapist a few weeks ago and she recommended I get the Complex PTSD workbook by Arielle Schwartz. I just started reading it and I am pretty angry and frustrated that in the first 30 pages every issue I've ever experienced in my young adult life has been explained. I really feel like if I saw a competent doctor 10 years ago, I could have worked through all this so much sooner. Has anyone else experienced this?"

It's very difficult for me to be vulnerable... It's nearly impossible for me to let my husband know what is going on in my heart and in my head, let alone anyone else (okay, except for strangers on the internet lol). It's utterly terrifying to let someone in to what's going on because the past taught me that bad things will happen if you do. It's also difficult for me to allow myself to feel my own feelings sometimes, and I instead try to avoid and distract myself. I know I am not alone in this. The strange thing is though, I don't ALWAYS avoid my own feelings. I'm a very introspective person, probably to a fault because I can get really lost in my own head sometimes (for example, I've ruminating about this issue for hoooours). I guess it's mostly the really bad feelings that come up that I push back down. &amp;#x200B; But I'm also learning that I struggle embracing other people's vulnerability. I find instead of responding with empathy, I get angry and irritated and have this ""just get over it!"" mentality. Part of me also just wants to run away from the situation, my go-to reaction to conflict (that or freeze). What in the world?! I would hate if someone responded to me that way (which is part of my own fear), so why do I behave in this manner? In my head and heart, I care deeply about other people, but when shit gets real I just turn into an asshole. This is a huge issue in my marriage, as you can imagine. Partly because my husband often brings up his feelings in a way that I perceive as hostile and it's very triggering for me. I cannot handle any amount of hostility, anger, aggression, negative tones, etc. (whether perceived or real) without losing it. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, has anyone else experienced anything similar? I don't want to be an asshole... I dream of having an honest and open conversation with someone one day, filled with love and empathy. And being able to look past someone else's fumblings into vulnerability (like if my husband does bring something up with anger, being able to give grace and look past that to the real issue).

255,vulnerability,CPTSD,"I did EMDR before I knew about CPTSD, but only because my psychologist kept pushing it.",1,anfw9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/anfw9a/i_did_emdr_before_i_knew_about_cptsd_but_only/,2019-02-06 03:40:28,"And now Im worried that experience has ruined EMDR for me, and I see so many people with complex PTSD helped by it. TL;DR at bottom. Basically, Ive been in therapy on and off since 2014, but always for depression, anxiety, etc. Funnily enough, my counsellor at the time in 2014 suggested PTSD after I mentioned my relationship with my mother and some baggage from childhood. But, I didnt score highly enough on the questionnaire so it was forgotten quickly and at the time I didnt yet consider by mother abusive, and thought my childhood was actually good. I was convinced my problems were entirely my fault/caused by having something wrong in my physiology. I did EMDR with that counsellor at his suggestion but found it uncomfortable and questioned the science behind it, so we didnt continue with it. Fast forward to 2017, I start seeing a psychologist. At first, and up until the last few sessions (saw him weekly for over a year), I didnt think anything was wrong. Turns out Im bad at realizing when people are behaving poorly, and I avoid conflict and try to be a people pleaser. But he knew that. It was something that came up a lot, and it was something we wanted to work on. I shared everything with this therapist. Our rapport was great, and I ended up realizing and then eventually, accepting, that my mother was in fact, abusive. My childhood was not perfect. I have major mom issues and act the way I do largely because of how I was raised. However, PTSD never really came up. I was diagnosed with MDD, social anxiety, and ADHD by him. I was hoping for these diagnoses at the time, because I truly believed they were the causes and not symptoms of a larger problem. He was really into EMDR, and brought it up early on. I explained that I had tried it before and hadnt found it useful, and had in fact felt uncomfortable doing it. But he brought it up almost every session, maybe backing off 3-4 sessions at a time before trying to convince me again. As I said before, people pleaser/avoids conflict, etc. so I would usually cave in to his requests to do EMDRalthough we would usually have a small conversation about how if I was to do it, it was really only because I didnt want to upset him or make him feel bad. I guess he thought the potential benefits made up for my protests that I didnt like it. I probably did short-lived EMDR with him about 20 or so times. I did not find it helpful, and could barely stand to do it for more than 15 seconds at a time. I just felt very uncomfortable closing my eyes in front of someone and having them tap their fingers on my knees... or the usual method I opted for, watching his fingers as he waves them back and forth in front of my face. It just made my skin crawl. I dont know exactly why, maybe it has to do with vulnerability. Has anyone else experienced this with EMDR? In the end, we had a falling out due to him being unprofessional and sharing things I didnt want shared with my GP and my psychiatrist at the time, who he knew I was not going to see anymore, and that they both didnt take my problems seriously. I dont want to go too into it, but safe to say that I felt extremely betrayed by the end of our falling out. Its still hard for me to talk about. It made me realize several red flags that had appeared early on with him, one of which being the fact that he pushed EMDR on me incessantly, and it only served to worsen how uncomfortable so feel doing it. TL;DR: Bad experiences with EMDR with previous psychologist who I had a falling out with. I felt uncomfortable doing EMDR to begin with, but after the falling out, I now associate EMDR with him specifically because of how much he pushed it on me. Im worried EMDR may be ruined for me, and knowing that I have CPTSD... I could probably actually make use of it now."

Basically I want to do 'nothing' a lot. And I don't *feel* depressed (plus I'm in therapy so I'd know if I was), but I do feel tired in my soul, and this 'rest' I've had since I met my SO 5 years ago feels like it makes sense, even if, from the outside, it doesn't make sense... &amp;#x200B; I can't blame my behaviour on my childhood but I wonder if it plays a role. I grew up in an extremely hostile, stressful house where my mother ran her daycare business from. Every day there were 5 to 7 children at the house, plus me, my parents, and my 3 siblings. It was beyond busy or hectic it was honestly incredibly stressful. &amp;#x200B; A lot of responsibilities fell on me when I was home from school, however I also had a ridiculous extracurricular schedule thanks to my nmom. I think she wanted me to be some kind of celebrity as i was enrolled in ballet, singing, acting, tutoring for classes and choirs and more. In childhood, I don't remember 'playing' that much. But I remember a looooot of rehersals, performances, practice and training. It was like, go to ballet in the morning, then school for 8 hours, then to a 2 hour swimming training session, then tutoring, then home, relate with family and siblings and possibly put them to bed, then i'd sleep. Often though, i'd be recruted to listen to my mothers complaints about my father (who gambled for a hefty period of time). I was her 'partner' emotionally and it was f\*cked. &amp;#x200B; Fast-forward to now, i'm 32. Between leaving home at 19 and now, i fought and hustled my ass off for freedom, independence and finances of my own. I still am not 'doing well' financially, but i'm also not in huge debt so that counts, right? I run my own business but it's a constant application and takes time. I have a lovely SO and he's exploring who he is (he's from a conservative country), I do therapy weekly and i try to take life one small bite at a time. But given the way i was raised, sometimes i can't help but think i am lazy. Some days i won't even go outside, I'll stay at home and work from there (it's winter here), and i'll just watch tv, tidy the house, do work and read on reddit. And I don't feel 'sad' with that, I feel good with that. &amp;#x200B; I have no other way to say what i mean other than I just like being in quiet, safe, peaceful places, and too much stimulation doesn't feel good to me. Before, when I moved out and was 19, the challenge of the big city and meeting lots of people was inviting - it was like channelling energy to a positive place. But now, I just feel like, I'd rather read books, 'be boring' as my nmom would call it, because ironically, i never get bored! i enjoy it! &amp;#x200B; Maybe i'm simply introverted, maybe i can finally be myself away from my nmom and the pressure for perfection. But I'm so far from who I was before, the stage, the performances, the feigned confidence and so on. I guess being raised in a dysfunctional house leaves little to no room for vulnerability - it's not safe. Though I do hope at some point, a bit of my bounce and energy comes back so I can enjoy some new things too. I also thought maybe it's down to the fact that now, my SO is my best friend. It just happened naturally and gradually. Can anyone relate or provide insight? I may be missing some important outside perspective..."

I went on a date with a forthcoming person and I felt so uncomfortable. Me expressing my vulnerability and receiving some kind of support from a more distant person however feels soothing. Am I completely damaged at this point? I can express myself and I can be vulnerable but maybe there are parts of me that my parents conditioned to be emotionally unavailable just as they were?

I took a few days to try and de tangle the mess in my mind. All of this stemming from having seen my mother on Christmas (a mistake in hindsight). Prior to seeing her I was very set on being a creative, mostly through visual art and I had dedicated so much of my time and resources into pursuing this. Then I saw my mom.. and she mentioned interior design and how I was apparently destined for it. A switch turned on in my brain and I was suddenly overcome with joy and ambition to see this through. The next day, I was a mess. I didnt know which way was up. I was so confused. What was my genuine hobbies and interest and what where instilled into me by my parents? Did I actually like interior design or was I oursuing it on a whim because my mom suggested it? The answer hit me today when I was scrolling Instagram.. I saw this sculptural artist that makes dolls inspired by their drawings. I was filled with inspiration and it triggered a memory I had since buried of a younger me collecting items to make my own sculptured dolls. And suddenly my mind was calm and I felt like me again. Its so hard to listen to your heart, when for so long you where taught your heart was wrong but in little moments of vulnerability your heart really does show you the way. Following it is much harder a journey but thats the process of recovery when it comes to CPTSD."
260,vulnerability,CPTSD,How do you maintain boundaries with new people without appearing rude?,1,adii57,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/adii57/how_do_you_maintain_boundaries_with_new_people/,2019-01-08 02:06:40,"Over the past few years my life turned on it's head when I realised I was in an abusive relationship and needed help from the authorities to leave and get my ex to stop contacting me. It was a terrible trauma because I only realised right at the end that there was something 'wrong' with my ex (I believe he is a psychopath) when he threatened to physically hurt me. It turned my life upside and suddenly made me hyper aware of my own safety and security especially as he then started to harass (and possibly stalk me, but I only have evidence of the harassment). I went from being a fairly open, friendly person, someone who trusted people too easily, believed the best in people to being frightened and suspicious of everyone, wondering if each new person was also a psychopath wearing a mask trying to trick me into trusting them. Since then I have done a lot of reading, joined forums, support groups, had some therapy and my life is more stable although I still have a long way to go. During my research I looked at all of the other people in my life and realised that I was surrounded by emotional abusers, sadly including my family and a lot of people I'd previously thought were close friends. I went no contact with most of them and low contact with my family. I've been trying to rebuild my life and trying not to isolate too much and make new friends. One of the problems I encounter is setting and maintaining boundaries with new people. For example I recently tried out a new group related to one of my hobbies. I recognised a woman there who I knew from many years ago. She asked where I was living now and I was initially vague and just said the area. She then asked which road and told me the road she lived on. This would normally not have bothered me but as a survivor of stalking and harassment it always makes me feel uneasy in case my ex somehow finds out where I now live. I couldn't think of a way not to say the road so I reluctantly ended up telling her. Then later on another woman in the group started referring to the road I lived on - the woman I'd told had already shared it. This gave me a sinking uneasy feeling which is always a sign that one of my boundaries has been crossed. This sort of thing used to happen to me all the time. It happens less now but it still happens sometimes and I find it really difficult to manage. I know of no way I could have avoided telling her my road without sounding rude or looking odd? I live in a location where people are very friendly, chatty and open so asking where people live including the road is very normal (it's a sort of village mentality) so I don't think these women have any sort of bad intentions but I guess it waste of my boundaries and it got walked over by these ladies because I didn't know how to protect it. I really want to get better at this. I am not good in social situations usually because of this sort of thing - I find most people too nosy and asking me prying questions about my job, if I'm married, if I have kids etc and I struggle to respond because I've been through a lot of traumas and don't want to talk about my person life at groups like this when I don't know people. Occasionally I've been made the subject of jokes in various groups and hobbies I've tried, often when I'm trying to maintain some sort of boundary. This then leads me to the leave the group and exacerbates my loneliness, vulnerability and isolation. Any tips or advice on this would help, thank you."

One that you caused, that you couldn't even acknowledge when it was laid bare to you. I'd lay it out for everyone else too, if I thought it would make you stop, if you had the capacity for shame.

The idea that I am the vulnerable that needs caring alienates me to the point where I want to get out of it. Is it a ""I do not deserve this type of love, so I shouldn't do it""-thinking or is it maybe because intimacy and vulnerability is a far fetched idea when you've been repetitely traumatized?

265,vulnerability,CPTSD,"Thoughts on vulnerability, fear, and courage (trigger warning)",1,a3cy7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/a3cy7k/thoughts_on_vulnerability_fear_and_courage/,2018-12-06 01:51:27,"This thought occurred to me in therapy today and Ive been developing it in my head a little bit more. Just wanted to articulate it better and see if people have any feedback. My thoughts relate to specific kinds of abuse I suffered as a kid, so Ill try to omit details and think about it theoretically but I still needs to reveal some things to get my point across. If you arent ready to read that please dont hurt yourself by continuing. All living involves some vulnerability, because if you are alive even at the most basic, molecular level  you have the potential of not-living (dying). This is true even for single celled bacteria If you send an email at work, you are claiming to represent those thoughts or beliefs, and that fact inherently makes you vulnerable to others. You are vulnerable because you might express the wrong opinion or give wrong advice. You may have a just a simple typo in your email and look dumb but thats still vulnerability. And you might even be perceived as being one way even thought its not warranted. You may be correct in your email but the person receiving may perceive it to be wrong and think that you are stupid or incapable. So here we all are, human beings relativity complex creatures who are all vulnerable all the time. That vulnerability NEVER goes away. No matter what you do. We are all at risk of being hit by a bus while crossing the street. Or being wiped out due to global warming. Or making a fool of ourselves and experiencing social isolation. Or saying the wrong thing and hurting someone we love accidentally. Or meaning one thing and having your words twisted. These fears along with a host of many, many other fears are normal fears that every human being experiences every day, all the time. So human vulnerability is always matched with human fear. But the problem with people who have suffered abusive situations, especially during childhood, is that the scale of what might happen has been exaggerated. Children are especially vulnerable because they need parents to provide food, clothing, shelter, safety, comfort, emotional support, developmentally appropriate education, and socially appropriate stuff. Abusive parents take advantage of the fact that children are vulnerable to fulfill their own needs. When parents abuse children they change the scale of what might happen as a result of some normal vulnerable action. For instance as a child I might have the responsibility to do a chore. I am vulnerable because I might mess it up and make a mistake due to my inexperience. I may just fail because I am no good at the chore. I may forget to do the chore completely. If I make a mistake by messing up the chore or failing to do it, I am also vulnerable to being punished. A normal punishment might be a stern talking to, to be more aware and conscious of what I am supposed to be doing. Or a stern reminder to not forget next time. An abusive punishment might be being shut out of the house with no food or water or shelter so I can see what its like to be homeless and be grateful that I have to do chores in exchange for the basic necessities of life. So now Ive associated, as a developing child two things that other people have not associated. If I make a mistake, I may now be homeless. The scale of vulnerability has changed, because a normal scale would just be like, if you make a mistake, you may let other people down and they may be disappointed in you. When children experience repeated exaggerations of the scale of what might happen as a result of some action, their sense of fear heightens because the consequences are always more severe. If you fail a test, you may not only have to take the test, study harder for other tests, or repeat the class. But you may have to face someone at home who will insult you, beat you up, and deny you food. The normal coping response to human vulnerability is courage. The fear never goes away, even for normal humans who have happy childhoods. Starting a career is risky, but normal people have the courage to try even though they might fail. Talking to someone on a date is risky, but normal people have the courage to try even if it might not go well and they might experience social rejection. Or the other person might not be someone you want in your life. Trying anything is risky. But for people who have experienced abuse, when the scale is exaggerated, the fear associated with normal things is also exaggerated. The body tries to reduce this fear by being desensitized. This is why people emotionally eat. This is why people drink. This is why people compulsively shop. This is why people binge Netflix. The mind and the body try to shut out the scale of fear because it is painful and unbearable. I am unsure whether anything actually gets rid of this fear or reduces the scale. I have a gut feeling that the only way to cope with it is to have extra courage. Living with CPTSD just normal living requires a huge amount of persistent, beautiful, COURAGE. "

Im lucky enough to have coworkers who do actually like and respect me and Ive made a ton of progress opening up in the last semester, but yeah.

I still read here but for the most part see my kind of active day-day cptsd as a thing of the past (as much as it ever truly is) following lots and lots of ""work"" on it. Cut to a few weeks ago. Met someone quite by chance who stands out from the usual like a diamond in a gravel parking lot. Two dates and, total surprise, great chemistry and, well, I seem to just really really like her. Now I know that it will likely come as no surprise but that kind of normal uncertainty when dating (does she like me back quite as much and etc) has activated a shit ton of old feelings and a kind of hypervigilance to betrayal and etc. I'm sort of keeping this to myself and just watching my mind and living with it, trusting it will pass. But then today it kind of struck me - I am very used to calming down big feelings - ie xyz feels very threatening but *rationally* I know it's not and so I see that big feeling is actually related to other times and places etc. But I feel kind of confused or caught off guard right now because I am having some genuine big feelings in the here and now and they definitely bring some normal healthy vulnerability and fear with them. But, well, its just in the here and now. For all this is a bit muddled, does anyone know what I am talking about here? How to relate to healthy feelings that both trigger the memory of bad times but are, themselves, in this here and now, perfectly safe in the adult sense?

It seems on the surface that everyones got it down. People get in relationships, make friends, settle down. Ive always struggled to fully connect with others, not that I dont care about them (hell sometimes I love way too much), but there seems to be a part of me thats chronically lost inside somewhere and nothing and nobody can reach it. Everything feels so fragile and temporary, and I seem to be always missing someone or saying goodbye. Its very hard for me to get to know people very deeply, in the sense that theres so much of me thats hidden away (not even deliberately), that it takes a ton of time and vulnerability for love and trust to grow. Sometimes years. And its as if nobody else finds it nearly as hard as I do. For some time I thought my trauma played a decent part in it. Maybe it does. Maybe this will heal over time. Then again maybe its just part of growing up. People in relationships are lonely because of a lack of friends, people with lots of friends are lonely because theyre single, there always seems to be something, not in a cynical way but in a, do I just have to accept this as a fact of life?

I don't really know anyone here, and while I feel lonely as hell, I'm not interested in trying to make friends. I feel confused and disgusted with myself. Nothing brings me pleasure and my life and life in general feel sort of unreal. My job is actually in the trauma/behavioral health field (not directly with people, on the social service end), and the irony of working in this field and desperately needing to get help for my own trauma is not healthy. It feels duplicitous, and is another area where what I present to the world and my actual lived truth is a massive gulf apart. And I've known on some level for a while that I pursued this job because I wanted to learn more about trauma for my own ends, not to help other people, and also because I've been directionless for so long that trauma has filled the void of other interests or goals. I also carry a deep-seated sense that I'm entitled a ""prestigious"" position in life, that I should be in grad school or a writer, and if I'm not doing something ""worthwhile"" I'm a loser. I realize this is not helpful or true, and I don't necessarily apply this to other people, but it's very ingrained in my thinking. And the truth is I haven't developed any real skill sets, and I'm so depressed I'm not capable of much. I don't feel like I've grown much in the last decade. I feel like whatever talents I possess have been dulled by neglect, negative coping, and long-term depression. &amp;#x200B; I have weekly phone sessions with my therapist from back home, and it's the one time each week I feel like I can talk at least somewhat honestly with another person. But it isn't a reciprocal relationship. I'm really not sure how to have a genuine connection or relationship with another person. My ego and sense of sense feel so fragile, and I'm repelled by vulnerability, so I present a phony self. At the same time, I don't feel interested in other people, and I feel like my indifference and disconnection has underpinned all of my other relationships. &amp;#x200B; My main fear for most of my life has been that I'm just like my father, who I've thought of as a sociopath/malignant narcissist for a long time. He was extremely psychologically abusive growing up, toward my sister, mom, and I. Our whole family system was extremely sick and dysfunctional, and we were all abusive to each other, but he was very sadistic and manipulative. He would gaslight us constantly and was ""covertly incestuous"" toward my sister and I. My mom was incredibly unstable as well, and I've come to realize that a lot of her issues were due to the (probably complex) PTSD resulting from my father's sadistic abuse and her legitimate fears about him harming her and my sister and I. She was very neglectful, controlling, irrational, would fly into rages, especially toward my older sister, whose personality she would equate with my father's. She seemed to identify more with me, and would turn to me for babyish comfort after fights. My parents divorce was absolutely hellish. My mom got a restraining order against my dad- he would threaten to kill her in chilling, psychopathic ways, and they fought for custody over us in a drawn out process. My dad was extremely indulgent with my sister and I, we would go to the mall every weekend, see movies, watch hours of tv. He acted like a best friend, and we found him charismatic and entertaining. We hated my mom, and he encouraged it. My sister and I would form alliances, would cling to each other to protect ourselves, but that relationship was incredibly dysfunctional and abusive as well. Everything was just chaos and abuse all the time, with an intense sense of needing to keep everything secret. I responded to most of this by dissociating, through media and entertainment and just numbing myself. It makes a lot of sense, the way I tried to survive. But I've been doing this for so long, my capacity to love other people and feel empathy feels if not irreparably broken, inaccessible and atrophied. &amp;#x200B; I'm worried this is just who I am now. I'm worried I'm too numb to change, too indifferent. Too far gone. And I guess I am if I conclude that I am. &amp;#x200B; I think I need to quit my job, and move back to my home state. I have a friend who very generously said I can stay with her. But I feel like a liar and a monster, and I keep circling back to these feelings and beliefs. I've been taking steps to join a DBT skills group, which my therapist thinks could be helpful since I really lack the emotional regulation and coping skills necessary to do trauma processing work. My beliefs and neural pathways feel so entrenched and well-worn that I think a more targeted intervention is really what I need. Maybe because I'm looking for a faster fix. I just feel fucking inhuman. The last big breakthrough I had was several years ago when I did mushrooms with a friend. I wish psilocybin, MDMA, ketamine, etc. treatments were more accessible. Or maybe that's just me outsourcing the real, difficult work I need to do to a fantasy. But I just feel so stuck and fundamentally disconnected from other people. I don't feel kind, I don't feel compassionate. I feel evil. I think having no social support system is really impeding moving forward, but I don't feel like I can connect. It feels like a goddamn paradox. &amp;#x200B; I would really appreciate hearing from anyone that has been in a similar place and hearing what your experience has been like, how you've approached your own healing when you've felt not only worthless, but like a horrible human being.

270,vulnerability,CPTSD,Shame and attraction towards authority figure possibly also battling CPTSD - feeling like I am re-traumatizing myself,1,9nuxdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/9nuxdc/shame_and_attraction_towards_authority_figure/,2018-10-14 03:16:00,"Hello group, I am new to reddit but have been a medium-time lurker in the past on this sub. Unrelated, but can you believe this user name wasn't taken yet? To my problem: the title says it. I have difficulties interacting with an important advisor of mine because from the beginning I felt like attraction got in the way. Instead of developing a small crush I am in limerence and have been for more than a year now. When in his presence and apart from it for days after I feel the grip of reality loosening up. I strongly suspect he is battling low self-esteem and some sort of trauma and is in recovery, all judging from the way he talks about himself negatively and then catches himself, or how he disengages in the middle of a conversation and spaces out. There are many little things adding up that make it seem that he is incredibly insecure despite being in a very high position career wise. In my quest of untangling the complicated emotions I have for him from his actual behavior I have diagnosed him in my mind with just about anything from ADHD to asperger's, but childhood developmental trauma is the one that's likely. When I met him for the very first time I instantly knew something was wrong. I am sure many of you know that feeling of threat and hypervigilance, or chemistry you get from some people - like you know them, 'know' that they are somehow trapped in themselves. Obviously I am aware that what I was feeling was what I WAS FEELING and in that moment I was already incredibly wary of my interaction with him. I felt like he was hiding something and his whole body language was incredibly ambiguous, nervous, closed-off yet his remarks delivered with a shy smile. Contradicting. I had many typical flashback symptoms in his presence and as I am writing this my hands are cold, my heart is racing etc. I am scared of him and what he can do to me, the power I feel he has over me. When I first met him, I immediately felt like I could help him, I felt an amazing pull, and the way he behaved made it seem to me *in my head* at the time that he felt that it too. In the past have caught him staring at me, seeming like wanting to say something, or staring at me and spacing out, or blushing when talking to me. We are always smiling at each other and his pupils are almost always dilated. The problem is I can't divide reality anymore from what is going on in my head. The way he looks at me makes it seem to me like he is afraid of me and simultanously wants to devour me. He could also be on meds. I have seen him also give other girls that soft eyed glimmering look he gives me, and they share apperance traits with me. Many pick up on his weird traits, and he is known to be 'strange', even in our creative field that attracts many individualists and strange people. I have issues with body dysmorphia, in that I look at pictures or video of myself and tell for instance my boyfriend, wow, I wish I could look like that girl, she is beautiful, and have a hard time believing that this person is me. I was bullied as a child for looking different (ethnic) and never had any positive experiences growing up regarding my appearance OR romance whatsoever in the outside world. Even though since my early adulthood I've had many, mostly positive experiences with love and am in a fulfilling, sexy if often turbulent long term relationship I still struggle with the concept that people might want to date me, or that someone might be attracted to me. I just now get around to the idea that people sometimes are actually intimidated by me, because I am pretty outgoing, always asking questions, talking fast, yet my insecurity probably shines through, as well. I am in a strong double bind in which I think, if I am actually beautiful, I have to make people comfortable, and if I am not beautiful I cannot act like I am thus inviting people to laugh at my self -involvement. I am aware this is disordered and useless thinking, but this advisor of mine acts like a trigger to my story of enmeshment with a traumatized parent figure and sole family. Usually when I feel something I can talk to friends, my partner about it. With this advisor figure it is difficult because everyone on our team is dependent on him in some way. We have often discussed his dismissive, contradicting behavior and the way he seeks constant re-assurance from us. The point of him making me uncomfortable and possibly I making him uncomfortable feels almost like on a #metoo level. He is also significantly older than many on our team yet still young in regards to the role he inhabits. Las year he kicked out somebody because he felt bullied, and noone stood up for the colleague, even though many of us agreed it was an incredibly uncomfortable and unfair arbitrary decision process. That way the advisor asserted his power and showed us his vulnerability in one swoop. I don't know who to talk to about it. With any other person I don't let these sexual feelings bubble until there is no turning back, I disclose them playfully, I feel like I have control over my sexual urges, and at least if the chemistry is very strong, I ACT ON THEM. With this advisor, the way he is responsible for us and at the same time treats us like his friends, it is impossible to talk to him. I feel like I am hurting him, and am scared of his dismissal. I would love to talk to somebody about this. I haven't disclosed to my therapist the extent of what I am feeling towards my advisor, even though last time I brought it up, I cried, and he remarked that this person re-awakens deep wounds from my failed attachment to my caregiver. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

For example, I stopped by my mother's house with my boyfriend to drop something off, and my mom triggered me a bit, and usually it's just upsetting and kinda ruins my mood for awhile, instead I felt those same emotions but stronger and actually started to cry for a second. Alternatively, I feel like those negative emotions didn't last as long. I feel like I cry around my boyfriend a lot more than I ever cry usually.

I now know without a doubt that she is a trustworthy person and am excited to explore where that relationship goes from here. On the other hand, it has been a tough week at work. I really like my boss, but lately the absurdity of the expectations placed on me has been wearing me down. Now that my anxiety is in check and I'm not trying to please everyone, people who once benefited from this at my expense, actively and passively, are starting to notice that they can't work me like a tap and get what they want on demand. We have some deadlines coming up and I'm finding myself unable to ante up to their level of ""seriousness"" and stress about all that. It's not that I don't care, I'm just not willing to run in five directions at once when provided with incomplete or ambiguous expectations. The ""worst thing that could happen"" doesn't scare me nearly as much as it did a few months ago. My fear/anxiety is no longer a reliable motivator and I feel really lost. It pisses me off that I'm just here feeling like a ""naughty kid"". It's like being taken back to when I was growing up, making honest mistakes that demanded my parents actually assume a mentoring role. Because they were never willing to put in a full effort, I always ended up with the passive rejection/disapproval and no corresponding guidance on what to do differently. The result was holding myself to unreasonable standards with no assurance of help and guidance. I'm beginning to see that for the laughable state of affairs it was/is and it's leaving me and my interpersonal relationships feeling like a fish out of water. \*\*Is this relatable to anyone?

The part that's been the most helpful for me is thinking about how vulnerability and trust happen together. We can't build trust with a person about being vulnerable, and that kind of blew my mind. I've been struggling with how to be vulnerable (so I can connect with people) without also having a huge amount of anxiety, and the ideas Brown lays put have helped demystify this for me. Other topics covered include shame, self love, and how to cultivate what Brown calls ""wholehearted living"". Her approach is definitely trauma informed, and I think she handled some really hard stuff with a lot of grace and clarity. Has anyone else listened to this?

I asked because of how often the doc would ask a question that I could not answer. Not because I wanted to break my amnesia. I wanted to answer her questions. Now I am remembering things that feel insurmountable and I only have this group and my fiance to vent. He's all out of spoons to offer for the night (he got me through the part that would have meant a 72 hour hold and is watching comedy) so hello friends. You don't have to talk about my stuff. I'm down to listen to yours if you don't have someone to get through this moment or feel like a scummy burden. I feel like a burden right now too. But I didn't kill myself tonight and I'm recommitting to the psych search so I'm stoned asf and allowing myself a mini controlled candy &amp; Netflix binge. "
276,vulnerability,CPTSD,A survivor therapist like Pete Walker?,1,9sd0iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/9sd0iu/a_survivor_therapist_like_pete_walker/,2018-10-30 00:19:44,"My current online counselor does a decent job of validating my feelings and the cost is reasonable. Recently though, she asked me for advice on whether I think she might be a manipulative mother, and her desire to compare my experience with my mother with her experience with her children is a red flag for me because it implies that she is not on my side and relates rather to my mother's experience - the person who is the primary perpetrator of my complex ptsd. I could switch to another counselor on the same website but I think it would be more of the same. The first one was far worse and had not ability to symphatize with me or validate my experience, so it was a relief to work with the current counselor who has been doing really well for about five months now. I think the piece she lacks is a similar experience that would give her insight to me. She knows about Pete Walker's book but did not personally have experience with c-ptsd. In a way that might be good, I dont want someone who is triggered by my pain. But when I read Pete Walker's book, I see his level of insight and think how great it would be to work with him. I feel like I am at a crossroads. If at this stage of my experience, if I can learn to experience relational trust and safe vulnerability, it might transform my life of isolation into one of connection. If I cannot, I am afraid it will be too late for me. As I am so frightened of almost everyone, achieving this first step with a counselor or therapist seems like the only way. But I need someone patient, who will always be unquestionably on my side."

The other day (after 2 years of seeing her) she mentioned how I end *every* *single* session first. Even if I'm crying and accessing really difficult memories and newly experiencing certain emotions, I simultaneously track the time; if we're at time I shut down my crying or whatever and say ""ok"" pull out my wallet, give her $20 and tell her to have a good day. &amp;#x200B; She pointed this out and asked me where I think it comes from. I think for me that comes from feeling that absolutely everyone in my life will abandon me (whether it's in the next minute or 15 years from now), so if I just run away first, they don't have the opportunity to do that. I feel like I took back some of that power that I *assume* they think they have over me because they are seeing me expressing any sort of vulnerability.

(for me, it's always keeping track of time in one way or another) Any with your therapist? Did more deeply analyzing those habits aid in your broader understanding of how you live and engage with c-PTSD? Did you think of/attempt to push against those habits after? &amp;#x200B; I'm just interested in hearing about other folks' experiences (if y'all have them??), what it's like for you to see it, and what you do or don't do with that knowledge after.

278,vulnerability,CPTSD,Do you think its possible to develop CPTSD as a result of multiple unrelated breaches of trust over time? Even if each incident on its own wasnt a huge trauma?,1,9v4rqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/9v4rqz/do_you_think_its_possible_to_develop_cptsd_as_a/,2018-11-08 10:44:11,"From age 10-12 I was bullied and ostracized from all of my peers at school by my best friend Sandra. I would consider this Trust Breach #1, and it definitely did affect me that someone I loved dearly was willing to be so cold in return. I dont recall much of this time period, beyond my factual awareness that I was being bullied, my desire to avoid school as much as possible, and my stress/frustration/anger/pain over not being able to escape or stop my bullys behavior. Shortly after the bullying stopped, I made a new best friend (Lola) and then I moved away. At this time I began experiencing mild depression and mild social anxiety. I had always been an outgoing, loud, confident person, but beginning at age 12/13 I became very deeply insecure and actually began experiencing panic attacks over social events like school presentations. Also continued to hate school. But all in all I still was trying to make friends and willing to trust them, my depression wasnt too severe, I didnt have sleep issues, didnt have physical pain, didnt have memory problems as far as Im aware, didnt dissociate as far as Im aware. Feel free to skip to the end of the Trust Breach list if you dont particularly care about the specifics of my situation. For those that want more context though: **Trust Breach #2 (age 12/13, grade 7):** New closest friend in current town (Angel) repeatedly abandons/ignores me if I do something she deems annoying or embarassing or undesireable, or sometimes just because she thinks its funny. I start to feel more cautious, insecure, and mistrustful. **Trust Breach #3 (age 13, grade 8):** Make another close friend outside of Angels circle (Vee). As I grow closer to her, she begins telling peers secrets and embarassing stories I confided in her, and also begins making bitchy joking comments about me to my face in front of our peers. I feel like Im with my original bully all over again, helpless, weak, hurt, betrayed. I bail out of my and Vees friendship very quickly, and resolve not to let my guard down so easily with new friends in the future. **Trust Breach #4 (age 13, end of grade 8):** Go visit old town to hang out with Lola, as I had been doing every few months for the past two years. Lola stops answering my messages when Im halfway there. Upon arriving at her house I find out from her mom that shes actually at a party with our old classmates for the night. I wind up going to the party, as I have nowhere else to stay and Im close friends with the host, Amy. Lola ignores me all night. **Trust Breach #5 (age 14, grade 9):** Attempt to visit Lola again. She stops answering when Im on my way again. I call her home and her mother informs me that she is with Amy for a sleepover and never mentioned that I was coming. I call Amy and explain the situation/lightly confront Lola on speakerphone. She apologizes, but neither one invites me over, and it is evident they dont want me to come. After I get off the phone I experience all of the thoughts and feelings I used to have after an encounter with Sandra. I am distraught, cannot stop crying, then aggressively cold and numb. I start to firmly believe that any kind of trust will lead to pain. **Trust Breach #6 (age 14, grade 9):** A month or two later, Lola blocks me on all social media after I asked her what was going on with our friendship and what I could do to make things right. I feel as though something inside of me has been fundamentally broken. Another flashback to all of my emotions with Sandra, but also now with Angel and Vee and Amy thrown in too. I am certain that any sort of vulnerability with others is too dangerous to pursue. After that last incident I became increasingly depressed, isolated, insecure, anxiety ridden, and mistrustful. I stopped attempting to talk about my real feelings with anyone, and instead focused on presenting a happy, perfect version of myself to friends and family. I developed extremely low self-esteem, self-harmed with increasing frequency, and began experiencing chronic anxiety in social situations. My body became hypersensitive to pressure, to the point that wearing any form of strap from a bra or bag would be excruciating. It began taking me 3-4 hours minimum of tossing and turning before I could fall asleep, and no matter how long I stayed asleep I still felt exhausted. At school I began to constantly analyze my peers body language, tone of voice, life history, etc so that I could feel like I could predict and was completely prepared for how they might behave towards me at any given moment. I became much more prone to episodes of depersonalization, these episodes started lasting longer and longer, and they occurred in response to many more triggers than ever before. I also became more prone to emotional flashbacks to my mindset after times when Sandra bullied me, and I was consumed with self-loathing, guilt, and helplessless. I could no longer remember specifics of Sandras bullying, or much of what happened before I moved at age 12. The thing is, I dont think I would have developed my CPTSD-like symptoms if only the bullying had occurred. I feel like I would have carried some emotional baggage due to it, but overall I would have moved on like I appeared to be capable of after it ended and when I first moved away. But I also think the bullying WAS the main reason I developed CPTSD symptoms. If the later trust breaches had all happened, but the bullying hadnt, I again think I might have carried some emotional baggage over them but ultimately not suffered any profound long term effects. It was the long-term exposure to someone I trusted hurting me and attacking my self-esteem that made all of the later breaches of trust so overwhelming and devastating, and that made me believe those later breaches were reason enough to stop trusting anyone. **So I want to ask your guys input.** Do you think a combination of unrelated events can be traumatic and cause CPTSD/PTSD, even though no event in the combo would have been traumatizing and/or caused CPTSD/PTSD to develop on their own? And do you think having your trust broken by many different close friends in a row is enough to traumatize someone, even though most of them didnt do anything that goes beyond normal behavior in childhood friendship?"

282,vulnerability,CPTSD,Just venting and putting this shit show of a life into perspective for myself,1,9lyvn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/9lyvn9/just_venting_and_putting_this_shit_show_of_a_life/,2018-10-07 06:44:33,"I think I may have finally narrowed down my *life situation* down to a few keywords. It started with **codependency** - with my mother. She was emotionally devoid due to her own mother (my grandmother) and grew up being her mother's codependent counterpart. ""I'll be the boy"" she once recalled a childhood sentiment of hers to me. Her family's financial poverty in rural, illiterate India, the cultural shame of a lack of a son in the household, an army dad (my grandfather) who shielded himself with the requirements of his job and used it as a self-serving excuse to stay away from his cold, hardened wife, and *her* daughters, all led to my mother being raised in a household with much emotional abuse, neglect and disregard. When I was born, she hung on to me tightly. By the virtue of having a penis, I broke the long draught of a male heir in my mother's life. She had given birth to two daughters previously, one died from medical complications while still a 2.5 year-old toddler, and the other was sent away for 7 years to live my uncle and aunt because my empty mother couldn't juggle all of life's demands for herself. But I was kept close to her. What I represented was important to her. It had been her whole life in the making. But as a newborn, I wanted attention, and love, and emotional connection. Unable to meet these needs for herself, my mother offered disdain and rejection in return instead. She may have even felt jealousy and anger - how dare a puny little thing remind her of her own subconscious failings, and want something she couldn't have for herself. As an infant baby, I was heartbroken by this rejection coming from my primary caregiver. At the same time, I was overwhelmed by the sadness and despair of emotional isolation. I retreated into myself. The brain/mind/ego kicked in to save the day. A false ego would step forward and have us pretend the emotional rejection, and abandonment and the resulting despair wasn't happening at all. Blinders were to be put on. A subconscious deal was struck. Part of the deal was handing over control over myself to the false ego to such an extent that the false ego's status couldn't be questioned. And there could be no backdoors to dethrone it from its place. After all, this would be the only shot at survival for a new infant, faced with an enormous battle and having no emotional guidance or connection to address it in a healthy manner. On the outside, my mother repeated her upbringing in her self-guidance in raising me. But also being empty and perhaps exhausted emotionally by this point, she necessitated that I become her codependent. I was to fill the role of her crutch, and only a crutch, and only *her* crutch. Seeing the objective of my survival being furthered in this scenario, the false ego went along. I, too, by now had developed a need for being a codependent myself. And that's how it went for years. Decades. Three of 'em in fact. The false ego metastasized into **narcissism**. Left to be trapped in a psychological box all by its lonesome. And having a very low ceiling for itself because of my codependent master's expectations. My mother herself was stuck at the emotional age of an early toddler, so needing to maintain her control over me, my emotional age was stunted to be even lower. *No matter what, it was important that the codependent master not be challenged, but still be flattered through a narcissistic mirroring.* Where was my dad all this time? He grew up in a full household of brothers and sisters. The youngest of 'em all, most family members had their turn in spoiling him to such an extent that he felt the best prospects for his future were to take up being an art major in college. Never mind doing something that might earn some money for an average farming family in rural India. He had the emotional space to pursue his own damn self. By the time he met my mother, she sensed an emotional vulnerability of normalcy in him and did her damndest to exploit it for herself and ensure some security for her future. Needing to maintain her control there as well, she wore him down into a slightly-less volatile codependency dynamic, and he willingly went along out of never having to take up a fight for himself before in his life. Three decades later, after getting off on the wrong start with my own marriage, I'm starting to stitch these concepts into one fabric of my ""life situation"". The codependency has been there all along. All the dynamics with different people, sullied by me needing to have the other person fill my emotional void. And the largest symptom of this root cause has been narcissism. I hesitate to say I am a full-blown narcissist (perhaps I was at one point and a lot development work has gone into addressing that) but I am still struggling with some narcissistic tendencies. The boredom, the restlessness, the lack of self-respect. What's made this symptom especially worse has been the covert nature of it. The false ego took quite a psychological and emotional beating from both the codependents in this dynamic, my mother and myself. My self-esteem has been so battered over the years that the false ego didn't much room to express itself externally. It just sat dormant for years, syphoning off energy from my deeply saddened self and catering to the unhealthy codependent ""bond"" between myself and my mother. This is where it's at after 32 years of going through the motions of living a life. Perhaps this will make way to actually start living a life."

A little background, I've been diagnosed with Complex Ptsd after another traumatic event occurred. I've been in the cycle of abuse and trauma since childhood but I'm working so hard to break this cycle. Leading up to this event I was binge drinking heavily and felt as though I had no future to look forward to. I was on the verge of suicide, and was destroying myself until I could end it all. During this event I was black out drunk and only remember bits and pieces. I'm a recovering alcoholic, and am proud of myself for not having a black out since March. After this event I went into remedy mode. The person who assaulted me was a coworker, we had been at a company event. Other coworkers were there and my boss remarked on how drunk I was. My husband wasn't there as he was running a dnd campaign. And I had never gotten that drunk without him there. I felt as though I was used again. But I didn't want to jeopardize the job I loved so I tried to smooth things over with my coworker, who texted me early in the morning after it happened that he felt terrible for what happened. Unfortunately in me trying to make it better I made it worse, (story of my life) he felt as though he could ask for more. And the entire time I'm in shock, denial, and angry and hurt and I just wanted to make it go away. That it happened again, by someone who must have picked up on my vulnerability and would regularly sexually harasse me. My therapist called it grooming and that word just makes me shiver. Like I could be that easily manipulated. Not that surprising as my previous relationship to my husband I was abusive and controlling. It bothered me, but I can't do conflict so I just smiled and tried to make light of it. But this time it was different, I didn't think anyone would hurt me while I was so drunk since that's such a risky thing for someone to do. Performing sexual acts on someone who isn't in a right state of mind. I know this happens a lot, it happened to my husband before we met. His friend got him drunk for the purpose of sleeping with him and it's just another thing in our society that should be talked about openly. He was sober enough to drive, the assault happened in his car which I thought he was taking me home. I'm not trying to blame the alcohol, I guess I don't want to blame anyone or anything. Because it was my greatest opportunity to punish myself, and I'm ""great"" at self loathing and putting myself in dangerous situations. Usually I don't realize it until it's too late. After this happened in didn't take long for it to come out. My friend who I had recently helped gain employment at this establishment was there that night. And told my husband what she saw. I was heartbroken of course but I didn't blame her. I was ready to be labeled the cheater and villian. I was ready to end it and this was the time to do it. While everyone hated me for hurting my husband. I got everything ready but then I thought of my husband. And how I couldnt leave that scar on him. So I got help. This all happened over a year ago. We both have learned a ton about complex ptsd and how it all makes sense to me now. Why I behave and feel the way I do sometimes. How my past was so painful that I never spoke about it, and over the year bit by bit more of the story is revealed and it's really a tender time. So my husband's family has learned more about me and my past then I'd like. I'm an extremely private person and it bothers me to no end having my skeletons out in the open. But for the most part they have been supportive and understanding. So it was a real shock when in response to a text that I sent to his sister about how I loose control of myself when I reach a certain point when I drink, that I got three long texts about how I cheated and I should just not drink. (possible cure for alcoholism? just don't drink. all those wasted hours at AA when it's so simple) That I play the victim and that I'm bullshiting everyone. She saw the text exchange that happened between myself and my coworker. Because I didn't want to hide anything and I wanted to own up to my mistakes. And now in that attempt to be forthcoming they are being used to hurt me and remind me of that low point in my life. Anyways I feel like this set me back on some progress I was making. Particularly in the self doubting aspect of my traumas. My husband as been to multiple sessions with me including my psychiatrist who warned me of the effects of drinking on my medication. (effexor which can cause frequent black outs) She says she doesn't want me to drink right now, and I'm trying really hard not to. Sometimes it feels like the only thing that helps. Though I am making lots of improvements and have learned a ton from my AA meetings. My husband having learned with me through this experience has reasured me time and time again that he doesn't feel like I betrayed him. He even told his family this and yet I'm still doubting myself. I want to hurt myself so much sometimes that it's scary, and I mean hurt not just physically but emotionally too. So we are both hurt, angry and confused. She said I need to own up to it and I don't know how else to. I've been going to therepy, AA and couples counseling. What more am I supposed to do to own up to it? Beg and plead for forgiveness? How can I own up to something if everyone on my counseling/support team and groups doesn't think I was in the wrong. I'm so confused and it sucks that it took a couple texts from someone to undo all the work I've done with my self doubt. I just feel like it was another kick when I was already down. It's exhausting and I don't know how to confront her. Or if I even should, that voice in my head is screaming that she's right. That I'm an awful person, that Im a victim and I don't deserve any good things. I know this isn't true, just how it feels. Neither my husband or myself have responded to her. Sorry for the long post, I guess I just needed to let it out. We are going to be okay, my husband and I are resiliant people by nature. He's feeling just as frustrated and I wish I didn't cause such division. I've never wanted to create conflict. That's why I'm always willing to be walked all over. Conflict is terrifying to me as it only leads to pain. Learned lesson from childhood that seems impossible to shake. Thanks again everyone, I hope you all have a lovely rest of your weekend. Apologies again for the long post! "

So for me I've been really struggling not having someone to hold me when I go through emotional flashbacks and I feel like I need nurturance, to the point where I can be self destructive and ignore abusive patterns in people just so I can have a sliver of affection. I'm taking a break from dating and all that until I feel comfortable being able to express my needs without fear and being able to be comfortable enforcing my boundaries. I even asked a friend if he'd be comfortable holding me sometimes because I've been struggling with my PTSD and have been reaching for the wrong people. I was so happy because my friend has been super supportive and has dated people with PTSD before and has no problem holding me and told me that if I'm ever struggling to feel free to call him. However, I'm really struggling to reach out and accept his kindness. I think about calling him but I end up chickening out and I really want him to hold me but at the same time the vulnerability scares me, even though he's one of the nicest guys I know and I feel comfortable around him.

Facing it, accepting that it happened, sitting in those spaces and doing a LOT of work. A friend of mine had a birthday celebration this past weekend at the beach(one of my most emotionally tranquil places), and we got to talking about a mutual friend of ours who is entitled, and uses his trauma to manipulate people. This, of course, led to me sharing my experience and what I was going through, and how it's messed up that he would do that, etc. I dove into a few specifics, and then - boom. Suddenly, I'm digging my toes and fingers into the sand, and I can hear their voices separate from me. ""Is she ok? She isn't there anymore. (My name), who am I talking to now? It isn't you."" She's empathic, and very in tune with energy and all of that. I just remember looking at her, and saying nothing, smiling and putting sand in her hands. She works with kids in pre-k, and was very calm and went along with it. ""Oh, thank you."" She would say, as I piled more sand in her palm. My wife, who was right beside me, said, ""I'm actually really surprised, and glad that she's doing this in front of people."" And I tuned out. I know she went on to explain, but I was just in this weird space. Then, I blacked out up until I had apparently thrown myself in the water, curled up in a ball and was letting the ocean toss me around. I guess my wife had a few scares, where I was wandering out too deep into the ocean, and she had to call out to me. She cried about it, saying she thought she'd lose me. I don't recall much. I can see her face when I think back to these moments, but mentally, I have no idea where I was. She invited me to swim nude with her, once everybody had left and I was calm. I agreed, and this guy came over from down the beach, stripped, and asked us, ""how's the water?"" I immediately got vibes from him and put my clothes back on. As we did, so did he. My wife and I got to our car, and he was parked directly next to us. She had forgotten something on the beach, and went back to get it. He, of course, got out of his car and approached me. I had already grabbed a bamboo stick and was aggressively beating the ground with it, as he asked where we were from and what we were doing that night. As soon as my wife returned, he retreated. It is honestly baffling to me how quickly predators sense your vulnerability. Anyway, I am laying in bed this morning after R&amp;R from the whole situation, trying to work through if this is progress or not. Just wanted to share. This is my first time being aware of my regression. "

Anyways after the last couple of EMDR sessions Ive accessed some emotion on my own!!! Finally worked my way up to a full-blown meltdown in the car about a week ago after feeling triggered. Which was ugly and not very safe but it felt SO cathartic. Now Im just overly sensitive and teeter on the edge at least once or twice every day. I still cant cry in therapy after nearly 2 years, but thats my next vulnerability goal :)"

I was feeling really isolated and shitty about it until I noticed that I've been seeing a bunch of posts here about people having to fire, leave, or otherwise find another therapist or counselor. Well, know that you're not alone in seeking out another trust-building relationship between therapist and client. It is a process of trial and error and vulnerability. But you are among others fighting to do the same. I want to wait a week or two before looking again to give myself some time to digest life. I purchased Pete Walker's *The Tao of Fully Feeling* after reading *From Surviving to Thriving* over a year ago. It's still one of my favorites. I might reread it. I'm tired, too, so remember it's okay to rest."

I have an intense fear of vulnerability and it makes dating difficult. My therapist said to me youre not fucked up enough that you cant do this - that you cant have this. Im having a hard time believing that because there are times when every fiber of my being says that it would be easier to detach because feeling vulnerable is hard and unsafe and its so uncomfortable. But he is the one person I feel safe enough to be wholeheartedly genuine with and I really dont want to lose what we have. I just need some encouragement or success stories or even a Ive been there and it gets better. Because I need to know that it will be okay.
290,vulnerability,CPTSD,Having a rough day.,4,918qtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/918qtq/having_a_rough_day/,2018-07-24 02:53:31,It started yesterday.. in the store with my mother the conversation went.. Me: Im cramping so bad. Mother: I have a headache. Me: You dont have to be combative every time I say something regardless of what it is you always say something to overshadow and minimize the emotions behind it. Mom: Im not in competition with you (some other shit she said that I blanked off on) Me: what? No one said you were in competition but you always do that I say one thing you say oh well me too now its not such a big deal. Mom:Thats a personal problem you need to stop putting that off on me thats just your perspective. Me: What? (Look of utter disgust) how do you expect me to not think like that when youve been a certain way with me for years? Mom: Something in the fashion of her saying stop putting her in the past thats not who she is anymore or some bullshit. Now today Im talking to my SO about how that situation made me feel a way and he proceeds to say shes a narcissist which I said no she does have traits though. I proceed to explain to him my view of narcissism and the Ive read in a group for children with Narc Parents. I told he that she was very nurturing to me as a child then she married and got stressed out and became abusive to me thats when the shit started and that when she wasnt having an episode of bipolar abuse we were actually very close. He goes on to say what if it really wasnt and she is just comfortable what if what she was showing wasnt love..(now I dont take advice from him when it pertains to mothers as his is a shit mother that doesnt give a fuck about her children and he basically has adopted the I dont care Im emotionless Im just telling the truth I cant help that Im so blunt) he thinks that he just so above being emotional and that hes so chill but in real life he def has childhood issues he cant even show love completely. I digress...I got offended because I know for a fact that my mother and SO dont like each other theyre just both so fake they sometimes forget they act one way then with me its like they try to drop hints about each other how the other is a certain way its annoying and I always say like you dont have to like each other. After talking to him about it he says that he doesnt understand the relationship I have with my mother and he doesnt understand me being irritated by her presence and voice sometimes when I wake I cant see her and I live with her so he doesnt get it because he wakes up happy.. I asked him to change the conversation but he then says why why did I interrupt him and I said well can we just change the conversation what else can we talk about he said we have plenty to talk about like hey youre an asshole.. I hung up. He was hurting me with his insensitivity and I cant trust anyone with my vulnerability. Its made in front of my CPTSD is a joke and when I actually do have problem people seem to just dismiss them.

292,vulnerability,CPTSD,Freezing again - vent :(,3,92ovut,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/92ovut/freezing_again_vent/,2018-07-29 05:48:50,"I know recovery is slow, non linear, one step forward two back etc etc etc. I've even posted a few progress posts to remind myself, when am in a rut or going backwards I am now, that this too shall pass and be overcome. But crikey it does not help in the moment. It does not help at all. In the moment I feel worthless, crap, sick from eating too much shit (as distraction), useless, incompetent, wasted a day, can't even maintain progress or put into play what I've learned.a fucking useless load of unlovable ugly shit. Inner critic is hopping. I just want someone to whip me up in a great big blanket of care that I can't give myself. Inner child is cowering away in fright. Makes me feel horrible and an abuser myself as by freezing and withdrawing I am denying her wholly. And what is worse is that I saw/felt it coming and despite about 10% of my brain saying do x y z to properly deal with it I instead withdrew, froze, fled life. Trying to face it now. So...things contributing to emotional flashback. 1. My doc is away. Which I see as abandonment. On which I have serious issues. Rational me knows bullshit as he's given me his email and told me I can pop into the surgery anytime he's there but he's not there and fuck I wanted to see him in person. I told him via email that I had maternal transference (go figure) for him and although he responded most appropriately I want to see him to see it was all ok and also just to see him cause am agitated. He talks me down. 2. My therapist is on holiday. 2 weeks. Arrrgh. Second abandonment. Which again is rationally bull as she said I can email her when ever and how ever many times and she will respond when she has wifi as soon as she can. But I'm reluctant to contact her on holiday as I'm not that bad I dont think and unless the act if writing is soothing and I think am too far gone for that, she only responds in summary (entirely understandable) which helps but I want more. I am lucky to have that though. 3. I'm worried about my career - or lack off. Been ill for 10 months now and it has stalled and gone backwards and not sure if it is recoverable. Success at that was no doubt part of my issues but it is also a large part of my identity and fuck its gone into the dust. So that is a huge real failure right there. And failure is defo a trigger. My doc advised me to find a work mentor and tell him he is one! Am chickening out of that as scared, ashamed, again don't want to ask for help unless am in crisis? But had a work trigger on failure yesterday and it really would help to talk to him. But that is to show vulnerability, to lay myself open to hurt, being left alone to cope, to ask for something that I don't even know what it is. Better not to ask and stay safe and crap. 4. Am scared to go to a calming space where I can meditate this all out. This is the local surgery garden but I need to ask for access and sonetimes I get the horribleest people on reception that gatekeep and deny and have no sympathy only contempt. To be fair there have been nice ones but the fear of facing a horrid one is paralysing. So I don't go and have spiralled down all bloody day. 5. Am very scared of accessing inner child and taking care of her. The last time I did it I wanted to walk into the sea. It was painful, hard work, made me feel fragile, vulnerable (albeit ultimately better) so much so that I had to emergency write my doc and therapist from fucking holiday . It's like the pain of healing is too much to revisit. This is it I think. There is a wall of resistance as I'm scared. The feelings/emotions are too much esp as I know neither therapist nor doc are around. The wall is there like a living thing that is saying no no no I won't let you around. As I bang on it to access inner me on the other side. Originally I had the wall as a horrible mua ha ha ha kind of evil monster. Then I remembered some advice I got from this board that the inner critic is me just trying to do its best as it sees fit. It 'knows' me and overwhelming emotion and abandonment and the pain of letting people down or not living up to them or making myself worthy enough for love through failure is or has been unendurable so it's protecting me from that. So now I have the wall just as a more plaintive goleem type character - means well but its mind has gotten worpped. Anyway, I sigh and I realise that this is it. I need to sit and feel the emotions of abandonment x 2, failure and fear of contempt. But my dog is now whining - sat out here without a walk for too long ... another avoidance tactic?! I don't know how to get over that scaredness of being in the horrible place I was last week. FML. I guess that will be a second post. Over and out. "

The internet is a new frontier and we don't fully understand it's effects on people. the behavioral sink and over stimulation of having the world at someone's fingertips is truly terrifying. as it exposes one to new vulnerabilities and streams of pervasive abuse by strangers. Strangers who in a different age we would never even have known. This is an overlooked subject imo and needs to be given greater seriousness. as CPTSD develops from perceptions of vulnerability and the internet is for many a safe space so when that is infiltrated it can truly lead to personality and mental breakdown.

I feel I spent all my life never really thinking the things I experienced were that bad...or if I knew it was bad, I didn't push it in people's faces....and not because I was afraid to. Meanwhile, I carried all the trauma symptoms with me, affected but not aware of the roots. Now that I got past my resistance to the word ""trauma"" which was thrust upon me, I can see how deeply damaged I was with the experiences. Now, it's like I'm starting to see that things were very bad, based on other people's perceptions, and it seems to awaken this grieving within myself....as if I knew it was bad underneath the surface and didn't know I was allowed to think it so. Even after I started seeing the reality, I came in touch with someone telling me that I'm not the only one with hardships. What's worse, is that this came from someone that I hurt for upon learning of their own hardships. For some odd reason, most of the people I've dated were sexually abused as children (not aware in beginning). I haven't been sexually abused, but I always felt so sad for them....and a lot of them seemed to be anti-weakness and anti-vulnerability. What's interesting is that I deeply related to these people, on a visceral level. We had many of the same attributes. Like we were the same blood."
295,vulnerability,CPTSD,How can I learn to feel intimacy?,6,8tjwwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/8tjwwn/how_can_i_learn_to_feel_intimacy/,2018-06-25 04:48:47,"Reading the books recommended here, I've found some answers, but I keep raising new questions. I previously wrote about difficulties with sexual intimacy. I wrote about how I feel like I can't feel anything during sexual encounters. I described it here: URL People with healthy sexuality write about how amazing sex feels. They talk about how it's such an explosively pleasurable experience physically and emotionally. They talk about how they experience intense feelings of intimacy and vulnerability. To relate to me, just imagine an intimate nude embrace, gazing into your lover's eyes, raw excitement and pleasure flooding your mind as you anticipate what comes next... and imagine that instead, you feel nothing, or just a tiny part of it. I feel a profound sadness contemplating that this satisfying experience may elude me for the rest of my life, that I am missing out on one of the most satisfying bonding experiences that others take for granted. Growing up, I remember being indoctrinated with the idea that feeling is bad, that strong emotions are bad. I felt like I couldn't talk to anyone about my emotions; that they were a sign that something was wrong with me or that that I was weak, or that my emotions were simply too squishy, gross, and embarrassing to talk about. Then again, I always seemed to be made to think something was wrong with me. I was more or less forced to turn inward. I was walking around psychically holding myself in a fetal position. To make matters worse, I spent years in a ""Christian"" school where I was indoctrinated with all manner of negative attitudes and hangups about sexuality. Flash-forward to today, and I feel constantly checked out and dissociated, and I have the problems with sexual intimacy described above. Even in day-to-day mundane life, I feel like the feelings of pleasure, satisfaction, and job, are rather muted compared to how I imagine a ""normal"" person experiences life. I just don't know what to do about it. I feel like I'm making progress dealing with my ""inner critic"" and ""emotional flashbacks"", and I'm grateful for that, but I still feel like it seems doubtful that I can ever experience rue happiness, joy, satisfaction, or God-forbid, sexual intimacy. Where can I look for answers? What can I do about this? I feel like I'm just turning stoic here trying to survive from day to day without going crazy missing what I wish for."

He asked me the previous session if I knew of someone in fantasy or fiction that I felt an empathic bond with. I picked uncle Iroh and Zuko from avatar the last airbender. For those that don't know uncle Iroh follows his nephew Zuko around. He's patient, lighthearted, protective when he needs to be and always offers advice kindly and gently. Zuko on the other hand is a tragic character, trying so hard to redeem himself in the eyes of his messed up family. He shuns the kindness of his uncle until the end of the show where there's a touching scene of forgiveness and unconditional love. Zuko is terrified he'll be punished but his uncle just holds him close and cries with him. I identify with Zuko, the scarred and burned boy who meant well but was beaten into what his family demanded of him. I felt that unconditional love for myself for the first time last session. I cried in the car on the way home. He didn't want or demand from Zuko, he waited for Zuko to come back and welcomed him with acceptance. I did feel that feeling of vulnerability and acceptance fade into a coping mode later which was a bit disheartening though. Has anyone else had something similar, either the embracing of the burned hurt vulnerable self or the fading of that feeling? Is this something that will get better with more sessions? "

Realistically, it is very difficult for anyone who hasn't had a series of extreme life experiences to relate to my experience of the world, and the devastation that follows having to cut ties with all family in order to live a better life. It is difficult for anyone to understand agoraphobia, and doctors are afraid when they face their own limitations. It must be a very terrible position to be in to dedicate years of study to something and then realize there is not so much you can do when all a patient needs is consistency and empathy and to be allowed a high degree of self-determination. That's my perception of the situation, and I have a feeling it's fairly accurate. What is not good is shaming myself for having such an unusual life story that it's simply too much for many people. I cannot change my life story, and I cannot expect any kind of treatment if I am not honest. Honesty so far has not brought good treatment, but surely hiding aspects of my experience as a child and now, as an adult, would be worse. Surely. So I am writing this because I know my feelings here will be understood by at least one person, if not more. All I need is empathy and I have found so much of that here. Sharing helps my shame, and being vulnerable enough to type this out here will help me not to shame myself into severe anxiety and dissociation. So, that's that. Unedited in any way, because not censoring myself whenever it's possible is the best medicine for me, personally. These words - sharing them - will be some of the best self-help I can give myself today. Thank you. No reply needed, but any replies will be happily accepted if there's anything anyone would like to say. "

Basically I cannot just sit down and say I need help because I am suicidal. But I did today. It was brushed off as day to day stressors, and a low day. This has not been a low day and the only reason I brought it up today was because I do not feel ok. That cry for help was ignored.

300,vulnerability,CPTSD,Anyone with any experience changing their name?,2,8ln3m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/8ln3m7/anyone_with_any_experience_changing_their_name/,2018-05-24 07:25:24,"Sorry for the wall of text, but I need to get this off my chest and I want to be as clear as possible. I'm very open to advice and suggestions on how to better protect myself in the future, as well as any advice for changing a name/identity. I left my abusers years and years ago, but I broke down last year completely after years of therapy, overworking and the worst breakup, loss of most of my friends, loss of my best therapist; I couldn't work, nearly ended up homeless, ended up in hospital after a suicide attempt. I fortunately had made a friend 8 months prior to me losing my flat who had the means to take me in, which meant moving to a new town and trying to repair there, leaving my old sense of self behind. I've definitely made some significant progress though I'm struggling immensely \- can't work, or socialise outside of my flatmates and a couple of friends over the phone but managed to work up to doing more chores, feeding myself better and more frequently, tried a new therapist that didn't work out, slowly budgeting my benefits, hygiene improved, making goals and plans to enter the community to build some healing relationships, and continue to work on triggers until I'm stable enough to work and move on. The problem I've had was two pronged: firstly my abusers are my parents and the rest of my family were mostly in the dark about the abuse. I tried opening up to an uncle and his partner, which lead to me being verbally and emotionally attacked and abandoned, and my privacy leaked to my dad. This was after being told everything was fine with one cousin who's a controlling rageaholic and another who's in her teens and suffering from anorexia \- they claim they are happy with their lives as they are. I was gaslit when I honestly and vulnerably confronted them on exposing me to my father and talking to me about his life as they understood that was my big boundary and told me ""It would ust be nice for me to know how he's doing since we don't talk. That's all"". This was after explaining my father had beaten me for being raped as a 16 yr old and triggering my chronic fatigue and the worst parts of my cPTSD which I have struggled with ever since. This is only of many stories and examples I shared with them. The consequence of this is I've decided they are fairweather/toxic family and they aren't worth keeping in contact with and they were the last family I had any hope of having a healthy relationship with. The second prong is my flatmate's family, we'll call him Erl. He has family issues of his own relating to some narcissistic abuse and physical, alcoholic abuse from his mother. He was taken out of her custody as she sometimes abandoned him for days for drink binges. She died in a carcrash when he was 9 after drinking heavily with his baby brother in the back. He luckily survived. His father then passed away almost exactly a year later in a work related accident, which was far harder for him as he had a very strong bond with his father. His grandmother adopted him after his passing and they had an odd, partly lovely, partly abusive relationship. They were very close, but she had a tendency for controlling behaviour, flipping out over minor things like flicking on a lightbulb etc. and various gaslighting, minimising/invalidating behaviours whenever she did something wrong. Because of the extensive pain of his parents loss, the intense tidal currents of his grandmother and the big age difference, in zone out into video games and he was left to his own devices most of the time. He essentially desolved his sense of self into gaming, whilst shifting like a chameleon to whoever he shared time with, avoiding anything or anyone that caused him pain or difficulty. As a consequence, he's very underdeveloped as an adult. Whilst he most certainly has some symptoms of cPTSD, he doesn't suffer from nightmares or anxiety at all. He has big issues learning new things that are emotionally challenging because he's a hide and wait till it blows over type. Since meeting me, he has begun therapy, had a short breakdown, quit video games, changed the dynamics of his friendships, started reading new things, changed his work to a new place that's less stressful for him with better pay and begun meditating and working on his emotional issues. Under extensive encouragement, he began being more honest and open with his family members, who for the most part he avoided like the plague and lying through his teeth when he did meet them because he didn't want to be bothered. Throughout this, I avoided meeting his family because he had a lot of work to do with building those relationships on his terms and I know from experience that as the new and strange variable, I will get the blame for anything they don't like. Low and behold, him opening up about his mother's abuse and drinking \- all of which must have already been known, there are public records on it \- and his grandmother's outbursts and controlling threats and that the effect they had had, that Erl was still struggling to deal with the effects and because he had had to hide it from the family, it had caused him to withdraw from him. That if they wanted to have him close, they needed to hear his truth and bear with him as he sorted through his own stuff on it, but he wanted to keep them in on the loop if they respected his boundaries on what was too much at that time. Some members took this much better than others, the split being clearly between his father's family and his mother's. His father's family seemed to be getting it, though a lot of this was new information for them and very shocking. They seemed open and loving and that hasn't changed. Unsurprisingly, his aunt \- his mother's sister \- lost it and stormed out and hasn't spoken to him since. Her partner was calmer but clearly took her side. His grandmother also denied any abuse from his mother, despite her taking custody of Erl whilst she was still alive because of the neglect \- the fact she lost her license for drink driving before her death probably didn't help either. Not long after, the aunt tried to add me on facebook, which I immediately guessed investigative action, not a friendly one. Erl's grandmother dodged him for 2 months afterwards, until she finally allowed him to see her yesterday. She blamed me for everything, saying I was brainwashing him and that if I was still in his life when she passed away, he would lose his inheritance. Now luckily for me, Erl isn't moved my money so there's no danger of me losing the roof over my head, but this was a very serious move against me because she wanted to deny responsibility for any wrongdoing she had done to Erl, framing the situation as black and white, I was evil, she was good. She could see what was happening despite only meeting me once \- and boy, did she like me when we met \- having never talked to me seriously about me or my life, and knowing I had no family because they had abused and abandoned me. This was the very reason I had kept my distance, I know the patterns, I know the cycles. She made it all or nothing, Erl had to choose me or the family, that if she had abused Erl that meant she had never done a thing for him; clearly not true. But none of that truly got under my skin. What did truly get under my skin was hearing after her and the aunt had got angry I hadn't accepted the false friend request, they had looked up my father \- my last name is unusual and relatively rare \- and contacted him to get ""his side of the story"". They revealed my location to him. They do not know the extent of the abuse, and it's unlikely he would come hurt me. But he does have the ability to. He now knows a part of what of my life is, struggling to recover in a small town, away from my work that I was so proud of, that I worked so hard for. This was after months of me pushing Erl to contact her and make things up. To give her a chance to understand his side of things, to build trust, to repair. She demanded he abandon me, whilst demanding he walk her down the aisle to marry the man he caught her fucking in the living\-room of his grandfather's house whilst his grandfather slept upstairs. She accused me of using him and manipulating him whilst threatening his family ties and inheritance if he stuck by me. She risked my safety to try and take advantage of my vulnerability of having no safe or loving family, so she could deny the horrors that Erl has had to go through, whilst stabbing me in the core about mine. I fought for Erl to have a connection with her because I saw a real potential for a loving relationship beyond pain if they both sat down enough and talked it out. I simply feel violated and abused again. Erl's beyond livid, I think he might have lost his grandparent over this. I feel scared again, I feel violated again, I feel like I'm burning again. Clearly she's a bitch \- I hate the word, but she clearly is. She has a history of doing this \- the aunt had to chose between the family home to live in or elsewhere because one of her daughter's was ""having too many babies"". This daughter isn't allowed in the family home. She has had three children. The grandmother had two. Clearly this is the fault of some cruel, cowardly old woman who can't take responsibility and respect other people. But this is also because I have my last name. So to the main point of this post \- how safe would changing my name realistically make me? Does anyone here have any experience changing their name? How would I need to go about telling the people who are in my life but aren't super close or trusted about the change and how would I prevent others from being able to find my family or them find me? Any advice/experience/thoughts would be very much appreciated. TL;DR \- been no contact with abusers for years, working intensely to improve life, had friend's family freak out because he's growing and changing which they blame me for and they contacted my family to try and expose and attack me. Thinking of changing my name so this can never happen again. Advice very much wanted on how to protect myself from c\*\*\*s!"

I hate my life and so I am choosing to make it uncomfortable. I have used many distractions to avoid my troubling problems: video games, porn, food, school work. Yes, even school work was a huge addiction, an escapism (maybe I will date, maybe I will get a career, maybe I will have a non-abusive home). In fact, having a career and watching porn gave me the same hope-filled arousal built on an imaginary concept of escapism. I am 25 fucking years old. I was ""forced"" to go to college until I literally had a mental breakdown and started to fight everyone within a 5-foot radius. I tried to kill myself. I tried to end the suffering. I was addicted to grades because it felt like the better grade I got, the more the professor valued/cared for me. I was coping with my own vulnerability and lack of emotional awareness. I used their praise for my own misguided sense of self-worth and lack of a loving family structure. My home is hell. It is a hoarding bullshit filled with enabling and the worse kind of consumptionism. My parents have no friends. I have no friends. Naturally the only friends I really had growing up was my dad and my sister. I had a choice at a young age between school and my home. I normally picked my previous house: it had so many interactions. Lots of natural things to explore. And so I skipped school most of the time. My new home was infested, gutted, and left with piles of ""stuff"" that has just accumulated over the years. My mother has a spending problem. My mother has a communication problem. My mother is a bitch. And so school became my new narcissistic hell. The worse pain happened when I started to repeat the routines. There was a reason why groundhog day or Edge of Tomorrow are appealing to me: the level of control over one's situation grows with more situational and introspective awareness the more they repeat it. And so over the past years I have started to see all these routines starting and stopping. The enabling, the coping, the promise of hope. As soon as I see it starting, I start to melt the fuck down. I have been crying, screaming, and raging. Closing my eyes and ears and just screaming ""SHUT THE FUCK UP."" I am not normally violent. In fact, I went away on a trip for three whole weeks a few months ago. This was the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE AND MY PARENTS AND SCHOOL. I forgot all about the house, the emotions, the feeling of being entrapped, everything disappeared. Until I got back... When I was away I could think, I could read, I could process things 10 times quicker. My teachers said I had a learning disability, my parents wanted a fix, and I just felt trapped. I have been labeled ""aspergers"" by doctors but I think it is bullshit. My true label is CPTSD but that was skipped because during the performance evaluation, a significant amount of the information was told (like an interview) on MY MOTHER'S PERSPECTIVE. I froze up instead of hammering that point across everyone's head and slamming the results as biased. I froze up. It was one of the worst mistakes of my life. I do not know what to do again. I am freezing up. Again. Please help me not make a second mistake. Please. What can I do? "

She said at the end of the session that I was always manipulating her. I was hurt, angry, and devastated. The next day I sent her a text and told her that she has two options, either to see me today or tomorrow to try figure things out, and I wouldn't pay for the session. Or if she can't/wont/ didn't want to, then she could refund the sessions I'd prepaid for and we were done. We met the next day. I said to her that while I was sure she didn't want to hurt me as badly as she had, there was a part of her that wanted to hurt me, and I needed to know what it was so I could fix it. She said that it was because I had come in with anger, hate and blame, and that she should have processed this better. Later on she admitted that it was her own feelings of inadequacy that brought up anger and defensiveness, and she was projecting all of that onto me. I was just sitting there sobbing about my life. So I wasn't manipulating her at all, and she's just hurt me for nothing I've done. Her saying this has reinforced every negative belief about myself and others I hold. That people will hurt me if I show vulnerability. That people won't believe me about my childhood abuse &amp; rape. That I am evil and rotten on the inside and that is what causes people who would have been nice to treat me in awful ways. That I deserve to be hurt. I'm not sure how to process this to make sure it doesn't set me back years a long way in recovery. Argh. I can't believe I PAID someone to hurt me like this."

Something about being the only one old enough to realize ""this isn't ok"" really messed with my emotional development in a way that made me very hard to be close to. Totally correct me if you disagree. I don't mean to say that my interpretations are necessarily correct. I'd love to hear from other oldest children and any younger/youngest siblings... ........................................... *I can be very controlling, especially when I'm anxious. I've caught myself feeling guilty about things &amp; subconsciously ""getting angry first"" in order to maintain control of the situation. My siblings are way less offensive about this kind of stuff. *I often feel like I'm the only person in the world who can solve problems- whether or not it's my place to. Nobody else ""really understands"" what's wrong &amp; what ""should"" be done. My siblings often don't want to get involved. *Again re: control, most of my deepest worries &amp; anxieties are related to things I can't control (fear of aging, death of loved ones). Growing up, my sister &amp; brother never really got hung up on these things. I was obsessive about them. *True honest vulnerability is something I think I'm legitimately not capable of. I get the impression my siblings aren't this way. *I've always had a kind of ""somber"" energy as compared to my younger siblings. My sister looks a lot like me except that she ""looks like summer"" and I ""look like winter"" (someone once told me). *I rarely feel hurt (not at first, at least). My first instinct is always anger. My siblings were always described as sensitive in my house. I was always ""mean"". *I am way more direct &amp; blunt than my siblings. I say exactly what I perceive &amp; exactly how I feel. With lots of adjectives and metaphors. My siblings are much more to themselves. *I am a textbook oversharer. I want everybody to know where I've been, what I've done, how I think &amp; how I feel. My siblings keep to themselves. *I seem to hold grudges far more than my siblings do. I have also vilified my parents in a way that my siblings seem to have avoided doing. * My siblings seem to be WAY more comfortable in social situations than I was/am. They've always had more friends &amp; were relatively popular in high school. * It really bothers me when people don't follow rules or are given things they don't deserve. I often feel like I don't deserve anything that I have. Ironically, I am very easily upset by implications that I haven't worked for what I have."

This could be an oppurtuinity to take my power back. I havent sent the message. Im honestly scared to. Im scared he will become angry and try to hurt me again. Im scared to acknowledge with my cousin who raped me that this is a very real situation. Anyways, here is my response. Its long as hell, and i appreciate anyone who reads it, and any support, which truthfully i need. James out of respect for me I hope you read all of this. I dont know if you understand the depth of how and why that night hurt me. That period of my life left me extremely vulnerable. As you know, my life has had a lot of abuse and trauma. I believe I have told you that I was molested until I was 6 years old by my maternal cousin. My home situation was awful, and you were very supportive throughout my teenage years. We started becoming close when I was 12. You were supportive and protective of me, our family equated us to brother and sister, and you always talked about how we were blood and that bound us. Having had recently turned 18, I was put in a hard position where I had to move out from my mothers house because of how hard it was, and I was doing everything I could to take care of myself. I was finally an adult, I had put myself through therapy for 2 years, having started after my second sexual abuse when i was 15 and a half. I dont know if you remember, but I finally disclosed to you about that sexual abuse on November 17th when we last saw each other. I still remember the date. I was trying so hard to move on from bad relationships, bad choices, and bad memories. I was working so hard to finally move on, I was in control. Everything was my responsibility now, and no person in authority could harm me as a helpless child, because I wasnt a child anymore. I have always struggled with trusting people. I trusted you. I knew you had issues, but I did not think that you would ever actually harm me. I created distance when I did not want to be around your issues, but it was never because I felt unsafe. I still trusted that you wouldnt blatantly harm me or use me. I still remember a lot of the events on the 17th, even though I was probably more intoxicated than I ever had been in my life. I did not really understand why you refused to sleep at Andys. We argued for a good 15 minutes and you finally gave in and left, only to come back and insist we go, even though neither of us shouldve been driving. Instead of taking me back to my parents, we ended up at your apartment. Thats still fine, i thought maybe you just werent thinking clearly or didnt want to make the extra drive to get me home. I still very clearly remember you asking to do coke off of me. And i very clearly remember making it clear ""thats not okay, we are cousins, why would you ask that"". Can you imagine what it is like for me, who is not even close to clearminded, who has been sexually abused and abused in other ways, to have someone I trust blatantly turn around and prove that I couldnt? Can you imagine that sort of vulnerability, confusion, and fear that causes? Can you imagine what it feels like to have memories of going along with everything and hating every second of it and pretending you were the man I had been dating for months because I did not have the ability to say no more clearly? Because I was already beat down and unsuspecting and unprepared at 18 to scream Fuck No to my cousin who caught me off guard and asked to use me? So after all of this, after not being able to tell my family that ive been betrayed and hurt, and having to quietly take care of my life enough so I can move out and start school in two weeks, i felt finally truly broken. I had failed as an adult. I had previously fully subscribed to the idea that I finally had the control and resources to protect myself, and I failed. I failed and there were no more excuses. It was obvious to me that this would be my pattern in life. I will try so hard, day after day, to get better and learn to protect myself more and to be smarter, happier, and more capable, and as soon as I start to get the hang of it I will fail again and be victimised again. This betrayal affirmed my worst fear that my only path in life would to be hurt and used. I could never be free and content or happy. Even though I had been suicidal many times before, I never have been so prepared, ready, and welcoming of my own death before then. I was truly convinced that that was my only true and legitimate option. I had nothing left, because I failed myself and I hated myself for it. I do not know what forgiveness in this situation will look like. I do know that, most importantly, I will work towards forgiving myself. If i forgive you it will be secondary. I also know that I cannot hold any of your pain, nor can I relieve it. That is not my weight to hold. If you truly feel sorry, and if you truly feel regret, and you truly wish things were different, then the only way you can reconcile this, with yourself and with me, is to really look at who you are and change the part of you that was capable of putting me through that. Change and heal the parts of you that led you to that point and that mindset. And finally, after this we will not speak again because there is no reason to, and I do not wish to hear from you. "

I want to talk to him about it but I feel scared that he won't think I'm worth the trouble or think I'm making excuses there really isn't any reason for me to think he'd act this way but I'm so afraid. I haven't dated for a long time because I just didn't want to get left anymore and any attachment was a big risk for me.

Under my left nipple, this has been going on for more than 20yrs. I have a constant throbbing sensation, like a tumour of pain. Cesspit like! It throbs, not always. Sometimes I would feel like things were moving around inside this tumour of pain. When that used to happen I would feel terrified and like I was going mad! That would happen for days at a time. Thankfully I no longer feel terrified or like Im going mad. (Though I do still feel like things are moving around inside the pain tumour) But this pain under my nipple, pulsates, the sensations travel down my left side to my left foot, making me want to curl my toes. I feel it in my right heel, up the inside of my legs and then the pain sort of transmutes to sensations all under my skin. (Like Im being touched all over, but Im not sure thats what it is?) I was medicated for the last 2 1/2 yrs on codeine for chronic pain. For 4yrs before that I had a very blessed time at a place of Christian worship. When these sensations didnt seem to be so prominent. But since Ive stopped taking the codeine. They have come back with a vengeance. If the pain sensation under my nipple had a voice. It would be like Edvard Munchs the scream, a constant scream! And at times like a little whimpering child. Any thoughts on what it is? How to deal with it? Any help would be much appreciated. I think it could be toxic shame, or a kind of paralysing fear? Or emotional pain from my traumatic childhood. Or somehow locked memories in the form of sensations in my body. I notice it more when Im at home, lay on my bed. (Which I do a lot) There is an intense feeling of vulnerability and theres some helplessness too, associated with the pain. Thanks yall :) "
308,vulnerability,CPTSD,I'm realizing that the quality of my friendships isn't nearly as good as I thought it was.,9,7zb87n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/7zb87n/im_realizing_that_the_quality_of_my_friendships/,2018-02-22 13:03:27,"TW: Verbose and self-indulgent, also containing descriptions of reckless behaviours and substance use. Have any of you guys ever found yourself slowly waking up from a long-standing delusion about your life, and not being sure how to handle it? I think that's sort of happening to me right now. I'm starting to feel immense guilt writing this - guilt and shame are pretty much my knee-jerk reactions to feeling genuinely afraid. In this case, I'm afraid of what I'm liable to experience as a result of my mind waking up to a different reality. I want to take back control and make sure that I don't toe out of line - just in case I'm wrong, just in case I'm crazy, or it's just my BPD and I'm really being ridiculous for thinking I could be more confident, more successful, more loving, more loved, and more ME. I've had a modest, slow-building positive spiral this month, giving me some relief from cPTSD symptoms. The gist of it was/is, I started reclaiming all of the ""bad"" parts of myself that I had tried to push away during my ""recovery"" (a term which I am growing to hate more and more these days, but that's for another post). Pardon me if you don't believe in astrology, and try not to judge me for taking an interest in it (I'm actually a logic-y science type for the most part), but this month was my birthday month and I've always really resonated with the archetypes described in Aquarius - independence, free-spiritedness, non-conformism, imagination, philosophical nature, etc. For the past few Februaries, since beginning therapy, I've done a lot of reflecting on who I am, and it always sparks really amazing realizations and a boost in feelings of freedom and authenticity. I've been realizing that my perfectionism in ""recovery"" is actually leading me astray from my core self, not taking me closer to it. My experiences in 12-step programs and other ""recovery"" spaces have left me feeling gaslit, confused, panicked and dissociated (I've since moved on, and FYI, I respect and support anyone who has found healing in 12-step programs, so please don't believe that I'm attacking you). The way that I let myself become a blank slate in those rooms, thinking I was hopeless and that couldn't trust any of my thoughts or behaviours because I was an ""addict"", left me vulnerable to the undercurrents of indoctrination that probably take some people as victims, but not others. Some people have suffered severe gaslighting abuse or other forms of psychological mindfuckery, and that's the main source of their addictive behaviour. They have no core. There's complete and utter fragmentation. Their minds can become like putty with the right stimulus. They're great at reading people. They start to sniff out other people in the room, molding their mind into a new shape that maps the edges of whatever themes, real or apparent, that present themselves. And as they become more and more lost in the often contradictory rhetoric of others, they keep trying HARDER to ""succeed"" at the thing that got them lost in the first place. They don't ""let go"". That's what happened to me. Some suggest I didn't try hard enough, wasn't strong enough, wasn't willing enough. I say that I was wounded and needed to walk away. But the legacy of perfectionism continued, because the perfectionism of course began when I was a small child, not when I started going to the rooms. This month I had the fortune of discovering that I don't actually feel very positively about the friendships I have at the moment with people in my immediate town of residence (I am incredibly lucky to have a bunch of friends from high school that I am still close with, but they don't live here). This is a University town, where people come and go based on age bracket at regular intervals. I ended up here for school, then I left. Two years ago, addiction brought me back here where the rent is cheaper and there's a renowned psychologist who I have the privilege of seeing for DBT group therapy. Those who were my schoolmates had left, and relationships were scant. And like I was saying, I'm a perfectionist, always have been. I'm also an over-intellectualizer, and a hyper-processor. I'm not satisfied until I've created new problems to solve by writing up satisfying and plausible narratives in my mind, drawing myself into sure categories and making sure that all of the garbage in my head is stacked neatly if it can't be disposed of. Some might argue that I could be diagnosed with an obsessive compulsive disorder, wherein my obsessions and compulsions are mostly related to ""recovery"" and whether or not I'm performing it correctly. I'm going to reclaim this part of myself, too. Being a hyper-processor is a part of who I am. It helps me to be creative and imaginative. I can use it for good. And here's how it fucked up my relationships: I legitimately believed that I was a hot steaming pile of filthy garbage when I started in early ""recovery"" here in *University Town*. I was obsessed with my shortcomings and moral failings, stopped allowing myself to experience any fun or enjoyment in life whatsoever, and started hanging out with people who were acquaintances that I believed had hated my guts for years. Therefore, I thought anybody who would extend their companionship to me was doing so as one of the most altruistic favours that I could ever even dream for. No, I didn't become friends with anyone who walks all over me, puts me down, uses me, abuses me, or anything like that. I become friends with good-natured people who are flawed yet human, like me. People who terrified me because I legitimately thought they were Gods at first. For almost two years, I could not see a *single* thing wrong with any of my friendships, except for whatever I believed *I* was doing wrong to create walls, offend, hurt, or otherwise let down. I believed didn't deserve friends, I was sick and unhealthy and my BPD made me annoying and intense. In fact, I was toxic and it was going to infect everybody around me and that would make me an abuser. The best I could do was to take what offerings for companionship I was given, be grateful, yielding, and always kind, and then shut up and never complain. If something didn't feel good, it was just my BPD ass and I needed to forget about it and be more grateful and loving. I started learning about vulnerability in therapy, so I tried to logic that out too. I performed vulnerability the best I knew how. I said combinations of words and phrases that would illustrate openness. I executed carefully constructed demonstrations of self-revelation. Like an MRA with a Nice Guy complex, I thought that vulnerability was like a currency, promising intimacy and acceptance from those who I delivered the funds to. The perfectionism became about interpersonal effectiveness and spiritual purity. I became more rigid, trepidatious and insecure than I had ever been in my life, even when I was *really* fucking unwell. When I was a reckless youth snorting drugs, fucking strangers and skipping class, I was so lacking in self awareness that my ignorance made me more authentic than I was when I started *trying* to become self aware. It's like as soon as a person knows they're on a quest for self-knowledge, they just start picking up new disguises that are more clever and believable, you know? Those feelings of deep inferiority still aren't that far away. They're liable to return, hopefully not at full force, but I don't get to decide that. I need to make some changes to my life before that happens, because in all honesty I want to move on. My friends here are all suffering varying degrees of unwellness, some trying to stay sober and mostly succeeding, some relapsing constantly, and some just depressed and low a lot of the time. I'm ready to go out and try to live my best life. Things aren't perfect and I'll have plenty of setbacks, but right now, my compulsive need to constantly be around my friends when most of us are in ""survival"" mode is draining as fuck. I feel guilty categorizing my friends as draining people. Honestly, I'm sure some of them feel drained around me too, because I'm too easily prone to shame attacks in the presence of people who are unwell, and I respond by dissociating, which makes me come off as disingenuous and shallow. I also used to be heavily involved in the social justice world, and for a number of (traumatized, young) Gen Z and Millenial activists, it's considered ""solidarity"" to have weak emotional boundaries and to engage in codependent caretaking. ""We can't lean on the system, so we have to lean on each other"" kind of stuff. So, it's my decision how much of that stuff I want to buy into. I can't be blaming myself and engaging in martyrdom and weird, thinly-veiled repentance-seeking behaviour anymore. I really can't. I'm compulsive about 'relational health' to an extent that it's become entirely counterproductive and damaged. Don't I deserve to not be damaged? Is it wrong, is it selfish to feel damaged by relationships where it's no one's fault? Can I give myself permission now? It feels like the right time."
309,vulnerability,CPTSD,I think I understand how dangerous learned helplessness can be for me.,43,808rby,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/808rby/i_think_i_understand_how_dangerous_learned/,2018-02-26 11:14:49,"I am writing this from the point of view of my own experience with learned helplessness: I have been looking through my posts and realize that a lot of my feelings of hopelessness and incompetence are rooted in feelings of childhood abuse and mainly from being told the ways I wasn't good enough by my father (No duh). Simply put, while the abuse ended years ago, the feelings of helplessness still go strong and dominate my feelings toward my work and life. I read once on another subreddit that ""If you don't think you deserve love or a good life, you don't."" and what it meant to me was that when I feel like I do not deserve a good life, I made unconscious and conscious choices that moved me away from a good life. I didn't challenge myself to do the best in my classes, I didn't risk myself by putting myself out there for internships (save one or two occasions) and I most certainly didn't show vulnerability in expressing interest in people (save one time and it was a nice, but short lived relationship). I feel like George Costanza in a way, every time I have done the opposite of what my inner critic insisted was true, I see at least something that proves I am capable. When I believe I can do something, I am almost stupidly stubborn in trying to get it. The moment doubt enters my mind I waver, and find external reasons why I could not have attained my goal. What I believed was reasonable doubt that kept me away from delusional narcissism was in fact defeatism and learned helplessness. By believing I was incurable, hopeless, and had something 'wrong' with me, they had become true. It led me to give up early, to be uncomfortable in social gatherings (and I am sure it showed to others), and generally buy into the idea that A) If you aren't perfect you are worthless and B) Only narcissists and sociopaths get ahead in life. Albert Bandura's concept of self-efficacy was fascinating to me because it mentioned that those with high self-efficacy could fail, time and time again, and keep trying, eventually succeeding, whereas those with low measures of self-efficacy would give in when met with challenges or hurdles too high to overcome. It was almost entirely psychological. I realize that through my own mental blocks, I was low on self-efficacy, barely trying before giving up. I was participating in a ""defeat without struggle"" because it is far easier to believe it is impossible than to try and fail, again and again. So with learned helplessness, I can see it is a dire threat to my mental health. As a child I felt utterly powerless (and for the most part was utterly powerless) and it made me feel incompetent and at the mercy of things beyond my control. Learning about Sartre's existentialism grounded me in the understanding that while situations often arise beyond my control, I always have the ability to choose my goals and act within the bounds of the situation I find myself in. I am neither all-powerful, nor powerless. I can choose to lock myself into the diving bell of determinism, and believe my genetics are flawed, my childhood too broken, my self as unacceptable, and live at the mercy of chance. Or I can choose to break out of the diving bell and embrace the freedom I do have. I can live a more healthy lifestyle, I can assertively seek employment and internship opportunities, I can study for the standardized tests, and I can do research. None of it will be easy, and many times I will feel like I cannot do it, but if I give into the inner critic, I will instead fall into despair and begrudging acceptance. It was not my fault what happened to me as a kid. I just wanted my parents to be happy and to have a loving family, and for reasons out of my control it spiraled into dysfunction and abuse. But those days are long behind me. I am in my early 20s, and I succeeded in getting an undergraduate degree and entering a graduate program. My CPTSD is now my responsibility. If I want to experience love and a fulfilling career and life, it must be my own responsibility to seek them out and try for them. I am not owed anything by anyone, but I do feel I deserve good things, and so I must make choices that will bring me to what I deserve. Thank you to the kind people on here who put a lot of effort into making this a supportive community. It has helped ground me and teach me lessons about trauma and mental health. I am not cured, not yet. But at least I know how I can start making progress in recovery. I hope I can share results in the future. tl;dr: Learned helplessness has been crippling my ability to make good choices for myself and treating myself with compassion. I realize I need to believe in myself and have hope for the future to move forward in recovery and life. "

I guess a specific example. I want to be closer with this person I love in my life who's expressed before that they enjoy spending time with me and wanted to even more, but initially I kind of pushed them away. I have a knee jerk reaction to these things and I know I did it partially out of fear. Now I regret that because I do want them to be more a part of my life but it takes so much vulnerability to tell them that; to ask them, since it's putting me in the position of wanting/needing something from someone and I can't even draft a text without feeling so much fear and an automatic urge to stop and to feel bad. I even know they'll be okay with it but I feel so much doubt. This stretches to most of my life. I don't know how to be vulnerable. I don't know how to put myself in positions to want, where others have the power over me and I know it. "

Little bit down at the moment. For about 10yrs between the ages of 24-34 yrs. I used to have this maddening wriggling worm like sensation/feeling under my left nipple, that would come and go. Id had no idea what it was at the time. The pain of it was toxic dump like, it would reverberate through my whole body like a dull throbbing ache! Incessantly I would worry and be panicked about it. Constantly questioning what was it, with no answers coming! Well over the last few days Ive been having regular little Stephen time. 12am-12.30am, and for other half hour periods when Ive needed to. Because of this pain, and the internal fear that comes with it. Though having little Stephen time is good, something I havent consistently done beforehand. But have obviously been working towards. It seems to have opened a can of, worms. Do you get it? So Im a bit discouraged, at the moment. Though I can see all the progress thats been made to get to this point. But this wriggly worm sensation/feeling under my left nipple, in times past would last for days at a time and was/is exhausting to cope with. This is a feeling of high anxiety, nearly unbearable vulnerability, helplessness. An insatiable hunger for acceptance and protection. It is bloody emotionally and physically draining! Its like an Edvard Munch scream of existential pain! But going to little Stephen and soothing comforting him, is progress and should help, a lot. If this feeling/sensation continues for a long time, (years). Well Im much better placed to cope with it. Now. I have boundaries, Im not a people pleaser, Ive learned to be kind to myself. My mental health is much better. I dont have catastrophic thinking. I can ask for help. I have support from family and real friends. Im part of a, true historically biblical Christian fellowship and all the good that goes with that. Im stronger, having survived all the crap that went on in my childhood, and having persevered through my recovery, thus far. Im more in my body, I dont disassociate. These are all good things. Which Im thankful for. My little Stephen time, involves me, lying on my bed. If I have heavy upper body clothes on, I take them off, just leaving a t-shirt, so I have access to my bare skin. I tilt my head down and to the left. I hold my upper chest area with my hands, and or stroke, caress my upper body, saying, there, there, little Stephen, its ok. I sing to little Stephen, little Stephen, little Stephen, I love you. I tell him, his pain is my pain, Ill protect you. Things like that. Sometimes I ask him questions. Like what is that sensation. Sometimes I talk to him, without speaking loudly. Sometimes I pull my legs up behind me, in a curled up baby like position. Im planning on keeping up this at least one 1/2 hour a day with him. Its taken me a long time of disregarding little Stephen and ignoring him mostly, because I think I was afraid of him? To get to the point of acknowledging him and consistently spending time with him. Little Stephen time works, I always, so far, have felt better, after the 1/2hr. Less fearful, to manageable levels. Soothed and at peace. I just thought Id post this comment, for me to externalise whats going on for me at the moment. See if there is any helpful feedback and to encourage and help others. Thanks for reading Take care. :) "

(An Excellent Description from TraumaDissociation.com),42,7qp9ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/7qp9ck/what_is_complex_ptsd_an_excellent_description/,2018-01-16 13:48:16,"**WARNING: MAY BE TRIGGERING** Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, is the result of multiple traumatic events occurring over a period of time, often referred to as ""complex trauma"". Causes include multiple incidents of child abuse, particularly child physical abuse and child sexual abuse, prolonged domestic violence, concentration camp experiences, torture, slavery, and genocide campaigns.[3] Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder is not a diagnosis in the DSM-5 psychiatric manual, released in 2013,[5] but is planned for inclusion in the ICD-11 diagnostic manual, due for release in 2017. [3] [Article from...](URL Differences between PTSD and Complex PTSD ([see chart at...](URL **Complex PTSD Symptoms** ***Interpersonal problems*** ...includes social and interpersonal avoidance (avoiding relationships), feeling distance or cut off from others, and never feeling close to another person. Negative self-concept involves feelings of worthlessness and guilt. While survivors of PTSD may feel ""not myself"", a survivor of Complex PTSD may feel no sense of self at all or experience a changed personality; a few may feel as if they are no longer human at all (Lovelace and McGrady, 1980; Timerman, 1981).[1]:385-386. Believing yourself to be ""contaminated, guilty, and evil"" is commonly reported by survivors of Complex PTSD. A fragmented identity is common, with Dissociative Identity Disorder occurring in some people. [1]:386 ***Interpersonal sensitivity*** ...includes having feelings which are easily hurt, anger/temper outbursts and difficulties with interpersonal relationships. Complex PTSD is normally the result of interpersonal trauma, the long duration of the trauma and the control of the perpetrator(s) prevents people from expressing anger or rage at the perpetrator(s) during the trauma; anger and rage both at perpetrators and the self can only be fully expressed after the trauma ends. Prolonged abuse normally leads to a loss of previously-held beliefs, with feelings of ""being forsaken by both man and God"". [1]:382,386 ***Affect dysregulation*** ...means being unable to manage your own emotions, and is often referred to as ""difficulties with emotional regulation"". The unexpressed anger and internalized rage resulting from the trauma may lead to self-destructive or reckless/risk taking behaviors, e.g., self-harm and/or suicide attempts, which may be driven by a sense of self-hatred. [1]:382, [6] People with Complex PTSD also meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, which are: a persistent sense of threat, e.g. hypervigilance and being easily startled avoiding reminders of the traumas, and re-experiencing or reliving the traumas, for example flashbacks and intrusive thoughts about the trauma. In addition to the symptoms above, survivors of prolonged child abuse have an increased risk of both self-injury and repeated victimization, for example relationships with abusive people, sexual harassment, and rape. [1]:387 **Judith Lewis-Herman**, who first proposed Complex PTSD as a separate diagnosis, stated: Observers who have never experienced prolonged terror, and who have no understanding of coercive methods of control, often presume that they would show greater psychological resistance than the victim in similar circumstances. The survivor's difficulties are all too easily attributed to underlying character problems, even when the trauma is known. When the trauma is kept secret, as is frequently the case in sexual and domestic violence, the survivor's symptoms and behavior may appear quite baffling, not only to lay people but also to mental health professionals. The clinical picture of a person who has been reduced to elemental concerns of survival is still frequently mistaken for a portrait of the survivor's underlying character."" [1]:388 **Complex PTSD, BPD and Personality Disorders** Recent research has produced detailed analysis of the symptoms of Complex PTSD, PTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Many people with BPD either have PTSD, or meet the proposed diagnostic criteria for Complex PTSD. Complex PTSD was shown to be a separate diagnosis from Borderline Personality Disorder because a significant number did not meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD (and vice versa). In 1992, when first proposing Complex PTSD, Judith Lewis-Herman stated: ""Concepts of personality developed in ordinary circumstances are frequently applied to survivors, without an understanding of the deformations of personality which occur under conditions of coercive control. Thus, patients who suffer from the complex sequelae of chronic trauma commonly risk being misdiagnosed as having personality disorders. They may be described as 'dependent,' 'masochistic,' or 'self-defeating.' Earlier concepts of masochism or repetition compulsion might be more usefully supplanted by the concept of a complex traumatic syndrome."" [1]:388 Complex PTSD was considered to be included within ""associated features of PTSD"" for the DSM-IV under the name Disorders of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified, but this was not included in either the DSM-IV or DSM-V.[8]:23 See also: ""Enduring Personality Change After Catastrophic Experience ICD 11 draft - Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder."" The ICD-11, which is currently a draft document, includes the diagnosis of Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder in the Disorders specifically associated with stress section, immediately after Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. [3] Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Code Unknown Definition ""Complex post-traumatic stress disorder is a disorder that may develop following exposure to an event or series of events of an extreme and prolonged or repetitive nature that is experienced as extremely threatening or horrific and from which escape is difficult or impossible (e.g., torture, slavery, genocide campaigns, prolonged domestic violence, repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse). The disorder is characterized by the core symptoms of PTSD; that is, all diagnostic requirements for PTSD have been met at some point during the course of the disorder. ""In addition, complex PTSD is characterized by 1) severe and pervasive problems in affect regulation; 2) persistent beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless, accompanied by deep and pervasive feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the stressor; and 3) persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others. The disturbance causes significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."" Synonyms: Enduring personality change after catastrophic experience - EPCACE, which is ICD-10 diagnosis F62.0 Narrower Terms: Personality change after: concentration camp experiences Personality change after disasters; Personality change after prolonged captivity with an imminent possibility of being killed; Personality change after prolonged exposure to life-threatening situations such as being a victim of terrorism; Personality change after torture [3]. ""Enduring personality change may follow the experience of catastrophic stress. The stress must be so extreme that it is unnecessary to consider personal vulnerability in order to explain its profound effect on the personality. Examples include concentration camp experiences, torture, disasters, prolonged exposure to life-threatening circumstances (e.g. hostage situations - prolonged captivity with an imminent possibility of being killed). Post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1) may precede this type of personality change, which may then be seen as a chronic, irreversible sequel of stress disorder. In other instances, however, enduring personality change meeting the description given below may develop without an interim phase of a manifest post-traumatic stress disorder. However, long-term change in personality following short-term exposure to a life-threatening experience such as a car accident should not be included in this category, since recent research indicates that such a development depends on a pre-existing psychological vulnerability."" [2]:163 **ICD-10 Diagnostic guidelines for Enduring Personality Change After Catastrophic Experience** The personality change should be enduring and manifest as inflexible and maladaptive features leading to an impairment in interpersonal, social, and occupational functioning. Usually the personality change has to be confirmed by a key informant. In order to make the diagnosis, it is essential to establish the presence of features not previously seen, such as: a hostile or mistrustful attitude towards the world; social withdrawal; feelings of emptiness or hopelessness; a chronic feeling of being ""on edge"", as if constantly threatened estrangement. This personality change must have been present for at least 2 years, and should not be attributable to a pre-existing personality disorder or to a mental disorder other than post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1). Includes: Personality change after concentration camp experiences; Personality change after disasters, and prolonged captivity with an imminent possibility of being killed; Prolonged exposure to life-threatening situations such as being a victim of terrorism and/or torture. **Complex PTSD References** 1. **Herman**, J.

It's almost as though we speak another language that the rest of the world doesn't speak. I think the thing that impresses me most is that despite (l imagine) all of us coming from a childhood of abuse and relentless invalidation, despite most of us having parents very high in narcissism, we gently and thoughtfully help each other. We want to be better. We want a decent life. But not just for ourselves, we want this for each other. This empathy for others, and this ability to self-reflect, is what l imagine separates us from our 'primary caregivers', who failed us so shockingly. Both alone, and together, we have a chance for a better life. Because we are prepared to do the hard work, the work our parents never did. I just had this kind of crazy thought... in many ways we are actually functioning like a healthy family system here.. giving each other the listening, vulnerability, and validation we never got in our childhood homes.

I was with my parents at the time, and was getting gas when a domestic dispute erupted in the car next to me. I went back in the car, and all hell broke loose, with one of the individuals shooting an individual in the car. Thank God that there was an off duty police officer, who prevented the situation from escalating. Despite this, the individual took his own life. Ever since then, the amount of paranoia that I have grappling with has been excessive. Hearing loud sounds of which I cant point to the source or yelling greatly concerns. I am currently seeing someone, and I am paranoid of them seeing someone else. Having said that, my perspective on life has changed entirely, and I am constantly reminded of how brittle it is. I am always worried about my vulnerability. My concentration has gone down the drain, and depression has now become an intrinsic part of my daily life. Consequently, my academic performance has been sub par. I am not quite sure how to cope with this. I am not sure if my plight would be categorized as full blown ptsd or just a mild manifestation.

Lots of parents are depressed. Maybe Im being too harsh on her and too easy on myself. Maybe I was a difficult child and had attachment issues that annoyed her. But there was something more to her treatment, which involved a heavy dislike of some traits I had or even learned from her. Its as if she hated herself and became crazy/accusatory anytime I mimicked her or wanted to be like her, or wanted her to like me. But I was also shamed or invalidated for having differing opinions. Its hard to describe, but its like she lacked empathy for herself, and could not provide it to others. Not just empathy, but genuine kindness. She seemed to think everyone was against her, even my dad, one of her few friends. Its like she wanted someone - me, her child - to be in charge of her, and disliked the parent role. I feel like other parents may not have liked some of these traits in their kid, but wouldnt have shown disgust or tried to shame me for it all the time. Maybe they would have showed concern. Sometimes i think it would have been nice if someone had tried to help, or showed affection or care, rather than ignoring me or belittling my feelings. That may have made a difference, and prevented me from falling into a spiral of self criticism that has become ingrained in my self concept. Now Im spending a lot of time and money to learn how to like myself. Perhaps thats why I suffered for many years unknowingly, because I carried around this idea that I was bad for just being me. having a parent become upset with you that you lack self esteem makes it worse, not better. Did she think I would just develop all these positive traits in my own? Its like my parents blamed me when I was a kid for not intuitively knowing how to be an adult. Its over now and Im grateful that I can fulfill these needs in myself. But I still struggle with remorse and self blame from time to time. Does anyone else relate? Edit: someone once wrote on here that my mom was scared of me. Just to clarify, I think her behavior was more abusive than anything I did. I would often withdraw or not answer questions about the school day, but I was not outwardly mean, and very nice if someone was nice to me. She was angry and defiant and seemed to feel it was her duty to be skeptical of everyone, and never show any vulnerability or love. Its hard to describe but Im tired of people and therapists blaming me for my moms behaviors."
317,vulnerability,CPTSD,The Importance of Compassionate Acceptance,28,7k8khg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/7k8khg/the_importance_of_compassionate_acceptance/,2017-12-17 05:23:28,"Hey everyone! So this is an excerpt from a book Im currently reading entitled, Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors. Ive found that a lot of the people who post on this sub are often fully aware that they are overwhelmed with particular emotions, or they are fully aware that they cant easily separate from negative emotions and they get stuck in a state of depression and hopelessness, but they have no idea WHY theyre stuck in that state or HOW they can successfully get out of it. For an answer to the why and how, I stress the importance of learning how to become compassionately accepting of ourselves. Its important that we are able to connect to all of our parts, realize which part is up at any given moment, and unconditionally love and accept that part for what it is. This allows to be put some much-needed distance between ourselves and our overwhelmingly negative experiences, while still processing the negative experience and integrating it into our emotional database. Its a bit of a read, but it is well worth it. Befriending our Parts- Sowing the Seeds of Compassion: The ability to be compassionate or comforting or curious with others, which comes so easily to many trauma survivors, is not usually matched by the ability to offer themselves the same kindness. What it took to survive has created a bind. It was adaptive then to avoid comfort or self-compassion, to shame and self-judge before attachment figures could find them lacking, but it has now come to feel believable others deserve or belong or are worth more- while, at the same time, it also feels that these others are not to be trusted; they are dangerous and uncaring. It is a well accepted premise that, to feel safe in any relationship, human beings need compassion for both themselves and the other. Internal attachment bonds or earned secure attachment (Siegel, 1999) give us emotional resilience. The internalization of secure attachment allows individuals to tolerate hurt, loneliness, anxiety, disappointment, frustration and rejection- all the risks inherent in any close relationship. But in order to unconditionally accept ourselves and earn that resilience, we need to develop a relationship to ALL of us: to our wounded and needy parts, to the parts hostile to vulnerability, to the parts that survived by distancing and denial- to the parts we love, the parts we hate, and the parts that intimidate us. The Role of Mindfulness: To observe and identify the signs indicating parts activity requires a witnessing mind capable of focused concentration or directed mindfulness. Mindfulness has an important role to play in the treatment of trauma because of its unique effects on the brain and body. Mindfulness practices counteract trauma-related cortical inhibition, regulate autonomic activation, and allow us to have a relationship of interest and curiosity towards our thoughts, feeling and body responses- or parts. Mindfulness is key to trauma work not only because of its regulating effect on the nervous system but because it also facilitates the capacity for dual awareness or parallel processing, allowing us to explore the past without risk of retraumatization by keeping one foot in the present and one foot  in the past (Odgen et al, 2006). Dual awareness is a habit of mind that allows to simultaneously hold in mind more than one state of consciousness. When individuals can connect to a felt sense of the child selfs painful emotion while simultaneously feelings the length and stability of the spine, the in and out of the breath, the beating of the heart, and the ground under their feet, intense emotions can be held and tolerated. From Whose Perspective Should we Observe?: Observations of the environment through the telescopic lenses specific to each part often creates a distorted perspective for the client. Each part has particular biases that narrow what it picks up as data and what it never sees. The fight part is not scanning for safety cues: it is hypervigilantly oriented toward threat stimuli. The attach part sees only the warm smile, the reassuring words, the polite manners- and never sees the danger signals that indicate grooming or seduction. When clients learn to identify the lens through which they are looking (the little part is hoping to see someone who likes her, the depressed part is looking at Susans expression and thinking the worst), they can begin to see the actions and reactions of their parts from a meta-awareness perspective. Rather than being flooded with overwhelming emotions, they learn to separate from the intense reactions of a part, acknowledge the feelings as his or her distress and bear witness to the child parts painful experience. *Perhaps for the first time, clients can have a relationship to a distressing feeling rather than being consumed by it or identifying it as mine.* the feeling or reaction is still palpable but with a decrease in intensity that is consistent with the ability to sustain curiosity and interest in it, rather than react to it. Mindful interest, as opposed to attachment or aversion, helps individuals tolerate emotions and sensations that may have previously felt frightening, and it supports a neutral stance towards whatever it observed or discovered. In addition, when individuals become curious and interested and focused on what they are observing, they intuitively slow their pace to increase concentration and observational capacity. Being interested is the first step towards getting to know another being, even when that being is a parts of ones own self. From this new perspective, it is easier for most individuals to find ways of soothing the parts emotions and anticipating events or triggers that might overwhelm a child without support from someone older and wiser.

I'm super lonely. Im nearly entirely alone at this point in my life. Ive distanced myself from many friends who were not good for me but don't have the skills to find, recognize, and make good friendships. Plus I'm 28 so friendships are hard to develop for everyone. I don't date. When I do it goes poorly so I've given up. I'm awful with new people because I feel like a loser, a poser, worthless and unlovable. I don't have the skills to have fun dates. My dates are aweful every time and I've humiliated myself too many times to try again. No matter how much I try to make a date different or fun I freeze up every time and fall into the same lame rut of just sitting and talking about nothing at all. It's not just nervousness of dating, it's fundamental beliefs that I'm a fraud and a freaking loser waste of space. I don't know what to do anymore because I've tried everything, I've read every book, I've been in different therapies for 5 plus years and nothing has budged. I have tried hobbies to make friends. I rock climbed regularly for two years. I met people and climbed with them regularly but was never friends with them. Idk how to make friends. I was the friendly gym guy, but a friend of no one. I tried vulnerability. I tried hanging out outside of the gym. Currently in jiu jitsu and the same thing. I'm distant from everyone. Idk how to get closer to anyone. I don't know how to form bonds with other humans. I honestly feel like a phantom. And I can remove myself from people's lives as seemlessly as a phantom as well. It's just not getting better. Something is damaged in my brain and I don't think it'll change. It's been honestly making me really start considering suicide in the future. My twin brother is the only reason I don't want to do that, but if this continues any longer I'll probably bite the bullet. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anyways. That's my story. I cope by getting high when I have weed available (not often). Mostly I just binge watch TV or youtube. I go through spurts of spending all my time in my hobbies (jiu jitsu now, previously rock climbing), but they too are just distractions and distractions arnt working anymore at keeping the pain away.

319,vulnerability,CPTSD,UPDATE: post after first ketamine infusion treatment for ptsd and depression etc. I just got it today. It was extremely profound.,63,7agumr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/7agumr/update_post_after_first_ketamine_infusion/,2017-11-03 14:25:06,"I got my first ketamine infusion treatment today. If anyone is interested in reading about it you can look URL here and see. I did not expect such a profound experience. Honestly I had no idea what to expect. Once the dr. put the iv in after a little while I was laughing uncontrollably (I'm a giggler, and also I think I laugh as a nervous reaction sometimes). Then I started to experience pure emotions - not the kind that we experience in daily CPTSD life. These must be some of the core emotions I cannot feel safe simply just feeling (without the associated feelings that come with CPTSD), I imagine I felt them in a way that a non traumatized person feels their feelings, like they just feel them without being afraid of them. The first thing that came up was how extremely controlling I am. Mostly of myself, and my attempts to go through life are based in / come from a place of ""how can I control this so I am ok?"". Then I saw that my own brain does to myself exactly what my father did - CONTROL. As in the main way I relate to myself is to attempt to control myself, which is exactly what my father did - control me (he kidnapped me and my siblings and brainwashed us). The next thing that I saw was how every single family member of mine utterly failed me as a human being. Sure if you are here in this subreddit then you probably see this too about your family. But I saw it IN REALITY terms - as in I saw from a place of detachment and honesty how horribly they failed me as a human being, and then I experienced how I have never ever felt loved or cared for by another human being. - I'm not saying no one has ever loved me, I'm saying I felt how uncared for, neglected, and unloved I was as a child - which never changed inside. No matter how much another person may feel that they love me, I can't feel it because this is underneath everything. This is the trauma - that raw feeling of ""oh boy no one has ever loved me or (literally) cared for me. Oh my god."" crying. Not in an I feel sorry for myself way either, just the pure understanding of it. There were other moments where I saw some people I know currently and saw them through these strange views of how unimportant they are and how important I make them be. Mainly that I make everyone more important than me, because that is what I was trained to do to survive. Again, I knew this on an intellectual level but I experienced it much differently while the infusion was in. During the treatment I was just blown away by how profound of an experience it was. I kept finding my mind looking for ways to control the situation, but since I was being given a powerful drug I was unable to exert any kind of control with my mind. It was so amazing to watch with detachment. I experienced myself keep looking inside for fear and anxiety, but the drug must have blocked my body's ability to feel fear and anxiety somehow - because no matter how hard my mind kept trying to look around inside and find the fear, or sort of catch it before it happened (internal hypervigilance) - my body wasn't feeling fear or anxiety - it was just my mind looking for it and expecting it. The main thing I keep saying about this experience is ""oh this was so WILD."" It was amazing. There were a bunch of little moments where I just kind of felt like I understood life on a deep level, and how unimportant so much is that I make important. I also then thought ""wait I'm on a drug maybe this is just drugs."" And then I'd feel the understanding of life again, or I'd feel some repressed emotion come out again, or cry seeing my mother and how unimportant of a human being she was - literally, not from anger, but literally that she just meant nothing and she'd been such a horrible ""mother."" As in ""WTF that was garbage."" I didn't have any anger about it - just kind of a strange sense of ""oh shit, my family were such strange people. Wow."" Like people I didn't know kind of. Hard to explain. Someone commented on my original post asking for other people who have gotten the treatment that they felt like shit for 3 hours afterwards. That was really helpful because it's exactly what happened, it's now about 4 hours later and I finally feel normal-ish again. But I felt like shit afterwards. I had to take a Lyft there and back, and got carsick in the car on the way. Dr. added zofran into the infusion, which should have prevented me from getting sick on the way home. It didn't . The Lyft ride home was unbearable I felt so freaking car sick. I had no idea I got so carsick (I usually drive myself places and forgot I'm not in other people's cars often, or maybe this just made me extra sensitive). I know during the treatment that this was going to be powerful and work somehow for me. I don't know exactly how it's going to work, or what it's going to help me with, but there is no way I felt like that and experienced all of that without some kind of result happening. Another thing I remember is that after seeing how much my mind works through trying to control myself, my life, and my environment ( I don't try to directly control other people, thanks to years working on that), and how exhausted I am. How utterly exhausting it is to live in this body that experiences life through these traumatized sets of working - control, fragmentation, isolation, putting other people in front of me - all unecessary, all unloving towards myself, and all of it because that is all I know, that's what I was taught TO DO TO MYSELF.. And also I experienced how fragmented I am inside. It wasn't scary, it was an honest experience. Also I saw how pretty I am and how pretty I would be if I were able to present myself to others as the sweet vulnerable person I am inside. And then I felt a little sad that I have such a ""hard / unapproachable"" kind of demeanor (someone once told me I come across like a docile tiger) because I don't have a choice, because I don't feel safe in my own body, I don't have the ability to feel safe in my own body, so I can't show anyone a sweet soft vulnerability because it's too dangerous. I can show it to them once I know them really well - but when you have CPTSD you don't pick the best people to show your vulnerability to. At least in my past I haven't. I am working on only connecting with safe people now in therapy fyi. If anyone has any more questions please feel free to ask. I'm getting another treatment on Saturday and then again on Monday. "

The question is what might make it possible to accept being wrapped up in a burrito roll in her office? The closest answer I can think of is bringing my own blanket. I know *why* I think vulnerability hasn't been possible for me, and how that's so strong that I can't even break down in my own place. It's really something I cannot do. It is such a block that I can't even touch it for long. As I said, pretty good idea how I got to be this way - vulnerability brought disgust and impatience and neglect from my mother. Also as currency. She had evidence of my deficiency, and she'd lord it over me. I remember that time I went inpatient and called home crying, leaving a message, and how she kept it on her phone to replay to me when I would say I didn't need to be in there (I did, but still). So, impatience and disgust and neglect, and also visibility. Visibility was Bad, because everything that made me a person was burned down. I had to tuck my music and movies and ideas away, because they'd be torn apart if I didn't. To be invisible was how I could survive. So taking care of myself, being alone, and having my humanity stripped away led to why, I think. I have no idea how to fix it, even within the safety of my therapist's office. Help?

And I'm pretty sure a big part of that is none of the guys I start seeing ever feel an actual connection with me because I literally CAN'T be vulnerable with them. When talking about feelings or any problems they have to pry before I say anything about my actual feelings.

326,vulnerability,CPTSD,The problem of relatability.,39,6wjiok,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/6wjiok/the_problem_of_relatability/,2017-08-28 23:53:39,"Someone posted something about feeling like a complete outsider. I gave them this answer which turned into a post. So here it is. Very long, as usual, but useful for me to write out: I remember a point where I really had this concern. How do people see me? What are they thinking? Why do I have to pretend to be human while other people seem to effortlessly 'be' human? So here is a piece of the puzzle that I've filled in since then and it has been very helpful for me. The thing that I so desperately wanted so much from other people (while feeling unloveable, awkward, weird and rejected) was not social interaction. It was mirroring. Mirroring is far more basic and intimate than social interaction. Mirroring is something we receive from our primary caregivers. It is not social interaction, but it is the precursor to social interaction. The 'foundation', if you will. Do you ever see a mother smiling at her baby/toddler, mirroring their facial expressions, smiling delightedly, echoing their sounds with little sounds? That's what mirroring is. The baby is 'received' into the welcoming affect of the parent like a kid into a lake or swimming pool. They get to bathe in it, splash around, jump in, learn how to navigate. There is no 'right' or 'wrong' thing to do. There are some reasonable limits, but the play is pretty much unconditional. You learn how to 'swim' in the safe welcoming affect of the parent. This is what we didn't receive enough of. The ability to simply play around and experiment with relationality in a safe environment. So the effects are two-fold. 1) We approach relational situations with a sense of dread, because we are unpracticed at them. We never received a full foundation. Our mirroring was inadequate, or it was smothering, or controlling, or detached, or shaming, or (fill in the blank). This is why I believe we feel odd. It's like never learning how to throw a football, and life appears to be a field where everyone is effortlessly throwing spirals. 2) We approach social situations looking for something only our parents or primary caretaker could have given us. We lack the basic building blocks of intimacy, but we desperately want other people to mirror us in the way our parents did not. We can't relate, but at the same time, we want way too much from simple social interactions. This is why boundaries were such an issue for me. I approached people at a party feeling like an alien in a human suit, and then I would ask them the affective equivalent of 'Will you be my mother? Will you be my father? Will you be my sibling/soul mate/ confidant?"" I remember walking up to people I had just met and asking them ""How am I feeling?"" It just slipped out. I wanted validation. Of course it weirds people out. It would weird you out. Predators are very good at figuring out that you are stuck in this disconnect. They can sense that you desperately want to relate but don't know the first thing about doing so. In that way, bullies of inadequately mirrored people are exactly like bullies toying with anybody else with a disability. They see you can't reach something from your wheelchair so they enjoy picking it up and taunting you with it. They are also suffering from a form of toxic shame, but they aren't in touch with their vulnerability, so they attack you for your need of mirroring (they see your lack of ability as weakness, and it subconsciously enrages them). This is the classic routine I lived in for so many years. Me: ""Will you please let me fit in?"" Bullies ""Ha! He doesn't fit in!"" By asking (through your uncertainty, affect, gestures, expression) if you fit in, you show everyone that you don't fit in. Otherwise, why would you ask? So here's how I untangled this one. First, I had to realize it was not my fault. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. (Go rent 'Good Will Hunting' and watch the 'It's not your fault' scene until you break down crying with Matt Damon. Rinse. Repeat) Your feeling alien and unrelatable has nothing to do with being 'cooler' or 'dorkier', or any adjective that fills in the blank. You aren't missing anything. You aren't 'incomplete'. You just didn't learn how to be mirrored properly, and you can't learn deep intimate mirroring in an everyday social environment. Being vulnerable at that level is too uncomfortable for people, and its not the point of social interaction anyway. Social interaction is actually quite basic and superficial. This is where therapy comes in. Therapy is a safe environment where a properly trained therapist can undergo this very subtle task of mirroring you. It takes time. There's a lot of toxic shame to work through, the shame of not being mirrored properly. If my parents didn't take the time to teach me how to be a relatable human, how could I be human? It's a very slow and painstaking process, but you can gradually learn. Eventually you will be much better at it than your bullies. One final thing (sorry, I do go on). What people think of you is none of your business. There is also literally no way of knowing what other people or thinking, other than what they tell you, and people are generally unreliable narrators. I'm aware that looking in from the outside it seems as if you are the only alien and everyone else seems to be effortlessly 'inside' relatable humanity. It's not true. Everyone is suffering. Everyone feels inadequate to some degree. People are also consistently wildly off base about everything. How can you know the exact circumstances, feelings and history that lead people to behave the way they do? People's conclusions about you, in other words, have very little to do with you. I used to think that someone's honest opinion about me was some sort of 'holy grail' that would give me the information I needed to feel accepted and become human. Nothing could be farther from the truth. People's opinions about you are often garbage. People project, reach bizarre conclusions, and have all sorts of delusions of their own. They aren't reliable. They are relatable. That's the difference. Your sense of self comes from you. You are the authority on who you are. That you believe it should come from entirely from someone else is proof positive that you have been emotionally abused. The problem with C-PTSD is that we are left flailing wildly about to look for something that we believe is missing from ourselves. Meanwhile, we are unable to trust ourselves enough to acknowledge that we already have what is missing. It's really really fucking confusing. The truth is there is simply something that we never learned how to do. What worked for me was a) gradually learning how to mirror b) learning adequate self care c) slowly building healthy boundaries. Sorry if this was too long. I just really relate ( ha! ) to what you said here. Good luck."

328,vulnerability,CPTSD,Internalization of shame as a child,29,6reujd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/6reujd/internalization_of_shame_as_a_child/,2017-08-04 05:37:28,"Hello :) This is something I wrote down because after a couple years of therapy and trying to work through issues, I feel it is a big realization. I'm wondering if others have been here, if they understand, and this isn't something we have to go through alone. (Sorry it is so so long, I don't want to cut some of it not because I feel self important, but because I feel it explains the whole truth of these issues). I honestly think it's silly to expect others to read it, but I wonder if others have felt similarly. This morning I took some time to really think about my progress in therapy, and what childhood trauma I had experienced to lead to my inability to have good boundaries and coping mechanisms. My therapist has suggested childhood therapy (or young child therapy, not sure the correct term), so I decided to investigate further on my own, since I won't see her until next week, through self talk. What I found (or think I found) is that in my memories of childhood, there was a lot of shame. So much, in fact, that I could not speak to teachers, speak to my peers, or other adults. I was frightened and it showed on my face, my body language, and in my interactions. I was overly polite and never crossed any boundaries, at the expense of being able to be ""me."" I hid a lot and ate lunch alone. It was hard to open up to others. I tried to figure out, why would a child have such high levels of shame? Especially a child like me, who hadn't actually DONE anything worthy of extreme shame. If my child was me, I would think ""she's a good kid. She has a good heart and is worthy of affection and love. she gets good grades and shows love."" Many of my friends saw that when I couldn't. To me, they are all wonderful people. Many of my behaviors were a manifestation of that. I cared and acted like a parent toward my younger sister; I earned perfect grades; i was an overachiever who would not accept help or money from people. I studied the bible from a young age and prayed to God constantly as a way to help with some type of guilt and shame that, looking back now, was not right. I believe that the reason I felt so much shame, is that my mom projected her shame onto me. She continued to do so for many years, because I think my behaviors were maladaptive and because I didn't understand, nothing changed. It was easier for her to hurt me than to help. 1) If I showed signs of emotional vulnerability and weakness, she would give me that ""look."" It is a look I tried to avoid so much that I locked myself in my room a lot. When I would hear her car pulled up in the garage, I would run quickly from the living room into my room and lock the door. I would go under the covers and wait, just wait. Would she be in a good mood or bad mood? Would she come pounding on my door to yell for no reason, as if I was ""bad"" and doing something bad? I was a good kid, for goodness sakes. Many parents would have been proud of my grades, my gentle kind nature. To her, it made her angry. Her ""look"" was extreme disgust, an upcurled lip that is empty and malicious, and it still affects me to this day that I struggle socially. i cower on bad days if I sense anyone might give me that ""look."" But she also would dismiss me. if I opened up, she would dismiss my emotions or feelings. I feel anger now, because she would move me around a lot, to different schools, when I was already so painfully shy. And rarely did she ask how I was doing. Did this move affect me (it did). How was I in school. It was always about her having control. And that meant treating me like a burden, but also as if I was her ""pet project"" as she sought education to become a counselor (a role, btw, that never came to fruition). So instead of actually caring, and taking the time to address the pain, she just tried to ""fix"" it by controlling me and telling me what to do, how to feel, what to think, with no compassion or empathy. But as a child, the most devastating part was she ignored my feelings. I felt this hurt the most. I am lucky that so many friends with kind hearts did show me the time and patience to listen to me, even if it was a burden. I forgive myself for that too, because I was in pain. 2) Her projection of shame was because she could not acknowledge any roles she played in the fact I had anxiety. her inability to manage her shame and regret were projected onto a child who had little defense mechanisms. I would say she was ashamed at my shyness, poor boundaries and other traits, because she had those too, as a child. I believe she could not handle that her behaviors -- being overly moody, unpleasant, demanding, unable to express love or even affection, but also being mean to my father, and critical of other people -- impacted me. It's easier to blame the child as being too ""sensitive,"" emotional or just a failure, than it is to accept your own role in their own problems and their own arrested development. It was easier to hate my father -- a kind, quiet man -- for being ""weak"" than it is to change herself. This can lead to many things, but I believe codependency, and my symptoms of it, are an internalization of this shame. My codependent traits tell me: I am responsible for how other people feel all the time, including strangers; I am fundamentally a ""bad,"" weak or stupid person who must make up for those traits by being the best I can be, and always beings polite; I must be hyper vigilant of my behaviors so as not to offend ANYBODY, even strangers. This has morphed in a terrible fear of even going out in public some days 9and also posting on here, or sharing my story at all. This is actually quite embarassing but oh well). I am afraid of retribution and of people projecting their shame onto me. Because some people will -- it has happened to me over and over and over again (few if no boundaries, which is technically my fault but how could I know). People with good boundaries also wont understand, so it's a lonely existence. You get taken advantage of, and ignored at the same time. This the genesis of my c-ptsd. When I feel that I am allowed to have boundaries, the fear dissipates like it never had before. I feel strong and in control of myself. No one can hurt me, and I feel such a sense of joy lately in this power that when I go out in public, I tear up. It feels like a huge weight has been lifted. Because most of my life I was so afraid for even strangers to look at me. This is the beginning of being free. One of the ways, I believe, a person could heal from these traits is going back and forgiving their child self. Forgiveness isn't even the right world, because as children we didn't NEED to be forgiven. I didn't DO anything so bad that was worse than any normal child! If anything I was so anxious and afraid that I acted too ""good,"" with few actual needs. This was all at the expense of my self. I can look back and see I was worthy of love, care, and being listened to. Children don't always get those things in large amounts, but at least they don't have to deal with a projection of someone else's disappointment and high expectations. The last thing I want to do is become that way. I've found that as my shame has worsened, that it is easier to have too high of expectations for myself, and blame and shame myself further for seeking help. While I'm strong enough not to let those boil over into being a contemptuous narcissist, i see now that it impedes my ability to open up to my friends and loved ones lately. It impedes my ability to be loving of my mistakes and those of others. I used to be good at this, loving of most everyone(still am in some ways) and it's only the last year that it's worsened, because I feel pain. I'm stopping this in its tracks, so if and when I choose to have children, I will never project this shame onto them, even if it's not malicious. I also realize codependency is maladapative and I would never have children until I feel this is more or less resolved (maybe it won't ever be completely, but I will trust myself as to never seek approval from my own kids and continue the cycle). This ended up being pretty serious (and very, VERY long) but it feels like such an important realization, that I never deserved this shame that has stayed with me since, as long as i can remember. Because that means I'm not responsible for other people, I don't have to internalize their behaviors, and I don't have to be something for THEM. While it hurts still when I disappoint someone, I see now that if someone acts childish because I establish a boundary, that is on them, for the most part. If I didn't smile enough or care enough to them, and act the way they wanted, and they blame me for that, they are not the right person to have in my life. They may be right -- I don't act perfectly, f.e. I can be aloof because I am afraid and don't always face my fears, and I blame my mom too much still -- but I don't deserve to be ridiculed, bullied or hurt."

Ive been trying to work through my issues for many years but it's only in the last 14 months that I got sober off opioids, and entered into addiction therapy and therapy for borderline personality disorder. I have been very focused on my addiction / BPD issues and although I was aware that I have trauma and a bad childhood, perhaps cptsd, I just kinda minimized it due to not wanting to use it as an ""excuse"" or just thinking that it's not a big deal and will go away if I focus on recovering from addiction and BPD. Well that has proven not to be the case. My BPD symptoms have improved, I'm not super impulsive anymore but I realize I've been left with the devastating effects of cPTSD that I've been invalidating because I'm just like, well whatever happened to me wasn't that bad/my parents never hit me/my parents bought me things and gave me money/I could have stopped the sexual abuse/im just lazy and pathetic and bla bla bla. As for what happened to me, well I Was emotionally abused and neglected as a kid and even as an adult by my parents. Bullied in middle school, sexually and emotionally abused by my first boyfriend at 15, lots of retraumatization throughout university through making bad decisions and then just last year I was the victim of a cyberbullying attack that hasn't totally ended and I told myself that it didn't bother me but truthfully it's tearing me apart and triggering all of the pain I haven't dealt with from when I was bullied as a pre teen. Something happened last week where someone contacted me to harass me re: things that were written in the cyberbullying webpage (pls don't give advice about how to get rid of the page, I've tried and even contacted lawyers and I can't get it removed). Anyway so I started reading lots about cPTSD yesterday when I realized that id been avoiding it and I accidentally really triggered myself into a tonne of debilitating emotional flashbacks by reading too much about it. I've never felt this knocked down by cptsd shit before, or at least this is the first time I'm trying not to run from it with drugs and impulsivity. I also stopped smoking weed a few weeks ago so I'm dealing with the emotional vulnerability of not having that as an escape. I haven't been coping as well as I'd like to these last few days and I feel incompetent and weak because of that. Today I made breakfast, went to therapy, went for a walk with my friend, but I've had a lot of downtime and I've just been laying in bed scrolling the web, I'm having body pains and blaming It on myself, feels like everything is my fault and I deserve every bit of how bad I feel, been oversleeping, I hate how I'm treating myself and feel like I should punish myself for punishing myself even though that makes no sense. I'm sorry this was so long and rambly, this stuff is new to me and I just want to get it off my chest, if someone can reply even with something short I would appreciate it a lot, thank you so much "
330,vulnerability,CPTSD,An unsent letter to my ex with CPTSD,17,6u6ibf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/6u6ibf/an_unsent_letter_to_my_ex_with_cptsd/,2017-08-17 10:53:04,"When I told you I loved you, it sure feels like you didnt really understand what I meant. My love is not something casual that just comes and goes, if a person earns a piece of my heart, I do not expect it to be given back. Love is a gamble, love is not just one kind of feeling, love opens us up. In that openness, we bare our bellies and our vulnerability is heightened. Pain is part of love. Pain is a part of life. Unavoidable. When I said I love you I said it knowing that pain would be part of the deal. The love I have for you is simple: You are a person whose threads have been spun in such a way that I realized I would always want you to be part of my life. Not out of perfection, but for the unique entity you are. In loving you, I agreed to you, every part of you. Every time you lashed out at me, I accepted those are parts of you. That the ability to control those things wasnt developed yet. This did not make the pain any more bearable. I am not a stranger to pain, it has been a prevalent undercurrent throughout my life. But it was a simple equation: Did the joy and happiness our time together generated overshadow the pain? The answer was always yes. No matter how much it hurt. How was I supposed to think that your actions were indicative of a person in control of themselves? It would make me an idiot if I thought the behaviours were a reflection of your wants. So many contradictions between loving kindness and painful outbursts to destroy everything you cared about. And in saying that, I wonder if you perceive me to see you as defective and resent me for it? Who am I to expect perfection from another human being? And when I had no choice but to act against the ways you harmed yourself, did you see it as controlling? Because the only thing I was trying to control was your continued existence in this world. I would fight tooth and nail against anything trying to hurt my loved ones, to take them away from me. I just never expected to have to fight the person I loved trying to take themself away. But if I loved you, what other choice was there? Let you go? Into a place where you no longer exist? This is what its like to love someone with this illness. It hurts every god damn day youre here or not. Being split white or black or pushed so far away. Everyone hurts. You are not alone. There are people who care about you. Who understand even when you feel they dont. They might understand a little bit, or they might understand that none of this makes any fucking sense. But the only person who cares about you who can do anything about it is going to be you, so that you can come to understand what you judge everyone else for not understanding. You are good enough. You can make it through. I think of you when I wake, when I go to sleep. Your pulling away and silence has crushed my heart but I do my best to think its not about me, that youre dealing with your demons. But god, how I miss you. The worst days with you were better than the best without. I pray for you so hard. This hope inside that we can reconcile when youre in a better place is so heavy, it eats me inside. I am so glad we got you started with therapy and onto sobriety. I am so proud of your sticking to it. I hope someday you can be proud of yourself. I love you. I will always love you."

It feels like everyone is a potential abuser, so I keep a deliberate distance or actively push people away out of a misguided sense of self preservation. I even separated from my husband for a year because I felt unworthy of the relationship, and couldn't find any trust. Does this gradually go away, or is there something that can be done about it? I'm in therapy, and it's helping a lot, but it's difficult to express this problem. I don't even want to show that vulnerability to my therapist. There's so much guilt about this."
332,vulnerability,CPTSD,Time to heal,5,6c85m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/6c85m0/time_to_heal/,2017-05-20 12:54:16,"A few years ago I was diagnosed with complex PTSD. My alcoholic mother physically and emotionally abused me during my entire childhood. Even though I'd been to many therapists and such, none of them worked through the process of healing and recovery with me. I'm now in a relationship with a covert narcissist. Over the past three years he's sucked the life out of me. His family is basically the only one that we have contact with. He is not interested in getting to know my family. His family is rude to us and quite mean about petty things like supporting him. His father yelled at me recently about something he thought we disagreed about (I've been fighting with my boyfriend to get him to go to the doctor) even though we are trying to achieve the same goal. My boyfriend hides the fact that we live together, refuses to stand up to them or ever discuss their inappropriate behavior with them. I'm starting to get frustrated and even mean about his family probably because they are basically the only people we interact with outside of each other and the occasional person at school or outside. I make all my boyfriends appointments for him. Recently he's been skipping them more. I have to take him to the appointment if I want him to go. His family has the signs of being quite toxic. Their behavior towards us has gotten progressively worse. Instead of comforting me or defending me my boyfriend basically says I'm too sensitive. I need to have thicker skin. Yet it is obvious to me that there is an issue. I need to examine my relationship. When I bring up these issues, I am usually told the problem lies within me. How do I talk to him about his family without being mean? I am finding myself saying negative things about them more and more. When I met I boyfriend, I had just left a long relationship and as a result was quite vulnerable. At first things were lots of fun. We enjoyed each other's company and shared lots of fun moments. Eventually my living situation changed and I needed a place to go. My boyfriend offered without really explaining that we'd have to hide it from his parents. This involves removing all of my belonging from the apartment when they come. Fair enough as I am living for free. However, my boyfriend has held the fact that his parents pay for a lot over my head. He expects that I spend a lot of time with them and such. Gradually, everyone in my life including several family members have been cut out. My boyfriend claims that my friends were annoying and distracting. I agree but he also helped to remove my support system. He expects that I visit his family with him as a buffer yet he has made no effort with mine except once recently. After two years of being together I'm starting to get sick of doing things with people who aren't even very kind when he seems to think my family isn't as important. There is always a way to manipulate things to be my fault. Some things are actually due to my actions. Others really are a two way street. When it comes to talking about out sex life he just shuts down and blames it on me. I spent so much time trying to find condoms he would want to wear and nothing worked. Eventually I gave in but was uncomfortable with unprotected sex. I voiced my concerns but he still expects something. He has no interest in engaging me sexually. He thinks vaginas are gross and scary. After all the blow jobs I still have received nothing. Sex became impersonal and now we don't do it. Though he occasionally will guilt me that he doesn't feel loved or wanted. Of course how can I initiate after he says something like that. He expects that I initiate everything because he feels rejected by me and doesn't want to force it. He also just gets annoyed for having to do things. Today I am working on a final paper for school. My grades are bad and I need to focus on this. He is more interested in surfing the web and complaining. Even doing the dishes was annoying to him. Now he is picking up his parents from the airport which pisses him off too. He still wanted me to help with chores this morning. When he had a project do I am supposed to do everything he wants and shut up about it. I cook and clean around the house. Chores are also my duty for the most part. He values his school quite highly and has said that we will take care of his education first and then focus on mine. I am taking out student loans for classes that I'm not doing well in because I barely have time to study. Being a house wife and student are likely not common combinations. Whenever I speak about taking more challenging classes my boyfriend is encouraging at first but then puts me down. If chores are not done especially during stressful times, I get the blame and frustration. He expects that I pick up the slack so that he can focus on school. His parents have been rude to us together and even to me indepently. Instead of standing up to them, my boyfriend said things are fine. As long as they are paying for things we have to keep our mouths shut. I can't live like this anymore. If something isn't done it could result in an issue. I have no friends anymore. I feel isolated at times. When I lash out at him, he says that I have problems and need to see a therapist. Most if not all of the issues in the relationship are pegged on me. ""If I wasn't such a jerk sometimes he would find me more sexually attractive"". Sex has been a serious issue. He refuses to wear condoms and doesn't like to go down on women. The whole interaction is about him. If I make one wrong move to throw the mood off he's pissed and guilts me about it for hours. Yes it's my fault if the mood is thrown off. Sex is really about his pleasure. Before I met him I slept with older men for money and has serious problems with sex. I told him I was sensitive and not ready for anything serious. After two years of being together we barely have intimate moments. I'm not sure what to do really. When I speak to him about my concerns he generally says I'm overacting and has little interest in continuing the conversation. He usually says he has to study or something even though countless hours are wasted. Sure what he is studying is important but so is my life and growth. It is clear that my feelings, thoughts, and concerns are second rate. He is much more concerned with talking about his own interests. Even after I've had a long difficult day, he barely asks how it went and launches into whatever he was thinking about. There were times when he was supportive and kind but now I feel trapped under his control to a degree. Classes I wanted to take have been put off. Friends removed from my life and family member alienated. I'm feeling isolated and he is starting to get mean. The goal is not to make him out to be the bad guy. I've just been so isolated that I could not reflect on his behavior. He continues to get frustrated with me for the issues he says I have including being nit picky, negative, and mean. I want some control back in my life. I do a great deal of the shopping and such now. I want to know if I'm crazy. Is his behavior normal? Most days I'm just thinking about how to make him happy. What snacks can I buy? Should I do the dishes again? Run another load of laundry? Clean up that mess? Fill the water purifier? He says he doesn't want to live without me which is hard to navigate. On the flip side he says he is wasting his time with me when I annoy him. In the past when I have frustrated him he says ""that we might need a break or something but where would you go? It would be such a huge mess with my family too. It is better that we stay together and you fix your problems."" He says during those times that he is not very happy and the blame falls on me. He says he wants me to fix my problems. I've learned that the relationship is dangerous and unhealthy. This has all triggered some very negative memories and feelings. However, I see this transition as a time to really work on my childhood trauma so that I'll be stronger in the future. I used to think that I forgave my mother for her poor parenting. I completely blocked my father out since he's NPD and left when I was five. My mother sued for child support. He later threatened to disown me multiple times for no reason. Now it is time to address the anger, vulnerability, lack of self esteem, and lack of self worth. Thinking that I can sweep my issues under the rug will not help going forward. This is my second relationship that is a repeat pattern of the type of relationship my parents had. It is time for a change within me. "
333,vulnerability,CPTSD,What I am like as a parent,15,6dvuum,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/6dvuum/what_i_am_like_as_a_parent/,2017-05-29 06:08:00,"I hate when I tell my kids off and I know I've over-reacted and I can see them feeling ashamed but I can't reel my annoyance in quickly enough. But I think I am getting better at it. I see their eyes wanting reassurance and I do cuddle and reassure them afterwards but I wish I was quicker at calming down. I hate how much their loud crying stirs up the inner anger in me. I'm trying to manage it. I try to remind myself that it's temporary; this isn't permanent; ""you go and soothe them because you're the parent and they want to be soothed"", but.. I'm not quite there yet. Something in the loud cry triggers an anger response in the depths of my chest. Why? I don't like myself at these times: when all I want do is to tell them to be quiet when they are crying. I just want the noise to stop. One day, and hopefully one day soon, I will be able to be patient like my girlfriend is. Something painful comes up from my depths when they tell me they love me, or when they act lovingly towards me, or have any deep positive emotion towards me. I ache somehow and I want to avoid seeing their vulnerability towards me. At these times, I want to be indifferent; I want them to be indifferent. I think it's safer. I think I equate vulnerability with suffering. But I will not cause them suffering. I swallow it up and I do my best to reciprocate that vulnerability. I am getting better at it. I could always physically cuddle them but there was an aversion in my chest (where my feelings are located). I am trying to cuddle them with my heart, too, but I feel pain. Pain for myself? Pain for them? Pain for their past and my past? Why does the idea of love cause me so much pain? And the love. The fear, that somehow, affection equals attraction. That concept has always been something murky for me. I don't feel romantic or sexual attraction to my kids, God, don't get me wrong. But I have this irrational fear that any feeling of affection leads to a feeling of attraction, so I suppress feelings of affection. In reality, I know it's not that fluid. But my feelings get so confused. I can't have affection for colleagues or students or my therapist or my kids because I worry I will confuse it with attraction. So I just suppress it and feel anxious. When in reality, I'm sure I could feel all sorts of affection and not be plagued with attraction. It's just that my brain doesn't understand feelings and how the wires work. I think those are my main gripes with myself and my parenting. Also of course there is the fear that the children will feel I'm abusing them, but that feeling is slowly subsiding, with reassurance from my girlfriend, and with me taking time to reflect on how I actually interact with my kids. I try to see the evidence. And I'm trying really hard to focus on the positive experiences and not the negative. Cause yeah, small kids have tantrums, and adopted kids come with their own set of traumas, but in reality, I think 95% of the time spent with them is non-negative. So if I could just get rid of the flashbacks (sensory, emotional, and visual), learn to see things for how they are - rather than through my grim-tinted catastrophic glasses.. ahh.. then I could truly live as a good, happy parent. I suppose it took me several years to feel I deserved love from my girlfriend. Let's hope it doesn't take as long with the children. I'm doing my best for them, and a lot of this stuff is internal. My gf doesn't see half of this in my behaviour with the kids, but my brain does. Sorry for so many posts recently. Holidays equal reflecting time. I want to know what is real and how bad I actually am so. Here's my soul for the eyes of the internet to see. Edit: In the interests of full disclosure, I comfort my children when they're sad, I teach them emotional literacy and resilience, I support them with their interests, I play games with them, I run around the garden, I encourage them to respect others' boundaries and feel confident to let people know to respect theirs, I laugh with them, I cuddle up with them on the sofa, I share their joyous moments, I listen to their little rants, I clean up their sick, I hold them if they have a nightmare, I let them wear my perfume, I help them to read, write, count, etc. I'm not saying I'm a dysfunctional parent. I'm saying what else I need to work on."

336,vulnerability,CPTSD,"I think my otherwise-wonderful boyfriend has C-PTSD. I think he has ""fight"" flashbacks. Help.",9,5qjad0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/5qjad0/i_think_my_otherwisewonderful_boyfriend_has_cptsd/,2017-01-28 06:56:33,"I'm not sure, but I think my boyfriend has C-PTSD. We've been together for 5 years. We are older. I'm almost 40 and he's almost 50. His parents are both (undiagnosed) personality disordered. Mom NPD, Dad BPD (but also possibly NPD). BF was the oldest. Mom made him into her emotional caretaker, but also rejected him in most ways. His younger brother, the golden child, was born, and both parents adored him and ignored my BF. BF seems to know that this trauma had a lasting impact on him, but he is reluctant to address it directly. In darker times of self-awareness, he was married to a dysfunctional woman who seems like an uBPD/NPD combination and had two kids with her. Her dysfunction felt familiar to him. In the present day, she will not let go and is still trying to destroy his life. She's a near constant source of stress for us. He and I have been together for about 5 years. We suffered a break up in 2014 that I now believe was related to a flashback. We'd been about to move in together. We argued, he left, and all of a sudden he treated me like I was the worst person imaginable and broke up with me. After about 8-9 months of no contact, we got back together. He confessed that he'd loved me all the while and I certainly felt that way about him, too. We've been back together since. The problem that we seem to be having is that each step of increasing commitment, he freaks out. I now think I recognize that they could be emotional flashbacks. My problem is that they are *very angry* emotional flashbacks, and he seems to target me. BF is gentle, funny, and kind in every day life. I'm not sure he loves himself very much, because he tends to take shit from other people who treat him badly and he never says a word. (I'm the one that taught him that healthy boundaries are ""a thing."") I allow him to be mad at me. I never use guilt or shame against him as the bullies in his life do. And because of that, he seems to take all of his anger out on me. Worse, after his flashbacks, he seems to want to distance himself from the anger and the only way to do that is to justify it by thinking that I must be awful and our relationship must be terrible. And then he gives me the silent treatment and actually avoids me. I am not perfect, but I am a huge proponent of giving people more space than they ask for. So I am constantly thinking ""Who does this guy even think he's been arguing with?"" It's not me, I know that. We bought a home together. He felt confident that he and I could get through anything, and that, yes, he had these panicky moments where he doubted everything, but that wasn't him. The trouble is that when he's in this state, there is no convincing him that I am not The Worst Person in the World, that our relationship is not doomed, etc. He flipped out on me on Sunday evening. His kids (teenagers) were with us and he's recently stepped up as a parent and has issued expectations to them about their behavior (doing homework, doing chores, cleaning up after themselves) and, as expected, they are pushing back against it. We knew this would happen, because they are teenagers and because he's been slacking as a father because he felt guilty about subjecting them to the divorce from their mother. What I never expected was that they would, in my view, bully him. I suppose they watched their mother do it for years, so it comes naturally. He is devastated when they are jerks to him. So, Sunday afternoon, he and I were laughing and chasing one another around the kitchen. Things had been so great we were talking about stealing away somewhere and secretly eloping (so his ex couldn't try to ruin it for us). I kissed him goodbye and went out with a friend of mine and was telling her how great everything was. And that he and I had faced some serious issues in the first years of our relationship, so we knew we could get through anything. Except, apparently, what's going on inside of him. Which he doesn't seem to be able to identify as coming form inside of him. The man is angry. I don't think he's angry with me, but he projects something onto me. I came home and we were joking around about something, and then I asked about the pileup of dirty dishes on the counter. His kids chores are supposed to be that one unloads clean dishes from the dishwasher and one hand washes the ones that require that. He freaked out on me. I know it was because the one who was supposed to unload the dishwasher hadn't done it all day, despite repeated requests, and was probably being obstinate about it. I get the sense that he's tied his kids' approval of him in with some sort of core trauma. I don't know what to do. They're teenagers, and if they approve of you, you're probably not being a great parent to them, you know? White hot vitriol started spilling out of him. He looks at me like he hates me and I am his enemy. He swore at me and I told him that I didn't deserve to be spoken to that way. I gathered my things and went upstairs and closed our bedroom door and locked it. He demanded I open it. I said that I would when he apologized for speaking to me that way. And his answer was to kick the door down. I felt scared of him. He then told me that the wedding was off, that he'll never marry me, that our relationship was over and he was sleeping on the couch. I don't know what to do. He's been giving me the silent treatment since Sunday. I've been giving him plenty of space and trying to reach out in small ways, but he rejects them. I know he feels significant shame about his actions. And I don't know what to do about that, because to avoid shame he seems to need to believe he did it for a reason and that reason is me. This hurts, guys. I understand he's feeling really badly, but I'm starting to feel traumatized myself. The most loving caring guy in the world suddenly flips and he hates me. I don't know what will trigger him. Worse, I'm not sure who he's fighting with. He doesn't seem to see me clearly. He avoids me in the home, as if I'm going to invade his space and try to control him, but I don't do that. I went out with friends last night and left him a note that I loved him and would really like to resolve this. I said something about feeling upset and knowing that he was upset too. This morning he says ""I know I haven't been speaking to you. That's not because I'm upset. It's because I'm trying to figure out what I want to do."" That sounds great, right? Except having been through smaller versions of this rodeo before, that means he's trying to get away from me and he'll destroy whatever we've built in order to do it. So that was a veiled threat that he's trying to figure out how to leave me. I calmly said something like ""I understand. But I want you to know that I don't think that any of what happened was about me or about our relationship. I think you took things out on me and at this point, it's become cruel. Before that happened on Sunday we were laughing and running around the kitchen together. You don't get to rewrite history to suit your mood."" It's like he's living on Mars, and I'm still on Earth, and he's trying desperately to convince me and himself that he's still on Earth, but he's very much not because none of this makes any sense. I'd been really worried that he had BPD and had split me black. Then I thought that maybe he just had fleas. Now that I've read about CPTSD, it all makes sense. I think he's triggered by the vulnerability of intimacy, which breaks my heart. Other than me, he seems to date only narcissist women, I presume because they are familiar and ""safe"" and he can't get too close to them. We had, what I thought, was the only healthy, loving, and emotionally intimate relationship he's had. Guys, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say to compel him to seek help for himself. Most of all, I'm so scared. I know that this isn't him, but he won't listen to reason when he's like this. Do you have any advice for me? I'm trying to reach out to friends and family, but even then I feel like I'm scared to say what happened because I'm afraid they'll hate him forever. I'm trying to strike a balance between silence (giving him space) and showing him that I'm not going to come after him, while also trying to take care of myself. I am absolutely worried about him and the torture that he's going through. But I don't think he ever stops to think about what he's putting me through. The man that I love, who I can depend on, just flips a switch and snatches it all away. Worse, he projects all this hatred onto me that doesn't belong to me. And I think his kids were the trigger this time. This feels so frightening to me. It was one thing for his ex or his parents to do something to trigger him, but his kids? That live with us 50% of the time? They can hound him and then he's going to turn around and flip out on me because I'm the only one who doesn't use guilt and shame and thinks that anger is an ok emotion to show (to some degree, obviously)? I'm worried I'm going to get C-PTSD of my own if he doesn't get help. But I don't know if there are some magic words to compel him to do it. I know that in the past, when he's been honest with me, he tells me he's afraid to dig up his past in counseling. And while I understand that, it also makes me feel really awful, because I guess even the possbility of losing me won't be enough for him to address it. And there's the whole ""have a 30 year mortgage together"" thing. The ironic part about it was that he bought the house with me because he knew he was happy with me and we could make it, and that when he has doubts he's usually not himself. So here he is, doing it again, but he's convinced that it's real this time. Sorry if this doesn't make much sense. I'm venting and letting it all out."

I'm trying to help a dear friend who I believe, after a year of research is suffering from CPTSD. A year ago, while my friend was staying with me for a few days, he disclosed some details of his childhood abuse. I was his safest friend to talk to and it wasn't unusual for him to bring up abuse from his past. I told him I believed him and was so sorry that had happened to him and that I was proud of him for sharing with me. He started distancing himself shortly thereafter and when I emailed him a month later asking if things were okay with him and us, he told me our friendship had become too complicated and I was to only contact him for professional reasons (we worked together sometimes too). Three months later I learned he had been telling our business colleagues, mutual friends and his family that I had sexually harassed him when he was staying with me (he's straight, I'm gay, there's zero truth to it and he's since admitted that to a mutual friend). He believes I exploited his vulnerability and depression in order to take advantage of him sexually. He believes I had ulterior motives from day one and was never really his friend. I've made 4-5 attempts to connect over a 12-month period offering to listen and try to work things out. He's refused and uses my efforts to build his case that I am obsessed with him. He's blocked my email, phone and socials. He recently lost his job for refusing to work with me and became so enraged by my last attempt to connect (via snail mail) that he has now told mutual friends he wants to leave town because I've ruined his career and he feels unsafe with me living near him. He's told a mutual friend he feels like his life will never get better. He stopped going to therapy and has totally isolated. His few friends don't know about his abuse like I do and aren't comfortable approaching him about therapy. Obviously, his parents aren't an option to call for assistance. I feel like I am literally the only person who can gently explain what might be happening. All I want to do is give him some info about CPTSD and be there for him the best I can. So, do I risk triggering an emotional flashback and permanent shut out by reaching out again or going to his house? I feel like I'm just allowing him to suffer if I don't try SOMETHING. "

Background, super traumatic childhood and young adulthood, PTSD and CPTSD, and it's ruining my life. I can't work, have friends, or actually enjoy any part of my life because of panic attacks, severe anxiety, paranoia/defensiveness, general vulnerability, and episodes of dissociation. I don't feel like a real person, but I remember what it was like when I did. I've been in therapy on and off for five years with a few different people at well established clinics. It has done nothing at all. I've continued to get worse. Is there anything that will give me measurable results? I feel all alone, hopeless, and like I won't ever see myself again, the real me that is underneath."
