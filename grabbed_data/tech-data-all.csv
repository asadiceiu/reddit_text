In addition to the videos, each project is accompanied by a project outline, project repository, and downloadable resources. Education Ecosystem users can also clone project resources from the platforms Git and run the applications on their own machines. &amp;#x200B; Dr. Michael Garbade is the Founder and CEO of the Education Ecosystem. Education Ecosystem users are able to access all of its projects for free. For developers who are at the intermediate stage, finding great resources to improve their skills can be challenging, Garbade said. There is also a growing need for developers with skills in areas like blockchain technology, cybersecurity and more. Companies are struggling to find enough talented developers to fill the talent gap which currently exists. He said helping to fill that gap is a key priority for the Education Ecosystem. We also offer a developer relations marketing service where tech companies can have content related to their products created on our platform, Garbade said. These projects are then shared with developers on our platform and elsewhere to provide more exposure for our clients products. Since its launch in late 2015, Education Ecosystem has been used by more than 5 million people across 194 countries, and more than 13,000 users have created over 200,000 video tutorials, according to the website. The companys team is made up of engineers, designers, and online marketers who bring tech experience from notable companies such as Amazon, General Electric, and Photobucket."
