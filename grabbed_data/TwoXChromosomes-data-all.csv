0,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,I am just so proud of my husband,1,i88w76,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/i88w76/i_am_just_so_proud_of_my_husband/,2020-08-12 16:42:32,"He's from a small town, raised in the 80s. He's from a good family, but they still had weaknesses. For example, they were very much a ""boys don't cry"" family. My husband is a sensitive man. He tries to hide it because of how he was raised. But for the ten years we've been together I've pushed him to stop denying his feelings. I gave birth to our first child 7 months ago. It was a really hard birth, super traumatic. I was in labor for four days, I refused any meds for 3 days and 12 hours because I was hoping for a natural birth. So my husband was in a front row seat watching me be in the worst pain of my life. I only remember flashes of the labor because it was so painful. One vivid memory is when they gave me oxygen to get my energy up. I had just gotten the painkillers I was desperately trying to avoid so I was able to focus on things other than pain for once. There were nurses all around me, because I had an infection and my blood pressure was a mess and a bunch of other fun things. I noticed my husband was crying. Full blown crying. I took his hand and asked him what was wrong. He said, ""I am so sorry I am so closed off about my feelings. I promise I'll work on it. I promise I'll be a better man for you. I will share my feelings I will be open about my fears."" Even the nurses looked really touched by his vulnerability. I laughed and said, well, dingus, you're literally crying and being open emotionally right now and you're doing a great job so I'm not sure why you're apologizing. It was a sweet moment and, hours later I gave birth. Now all these months later, I'm nursing our boy in the bedroom, my husband comes in all teary eyed and says, ""I just thought about your birth again and how incredibly strong you are and how much I love you and our son and how scary that was. I am scared of death and how I could lose either of you. I love you."" We held each other with our son in my lap, it was such a grand moment. I am so so grateful to have such a sensitive and strong and supportive partner. Thanks for letting me share this."
1,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,A plea to women on Reddit: can we make some noise?,1,i9zr59,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/i9zr59/a_plea_to_women_on_reddit_can_we_make_some_noise/,2020-08-15 12:43:08,"In response to the recent posts here venting about this website, I want to reach out to the women here and maybe start a discussion about the right way to use Reddit as a woman. By that, I mean whether or not we should ignore the misogyny and/or avoid it, or whether a large portion of us need to become active. Of Reddit's rules that apply to the entire site, Rule 1 is to not ""promote hate based on identify or vulnerability."" Now this is pretty vague, but it gives these two examples: - Comment arguing that rape of women should be acceptable and not a crime. - Meme declaring that it is sickening that people of color have the right to vote. So, how is it that a post on the front page today has an active discussion about how women should have their right to vote taken away? With hundreds of upvotes. (I can't link it here, but I don't have to because I know you all believe that this post exists.) But doesn't that fit right amongst Reddit's own examples of content that is not supposed to be here? And behold! Even if you try, there is no way to report this supposed rule-breaking. Breaking ""Rule 1"" is 100% permitted on Reddit. So it's not really a rule is it? The ""Content Policy"" page is just a pretty facade for people Googling Reddit after hearing about it for the first time. There are nearly 13 million members of this subreddit. But moreover, half of all human beings are female. We are not a minority. We are half of the world. It seems to me that there is a lot of firepower here. A lot of geniuses. A lot of skilled writers. A lot of any type of person because we are half of all people, but my point is: why are we waiting for this problem to go away? This is the opposite of a ""just deal with it"" situation, i.e. 1. At odds with our existence 2. Available for change 3. Completely arbitrary in the first place. I'd like to point out that for many of us, the bulk of the hate we encounter is sheltered on the internet. In general, it is accepted in society that you can't be a loud, hateful bigot. So for all those who have been told that you just have to deal with this issue as if it is a fact of life, what a joke! Actually, it's the loud, hateful bigots that have to face the facts about society not accepting them. I understand why some would choose to stay in the select pockets of this website where you won't have to deal with it. But, there should be enough of us to make up for the loss. Can this be enough already? The internet is not ""for boys"". For Christ's sake. Do you know how cringy it felt for me to have to write, ""--the right way to use Reddit as a woman""? This is ridiculous. It would only take a fraction of us to be louder than them. I want to end with this question: Which group of consumers do you think Reddit would have more interest in attracting: little packs of hateful idiots who give it a bad reputation and who generate content advertisers wouldn't touch with a stick? Or half of all people?"
2,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Dating/breaking up with past sexual trauma,1,ij68uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ij68uz/datingbreaking_up_with_past_sexual_trauma/,2020-08-30 13:43:32,"Hi lovely people. I just wanted some insight/solidarity on how yall cope with vulnerability and heartache from past trauma during break ups. I was seeing this guy for three weeks hours FaceTiming, texting everyday, a few dates etc. I shared really personal things about myself, including explicitly talking about one of my assaults. He was incredibly kind, empathetic and so lovely. He also made me feel really cared for and not defined by my trauma. He ended things because a past friend he has history with expressed feelings for him. Im gutted I know it was short, but the depth I shared and the comfort I felt with him intensifies the loss. I dont often feel safe and really like a boy, and I really did with this one. I feel myself trying to blame myself and find fault, ie sharing too much, being insecure, having a lot of hang ups and triggers from my PTSD, etc. I know its not my fault, even though the worst voice in my head insists it is and she is so damn loud. I also know I cling to the idea I caused this because I compulsively seek control since its been stripped of me so often. Im also just afraid to date again (and I know I can and probably will take a break), but at some point Im going to have to share this trauma and open myself up to hurt again. How do yall cope with feelings like this, with trauma while dating and more broadly the loss of someone you really liked? Any responses, including kind words, would be really deeply appreciated right now."
3,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,My high school predator was my favourite history teacher.,2,hkth47,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/hkth47/my_high_school_predator_was_my_favourite_history/,2020-07-04 09:41:37,"TLDR; when I was 17, my high school teacher preyed on me and groomed he so he could take advantage of me. I have never told anyone this...I was recently brought back to what happened when a friend from long ago in high school posted about this teacher being fired for molesting students and being inappropriate in general. I was depressed and came from a bad home life. I cried every day on my way to school from what my mom had said or done to me. And cried on my way home fearing her physical, emotional, and mental abuse. I honestly wanted to kill myself and all I wanted was love. I found an old journal, and Im looking for support right now, because re-reading it is making me an absolute broken, idiot, naive, stupid mess. Im not sure what to disclose as a trigger warning, but I feel like I should add one. January-21-2011 This week has been the best week of my life. There have been moments where I was scared but...in such a short time; I fell in love with him. It grew from teacher, to friend, to a passionate love. I feel like this is honestly the first time Ive been in love, but it hurts so much. I dont know why I love him. I know I love everything about him. He makes me happy, he makes me feel special and good about myself. Not the your pretty good though, but making me feel like I can change the world. I am ignoring every other factor, His age, the fact that he has kids, its illegal, hes my teacher and how scared I am. I love him, and you dont know how good it feels to tell him that. He told me to follow my heart, and I followed him all the way into the history office and kissed him. It was like magic. It scared me at first because it was so intense...this was Tuesday and its Friday now. Each day we have met in the history office, in (redacted) class or in his room after school...for a very thrilling 20 minutes. I feel a need to be with him, physically and emotionally. He is mine and I want it that way. Right now...Im more scared then I have been in my entire life. Hes obviously sick. There was the week where he was gone four days, and that wasnt good. Today he told me there was something wrong with his spine and heart. We talk about making love. Im scared for a number of reasons, being so open physically and emotionally and the vulnerability. But I want to. He even said that it might keep him longer, not to make me do it but just as a fact. I love this man so much I swear I will give him anything. In the back of my head Im wondering if this is so intense because I worry he will leave me soon...and Im not sure. Any moment I spend with him is amazing...and it will be stolen away soon. Today in class he told me he has weeks to live. I was upset and told him he cant go, and he said ill miss you. Tonight he told me that I had to let go of him. He wanted to stop us so that I wouldnt be hurt and it would be easier. I dont care how much time we have together, I want to make the most of it. I want to be the last woman he loves. I will never in my entire life forget him. It hurts so much to think of not being with him. When he leaves, what will I do? How will I feel...how will I live? I feel like everything will make me think of him and I will feel broke inside...I need him in my life. He cant let us go early; physically we have been together four days but the extent that I feel for him...Im so scared because I feel so alone. No one will understand when he leaves who can I talk to? They wont know why Im so upset. How will I move on like he told me? Will I value each day and be positive like he was? Will I find love as strong as ours...will I eventually get over it? I am sad, and I am hurt. But weather he leaves me in two weeks, or two years I love him. No one will understand but like Rose from titanic said a womans heart is an ocean of secrets. No one would understand how I loved everything he does. Everything he says, how he thinks and acts, what he likes. I will be strong, and I know I will be okay. Theres no way I can get through this if I dont believe that. (I continue to think of Mr. Magoriums wonder emporium) I will show him somehow how much I love him and how important he is to me. He has taught me life lessons, he taught me to trust myself, to believe in myself, and how to love. He is bringing my walls down and making me trust him, feel things I never thought possible. I cant do anything to change this, so I have to make the best of what was given to me. I will love him as long as god lets me, but I still ask to please not die. I just want something to remember you by so I know it wasnt all in my head. Something I can touch and keep, and love. Everything good comes to an end."
4,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Men &amp; Vulnerability,1,hgth94,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/hgth94/men_vulnerability/,2020-06-27 23:27:21,"So there's this r/AskReddit post going around about why men don't talk about their problems. I was late to the party, I've lost the comment I wanted to reply to, these thoughts about what I consider a crucially misunderstood issue won't leave my mind in a hurry and I have some stuff to say. So, this is going to be a rant, it's going to be long, I apologise in advance. Here goes: It seems to me that a lot of people turn men repressing their feelings into an isolated-success-vs-failure issue, e.g. ""women do/don't like men who cry"", or ""I will/won't receive support from my friends when I open up"" therefore ""opening up is good/bad"", which is totally missing the point. Every single person that has ever existed has been vulnerable at some point in their lives. We all have emotions, and all inevitably feel things we don't want to feel. There's just no way around that. Now, when someone like myself (a woman in her 20's) claims that she appreciates a man who is willing to be vulnerable, it means I appreciate the effort it took to find a better coping mechanism than ""*Warning: emotion undesirable. PUSH-AWAY protocol initiated.*"" In other words, the skills (and the willingness to learn) to manage one's own emotions. You know, the skills everyone and anyone needs to become a reasonably happy and healthy person. Contrary to saddeningly popular belief, ignoring the emotions you don't know what to do with is **not** a solution, and **will** fuck you over later down the line. That said, the experiences of those who have repeatedly tried and failed to cross this bridge are **absolutely valid**. There are plenty of places and communities that will enforce (sometimes by terrifying means) the status-quo of the stoic, masculine man who isn't fazed by anything. And finding a way to communicate your need for support isn't easy, even to a person who is willing to listen. A lot of men in long-term relationships make the mistake of giving their partner (and often their partner only) the responsibility package of being their therapist, their comfort blanket, and their rock - which is overwhelming to deal with, especially since a lot of men who have been repressing things their entire lives open up in a very explosive, jarring fashion. Other trusted individuals, such as best friends, mentors, even celebrities we look up to are also thrust into these situations. When someone simply doesn't have the skills to even begin sorting through their own pain, it doesn't seem unreasonable ask someone else to do it for them, but the sheer magnitude of the need pushes people away. Which, understandably, feels like a huge betrayal and discourages many from ever doing it again. BUT - it's hugely important that we are considerate of our helpers. Those who have been in a high-stakes supportive role will know that it takes a whole lotta patience, empathy and wisdom to be there are the right time, provide space at the right time, say the right things, etc. These situations are volatile, and progress is elusive. Situations where a well-meaning helper ends up the victim of abuse (intentional or unintentional) are not unheard of, and vice versa. The non-damaging versions of both helping and being helped require pretty substantial skill sets of their own. So if you work up the courage to ask someone to help you work through some things, please remember that them agreeing to do so is committing a potentially draining experience. I want to make it crystal clear that I'm not discouraging asking for help, I am encouraging appreciation for the help we receive. After all, if we're going to sacrifice time and effort to help someone, it's going to be someone we care about. I am aware balancing these things with the people you know irl isn't always an option, in which case we have no choice but to look to external resources, which can have the prerequisite of ""manufacturing"" the necessary trust to break down all the barriers that prevent us from facing them ourselves. This adds another layer of hardship and complexity, especially in environments that look down upon seeking avenues such as a therapist or a support group. There is also the very real danger of finding a community that preys on desperate outliers for its own gain. So what the hell do we do? The disappointingly realistic answer is: it depends. On who you are, what the people around you are like, what resources are available to you, and, last but not least, what you are willing to do to better yourself. Make no mistake, becoming happier takes a lot of grueling internal work, which is something NO ONE CAN DO FOR YOU. Even with all the help in the world, the crucial healing process is something **you** need to commit to. Otherwise, nothing is going to change. It's the combination of the support you need and the determination to learn and improve that's going to grant results. Often we have one but not the other. So, we keep looking. We keep trying. You are probably capable of more than you realise, and there **are** helpers out there - people that understand, that you **can** find common ground with, that **will** listen. I promise you, they exist. OK, I've run out of steam, so I'm going to wrap this up. The best advice I can give you is this: you matter, and you deserve to be happy. No matter who you are. You may think you have all this proof that you are a horrible person that the world would be better off without, but one of the best things we can ever do for ourselves (and others!) is leave room for growth, and that is a hill I will die on. \*\*\* As a small disclaimer - this post is about men, but the content doesn't apply to men only. In case there was any confusion. I've posted here as well as in r/MensLib to provoke a wider variety of perspectives (provided this gains any amount of attention). Also, I invite anyone with resources that may help anyone struggling with the stuff I've talked about to post links in the comments. Thank you."
5,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,"Guy asked me to have sex. Should I reach out his GF, and how should I approach it?",1,gdczlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/gdczlb/guy_asked_me_to_have_sex_should_i_reach_out_his/,2020-05-05 00:52:23,"tldr; a guy i worked with talks about wanting to propose to his girlfriend. during the last project him and i worked on, he asked me if i would have sex with him. im struggling on whether or not i should tell her, and if so, how? Over the last few years, I used to work on artistic projects with this guy. He always gave me a bit of a strange feeling but never explicitly said or did anything to make me feel that way in the beginning. Hes ~10 yrs older than me and it was a new artistic medium i was getting into, so i chalked it up to just feeling nervous about the newness of it all. We worked on maybe 4 projects together total. i noticed that a lot of the work he did with other peoples tended to lean towards being more risqu but it hadnt gotten that way with me as thats not really something im comfortable with. i knew that he was in a ltr with his girlfriend and that they lived together. ive never met her but hes talked about her. i made a point of asking about her every time we worked together, and he always said that he wants to propose but they were struggling in the bedroom so he wasnt sure. that always felt like tmi to me but i just dismissed it. on the last project we did, we were literally alone with nobody else around. he started asking me sexual questions while we were working which made me feel weird and i just kind of ignored. he then tried to turn the project to be more risqu like the others. we hadnt talked about this beforehand but we were alone with nobody around and in the middle of working so i panicked and agreed, which i deeply regret. as we were walking back to the car he mentioned that if we were both single in x amount of years we should get together and i sheepishly agreed because i just felt so uncomfortable i didnt really know what to do. i know i shouldnt have and i know i should have stood up for myself but i was feeling so unsettled. on the drive home, he asked if i would have sex with him. i said no. i said i had a boyfriend (i did) that i lived very much (i didnt). he asked if i was sure i wanted to say no, and i pressed the no. he didnt ask about his girlfriend but i should have. i just wanted to get home. this last incident happened about a year ago and i just now blocked and deleted him on everything because i realized how truly inappropriate and uncomfortable that all was, and i would never be able to push past it and open up on an artistic level with this person again. that requires a sense of vulnerability i am no longer comfortable sharing with him. he did manage to reach out on a different account and express confusion on why i blocked him out of the blue, but i didnt respond. id rather just leave it in the past. now my issue lies in whether or not i should reach out to his girlfriend. i know her name and i know her fb and instagram handle. although i dont know her, i imagine if i was in her situation id want someone to tell me. even though he cant make those advances with me anymore he still works almost exclusively with women and could easily be making those remarks to any of them, and who knows what could happen. i dont really know how to approach the subject with her, or even if i should. advice is welcomed please!"

Her vagina is closing off because her HEART is closed off. Her nipples are retreating into themselves because she cannot put herself out there.

I had worked with my therapist for weeks on the visit, being prepared to let the family member know about my childhood trauma since it was relevant. It ended up being a bust, I came back early from what was supposed to be a week-long visit. I felt exhausted, drained, and dejected. My close'ish friend who knew about the visit FaceTimed me to see how I was doing after returning. I never told her about what I went through growing up since I haven't shared it with many, but, in that moment of raw emotion and vulnerability, I decided to tell her what happened in my childhood. Now, I've told a handful people in my life  boyfriends, close friends, family  but they all reacted in ways that averaged out to ""wow that sucks, I'm sorry,"" not that there's anything wrong with that. But, for the first time in my life, someone actually cried hearing my story. And for the first time ever, I felt seen and understood in a way that couldn't ever be articulated with words. It wasn't until later that I realized how meaningful that moment was not only for my personal growth, but the development of our friendship. I still tear up thinking about that moment she became my best friend. I just wanted to celebrate this intimate moment of female companionship with everyone "

I never once doubted my decision. I knew it was what was best for all of us. No one would benefit from going forward; a clear and simple answer. So why does every cheesy Mothers Day ad leave me hollow and disconnected? Its probably just the fact that I havent seen my own mother since February, right? That my Grandmother is alone; she looked so tried on the call. Ive only just begun to unravel the tangle of our relationship, and Im so afraid its too late. Maybe its that I havent spoken to the woman, who was a second mother to me, in a little over 6 months. The knowledge that her own advise (to move forward and not look back) means I may never get to share in her wisdom again. Thats why Im crying at the images of mothers, daughters, children? These deep animal sobs are just the isolation doing me in, right? Not the ebbing tide of hormones still washing thru my body. Not the subtly altered cradle of my hips. Not the stack of insurance forms on my desk. The course of action was never in doubt, never questioned. There were no what ifs or maybes. It was never a question, only ever a statement of fact. So why do I feel so empty? Hollowed out? A pumpkin scrapped clean and carved into a mockery of smile. I alway professed my faith in science and choice; loudly. An unshakeable, unsentimental, unquestioned understanding of cellular division. Yet I find myself in mourning for something I cant define or express. Homesick for a place Ive never been. I never could have given you what deserved. Nor could I wish upon you a world imploding. You shouldnt have to suffer for my unregulated brain chemistry, or pay the price for my attempts at connection. Its uncertain whether or not Ill survive them. Yet, you gave me an unexpected grace. You were there in the harshly lit waiting rooms, on cold tables, and hospital corridors. Thru the blood draws and deniles. The countless, sleepless nights, and the crying behind the wheel. The only witness to my isolation (safety in solitude). A lesson in humility, vulnerability, and the unexpected empathy of strangers. You gave me prospective, and taught me the power in asking for help. So maybe on this day when we celebrate the strong women who mold us, I can begin to let myself feel this. Maybe I can find the strenght to be kind to myself. To recognize the love in inherent in deciding to end this, end you. Perhaps I can allow myself to grieve mutating cells and all they carried with them. So Im sorry, and I love you. Thank you. "
9,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Slut shaming,1,gm2qms,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/gm2qms/slut_shaming/,2020-05-19 00:44:51,"TRIGGER WARNING Slut shaming is a well discussed topic in feminist groups and Id like to share my stories and hear other peoples. I have recently began thinking about this when my sister was made out to be a problem in her work for reporting cases of sexual harassment. It got me thinking about the vulnerability of young women and the acceptance of predatory behaviour. The first time I was called a Slut I was 13. I was branded this because I was in a relationship with a 17/18 Y/O (M). This lead to pretty severe bullying spearheaded by other girls my age. This became so awful I would have upwards of five panic attacks a day. I was too scared to even use the toilets at school and would end up bleeding through during my period because I was so afraid to go in. I WASNT A SLUT I WAS GROOMED My friend was called a slut because she was filmed in the school changing rooms while getting undressed, the girl who videoed her was found trying to upload the video to YouTube by her father who thankfully reported this to the school. The girl was suspended for 2 weeks then allowed back. SHE WAS NOT A SLUT SHE WAS A VICTIM When I was 14 and reading Of Mice And Men a teacher laughed when an other student referred to me as Curlys Wife. I WAS NOT PROMISCUOUS I WAS A CHILD When I was 15 I met an 18Y/O (M) he had no job and relied on me for money, he would tell me when I looked bad in pictures and would tear down my self esteem. When I left him he described intimate details of my body to our friends. 6 years later he still does. When I was 16 I passed out at a party an 18/19 Y/O (M) took advantage of me. Once again I was branded a slut. When I was 20 a friend of a friend tried to kiss me in a bar and I said no. His girlfriend then began calling me awful names and warned my boyfriend that I was a slut and a horrible person. As Ive gotten older the more I have realised how these particular events have affected me and my need to try and stop this happening to other young girls is only getting stronger. *I apologise for my terrible writing skills*"

Everything for the first eight months was an absolute dream. Id never been so certain someone was my soulmate. Id never trusted someone so deeply, never allowed myself to be so utterly myself, so vulnerable, with another person. But it might as well have been just a dream  because then I found out hed been lying to me. Presenting himself one way while behaving sexistly behind my back with his bro. Told me up and down it was a lapse in judgement and a result of just trying to impress the guy while not having many friends due to his life circumstances changing. Give him the benefit of the doubt. He cuts this friend out, moves forward and does everything I ask to try and rebuild trust. Except he continues to show impatience with me having trust issues. Flash forward, were quarantined together now. Im literally trapped with him. I catch him hiding something from me again. Another lie. Juvenile behavior. Obsessed with video games. Cant uphold the smallest of promises to me. His word now means nothing. His claims of honesty mean nothing. He has no moral backbone against the things that matter to me  rejecting the isms in life. Hes utterly apathetic about everything. Why should he care? It doesnt affect him. Hes never been a minority. I cant see him the same anymore. I used to feel such an incredible magnetic attraction to him. In the beginning he acted so different. He presented himself as this mature, sensitive, sophisticated, nurturing, emotionally intelligent man. Now I can only see an immature, emotionally dense, insufferably lazy, inconsiderate boy. What happened to the man I fell in love with??? Was it all just a lie? I feel like Ive woken up into a nightmare. How do people do this to other people? How do they pretend to be something theyre not and lead you on and colonize your vulnerability... for what??? Weve talked endlessly. Weve done couples therapy. He tries to be more patient, more understanding, more kind and loving, even while continuing to find ways to let me down. Nothing seems to change the fact that I simply cant see him the same way anymore. I dont know this person. And I cant even leave. Ive made a horrible mistake. I feel like Im drowning."

12,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,My past is making it very hard to connect with a man I care about (tw: abuse),1,g3pyg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/g3pyg8/my_past_is_making_it_very_hard_to_connect_with_a/,2020-04-19 02:08:01,"Hi all! I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place, but I would to share with other women. I unfortunately have few female friends, and the ones I have do not share my experiences in this matter. It's always hard for me to share thoughts and feelings, being a rather private person, and even more so ones that make me feel weak and vulnerable. I think this behavior is partly my personality, but it was also necessary for my survival in the very abusive household I grew up in. Besides being physically harmed my whole childhood, I had no privacy in my mother's home, no affection, no support, and never heard a positive word about myself. I had been made to believe I was the root cause of every problem that existed in the ""family"", whether it be her own unhappiness, her suicidal tendencies, my absent father or even the bad reputation she suffered among relatives. I left when I was 16 and managed to (mostly) heal and build a life and circle I thrive in, and am proud of. However, I have been left with almost non-existent self-esteem, and a fear of letting other people have any hold over me at all. Several months ago, my relationship with the man I was convinced I would spend my life with ended. We had been off-and-on again for five years, but looking back I can see we were never truly good together. He is not a bad person, but he was a very bad partner, and the relationship turned toxic- flirting with abusive, at any rate extremely damaging to me. He was distant, egoistical, temperamental,dishonest and much, much less committed than I was. He could be cruel, perhaps not intentionally, and he certainly took advantage of my feelings, devotion, and vulnerability. I behaved badly towards him as well, and hated myself for doing so. It took me months to recover from this, but I thought I mostly did. Until a month ago. A month ago, just as the pandemic started to unfold, I accepted a walk in the woods with Tinder date with whom I'd spoken only a little. In a turn of events that surprised me enormously, it was the most fun I'd had with a man in a very long time. We've been dating since then. It's been really good. Because of the circumstances, things have moved much more quickly than they would in a normal world. He's been quarantined at his parents' house in my hometown, so he's had little distraction but me. I suspect this has made him more keen than he would usually have been, but then I have also had more time than usual, so it doesn't bother me too much. It's really a good match. I find it easy to talk to him, he is very smart, funny, communicative and he seems kind so far. I also find him very attractive, and the sex is excellent. We've been keeping things casual and haven't spoken about a future after the pandemic, and there's been some mention of feelings, but neither of us are in love- at least not yet. I know he is someone I could fall in love with very easily, so I have not been letting myself get too attached. I am truly trying to relax and spend time with him, to enjoy myself in a healthy way with a good man. I've become afraid I can't do it. I have been noticing behaviors in myself that worry me. It was hard for me to relax in his company at first, but even when I did it was never in full. There's always some insecurity that I'm not being fun enough, or attractive enough, or smart enough. I can live with that by telling myself other people don't perceive it that way, but the closer we get, the more insecurities stemming from my ex's treatment of me get in the way. Yesterday evening, I was cooking while he was working at my desk. We were silent as he was concentrated, and I was slicing some onions while all of a sudden my hands started shaking so bad I had to put down my knife. All of a sudden I was horribly afraid that he would get annoyed at the sounds of my cutting stuff, that he would realize he couldn't concentrate with me moving around in the same room. I was anxious of being a burden, and afraid of being snapped at, or worse. A few days ago we were lying in bed and started fooling around, but I wasn't in the mood for sex, so we stopped. The moment he took me in his arm to go to sleep I felt a horrible wave of guilt for leading him on and not sleeping with him. My ex and I were barely having sex in the last months and he never made a secret of how much he resented me for that. There's been a lot of these moments, although I've been rather careful to not put myself in the kind of situation I would usually experience them. I'm rather independent anyway, but I've been especially cautious, always doing everything myself so I wouldn't need to ask the smallest thing of him. In part because I'm afraid of being refused, but also and especially because I don't want him to think I'm a bother in any way. I got quite emotional a week ago (my PMS affects me very much), and told him I was getting feelings for him but wouldn't be getting attached, and we checked in with each other on how it was going. I was a good conversation, but I felt guilty about forcing him to have such a conversation for a week. I always worry I'm just not enough. Not good enough to keep a man interested, to be loved. No interesting enough to keep anyone entertained. Not beautiful enough, not successful enough, not casual enough, not fun enough...This morning he casually mentioned swiping on Tinder, and though I'm honestly not jealous, since I don't really need exclusivity and we've been keeping things casual anyway, it confirmed my fears of my own inadequacy. I don't know what to do. I'm honestly trying to be with this man I really care about. It's been easier and safer with him than with anyone else. I'm just terribly afraid this means I can't do it at all. I'm starting to think I'm really better off alone, which I don't mind being anyway. I'm thinking of ending things now to spare myself grief in the future. For those of you having read through this, first of all, thank you. I need advice: have any of you been able to have a healthy relationship after having gone through abuse? Can you share how if you did? Should I end things now? I just really needed to type it all out somewhere, and anonymously. Thank you for allowing me to vent. Anything you have to say will help!"

I'm just here to vent, maybe get some advice on this situation that I am in. Some backstory, I was violently sexually assaulted by a close friend when I was younger (11yo) and it has had lasting effects on me both physically and mentally. It's been well over a decade and I've mostly been able to move past it, with the occasional snag or reminder here and there. Overall, life has been good. My husband (married about a year) knows about the assault. He knows about the effects it has had on me and that sometimes my reactions to things are tainted by the anxiety I have stemming from it. He has watched me struggle some days, has held me while I break down over trying on an outfit that shows too much skin. He is kind and compassionate and loving. The other day, he made a mistake. Morning sex is common for us, especially on days when we both are able to sleep in or otherwise have a decent amount of time before work. This morning was no different. We woke up and were chatting in bed, cuddled up together while I read on my phone. He asked if I was up for sex, which I answered with, ""maybe in a few minutes"". He accepted this answer, as my maybes are more often that not yeses. However, maybe ten minutes later, he started touching me. Also not unusual, so I let it be. He started with stroking my stomach, my waist. Nothing terrible. It was nice, it felt good. But then he reached for my vulva to finger me without asking and with no warning. I immediately panicked and shoved his hand away. I sat up and just had to look away from him because I just instantly felt so *violated*. He also panicked a bit, asking me what was wrong and if I was okay. I said no, truthfully. After a moment to collect myself, I explained that I was completely uncomfortable with how he had just touched me and that it reminded me of when I had been raped. He was devastated. He apologized profusely and tried his best to comfort me, but I told him I just needed some space. We barely touched the remainder of that day, and very little the day after. He keeps apologizing to me. He knows he messed up and is taking full ownership of this mistake, and I do totally forgive him. I understand that he made a mistake and I won't vilify him for that. But it's resurfaced memories for me. It has resurfaced pain and vulnerability and this intense feeling of discomfort that I never wanted to feel with my spouse. He respects me so much more than my rapist ever did, but I still feel so violated. We were able to be intimate earlier and it was fine, but I can't shake these awful feelings that have cropped back up after so long. I don't want to have to look at him and tell him he's reminded me of my rapist. I don't want to have to say no to sex (very good sex, I may add) because of a long-past trauma and a rapist that still haunts me. I hate that I'm still so broken over it. I hate that it is affecting my marriage. It's not fair to either of us, but I know if I tell him all of this, it will just make him feel worse and that's the last thing I want. I feel like I'm overreacting, but I don't know what else to do. Sorry for the long post, but any words of advice or encouragement would be much appreciated."

That it's not nearly the same as punting a girI between the legs either, that it's far more visceral and personal and symbolic when you have vulnerable internal organs, that are THE manifestation of your sex, your manhood, your vulnerability, your identity dangling between your legs, that get smushed and compressed and caught between your own body and whatever is hitting you? That there is a greater sense of identification with those parts for boys than for girls because they're external, that there is a great fear of loss, a great sense of vulnerability, an immense sense of humiliation when that vulnerability gets revealed and exploited, a sense of futility and identity loss, because of the insane pressure to be ""invulnerable"" as a guy, because of the sacrifices you have to make while holding up that facade, which turn out to be for nothing when you get exposed? That maybe girls and women can't fully empathize with that? That just because you can't empathize doesn't mean it's ""ego"", or that those feelings are immature or invalid?

I'm so tired of people saying this. That women only date assholes and that the ""nice guys"" can't get a shot. (I have a lot to say about ""nice guys"" but let's not get me on that roll.) This can also be the case in same sex relationships or a female narcissist and male victim, however I have only experienced heterosexual relationships from this angle and will be speaking from here. It's all I got. The ""assholes"" that sad, bitter men refer to when scolding women for getting their hearts broken? They're called narcissists. I know many of you already know this. But a lot of people don't and that's why it keeps happening. Narcissists are incredibly dangerous. Not always physically, but certainly mentally. And emotionally? Fuhgeddaboudit. The basic definition of narcissistic personality disorder is: a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others. Tell me if this sounds familiar. First off, I'm going to guess that those of you who have been through this type of relationship are emotional, vulnerable, open about how you're feeling almost all the time, caring and giving. Not always perfect, but you care about people and you want what's best for those around you. You love to laugh, have a lot of fun doing simple things with the people you love. And you also want to do adventurous things, especially with your partner. Am I close? The narcissist when you first meet him (or her)...my god. He is everything you've ever wanted. He also seems emotional, vulnerable, open about how he's feeling (he might even cry talking about family trauma!), caring and giving. He doesn't seem perfect as a person but boy oh boy does he seem perfect for you! He acknowledges all you do for others. He makes you laugh, he loves to sit at home with you and do nothing, but he also talks about all the adventures you'll go on together! Am I close? THAT IS THE MAN WE FALL IN LOVE WITH. I don't know how many times we need to scream it from the mountaintops, we DIDN'T KNOW he was an asshole when we met him. And that's not because we're gullible, or weak, or idiots, or attracted to assholes. Narcissists are attracted to US. They see our vulnerability. They can physically feel how we feel about them, they can see how they make us feel and it makes them feel so powerful. They feed off of that power. They listen intently and tuck away little nuggets of information in the back of their minds so they know exactly what they need to do in specific situations to get us and keep us hooked. They know the right words to say and exactly how to say them to create the desired effect. They're fanTASTIC actors and really really smooth mothertruckers. But. They can only keep this up for so long because that ""good guy"" facade is exhausting. Not that it matters, because once they've got us they don't even need to try anymore. They can blame it on depression, or YOU, or outside forces. Never themselves. Never taking responsibility for their manipulation. Nothing is ever their fault. One of the best things they say is ""you knew who I was when you got with me"". As if to put it completely back on you and your bad judgement for falling for his bullshit. And we stay. We stay because we think the real him is the him we met initially. We think we'll get him back. We think that WE DID SOMETHING WRONG to create this monster he has become and we have to fix it by being ""better"". And in relationships with narcissists, your relationship is a cult and he is the leader. When you question him, you're disloyal. When you tell him he's hurt you, you shouldn't have made him. And when you tell him you want to leave, he becomes the man you met once more. To hook you again. Short story time: My ex never wanted to make out with me. He knew I loved it so much, it's one of my favorite things. We went months without making out, just pecking here and there. One night we were out and he said some nasty things to me and I got upset. Then he kissed me more passionately than he ever had. I literally turned beet red and said, ""Why don't you do that more often?"" And he said, ""Well, I can't let you expect it all the time, can I?"" We do not choose assholes. They choose us. We feed their ego because all we want to do is please them. And when they tell us we haven't or we feel like we haven't, we beg and plead and apologize to THEM for not being better. They put themselves down in order to garner your praise. Call themselves worthless, idiots, unattractive and undesireable so you tell them how wrong they are. And they refuse to let us go because they need what we supply to them. And the reason we keep dating guys that are seemingly all the same and end up the same is because no matter what we do, we will always attract narcissists. For a while we just keep thinking ""this one will be different"" and then we keep being proven wrong over and over. It's only when we actually start to see the signs that we can steer clear of them. Look for the red flags, even if he seems kind and genuine. I'm not saying distrust every man, but you have to protect yourself. You can't always see them, but listen....TRUST your friends. TRUST the people who know him who tell you he's no good. Don't so easily surrender your trust to a man who is trying to win your affections and refuse to trust the ones who have seen his true colors when they break out the color chart. They are wrong. The pain you feel is not your fault. And they will make you feel like they have all the answers and you don't need to talk to anyone else about your relationship because it's PRIVATE...but THEY ARE WRONG. Please please talk to people you trust when something doesn't seem right. Or it feels too good to be true, because it just might be. You. Are. Worthy. Of. Better."

Blog medicine. Facebook medicine. Bullshit medicine. I recently had a lady ask me to check into a blog post she found that told her her picky eater of a toddler was both her fault and an indication that the toddler was to suffer anxiety and depression at their tender age. It was on a popular parenting website. This isn't new. This happens all the time. People turn to google. It might be to inform themselves before going to the doctor. It might be because medical costs are high enough that people seek out the cheaper option of Dr Google. It might be because someone has fed them the misinformation that real doctors are not to be believed. It might simply be because they're scared and can't help themselves. Or it might be because they're not getting the important answers to their suffering they're seeking the conventional way, and they don't know where else to turn. Most people do not know how to identify a bunk or severely skewed article when they see one, and these blog medicine bullshitters profit from this. If there are people in the world I hate on sight, it's those that prey on people's vulnerability - and what makes a person more acutely vulnerable than concerns about their health or the health of their children? This blog post I looked into... The hallmarks were there: * Blame. Fear mongering. It's the anxious mother's fault - insinuated, of course, as that's more effective. The consequences are dire - never what you'd want for your child. * A ""study"" that looked into ""over 900 children"". Sure, that may be... So why didn't the author link the study, like they did all these other people's ""how to deal with your picky eater"" projects? No link to the study. No name of the study. No names of the, as referenced, ""researchers"". Not even a date on the blog post that would help you search up this study. Makes it nice and hard to fact check the blog post. * And a byline. A good ol' byline from the author of the blog post that promotes their online learning service - complete with a link. A byline that provides another link to their book you can buy. Fuck you author. F.U.C.K Y.O.U. On sight, I don't trust you. But the average person will fall into your trap: you've spun it so well. You sell scared people on fear mongering bullshit and profit from it. If these sorts of blog medicine posts are based on something that actually exists, you can bet your arse they're writing their article from the point of view of someone who, at the very least, wants to confirm their own bias. I did manage to find this study. Yes, there were parents of over 900 children in the initial consultation of this retrospective analysis. By the follow up - on which they based their deductions on developing mental health concerns among children under school age - there were only 188 children. They also focused on to two types of children: the child with sensory sensitivity to the world, not just food, and the child who was facing some other detriment of their picky eating. Their concern was not on the picky eating toddler who was otherwise fine - as the blog post liked to suggest they were. The article about the study also made a *point* of indicating causal relationships had more to do with family dysfunction as a result of concern over the child - that *that* was where the child was getting their anxiety from. Not, as this blog post wanted to proclaim, that the mother with anxiety troubles was somehow causing all of this just by existing. That their child was, just because they were a picky eater, going to end up anxious and depressed. It angers me to no end that people put this shit up on the internet, leading scared people to think one thing, when they've depicted it for the benefit of no one but themselves. It angers me that my initial response to people who bring my attention to these things can't be: ""well that sounds like a load of cock."" It angers me that when pregnant mothers search up some food they just ate because it was the only thing their body was telling them they could keep down, find in the results that fucking rice is going to abort their child. Where is the part in those articles that getting food poisoning from freshly cooked rice in the western world is really not much more likely to make you extremely sick than every other goddamn time you've eaten rice? Not there. Nope. Because it's better to make mothers feel like every bloody thing they can do is wrong - at least, for the people who sell books on this crap. People who are concerned about the rare negative effects of vaccinating their children find this crap. People who wonder why they have a sudden headache they've never had before get told they're about to die - and what ""natural remedies"" can save them - no mention of the fact that cocaine and opiates are about as ""natural goddamn remedies"" as those ones they sell you on (though, PSA: cocaine is not generally all that beneficial for anything, and don't take opiods for a migraine). People who have been suffering for a long time something that isn't easily diagnosed get pulled into bullshit scams that tell them getting the toxins out of their bodies is going to fix it. People who want to lose weight are fed simplified consumer medicine explanations of how to do so. Babies get essential oils squirted up their noses and into their eyes because some stupid fucking blog wanker sold parents on the idea that that was going to help. Why? Because they get money for it. Because they get to pretend they're smarter than doctors. Because they get an ego boost. Because they can tell you they're better parents than you - they're better anything than you.

She was in the previous relationship for about 2 years. It was clear that she was still attached to her ex when we first started dating - she has said that she still loves him. I was fine with this. I totally understand that you can have feelings for someone you've spent such a large amount of your life with. A few months into our relationship, my girlfriend met up with him a couple of times. &amp;#x200B; We had a rough patch and were technically separated for about a week. She slept with her ex (not me) during this time. We get back together and she continues messaging and meeting up with him occasionally. I'm still ok with everything at this point. I know that they've slept together but we were pretty clearly broken up when they did. I'm also still fine with the messaging and hanging out because I trust her to be committed while we are dating and don't want to control who she sees and talks to. I was playing on her phone and see a message notification from him. Curiosity gets the best of me and I end up scrolling through a bit of the message thread - I see him saying things like, ""I love you and want to try again if you're up for it"" and her inviting him on a trip to Italy, her home country. This bothers me a lot and so I confront my girlfriend about it. &amp;#x200B; We end up having an argument over it (more crying than yelling). She says he knows a lot about her and she can't just stop talking to him. I tell her that it hurts me knowing that she continues to keep close contact with someone who she has feelings for and who has feelings for her.

Id spent a lot of time trying to answer a related question: what does I love you really mean? Perhaps because of this uncertainty, I use the phrase more sparingly than other English-speakers. Even though I consider most of my extended family delightful, I'm not one to bandy the phrase around with cousins, aunts, and the like. Furthermore, I don't have any friendships of the sort that would exchange these words casually. My predominant experience with saying it is as a closing to phone calls with my mom and siblings, but in that case the phrase is so taken for granted that its merged with the farewell following it to create loveyoubye. As if there werent enough meaning in the three words separately to merit a pause for breath. When I was 18, I repeated it when my boyfriend of three months said it to me. It was my first real romance, and I was so elated at the time that it never occurred to me to wonder if what I'd said was ""true"". About a year later, he told me that he had spoken too soon, because what he felt for me now was so much deeper and more intense than what he had felt then. My feelings had evolved similarly over that time, but I would never have thought to myself, much less intimated, that what we whispered to each other back then, in the midst of a stolen afternoon alone in my childhood home, was a mistake. The precise composition of emotions I was naming changed dramatically over the course of our five years together, but I love you always felt right. I think what I intended to express is somewhere close to you are wonderful and I offer you all I can give. And as we grew and learned one anothers intricacies, I simply had more to offer, more to give. Lately and for only the second time in my life, the phrase has been asserting itself in my mind. It happens when I think about the man Ive been seeing on a less-than-semiweekly basis since October. Some of the intervening infatuations, crushes, lovers, and boyfriends that followed my first love have enthralled me for longer stretches than this, but what I felt for those people was more transactional: ""you might be wonderful; I offer you anything that will make you like me more."" With this one though, the impulse is just to give--without calculation, expectation, or hesitation--the natural runoff from the joy his existence engenders in me. Confining this fact to my private thoughts and tawdry poetry sufficed, for a time. Then I began to notice that my usual gestures of affection seemed wrong, like I was trying to cram kisses, embraces, and near-synonyms like ""adore"" into a hole in the universe that was shaped like ""I love you"". But I held back, thinking of all the reasons to hesitate: it was too soon, I couldn't be sure of my own feelings, I doubted he felt the same, and I couldn't guess how he'd react. But last night, as I was falling asleep with his arms around me, those reasons to hesitate didn't seem so dire. I didn't consider the opposite, my reasons for wanting to tell him, until it was too late. After I said it, I paused for a moment, intending to follow up with something to the effect of ""you don't have to say it back, and it doesn't change anything between us."" But before I could get the words out, I already sensed him responding. Normally my nocturnal murmurings are met with a settling, almost melting, of his body into the hollows of mine, sometimes accompanied by a light squeeze or peck on the shoulder. This time, he felt mechanically rigid as he whispered back ""I love you too."" ""You don't have to say that,"" my words came out more accusing than I meant them to; in trying to fill the hole in the universe, I felt like I'd tumbled through it myself. ""Okay"" was all he said. I wish I had just left it there. But I mistook my feeling of disappointment for a sign that my mission was left unfinished. That there was any ambiguity in his reply. ""...What I meant was, you don't have to say that unless you mean it."" In the darkness, he probably couldn't tell that even the tips of my ears had flushed pink. ""I knew what you meant. And I loved that you understood."" If he melted into me then, I was too numb to feel it. Simultaneously numb and exposed, like some glob of organic matter that had flopped out of its petri dish and splatted on the lab bench. I don't think he meant to sound mocking. Pretending to sleep provided me ample time to conduct a postmortem. Clearly, I'd failed to prepare for a disappointing outcome because I thought I was meeting a demand external to myself, decreed by the perfection of the moment. I didn't acknowledge that some internal desire had driven me to it. So what had I wanted? What is the purpose of saying ""I love you""? I wasn't entirely truthful before; there is one friend with whom I exchange ""I love you""s, though only on special occasions. Actually, he and I started off dating, but after six months I began to feel restless and uncertain that we could be compatible longterm. Shortly after our amicable breakup, he left me a gift bag of my favorite snacks and a note expressing his desire to remain friends. I was touched by the gesture, but frustrated by the ""I love you""--his first directed at me--buried in an embedded clause towards the end of the note. Like a corpse peeking out from a receding glacier, it emerged too late to change anything. After reading it, I paced around for the span of a packet of fruit snacks, wondering why he had expressed it in this indirect way. Perhaps he'd already re-filed me among his considerable ranks of intimate platonic friends, and hadn't given the phrase a moment's thought. Perhaps he wanted it to be ambiguous. It was that furtive, guerilla ""I love you"" that forced me to reassess this man. Ambiguous or otherwise, he exposed vulnerability to someone who had just hurt him. And though his personal definition of love might not perfectly overlap with my own, the greater context of the gesture reminded me of his innate generosity. When I told him I loved him some weeks later, it was because I knew it was true and I wanted to reciprocate his vulnerability. I was only worried he wouldn't believe me. But he accepted it as confirmation of what he'd already suspected, and understood without me having to explain that I wasn't attempting to get back together. This morning, we both proceeded as if last night's confession hadn't occurred. This at least attenuated my fear that I had scared him off for good. Still, I found myself sighing with relief when he left for work, and wondering how much longer all my interactions with him would have to pass through a ""could this be construed as overly-attached girlfriend?"" filter. I had wanted to open myself, and to invite openness. Instead, we had both retreated ever so slightly back into the ice."

My friends boyfriend got completely plastered, passed out at 4am, woke up at 7am, snuck into my room, and started to rape me. There were witnesses, and my friends bf admitted it to my friend, but Im struggling to take the steps necessary to file a police report. I recently started dating a guy, and I felt I needed to be upfront with him. Although its new, we had a very quick, fast, and intense connection. I felt I could be vulnerable with him. His reaction was so off-putting that I just blocked him on every app and service I could. I opened up to him, and he: -Pressed for explicit info, probing to try and figure out the details of what exactly happened. -Wanted a play-by-play of **my** actions, to see if Id led this guy on at all (I hadnt in the least, as if any of that would warrant what he did). -Started telling me what to do and how I should proceed. He suggested *not* calling the police because it would just drag this whole thing out (as if its now suddenly just over and I can simply move on). -Began talking about himself and his trivial stresses at the moment (Im so tired, work will be so hard on Monday, my room is such a mess...etc). -When I went quiet, he told me to cheer up and smile and not let it get to me. He literally demanded that I smile for him. I refused, then I said goodnight and hung up. He then got very upset with me, and sent me a wall of text telling me to stop being shitty to him and how upset he is and how Im only making this situation worse, etc. So I blocked him. What a stupid, selfish, insensitive idiotic fuck. I know on this sub, yall know better, but *holy shit dont fucking act like this guy*. I was feeling horrible before, but now I feel even worse. When someone tells you theyve been raped, or battered, or assaulted, or taken advantage of, **listen to them**, let them tell you how theyre feeling. It takes such an incredible level of vulnerability to open up to someone about it. If youve never experienced it, youll never understand how it feels. Its so violating, it makes you want to flee from your own body, and it destroys your trust in people. Tread lightly. Be empathetic and conscientious. Thanks for reading. "

When she, as a girl, hurts and humiliates him as a boy, by attacking and exploiting what makes him a boy. His genitals. Internal organs that are just dangling outside the body, that are the physical manifestation of his vulnerability and his manhood, that he touches and looks at every since he was born, that he can take in his hand, that are somewhat separate from the rest of his body, that he has actually emotionally relates to because of that, unlike his prostate or his liver, or his bones. The physical pain alone is overwhelming and can cause a guy to pass out. It causes all kinds of weird, threatening bodily sensations other than pain. It can legit be traumatic, the younger the guy is, the more so, naturally. And then there's the emotional/psychological pain, especially when a girl does it, and a strong sense of alienation.

I know this is long but I feel a sense of catharsis in finally having the words to share this. I was in my second year of teaching as an adjunct (part time professor paid per course with absolutely no job security or benefits - for those outside of academia). I was working on my PhD and trying to begin a career in education. I was also a newly divorced single Mom and scraping by on child support and adjunct wages. It wasnt ideal but when I started my PhD, I didnt expect that I would soon be supporting myself my ex husband made plenty of money and part-time adjuncting would have just been a bonus. But thats not how life went. I was young and I suppose not-unattractive. I could see the way that male students looked at me. It made me careful when dealing with them. I chose my words and responses carefully and held meetings with students publically in a school caf just to be safe. I had a male student that semester who was a freshman star on one of our school sports teams. He was a good kid but something was definitely going on with him. He would bounce back and forth between overachieving and failing to turn in assignments altogether. It wasnt consistent. I offered to meet with him when he struggled on a paper and at the end of the meeting, I was certain my intuition was correct as he refused to answer why he hadnt turned it in on time and didnt so much as ask for an extension. He mumbled an apology before changing the subject. I would later learn that this meeting is what started it all. Members of his team happened to walk by as we were meeting and began making jokes about us on their team group chat. It was full of innuendos and highly inappropriate comments about me and my body. There were candid photos of me that various team members had taken around campus with comments and other inappropriate photoshopping that included the male anatomy. I would learn about this group chat later. The student was in my first year seminar class and  as we were instructed to do in our small liberal arts college - I had my students over for a movie night to watch a movie based on a book we read in class. The school enthusiastically encouraged this. We got pizza and snacks and my own children joined us. It was a fun night. As the night ended, the student lagged behind and asked if he could talk to me. We sat on the couch in my living room with my children right up the stairs, and he shared with me about the abusive household he had grown up in. He was struggling emotionally and working to distance himself from his parents but they were holding financial things over his head and he explained how hard navigating financial aid was for students with abusive parents. I recommended counseling and gave him the name of someone in our schools counseling center. I also called a friend to ask about options for him regarding financial aid. He cried a little bit but overall, it felt good to help and also helped me to understand why he had been struggling. I said goodbye to him, along with one of my children who had woken up towards the end of our chat. The student got back to his room on campus around midnight. I realize how risky this was but in the moment, it didnt cross my mind. He wanted help and even though I could have been in danger or I was putting myself in a position where it looked suspicious, I wasnt thinking of that in that second. This was a mistake, of course. To be fair, our community is small and some professors even have students live with them. They babysit our children, get rides to Church, come for Christmas parties, and some even work on research projects at their professors homes. In retrospect, this seems inappropriate but its a small Christian college and these things are just expected and encouraged its part of the community environment the school tries to create. I had never really done any of that but it was fairly normal among my colleagues. While I know letting him lag behind was certainly not the smartest move to be beyond reproach, it also paled in comparison to the close relationships that some of my colleagues had with their students. The difference, of course, was that I was young and single and apparently pretty. It came to a head when his coach heard his teammates making jokes about us and learned about our nighttime meeting. The coach discussed the situation with the student who assured him that absolutely nothing had happened and then scrolled through the group text. Rather than even consider reprimanding his athletes for the x-rated inappropriate comments, his only action was to report me to HR. As far as I know, his athletes have never been punished in any way whatsoever for the inappropriate messages. The call came while I was shopping. I froze in the middle of the store. The Dean wanted to meet with me and would make a recommendation to HR as to the future of my employment there. I was surprised to hear his harshness for something that was a lapse in judgement and hardly matched what I saw colleagues do without a second thought. But I realized that maybe I hadnt taken it seriously enough. I had panic attacks in the days leading up to it. I was a single Mom and couldnt afford to lose my job I had classes lined up for the next semester and it was certainly too late to find new ones somewhere else.. but as an adjunct I had no union or job security to back me. I really just had to hope I could apologize and convince him that nothing happened. The meeting took place during finals week. He began by asking me what happened  a story which I was more than happy to share, wanting my side of the story heard - before he shared what he had seen in screen captures taken from their group text. They were incredibly inappropriate, but certainly not my responsibility. His next comment surprised me, I cant have professors in my program who cause messages like this. I had no control over this honestly, I had half believed he was going to suggest that I report them, but no  no one held them accountable. Not then and not later. He went on, you have to know that you are young and attractive and the rules are different for you. I believe you that nothing happened. The young man says the same, but you have to know that these young men are going to act like this and you need to safeguard against it. You caused a distraction on this team, do you know that? I was silent. I have the power here. I should fire you for this. You are beautiful of course you know that men are thinking lustful things about you. You are an adult and you know better"" his words were both stern and demeaning. So little of what he said registered. I was simply fighting for my job. I was also tempted to point out the number of instances where far worse infractions had been overlooked but I was scared and maybe he was right. Maybe I hadnt taken my lapse in judgement seriously enough. I could feel my stomach churn as I considered what I would do if he fired me. I remember that this is when I started crying. His next response surprised me. I have the power here, he said again in a belittling tone. You know that, right? I don't think you are taking this seriously enough. You need to convince me. I tried to shake the feeling that he was enjoying it. It felt like he needed to hear me admit that he had power over me. But that was silly, I told myself. Again, I tried to explain that nothing had happened and how I was going to be above reproach in the future. I just dont know, he said sternly. Do you even want your job? I need to hear it. I nodded and again, tried to explain and assure him that I didn't want him to fire me but he stopped me. You need to prove to me that you want it. You need to convince me that you are worth keeping around. What can you do for me? His words didnt click in my brain. I simply wanted him to see that he shouldnt fire me but it felt like he was asking me to beg him, which couldn't be right. I was terrified and confused. I shared what I brought to the department and again, I shared how I planned to safeguard against anything like this happening in the future. Tears openly ran down my face and I was surprised to see that he seemed to be almost enjoying it. You know I could fire you right here and right now, right? Yes. ""Youre a single Mom, right? Yes. You losing your job would be hard. Right before the holidays too. You don't want that, do you?"" ""No. I don't."" ""Youre an adjunct.. I dont even need a reason to fire you. I just have to say the word. He waited for an answer and I simply nodded, miserable and scared. How are you going to convince me that you belong here maybe even that you are someone I should consider for other more important positions? I can do that. I am the one in power. I didnt understand but something felt off about his carefully worded statement. Again, I gave my list of plans and reasons. He looked annoyed and sighed. Finally, after staring at me for a moment, contemplating, he said I'm going to take pity on you. I don't have to and I shouldn't. You owe me."" I felt a sense of relief mixed with discomfort. Owe him what? He continued, ""For what its worth, I dont think you slept with him. Youre way out of his league anyway youre beautiful. I could have fired you I need you to know I could and you're lucky I'm a nice guy. But you have a lot of potential. I'm taking pity on you but I do think we need to discuss this further. I want to meet with you throughout next semester lets say, twice per month. You need to show me that you really want this. I nodded, feeling a mix of sickness from something I couldn't quite explain at the moment coupled with relief that I would be able to pay my bills. There was nothing I could do, of course, so I simply said, okay, I will set that up with your assistant on the way out. No, he quickly stopped me. Email me directly. I think its important to protect your privacy. You are definitely a rising star. Im afraid it might hurt your reputation if people knew you had to meet with me so often... they would know. I wont let that happen to you. Lets just keep our meetings private maybe even off campus. I was confused, but nodded. I need you to show me just how valuable you can be to me. Im the one who gets to make the decisions, he pointed out yet again. Show me how bad you want it. My discomfort, which had started sometime around his second declaration that he had power over me, was still growing. I got up to leave, using as few words as possible. As I walked towards the door, he switched tones to tell me, in an almost fatherly tone, it's going to be okay. You'll get through this. Just a minor setback. It made me doubt so much of my earlier discomfort. I couldnt put my finger on specifically what I was feeling. In part, I breathed a sigh of relief that I had survived, but the idea of a meeting like this again made the panic rise in me. Full of doubt and uncertainty, I tried not to think about it and stick with being grateful that it was over. This was 3 years ago and the dialogue I just gave is pretty accurate to what happened. I remember his words so clearly. He needed me to know he was in power. And in the moment I didnt see the subtle innuendos  or rather, I dont think I wanted to admit them to myself. At the time, I mostly just felt uncomfortable  I felt like he was getting off over hearing me beg and admitting that he was in control but I didnt put two and two together until later that he really wanted something more. After this meeting, I struggled with whether I should share what happened with HR. He was a 20+ year employee with a great reputation and a lot of power. I was an easily disposable adjunct. Of the two of us, I probably wasnt going to win. At the very least, I decided that I wasnt going to follow up and set up a time to meet with him and if he did insist on meeting with me, I was going to ask that someone from HR be present. Incidentally, it wasnt necessary. I was surprised when, several days later, he copied me on his official recommendation to HR and it looked so much different from what we discussed. In it, he shared how we had a great meeting and upon meeting with me, he believed my story that nothing happened but he was encouraging me to use better judgement in the future. He saw my infraction as a mistake and not a trend and really not a big deal. He stated that we had talked about the importance of boundaries (had we? I didnt remember that) and he believed that I understood what I could do differently going forward. He said nothing of the meetings he had requested. He also never followed up on them and I certainly didnt. I have avoided him in the days since. I feel uncomfortable every time I think about this meeting. Some part of me wonders if Im blowing it out of proportion but I know how I felt. I just needed to finally share this and put it to words. I felt so powerless adjuncts are easily disposable and there really doesnt have to be a reason to fire us. We have no one protecting us. I feel like he wanted to prey on my vulnerability and powerlessness. I think I have hesitated to share this story partially because its so ambiguous but also partially because I felt responsible in some ways for failing to be beyond reproach in this situation. He made me feel so guilty and like I had messed up so badly but that he was taking pity on me. Looking back, I know his behavior was inappropriate even if it took me a long time to sift through what I felt and put into words why. I feel sick in my stomach when I think about it. Just needed to share this story somewhere. TL;DR I'm an adjunct professor and I finally feel comfortable to share the story of an uncomfortable and inappropriate meeting with my school Dean."

I struggle with expressing vulnerability because I dont have role models that look like me and every semester find that students often feel the same pain I do. I also never felt that feminism represented me or had space for me because I felt weak and or lacked A spine. I find out everyday that the opposite is true. that as long as my intention is to motivate and lift up individuals by their strengths then Im just as worthy of space as the feminist before and after me.

When I was about 10-13, my family was one of the few people with a dial up connection and a computer, and as a massive anime nerd, I of course was all over message boards and chat rooms, flying absolutely blind in a new space my parents couldn't navigate or set rules for, and even if they could set rules, I probably wasn't going to be listening regardless. And I made so many mistakes, man. So many that put my mental health at risk, and I was only so lucky that I didn't end up actually videoing or sending pictures with these people because I didn't have a video camera and an inability to actually upload pictures. I was listening to predatory older guys whose eyes lit up when my Mocospace said I was 14 and who asked me if I'd kissed anybody yet, trying to prove I was a 'real fan' by memorizing trivia and feeling like shit when I couldn't remember something about a mangaka I claimed to (and frankly still do) adore, and all the rabid discourse thag came with unironically loving a stupid anime for dumb reasons just because that all the universe decided was shit and everyone who liked it was shit, and everything else that came with the internet in the early to mid 2000's. And even today, especially today with all the new accessibility and the increased vulnerability, and the absolute vitriol that todays fandoms are capable of... I want to do right by her and keep her safe. Safer than I was at least. The internet is a wonderful and amazing tool to understand the world, but it's still so, so dangerous for her as a young girl.

He works in a trade, he chops wood for fun (and charity), he hikes and camps alone and often, his home has nothing but a few clothes and lots of books (which he loves to give to people), he fears very, very little in life, and his hands are rough, marked with scars, and often dirty. The first time we planned to hang out outside of where we met (school), we were supposed to take a walk but it was almost dark (I am not a fan) and very cold (I've had hypothermia and hate the cold) so I came to his home instead. I was there to see him, but we also had some difficult things to discuss relationship-wise. Here's where his vulnerability comes to play. He was so visibly nervous, he was shaking. I was sitting at his kitchen counter and I was talking to him and he said ""I am so sorry, I AM listening to you, but I'm so nervous, that I have to do something with my hands, so I'm going to clean my kitchen"". And that vulnerability was just so sexy and beautiful. He made us tea and we sat/laid on his bed and talked for hours. I asked him for story after story from his life (he's lived in many countries and states and I've never left the West Coast of the U. S. even just for travel). After the first couple of stories, he looked me in the eyes and said ""You know, I'm just as fascinated by you and I feel like I'm talking too much."" but I asked him to continue. I have been without passion in my love life for years and he kissed me like he needed it to live. I just wanted to share this with someone, so I chose you all."

I like walking, so yesterday I decided I was going to walk to the mall (about 3.1 km/1.93 miles away). I came across this suburban area surrounded by nice big houses, but also very empty with few cars passing by. Now, I grew up in a third-world country so I am used to being catcalled and being sexually harassed on the streets, as crude as that might sound; but for some reason, this experience has shaken me and I haven't been able to stop crying since then. Back to the story, I noticed this old car just parked on one side of the street, approximately 20 meters (65.6 feet, according to Siri) ahead of me. I thought it was odd since that neighborhood looked so upscale and the car looked decrepit at most. My spidey senses went even more off when I distinguished a man inside the car, wearing a hoodie and sunglasses. I was not about to walk by that clich of an abduction scene so many times portrayed in the movies, so I immediately resolved to cross the street. I looked left and right, as one does instinctively when crossing a street, but before I could cross, the car just drove away. I kept walking, and perhaps two minutes after, the same car stopped next to me and this man that looked like a Walmart Post Malone popped out of the window and told me to get in his car. I had read about how one shouldn't engage in a conversation or even cross eyes with this kind of person, so I just ignored him and kept walking. Unfortunately, he kept driving right next to me, now insisting even more on me getting in his car, saying things like ""You are so beautiful"", ""Are you okay? I can give you a ride"" ""Just get on the car"". At this point I was already very scared, he didn't look like he was going to leave without me, so I just...grabbed my phone and said I was going to call the police. Perhaps it wasn't the best move but I couldn't think of anything else. Luckily, he left as soon as I grabbed my phone, but I have been a mess since then. I can't shake this feeling of unsafety and vulnerability as a woman. I know nothing really happened but I still feel scared and I find myself crying constantly over this. I guess what I'm asking for is how does one cope with this type of experience? It would also be helpful if I could read similar experiences to mine."

He simply reminds me of how strong and beautiful i am and prays for strength with me. Well i finally had to shower without my mothers assistance, and i was very embarrassed to be sitting in a shower chair trying to wash myself in his sight. I told him to leave me there, i could do it myself. So he did, but not without giving me a kiss and telling me i look sexy. (Brownie points lol). Now, i have Always been a VERY sexual person and we have a thriving sex life. So as i was finishing in the shower, i was already sitting so i made a move on him offering oral sex.

And dont get upset thinking Im rejecting you because you know you look damn good right now! ..... this is one of those baseline how a man should act moments... HOWEVER, he is the first man in my life to treat me with such tenderness, respect, and consideration. So in that moment, i felt so secure and beautiful even in this terrible state! I read stories on here all the time about how simple things that someones SO does that make them realize just how messed up their exes were. This was definitely my moment. My exes wouldnt have even cared for me, they would have requested oral sex constantly and had no consideration for my feelings or physical state.

Everything about it is so draining and time consuming. Does he like me? Is he dating other people? Should I ask him? Why isn't he texting me back? Am I being ghosted? I've avoided dating for so long. I had a very controlling long term boyfriend in college and once I got out of it I spent years trying to avoid another relationship. I still went on date, hooked up with a few men, and even had a casual on/off thing with someone for years but anything that involved emotions of vulnerability sent me running for the hills. It just makes me feel weak, like I've let me defenses down for anyone to come in and just mess up my life. And then two months ago I reconnected with a friend. I always likes him but didn't want to deal with the emotional fall out of a relationship so nothing every happened. But this time was different. He was more mature, he'd graduated college and gotten a better job, he was responsible, he wanted to talk to me and spend time with me and was telling me how much he liked me and liked spending time with me. And i was really starting to fall for him and let myself open up to the possibility of building something with him. He was even eager to meet my friends for my birthday next month. And then nothing. I haven't heard from him in almost a week now despite reaching out a couple of times and getting very limited responses. I'm pretty sure I've been ghosted. Feels bad man. I feel like a total idiot. I shouldn't have fallen so quickly. I should have been more skeptical of his words, I should have just been more careful. Now here I am, almost 30, running to the restroom at my office to let out a quick sob before pulling myself together and getting back to work. It's making my already terrible anxiety so bad and all I want to do is sleep and get some wine. I was lonely when I was single for years but right now I wish that I'd never rekindled things with this dude. I try to keep myself distracted with school work, friends, hobbies, gym but man nothing is helping right now and now I'm mad at myself for being so weak and dramatic that a 2 month ""something"" is just ruining my days. I'm not even sure how I'm going to try to get back into dating now.

For context, I have Aspergers, and my condition made me an easy target for all kinds of bullying and cruelty my whole life. Ive never had good social skills, so people usually took advantage of me. When I was in second grade, I had a crush on a classmate, lets call him Nick. Somehow a group of snooty little princesses found out, and one day during indoor recess, these girls pinned Nick down to the beanbag chair, dragged me to him and forced me to kiss him. I didnt want to kiss him because I didnt want to get in trouble with the teacher, but these girls wouldnt let me go, so I kissed him on the face. And of course, being the American public school system, I got in trouble but my tormentors got off scot-free. I cant imagine what Nick (or any other boy I ever crushed on) must have been thinking. Maybe something like Of all the girls in the second grade that could like me, whyd it have to be the weird special ed kid? This incident happened five years before I was sexually assaulted at summer camp and the counselors dismissed it as me overreacting. It also wouldnt be the last time that mean girls would find out about a crush and embarrass me about it. Eventually I learned to just stop having crushes, let alone tell anyone about them. Today, I am a virgin at 25. Ive never been in a relationship, never kissed. I had a couple experiences but they ended with me freaking out and leaving because they held my hand or expressed interest in kissing or sex, and I believe both the beanbag chair incident and getting assaulted at camp have contributed in some way to my fears of intimacy and vulnerability. Im seeing a therapist regularly and finding healing in writing, but I just want to overcome my past so I can learn to open up, stop fearing intimacy and sex, and find a meaningful, loving relationship."

I thought we really hit it off. We made each other laugh, we both seemed willing to go out of our comfort zone to watch movies we wouldn't otherwise watch, and she even dug the ska/punk playlists I had on my phone(which nobody likes!). Well, yesterday night we met up after work and cooked together for the first time(I'll be honest, she did most of the cooking!). We started talking about some more personal stuff and she brought up that she was a victim of abuse. The conversation went on, I tried not to pry but I also mentioned that I had some crummy experiences of my own(but different from hers). The only people I've *ever* told about the stuff that happened in my life, was my best friend and well, anonymously on the internet. So for me, it felt like kind of a big moment that I felt like I could talk to her. I didn't really delve too deep into what happened and we both mostly just talked about the ways it changes you, the paranoia of being around strangers, the constant questioning of motives and the difficulty of knowing when its okay to let your guard down. But this morning I asked her if she wanted to hang out this weekend. I could see she read the message as soon as I sent it. Then it looked like she was messaging me back but she stopped. I didn't really think much of it and just assumed maybe she was caught up in some stuff at work. At some point during work, she messaged me saying: ""Sorry for ghosting. Lets chat tonight"". I got off the phone with her a little earlier and she practically said between the two of us, there's too much baggage. I understand and respect it. Though at the time when we were talking about it, it just felt like a moment of vulnerability between the two of us to talk about something that's really hard to talk about(at least I know it is for me) and every instinct in me, for some reason, told me it was okay to talk about it with her. Clearly my instincts were wrong. So I'm just wondering, does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? Is it just a bad idea for two people that have some kind of trauma to date? Maybe I shouldn't have said anything at all and it was her time to tell me something? But not saying anything feels like some form of lying. I'm sure I'm over-complicating this and maybe its just as simple as we weren't vibing as much as I thought we were."

But I'm starting to realize that I'm also very nave, and I think it makes me vulnerable to predatory, manipulative people. I'm the type of person who just wants to get along with everyone and wants everything to be nice and happy. Of course, this isn't how people actually are. And the funny thing is, it's not like I was raised exceptionally sheltered, because I wasn't. But I seem to have this stubborn need to trust everyone around me and assume good intentions. I hate manipulation and game-playing with a passion, so I put myself out there in a way that shows I'm not about that. But that doesn't change other people, and I'm making myself too vulnerable in the process. One thing I particularly struggle with is men and sex. I have had a lot of plutonic male friends throughout my life, so I always think of men as potential friends first. I don't think about sex or sexual attraction, not off the bat. But men do, and there have been so many situations where I think a guy is being nice to me because he enjoys me as a person and wants to be friends, when his real aim is to get me into bed. I am also too trusting at work, thinking everyone has the best intentions, and when I find out that someone is strategizing or scheming, it comes as this huge shock to me. Or when I find out that a colleague is actually competing with me, when they've been so nice to my face. It makes me very uncomfortable that people can be so dishonest. It's like I know about the darker side of humanity, but I refuse to really acknowledge it or believe that it could affect me. I've dealt with people who are obviously snakes, but I keep telling myself, ""No, they won't hurt me like they hurt everyone else"". And then they end up hurting me, like they hurt everyone else. It's not rocket science. I just don't know how to become more realistic and how to better protect myself."

How do I overcome my fear of talking about my emotions and feelings and telling this guy I want more? It gives me so much anxiety and I know I have to so that I can be happy but I just cant bring myself to do it. We have been talking and sleeping with each other for about 4 months at this point. Im pretty slow when it comes to realizing my true feelings. I worry that if I say what I want he wont reciprocate and ghost me. If he isnt interested in a relationship I would be okay with being just friends (without the sex, obviously to protect my feelings). Especially because I am new to a city and dont have many friends. Also want to add that I am so bad at making people I date understand how I feel even in a nonverbal way. A lot of them have told me that I dont really treat them in a way different than any other person Im friends with and it sends mixed signals so they back off. This guy seems like he is really into me when we are together but not super responsive when we text. We text mostly to just make plans to see each other. I dont know I just want to understand how to make the move and also if it doesnt work, how to make people feel like Im into them when I am!"
47,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,[NSFW] Im starting to finally admit to myself that I was raped.,4,cipw61,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/cipw61/nsfw_im_starting_to_finally_admit_to_myself_that/,2019-07-28 11:33:00,"I should be posting this on my alt, but this is my main. Ill probably delete this, I dont know. Maybe Im just posting this to try to free myself from the shame Ive felt. To start off with, Im 15. Most of these events transpired when I was 14. This is going to be long, Im crying and pouring my heart out. It hurts so much to relive these events. When I was 7 years old, I was staying with my grandparents over Christmas break who lived a few states away from us. My step grandmother had a daughter with 3 children. One of her children was a 12 year-old boy. One night, the children were gathered in the living room with the adults all in the next room. My older cousin invited me to sit on his lap. It was innocent at first, but then he said I should squirm around in his lap, and I did. He then wanted me to kiss him on the lips, and we did. I remember enjoying it, I was too young to understand. We made out for a few minutes, with other people in the room and no one cared. Eventually my father noticed and he suggested I stop doing that. No one cared. He was 12, he shouldve known better. I was barely 7, only in first grade. When I was 13, my life had gone to shit, Im not being overdramatic; but I dont want to go into those details. The only attention I was getting from home was negative. I wanted positive attention, so I acted out and became promiscuous. I started wearing slutty clothes and sending nudes, and thats where it all went down hill. On my 14th birthday, I lost my virginity to a college boy. It was one of the most painful experiences ever. But I wasnt done there, I craved intimacy because I thought I needed it to be complete. I met this guy offline, he was 21. At first I was obsessed with him, we were experimenting and having fun. He started treating me badly and took advantage of my vulnerability and depression, started claiming he was going to fix me. One night, I had about one inhale of a dab (weed) pen, and got extremely high to the point where I was paranoid and felt like I was going to die. He said he wanted to have sex, I said I didnt feel like it, but coaxed me into saying it would feel amazing, so I lay there letting him do what he wanted with me. I couldnt stand the kissing, but Ill never forget that feeling of when he penetrated me. He thrust a few times, and I was in the weirdest pain Ive ever been in, I dont know how to describe it. I freaked out and told him to stop, he tried to reassure me I was okay, so I just lay there a few more minutes. Eventually, I couldnt bear it and I pushed him off me and cried for him to take me home. He did. I stopped seeing him, told him I didnt want to see him anymore. He didnt take it well and would text me constantly saying he knows whats best for me and I need to just let him in. After a few weeks of no contact, I got incredibly wasted. I called him and agreed to see him. I barely remember that. The last thing I remember that night, was getting into his car and I started crying about my mother on the cuts on my thighs. I threw up in his car and passed out. I woke up, he told me to go home and I did, I was in new clothes but I didnt question it. After I woke up in my bed, I opened snapchats from him. Snapchats of him with me, passed out, kissing me, cleaning up my throw up, my vomit, him saying how much he loved me. I freaked out. I cut contact and created a new Snapchat to get rid of him. To this day Ill occasionally log into my other Snapchat, and he still texts me. Im paranoid hes stalking me. There was another guy, 18. He was an asshole, and I loved it. Hed put me up on a pedestal and then he would would belittle me. He would still sleep with other girls, which made me extremely jealous. I slept with him for 3 months, stopped for 6, started again for a month, stopped for another few months and recently slept with him in May (first time I slept with him when I was 15). I had feelings for this guy, and I knew he would never reciprocate them, but I took the scraps he gave me. He would love morning sex. I distinctly remember waking up, and him wanting to have sex. I said no. And tried to go back to sleep. He got on top of me. I told him no, not right now. He wouldnt take no for an answer. I felt his dick against me, and he started to dry hump me. But I wiggled my way out but hed get back on top, this repeated a few times. Eventually he got annoyed and pinned me now, opened my legs, and penetrated me. I cried stop and no so many times throughout this, but it was a game to him. He flipped me on my stomach and just thrusted himself into me as hard as he could, ignoring my pain. I was clutching the bed in pain and tried to get up, but he told me to stop arching my back. It hurt so much. I remember laying there, motionless, with a pit in my stomach and no longer enough of me to fight. It hurt even more than my first time. Ill keep this one short. I slept with this 18 y/o throughout a few months. Sometimes Id get drunk and call him. One night I got drunk and I invited him over. We had sex. It became a pattern. Id get drunk and wed have sex. In fact, I had sex with him when my boyfriend and I were broken up. I was absolutely wasted. I fell asleep and he sat out in his car and waited, calling me. Instead of just leaving he came inside my house. I remember him waking me up. I dont remember anything else after that, I think I passed back out. I woke up to him fucking me. I have been willingly violated countless times. I tell myself that I started it, that I deserved it. I convinced myself it was normal and brushed it off. I knew they were taking advantage of me, but I was too depressed or numb to care, and didnt I incite that anyways? I still struggle if its rape or not. Ill go back and forth. If its rape,why dont I remember every single detail like other girls do? My sexual libido is in no way damaged, and I feel like a whore for it. Even if I was raped, I still feel like a whore for still having a sexual appetite. Im lost."

49,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,I was contacted by a daughter of the man who raped me,471,c0mvhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/c0mvhp/i_was_contacted_by_a_daughter_of_the_man_who/,2019-06-15 03:32:57," ..... via a loose acquaintance of both of ours. She had been looking for me since I publicly outed her dad several years ago. She wanted answers and wanted to know what happened. She told me that she does not have a relationship with him and that he has hurt several people in her life. Here was my response to her (it's lengthy, also trigger warning) Names have been changed or redacted. &gt;!Dear D, !&lt; &gt;!I hope this finds you well. I have been doing quite a bit of soul searching as of late and wanted to make sure that not only was I okay with writing this, but also that I chose the correct words to express myself. I can't get into detail with what your dad did to me. Much of those memories are lost due to time. I can give you a general timeline and an overview as well as how my life has been impacted. I'm not sure if this is what you are seeking. I'm not sure if it will be helpful to you. I don't want to hurt you in any way. This is not my intention. I only wish to help you gain perspective and hopefully grow in whatever way you wish to be. !&lt; &gt;!I was barely 15 years old when my parents sent me to &lt;redacted&gt;. It was February. It was terrible. I felt so alone and lost. I wasn't a ""bad"" kid. No one there was, really. Our parents just didn't know what to do with us since we couldn't/wouldn't conform to their idea of a ""good"" christian child. Do note, I am an agnostic atheist. I hope I don't offend you by my lack of capitalizing words such as ""god"", ""christian"", etc. Anyway, I felt terribly alone there. I made some friends, sure, but I really missed my family. I was relatively close with my dad. He and I would talk about things all the time. Over time, your dad became like my dad. He became like a father figure to me. He was a father figure to several of the other girls there, actually. !&lt; &gt;!P, 15, she looked similar to your mom with short blonde hair and green eyes. About 2-3 months after I was there, she said that your dad tried to hug her and kiss her. She was isolated from the rest of us and was quickly sent back home. She was very adamant about it and she was not one to lie about things. They didn't believe her. I, of course, didn't really think anything of it since I perceived him to be like a father figure. I thought that maybe he was just trying to comfort her. I don't know. To this day, I'm still not sure what all I was actually thinking. That whole experience is just an absolute clusterfuck (apologies if you are offended by swearing. I tend to do it a lot) of emotions that I still feel to this day. !&lt; &gt;!B, 15, she also looked similar to your mom and P with long strawberry blonde hair and green eyes. She was very close with your dad. They talked a lot. She never said that he did anything to her, but it wouldn't surprise me based upon how often they talked and they were also alone together a lot. When your dad and I started talking, she became jealous. She and I were friends, but after your dad started talking to me, she wasn't my friend anymore. !&lt; &gt;!Finally, there's me. I also look similar to your mom, P, and B. I had/have long blonde hair and blue eyes. We all share very similar builds as well - short, small boned, light features, thin, similar face structures. As I said before, your dad became like a father figure to me. I cried when I talked to him. I felt like I couldn't talk to the women there because they were too harsh. Your dad wasn't. He was kind and gentle. I really missed my dad. !&lt; &gt;!Do note, we were only allowed one supervised 10 minute phone call to our parents once a week and only during specific time periods. Additionally, all letters coming in and out of the place were read by staff. The place was worse than prison, really. I was put into isolation for 2 weeks because I refused to rat someone out. Isolation was a room about 6 feet long and 3 feet wide. I was allowed out to go to the bathroom (supervised), do early morning chores (supervised), to go to bed (after everyone else was already in bed and the lights were out), and to go to church/chapel services (also supervised and if anyone talked to me, they would also be put into isolation). Meals were brought to me. I was allowed a bible in there. Nothing else. I found a pencil in there and wrote poetry and drew on the walls and inside a cupboard. I am sharing all this with you so that you can better understand the hell hole that that place was. !&lt; &gt;!I was 15. Most of the kids there were between 14-17. There was a girl there who was 12. Most of us had never committed a crime. Our parents just didn't know what to do. This place seemed like a solution, but for me, as well as many others, it gave us scars and wounds that seem to never be able to heal. !&lt; &gt;!Anyway, it was around August or September when your dad first raped me. It was in the attic. You were only allowed a certain amount of space in your shared closet and dresser. All your other stuff went into the attic and you had to be escorted up there by a staff member. There were some spare beds up there and that's where it happened. I needed some of my stuff. He took me up to get it. And then he raped me. I still remember, very vividly actually, the sun coming through a window up there and casting scattered light around. I was.....numb.....almost like my body and brain were disconnected. I trusted him and felt like he was my dad. But he took advantage of that. I remember him telling me something to the effect of that nobody would believe me if I said anything. I remember thinking about P and what happened to her. Nobody believed her and she was sent back home. I wanted/needed to finish my year there to please my parents. I remember seeing my friend, C1, later that day and her asking me if I was okay. I said I was, but she knew something was wrong. !&lt; &gt;!I became more withdrawn as time went on. He would write me notes and put them under my pillow. One of them said something like how turned on he would get when I crossed my legs during church (he was always sitting up on the stage). I began to pay better attention to how often I crossed my legs and would try to not do it. He would look at me during his sermons and classes. I felt sick each time. He would tell me to meet him at a certain place at a certain time. I always did. Why? I'm not entirely sure. Fear, maybe. Acceptance by him, also a possibility. I was so confused, to be honest. Someone who I thought I could trust took advantage of my vulnerability. Maybe my only worth was tied to being a sex object. I often felt that. Sometimes I still slip into that thought, though as I've gotten older and have been healing, those thoughts come less and less. !&lt; &gt;!He raped me once or twice a month until January. Your mom knew something. He would tell me that she thought that he was seeing a hooker. He stopped having as many ""fatherly"" discussions with me and the other girls. He told me many things such as not liking his job and wanting to work in the computer industry. He wasn't happy in his relationship with your mom because she was always a bitch to him. He wanted to rescue me from the place and run away together. I was 15. He was 30 something. I didn't want any of that. I always liked your mom and so desperately wanted to talk to her. I remember one time coming over to your home (you were living at the place) to clean. There was a poem framed there that I had written. I had written it and your dad was supposed to give it to a boy there that I liked. He had given it to your mom instead and said that he wrote it. That made me feel so sick and angry. 1) He never passed along something special of mine to somebody who I actually cared about. 2) He tried to claim the work as his own. 3) He took even more of me and tried to convince your mom that this was how he felt about her. I think that your mom had her suspicions of what he was doing to me when she saw me see that poem. There was a look in her eye when she saw me looking at it. I wish I could've told her. I felt like she would have thought it was my fault. She probably did. Maybe she still does. I know it wasn't my fault, though sometimes I still slip into self blame and feel like shit about it. The thing is, I was a child. He was an adult who was my authority. Not only was I a child, but I was a child who was raised IFB, which has sooo much baggage placed specifically upon females. I am digressing again. Apologies. !&lt; &gt;!Your mom was one of the few women there who was actually kind. I hope you are able to have a relationship with her. There were literally 2 women there who I felt comfortable with. One taught a sewing class and I was allowed to go visit her at her house a couple of times. The other was your mom who supervised us when we cleaned the church on Saturdays. Yes, we (almost all the girls except for those who were special and good) cleaned the entire church on Saturdays. This was in addition to our normal cleaning chores at &lt;redacted&gt; as well as doing all the cleanup in the kitchens. Funny, all the cleaning that we had to do, yet was never recognized by anyone. Never a thank you. Just an expectation. Anyway, your mom just legitimately seemed like she cared about people. I longed to really talk to her, but I just couldnt because of the secret that I held. I still feel guilt for not telling her right away. Your mom didnt and doesnt deserve what she has gone through. !&lt; &gt;!On a couple of occasions while we were cleaning the church, my friend C1 and I would be cleaning the basement and your dad would come down there to talk to me. It became more than that and he would kiss me while I held cleaning supplies in my hand. Once he tried to finger me while I was cleaning a classroom. He heard your moms voice and told me to hide under the desk until I heard the doors to the stairway close. I did. I remember sitting under there, heart pounding, thinking that maybe I could say something now. Maybe I could confront your dad with your mom right there. I didn't. I had too much fear about what could happen to me. He wouldve denied it. I wouldve been ostracized. I was a coward. I had told C1 what was happening. Something about her: she was raped by her step father multiple times over a couple of years starting at the age of 13 or 14. Her mom found out and blamed her, thus sent her away. Her brother, C2, was sent away as well because he stood up for his sister. Her brother was the boy I liked. I remember C1 telling me that I just had to hold out a bit longer and it would end. I was going to go home soon. Basically just let it happen. I probably wouldve told her the same thing, to be honest. What else can someone do in that situation and with the limited knowledge that we had about how things worked. !&lt; &gt;!I had tried to get some sort of attention to what was happening to me by way of saying that a demon was having sex with me. I thought that I would be taken to a hospital and checked out. I told a counselor there that I was having terrible dreams of a demon raping me and that I could still feel the pain in the morning. He asked me a couple of questions and asked me to describe my dream and that was that. He said I needed to pray and that I was being punished. He said that I wasnt allowing Jesus into my heart and thats why it was happening. I really tried to emphasize that I was feeling pain down there, but he just didnt listen to me. Whatever was happening was my fault for not letting god into my heart. Thats how he made me feel. Once again, I am to blame. !&lt; &gt;!Everything came out in January. At this point, I was so sick of being raped and was so depressed. As C1 and I were washing dishes, I was talking to her about it and was crying. I was telling her that I was going to tell someone. I couldnt hold out for another month. That Saturday, after cleaning the church, I was going to go to the womans house who taught sewing classes. I was going to tell her then. I felt safe with her and knew that she would protect me. Another girl overheard our conversation and told pastor &lt;redacted&gt;. He called me into his office that Saturday after we were done cleaning (of course things needed to be cleaned first!) He asked me if your dad and I had a relationship. I was caught off guard and initially told him no. Mind you, your dad was sitting right there. He said that someone overheard a conversation between C1 and me. I said that they were lying. I asked if I could go because I was supposed to get picked up soon to go to this womans house and he said that I wasnt allowed to go there anymore. At this point, I was terrified. I went back out and sat on the bench with C1. I was crying. I didnt trust him, but I didnt know what to do. I said something like fuck it, Im going to tell the truth since I cant see her and tell her. At least itll be out there. I was scared of being put back into isolation. I was scared of not being able to go home in a month. I was scared of being looked at like I was a liar. I was scared of so many things and felt that at least I could maybe be honest with this and even though I didnt trust pastor &lt;redacted&gt;, he was still obligated to protect me. How wrong I was. !&lt; &gt;!I went back into his office and told him the truth. He just sat there quietly. He then made me feel like I was somehow responsible for ruining a marriage and a family. It was my responsibility to not cause lust. Now, your dad and his family had to move away. I would not be able to talk to anyone and he would notify my family to come pick me up right away. And they did. I was gone the next Monday. I wasnt allowed to speak to anyone and no one was allowed to speak to me. C1 and I, of course, still found ways to talk to each other in that short time frame. We had become pros at finding ways to talk even with all the supervision. The girl who overheard our conversation apologized to me profusely saying that she didnt know what would happen did. I was angry, of course, because I was going to tell someone who I trusted and with whom I felt safe. She didnt allow me that. Looking back though, she did what she thought was best and I understand where she was coming from. !&lt; &gt;!&lt;redacted&gt; Church paid my parents several thousands of dollars over the course of several years. My parents didnt say anything because they wanted to protect the church and pastor &lt;redacted&gt;. I think that the money was basically hush money so that there would be no lawsuit and that no names would be dragged through the mud. My parents regret it now. They have many regrets now. After several years of barely even talking to my family, I actually have a close relationship with them now and have forgiven them. They recognize that they fucked up. In more ways than one. !&lt; &gt;!I went through many years being so fucked up from this. When I made that video that you saw, I had gone through 3 different times of trying to press charges against the church and your dad. Nothing came of it. I tried the local police, the sheriff's department, the district attorney, several attorneys, and even the FBI. All said that there wasnt enough evidence. I gave names, they even spoke to my parents and my friend C1. Multiple people at that place knew what happened. There were police officers that went to that church so I get the feeling that this was why nothing actually happened. There are plenty of witnesses. Even documented proof such as checks coming from the church to my parents. Its all gone now. I doubt I could find it all again after all this time. !&lt; &gt;!Anyway, because of the statute of limitations, time was running out. I did all I could do and then made that youtube video. I hoped that it would reach someone and even if it made someone think twice about sending their child there or let their teenage daughter be around your dad, I felt that it was worth it. I looked into the law and found that what I did was legal. Truth is always a defense against defamation/slander. I knew that I had the truth and I really was daring the church, pastor &lt;redacted&gt;, or your dad to try to sue me for it. That didnt happen. What did happen was a lot of people contacted me verifying what I already knew and giving me support when I really needed it. !&lt; &gt;!Have I mentioned yet that I was once depressed and suicidal? Yeah, Ive tried to kill myself twice. Making that video was one of the most difficult things that Ive ever done. It made me vulnerable. I do not feel comfortable being vulnerable. I was very raw in it. I had some tough responses to it from people such as pastor &lt;redacted&gt; daughter and your uncle. I dont blame them. I felt sick when reading their responses. I still feel sick when I recall them, but I understand them. Its only natural to defend those you love when you dont know what that person has done and you find some random stranger talking about it. I get it. I forgive them and Im okay. !&lt; &gt;!The video itself, I dont regret making it. As I said before, if it helps someone to not send their child there or to keep their young daughter away from your dad then it was worth it to me. I made the video to get knowledge out there and to hopefully protect others. I didnt make it as some sort of therapeutic outlet for myself, though it did feel good afterwards. Writing this to you has, however, been rather therapeutic. Would I make a video like that today? Probably, just without as much rawness as I displayed. I have grown a lot over the years and really am trying to be more forgiving. !&lt; &gt;!I try to forgive pastor &lt;redacted&gt; whenever I think of him. To be honest, I dont think about him as much as I once did. Maybe once a day. Sometimes not even that often. He did what he thought was best based upon his morality. His church and what it stands for is far more important to him than what Jesus himself would deem important. His morality is different from my own. He perceives his morality and the protection of it to be more important than that of societal expectations or even that of those who he is supposed to be protecting. !&lt; &gt;!Your dad, I also try to forgive whenever I think of him. Thoughts of what he did to me were once far more frequent than they are now. Its mostly in the shower when I am scrubbing away all the dirt when I think of him and what he did to me. I often cry in the shower. Sometimes when watching a movie. Often when watching something traumatic. Always when reading about someone being raped. Always when thinking about religion/abusers. Sometimes at night when Im going to sleep. Sometimes, I still have nightmares. But whenever I am conscious enough, I always try to forgive your dad. Im not perfect. I havent forgiven him, but I do try whenever I can. I understand that, to him, he didnt do anything wrong. That cult of religion places so much blame upon women and girls that he may legitimately feel like I am to blame. I was young, attractive, and was basically asking for it, to him. I get it. I try to understand each persons perspectives. But I feel that deep down he knows that he really fucked up. I forgive him right now. I cant say that I forgive him eternally, but at this moment, I forgive him. Thats all Im really capable of. !&lt; &gt;!You had mentioned that he has hurt people in your life. I dont expect you to be able to, but if you can try, try to forgive him every time you think of him. Try to think of how he was raised and how he became the person he is. While he is not blameless, he is still just a product of his environment and the genes with which he was given. I am not saying that you should forgive what he did. I am simply saying that you could try to forgive him. Maybe, someday, he will recognize his mistakes. Maybe he wont. But no matter what, you can at least feel a bit of a weight lifted off your shoulder by trying to forgive. Holding resentment hurts you, not the other person. They often dont even know. Yet, you feel it continually pressing down upon you and gripping your throat. Becoming your very state of being. Taking over you. I know how this feels. Its a terrible way to live life. Life is so short anyway. Try to not let other people take any joy that you may feel while living it. Once again, I am not perfect. I cannot say that I go through every day feeling joyful and as though I have no weight upon my shoulders. I can say, however, that I feel less depression than I once did and I have less anxiety in my life. You may not be able to start forgiving right now. Thats okay. I just hope that you remember this later on in life when you are in a better place in your life and are able to. !&lt; &gt;!Thank you for contacting me. I know that it mustve been difficult for you to do so. You probably werent sure how I would respond, if I responded at all. It took a lot for you do so, Im sure. Do let me know if I can help you in any way. I am open to any more questions that you may have. As I said before, I cant really give many specifics because I simply dont remember many things, but hopefully I am able to help you in whatever way you need. I just want you to know that even though we do not know each other, I do care about you. I dont know what all you have gone through and I do not know how my making that video impacted your life. If you feel up to sharing it with me, I would like to read it. Nonetheless, I can only imagine how difficult it all has been for you. I hope that you do not blame me for anything, though I do understand if you did/do. Its okay. I hope that you are able to find peace in your life and live it with the most joy that you are capable of. !&lt; &amp;#x200B; By sharing this, I hope that it is helpful to someone. I never expected to be contacted by one of his children. I had no idea of what to say to her. I tried to find info online, but I couldn't find where it had happened to anyone else. It was/is a very strange and difficult situation for me. I'm still not sure if what I wrote to her is okay. It's still her dad, you know? Anyway, just thought that I should share this in the hopes that someone who may go through this in the future won't feel so lost."
50,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,I was spit on tonight,7,c40ivh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/c40ivh/i_was_spit_on_tonight/,2019-06-23 17:17:11,"Walking up the stairs in a parking garage at night, two men were lingering at a corner in the stairwell. As I walked passed them, I felt something wet on my leg. After we got to the top, I looked down and saw the brown-tinged spit on my skin. I was going to take out a napkin to wipe it off, but I noticed they were now following us inside. So I walked with his spit on my leg for what felt like forever but was probably 2 minutes until I found a bathroom. My boyfriend was with me and wanted to confront them. I tried to explain that there's two possibilities--1) they apologize or 2) they escalate--and that I wasn't willing to risk it. I just wanted to get the fluids off my leg... Tobacco or blood tinged, not sure which. I'm in healthcare and I've accepted that patients will spit at me. Not acceptable behavior, but it comes with the job. Being spit on by a stranger in a parking garage... Wow. A very different form of disgust and vulnerability from not knowing why it happened or how I can prevent it in the future. Anyway, thanks for letting me get that off my chest."

My male friend had a somewhat small birthday party. maybe 15-20 people (he's thrown parties in the past that have had close to 100 people, so this was tame by comparison). The guests were mostly men, but I was far from the only woman there. A friend of a friend came that I didn't know. Pretty normal party stuff, but every interaction with this guy was just awful! At one point, I started telling a funny story and lots of people laughed. He then came over to me to ""improve"" my story by ending it with a rape joke. I told him that behavior wasn't okay with me and he tried to weakly defend it but I walked away. Later by the bonfire, we're talking about our lives and sharing stories and there's a lull in the conversation. This guy pulls out his phone and shares a meme that's just filled with grotesque murder jokes, violence against women and minorities, and he's laughing. Full-on guffawing. A few other people laugh, including the friend he came with. I get up to leave and he says ""oh, is that too much for you?"" somewhat snidely and I didn't respond and went back inside. He tried to engage with me again a few times and even asked me to leave with him but I just politely shut him down and avoided him the rest of the time he was there. Everything about how he interacted with me was creepy and despite being polite, there was a certain aggression to him. I didn't mention it to anyone else because I didn't want to cause problems and I handled myself just fine. The other men at this party are gentle humans and after this particular guest left, the party continued with a peaceful, lovely time and everyone allowed themselves vulnerability and acceptance. But while this man was there, everyone had their guard up and I think I was the only one to even attempt to call him out. It breaks my heart that even the good men in my life don't see this behavior as problematic or that it can make others feel unwelcome. Especially people who have been abused or are more likely to be attacked. Fortunately, these types of people are rare in my circle, especially at intimate events like this. I don't know how to address stuff like this though. How do you get men in your life to recognize this behavior for what it is and address it?"

But there are times I get sad: At the times of texting him I felt it was powerful of me to be transparent with my emotions, that there was power in vulnerability, and my voice was allowed to be heard. Now Im incredibly embarrassed.. I was very concerned he was resenting me, blaming me for opportunities missed (we spent alot of time together- although I was always encouraging of his music, who knows maybe he thought he needed space to create and focus). So I feared his resentment although he is the only one in control of his actions. I wanted to reach out, to clear the score, and confess to missing him so that I could be remembered as caring and loving. And maybe with some underlying hopes that expressing my feelings of missing him and desiring a friendship now that Ive grown would result in.. meeting up? Im not sure. And I know it may seem counterintuitive but I just sent a text to him, but it is most definitely the last. it read: i really feel in the wrong for trying to keep in touch, that wasnt the right thing to do.. and now apologizing is difficult cause thats just like... reaching out , again. nd its not fair to make someone listen always ( so i owe an apology. )if anyone needs me ill be practicing forgiveness to myself and others. no response desired.  and now I feel like the independence that was already growing is now about to fully bloom, and I am ready for everything to come. just wanted to share. Im very sensitive, I know a lot of this is overthinking but I really valued my relationship and losing it was hard on me."

I stopped thinking about it a week after it happened and just now suddenly started crying. I remember it rained the next day. I remember I was sitting on my couch and I can't remember what I was watching, but I was paying attention more to my phone than the show because I was on tinder. I didn't even really have plans to sleep with anyone. I was chatting with a guy named Dan. It was late at night and I was bored and I remember he asked me if I wanted to hang out. I gave him my number and he gave me my address and I remember I had a bad feeling about it. But I ignored that and I noticed he lived 2 minutes away from me, in the apartment complex I'd passed all the time wondering if I should try to move there next. I remember I couldn't find his apartment because there were so many of them. And I remember when I finally did I say outside parked in front of a street light, questioning whether I should go in. And then I told him I was here and he told me to come to the door. The first thing I noticed was that all of the lights were off in the apartment. And then the second thing I noticed was that he locked the door behind me. And the third thing I noticed was how tall he was. He was over a foot taller than me, at least. I think I remember his tinder bio saying he was 6'4. I remember jokingly asking him if he was going to turn on the TV or something, and I looked around his living room and saw there was another door to my left. He didn't answer me about the tv. So we had small talk, and then suddenly he was trying to kiss me. I tried to laugh it off and push him away gently, and then he kissed me harder so I pushed him away firmly and told him that's not what I came here for. And then he kissed me again and held me there, and I remember that's when I really got scared. And as he kissed me I tried to kiss him back, suddenly trying to figure out whether I would be able to get out of this or if I started fighting whether that would make this much worse. He locked the door, so I couldn't run. The door to the left of me, I wasn't sure if it was open. His kitchen was right there, he easily had access to knives. So I decided letting it happen was better than dying. I remember feeling like I'd gone into survival mode. I remember thinking, if I do this then I'll be able to leave without getting hurt. He took his pants down and I got to my knees and did what I had to, like it wasn't even me. Like I was someone else doing that, robotically. And then he stood up and lead me to his bedroom. I remember the floor was carpet. And I can't remember the first position he put me in, but I remember I kept my shirt on the whole time. And I remember I felt so grateful he hadn't seen my fully naked body. So unbelievably grateful that I had gotten to keep that vulnerability. But I remember thinking that if he wasn't doing this to me right now, I would have been attracted to him. He was a physically attractive man. And he didn't have to do this to me. I would have probably eventually slept with him down the line. He didn't have to be doing this. I remember I was on top. And I remember he pulled me into doggy like I was a ragdoll. And then I remember he forced my head down, and pinched my nose shut and wouldn't let me breathe. I felt like an object. I've never felt more worthless. I remember when we were finished I put my clothes back on and he immediately lead me back out to the living room, to that door that was on my left. It had been locked. He unlocked it to let me out. And then he told me to text him when I wanted to do it again. On my short ride home I cried uncontrollably. And when I got back in my apartment it didn't feel the same as it did before I left. It felt hazy and not real anymore. I cried as I undressed again and climbed into the shower, hugging myself as I tried to wash all of that away. As if I was trying to reclaim my body back as my own. I don't remember how long I stayed in the shower, but I remember the full feeling of being violated didn't hit me until I went to wash between my legs. I thought about going to the police, but I was afraid they'd laugh at me and tell me that wasn't rape. Because I did let it happen. I didn't tell anyone until the next day, when I told my best friend over the phone. She told me I should go to the police and call the rape hotline. I didn't. I remember I had to work the next day and my coworker and I were doing an inspection outside. And I remember it was raining, and I remember that entire night I took a lot of breaks to cry in the bathroom. But I remember being out in the rain, and it was quiet, and all I wanted to do was curl up on the ground and die."

Im a rape survivor who generally doesnt think about my assault that much. Its been a few years, and in all Id say my recovery was on the easier end compared to other womens experiences. I consider myself extremely lucky that Im able to have a relatively healthy outlook on sex and usually very much enjoy it. Anyways, last night my boyfriend and I were getting hot and heavy and decided we wanted to have anal. Immediately as he entered me, I got this rush of anxiety, which led to a lot of pain. I froze and started shaking, and my boyfriend immediately pulled out and knew what was wrong. This hadnt happened to me in a long time (not since weve been together), so the fact that he knew exactly what was going on went a long way. I laid there frozen and crying for a good 5 minutes, and he just rubbed my back and held me and said I could talk about it if I wanted to. After I was able to relax, I told him that it was nothing he did and that it wasnt his fault, which he quickly dismissed and said this wasnt about him. I apologized since hed never seen that before and probably wasnt expecting it, and he assured me that I never had to apologize for anything related to my assault. The reason Im posting on here is because this experience made me realize the value of having a supportive and understanding partner, especially after being assaulted. We havent been together a super long time, so the fact that he acted the way he did in a moment of extreme vulnerability for me was amazing. I dont want to be one of those women who brags about their boyfriend incessantly for just being a decent person, but I think this goes beyond that. Im really a lucky lady, and I hope other survivors have/are able to find partners who are equally as supportive."

Now that women have worked so hard to catch up to men through this lens, we're nearly at their level. But through the female lens of compassion, empathy, unity, and emotion, men are severely unequal to us. First of all, men in America are being implicitly taught to negate the importance of their bodily autonomy through routine infant circumcision. Then at a young age they are told by the media (or even friends and family) that they are not allowed to cry, express emotions or show love. They are looked down upon for showing vulnerability, so they hide themselves. They are taught that they need to impress and entertain everyone, while pretending that they can't ever be hurt. As a result, mental illness and suicide in men is on the rise. &amp;#x200B; Never before have women gotten to share such an even playing field with men in almost all career fields. More women are in school, getting educated, and becoming enlightened than ever before. Women are becoming amazingly powerful and independent. This next century is going to be a boon for female leaders, creators, and global influencers. We might even one day overtake men's classic role as the breadwinner. I'm not saying there isn't still progress to be made, especially on a global scale. But nowadays, there's really not much stopping women from attaining any career they want as long as they're willing to work as hard as men. Now we've got the best of both worlds, but men don't. I think it's time that we fought for the rights of men to have the same benefits that we do in society. Men deserve the right to be vulnerable, express emotions, feel deeply, and show love, in the same way that women deserve to attain success and independence, compete with men, and become leaders of society."

We played a game called league of legends together as did all my other friends which lead us to spend more and more time together. We're both very emotionally damaged, neither of us open up to anyone because trusting someone means vulnerability. The more time we spent together the more comfortable we got around each other and one night I had a complete breakdown and I told her that we cannot keep talking to each other, explaining the situation and hoping she understood. We stopped speaking for a few weeks after which we bumped into each other by accident and it was as if nothing changed. Making her laugh was the highlight of every night. My feelings for her grew more and more intense. I couldn't control it anymore and I told her how I feel and I asked her to 'be my partner in crime, my girlfriend'. She said yes and I don't think I've ever felt happier at that point I decided I have to fly out and see her, the distance between us was completely irrelevant to me. I can remember the day I first saw her at the airport to this day as if it happened yesterday. Her silver hair, her blue eyes and that absolutely gob smacking smile. I never felt more nervous in my life, it was as if I was a kid in the schoolyard walking up to my crush. The awkwardness lasted a grand total of 10 minutes after which we both acted around each other as if we knew each other for years.I stayed there for about 10 days and she was the first person I told I love them. She said it back, for the first time also. Our lives haven't been particularly easy outside of us, we both had our problems. She spent the whole start of the relationship making it work for both of us because I was too scared to commit myself emotionally. She studies Japanology, and is hoping to go to Japan for a year as a part of her studies. Which is what had me concerned about how we would make it work. But no matter what she understood how I felt and made me believe that we will make it work. We both had something bad happen in our life around the same time, and I wasn't there for her when she needed me. I hate myself for the fact that I didn't ask her how she really feels about the crap in her life. And because shes just as stubborn as me and hates troubling people with her issues she didn't tell me. But I should have known. The stress of it all got to her and we broke up. That sent me into a spiral. All I could think about was her. The way she would make fun of me whenever i did something stupid ( all the time). Or hearing her telling me she loves me. We didn't speak for weeks. And against my better judgement I messaged her if she would like to play a few matches with me and some friends. She said yes and just like that we spoke to each other as if nothing has happened. We did it again the day after and once again I couldn't handle not telling her how I feel. She told me she feels the same way, but right now it doesn't matter how she feels about me because all of her time is being taken up by university and that it wouldn't be fair on me as she barely has time for herself. I love her, so so fucking much. I love the way she brushes off every compliment I give her because shes terrible at receiving them. I love her passion for tea drinking and drawing. I just love her for her. I love you you silly girl even though you're being stupid. Let me help you believe just like you helped me. I'm sorry I'm a mess and I just don't know what to do."

Two older women joined in the conversation and they insisted on knowing what I wanted and while sitting there in front of me, they were repeatedly saying ""No, pff, no, no..."" , with a judgy look, scanning me, their eyes were going up and down my body, I felt so ashamed. I then kindly said thank you and goodbye, and they acted like I wasn't even there, talking over me already with the salesman. Then they laughed at me while I waited for the manager to finish his phone call.

I don't want to be hated by women I find wiser then me. I lose respect for them, which I really don't want to!!! When a mature woman, or just any woman in fact, but especially older smiles back at me or makes a kind gesture, It gives me such joy! I love women that do that, I find them liberated, free and compassionate. I respect the hell out of them. They give me this fuzzy feeling. But It's so rare.. Many people are afraid of getting older, but I somehow cannot wait for people to take me more seriously and less like a young, inexperienced, sexually ""ripe"" flirt. Then, when I am older, I will prove that one can still have an open heart towards all people, regardless of their age! I know I should stop caring about what they think. But you know, I'll be the first to admit that once I stop caring about that, I stop caring about them as people as well because I don't respect them, and I stop being kind and be bitter instead. I don't want to be bitter and lose the romanticism in me. How do I go about this? If it was an occasional thing, I could just ignore it and move on. But it's been a rule, rather then an exception. I don't want to turn into a warrior with a shield that's protecting me, I don't want to build a wall (which I obviously already did), I would like to keep my human vulnerability.. &amp;#x200B; Do any of you feel the same way?

Even if you didnt understand why, you felt like the lack of a man in your life made you worthless. You felt this even with many people to love, support, and value you. You settled for someone who seemed decent enough. You were desperate to feel value. You cant do better. Like a predator hunting its prey, he sensed your vulnerability. A broken woman.

Im not sure when it hit me that I was trapped. I had the opportunity to go another country, so I did. I never told my family about the abuse. I was blind for years. I thought I was stronger. They thought too highly of me. Im sorry I ever thought you were weak. Im sorry for judging you for not leaving. You were broken and you stayed because he took advantage of that. You werent weak. It wasnt you. It wasnt the addiction. It can happen to anyone. Today marks the 20th anniversary of her death. He may not have been directly responsible but her abuser was the last person she was alive with. The last words she ever heard were insults from him. That will forever haunt me. You died believing all those horrible things about yourself. It was not true. To anyone else out there believing those things. Please know its not true. Its not you. It can be anyone.

The first match offered $20,000 in financial compensation and the second offered $25,000. That's not uncommon for a healthy, light-skinned, well-educated woman who can write good responses to questions and has access to enough photos taken by skilled photographers over her life to show her in an attractive light. There are a lot of agencies that will offer compensation like that to women like me. I recently learned that surrogacy compensation with a for-profit agency in the USA starts around $25,000. It targets a different demographic group. The surrogates I've met have often been working-class women with a few kids. What people are willing to pay me for in exchange for two weeks of doctors visits and a bit of DNA is the same that those women get for actually being pregnant for nine months and literally giving birth to a baby. This makes me feel uncomfortable. A lot of less privileged women get into egg donation and surrogacy because they really need money to pay the bills. Those women go through the exact same medical process, often with lower quality medical care, for less than one tenth of what I'm offered. Unlike me, if they have a complication, they might not be able to run over to a fancy hospital in a big city and know that the doctors will do everything possible to help them because they aren't a very privileged white woman with good health insurance whose reproductive system bleeds money. Fertility treatment involves a lot of different kinds of vulnerability. There are women who undergo years of invasive medical treatments only to finally learn their eggs aren't fertile and their children will not be biologically related to them. There are those who are repeatedly stimulated until they have fifty ripe follicles and have dozens of biological offspring whose identities are unknown to them. There are surrogates whose bodies nurture and protect a growing fetus for almost a year and then must separate from the newborn life. The ethics of the for-profit fertility industry concerns me. The fact that I can check off certain boxes for appearance and education means that I am offered more money for going through the exact same risky medical procedure as another woman. The way that agencies may pressure young women into signing legal contracts to get medical procedures that they do not fully understand is shameful. The misrepresentation of donors and surrogates to intended parents makes me wonder what will happen when those kids take a $50 DNA test and find out the truth. Implanting an embryo made with an egg from a woman like me into the body of a poor woman of color and treating both of us like employees instead of friends is not okay. The way that these agencies prey on the vulnerability of infertile women and suggest that they can have a more 'complete' experience of motherhood if they turn their pockets inside out is appalling. There is nothing less whole or beautiful about a family that you are not genetically related to, or one with a child that you didn't see the birth of. If you are considering becoming an egg donor or using one to create a family, I encourage you to check out the We Are Egg Donors blog. It helped me immensely in understanding the risks of what I was getting into, both physically and emotionally. I don't think that it's inherently unethical to accept or give money as part of egg donation or a surrogate. We live in a capitalist society and doing these things involves real risks and can end up costing a lot of money if you have complications. I personally am not comfortable with any further involvement from a for-profit agency now that I'm more aware of what's actually going on, but I don't blame others who don't make the same decision. I am really into open matches where the families know one another and respect one another. They are biologically related and oftentimes biological relatives like to know one another. Individual preference matching is not something I think anyone would debate the value of. I think it would be much better if donors and surrogates and families had a way to directly match with one another and decide what they all want and need among themselves. That sounds a lot more family-like to me."
66,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,I have complicated feelings about egg donation.,1,apawym,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/apawym/i_have_complicated_feelings_about_egg_donation/,2019-02-11 12:21:23,"I became interested in donating my eggs and was matched twice through egg donation agencies based in the USA. The first match offered $20,000 in financial compensation and the second offered $25,000. That's not uncommon for a healthy, light-skinned, well-educated woman who can write good responses to questions and has access to enough photos taken by skilled photographers over her life to show her in an attractive light. There are a lot of agencies that will offer compensation like that to women like me. There are a lot of serious health risks that women face if they choose to donate eggs. The process involves injecting yourself with high doses of strong hormones, having your ovaries grow to be the size of oranges, followed by anesthesia, invasive surgery, and a recovery for which you may not have any access to pain medicine. Complications such as ovarian torsion and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can lead to infertility and death. Asking for money in exchange for taking those risks is not the same as 'selling your children' and it is offensive to everyone involved to minimize the risks by saying things like that. I recently learned that surrogacy compensation with a for-profit agency in the USA starts around $25,000. It targets a different demographic group. The surrogates I've met have often been working-class women of color with a few kids. What people are willing to pay me for in exchange for two weeks of doctors visits and a bit of DNA is the same that those women get for actually being pregnant for nine months and literally giving birth to a baby.

I was looking to throw myself into it having just gotten out of a kind of relationship where i lost my sense of self. Just bad. He'd say things i didn't like, and instead of walking away or standing up for myself...I'd just try to empathize with him. By the end of it I'd compromised my self so much I was a doormat. And i feel it tremendously. I get anxious, i get terribly sad, and some days i just cry. I'd explained all this to these women when i interviewed to join and that i was feeling insecure, weak and looking to build on myself. That i loved charity work, seen the good they'd done and was excited to get to work. They quickly brought me in and even made me an officer ( this was upon meeting me fit the first time ). I was nervous but excited. This would build me up. We had our first event yesterday and it went well and we went for lunch after. The president of the club, the vp and the vp's husband and me. During lunch we got to talking about events we could hold and asked what I could bring to the table to fundraise. I enjoy car shows and know some of the local car clubs. They'd mentioned they hadn't had success with car shows before. And i asked who they'd worked with. They mentioned one of the clubs who's founder I know and i said, ' I know him, I'm good to his boys' At this point the president immediately turns to me and calls me a whore. Not joking, not under her breath. Just looks at me and says 'Whore' I was confused and thought I'd heard wrong. I asked her 'what' and she said it again. 'Whore' At which point i just felt like shit. I told her no... I know him and his sons, they're good kids and build cars. I'm kind to his kids, go to their shows and partys. She told me she thought I'd meant i was sleeping with the whole car club. I told her 'no!' I felt miserable. I started to tear up and kept repeating ' I'm not a whore ' there in the restaurant. The hostess was just a few feet from me. The VP said nothing but looked horrified. And her husband just got quiet. I got my stuff and walked outside and they both quickly followed me outside. They tried hugging me and apologizing and i felt miserable. And then i apologized too them for being upset about it... I explained to them again i was just going through some stuff and felt very insecure and vulnerable. And diverted attention to the fact that i was getting over the guy I'd been seeing fit the last 8 months. I cried some more but the day went on. We had other things to do. The president gave me a gift and bought me a drink at the next stop. We would be interviewing another girl who wanted to join. I stayed quiet and listened to them explain to the new girl about how they were there to support women, had all been through difficult times and worked hard to be there for each other. When the day finally ended with them i got home and the president sent me a meme about getting my shit together. And it dawned on me. She called me a whore. And i apologized to her. And that act alone had given them permission to now blame me and use my vulnerability against me. They can call me whatever they want, treat me however they want and if i take offense then i ""just need to get my shit together."" In the past I've made excuses for people, stick it out, try to see it from their side. Think it'll get better. It doesn't. I'm not doing that again. I'm leaving the group today. That's me getting my shit together. I'm not staying in a group where the president can double down on calling me a whore. In front of other officers, in public. At all. "

I've always thought of myself somewhat sage and experienced with relationships as I approach my mid 30's. I've read all the ""Are you dating a narcissist?"" and ""9 signs you're being gaslit"" articles on psychology websites. I thought I would see the red flags from MILES away. Only after a couple months of spending time with a guy I thought was charming and caring, I was pushed to the point where I was questioning my own sanity. I stopped dating and deleted my social media because I believed I was ""too unstable"" and ""messed up"". He knew I was looking for more, but I agreed to try platonic friendship after his extremely strong insistence. This week I told him I couldn't be his friend anymore. I still had feelings for him and hearing him talk about other girls was hurtful and triggered my anxiety. He freaked out, said I was a poor friend anyway because he had to ""walk on eggshells around me"". He refused to answer when I tried to clarify if he had feelings for me, stormed out and left me at the bar we met at with half a drink. I followed up and apologized for ""mixed mesages"" (because I was struggling with my feelings but also wanting the friendship) and let him know I was open if he eventually wanted more (totally taking that last back now!) He replied with a bunch of really confusing messages and said that I was emotionally unstable, demanding, and a poor communicator and that he no longer even wanted a friendship. I went through an extremely traumatic loss - a commonality we both shared - last summer and he saw this vulnerability and took advantage of it. I'm coming to terms with just how easy it is to fall in to the trap, especially with how rational and sure of myself I like to think I am. I'm lucky I got out only two months but I can't help but continue to question my perceptions after this experience. And man, is it hard to know he's left this experience thinking he's done nothing wrong, that it's all my fault, and is going to continue treating people this way. The red flags can be subtle, ladies. It feels awful to have your own feelings and perceptions questioned."

One of my first relationships was with a guy (met him through work and friends) who I trusted with everything. One day, a flip switched and he looked at me and said, ""I don't like you. Get out."" No warning. I was devastated and it broke me for over a year. It lead to severe depression and I think it is why I have these feelings about men. I want to meet someone and I want to be able to trust them, but there's always this voice in the back of my mind telling me that they might be violent or they may be someone completely different behind closed doors. I get that vulnerability is a huge part of being with someone, but I'm just so afraid. Anyone who has been through this, or has advice on how to get past it, please share in the comments.

I find myself wondering if it makes sense to write this now because it's a season of new beginnings. Sometimes, to realize a new beginning, you need to let go. &amp;#x200B; It's time to let go. &amp;#x200B; When I was 21, I went on a few dates with a guy I met at a party. He seemed nice enough but I called things off when I acknowledged that I wasn't ready for a real relationship. At the time, I had just suffered my first real heartbreak. There is nothing quite like the first one, and it made me naive  I had thought I could meet someone else and have an open heart right way. I was wrong. He understood when I broke things off  or at least, he seemed to. &amp;#x200B; Months later, I received an email with a long document attached  it contained several pages of hurtful things about me. The words also made me feel personally threatened. When he called to apologize, I wouldn't accept his apology. The poor excuse of I didn't mean to send it was immediately won over when I pointed out that you don't accidentally send a 7 page typed letter without some sort of forethought. &amp;#x200B; A few months went by, and things escalated. I started receiving hearing that he'd asked friends where I was going on weekends, or what bars I'd go to at school. I received letters to my family home without sharing the address. He showed up at friend's homes looking for me. I politely asked him to please leave me alone. I knew I didn't have enough concrete information to call the police. &amp;#x200B; I moved to a different province for school and he found me there within a month. I started getting several messages a day from various sources. I got rid of my cell phone and got a burner phone that couldn't be traced. The comments became increasingly vulgar and sexual in nature, and all posted under fake names. I knew in my heart that it was him. &amp;#x200B; While I knew the things he accused me of were untrue, I started to build a narrative in my head that anyone who acted the way he described was leaving themselves open to the potential of a similarly awful experience. I know, of course, that this is a ridiculous thought. But the repetition of the messages, the lewd content, and the personal nature of the attacks ate away at me. I began to form strong ideas about sexual vulnerability and convinced myself that if I didn't allow this to be part of my life, that I would be safe. &amp;#x200B; After a full year of receiving messages without responding, I finally answered to say that if he contacted me again, I was calling the police. I received another taunt almost immediately, and made the call. I will spare the details of the following six months, but they included an influx of messages, a police officer that said the whole situation was my fault, and the threat of a trial where all the horrible things would be read aloud. &amp;#x200B; I went to a therapist to try and understand why this was happening to me. I almost dropped out of school. I became very depressed. It was one of the most difficult and dark times of my life. It made me question the core of my personality  my ability to trust, and see the best in others. I felt lost in my ability to express myself. I questioned everything... &amp;#x200B; ...In the end, I won the war. Charges were laid. A trial was avoided (thankfully). I cannot express the emotion that came over me, almost 3 years after this had all started, when I received a copy of the court order in the mail. With my name and his, a list of conditions, and his signature. I felt freer than I had in years. &amp;#x200B; I won't pretend that this experience hasn't affected me since. I've struggled with intimacy, feeling that if I explore sexuality too much, that I might become worthy of the comments he made, that I might be the woman he believed me to be. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward to today, and I have found my forever partner. He is more than I ever thought could exist. He is my best friend, my soul mate, and the best sexual partner I've ever had. He has been patient and kind as I've fought with myself in exploring my sexuality and how it fits with his. I've grown so much, and I'm truly proud of myself. He encouraged me to write this story. &amp;#x200B; To anyone who has felt afraid, or has questioned the person that they are: you are not alone. You are beautifully perfect, just as you are. You are strong, even when you feel weak. You are fierce, and fair, and kind-hearted. Don't feel alone. Write, and share. Everyone here is cheering for you. &amp;#x200B; Final note: &amp;#x200B; Since my harassment occurred mostly online, I'll admit the terror I feel in posting this. This is the first personal account I've written and posted publicly in almost thirteen years. But it's time. I hope this helps others feel less scared, less alone, and more supported and empowered. &amp;#x200B; With a brave heart and a deep breath, I click Post."

Even during regular appointments, Im pretty anxious. Ill do it, but I need them to walk me through it. I work in the medical field and realize its just another day to all of them, its not necessarily the *embarrassment* of being exposed (although thats not great...) but more so just being in a vulnerable state of unawareness. What makes me anxious is the vulnerability of being under anesthesia and having people put their hands/tools in my most sensitive area without my awareness. I dont love anesthesia because Im a bit of a control freak and total loss of consciousness freaks me out. I trust my doctor more than *anything* and she explicitly told me she does not allow anyone into the OR without introducing themselves to me. Shes amazing.

73,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,The biggest change estrogen brought me is an understanding of the universe of plutonic affection between women.,1,ad790o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ad790o/the_biggest_change_estrogen_brought_me_is_an/,2019-01-07 03:54:19,"I cant speak for others, only myself. However I do think that many others will find this resonates with their own experiences as well. Before hrt, when I was living in a brain vastly dominated by testosterone, female-female affection was so conflated with sexuality that I had incredible trouble distinguishing the subtle layers of it and grasping it. (Accounts shared by other testosterone-based brains corroborate this... as if its even in question). Now, after 24 months of estrogen (and 12 of progesterone, which yes - does have effects) I can confidently say that the biggest single change of transition has been coming into a new understanding of how women relate to other women. There are entire *dimensions* of plutonic, straight-girl affection that I had no idea existed before. Im talking the cuddle tight, soul-to-soul, big sister love that is based on mutual empathy and appreciation for each others shared vulnerability. These feelings can exist concurrently with or independent of sexuality altogether. And with the case of many of my girlfriends, it can be a delicate mix. Sometimes queer, friendship-plus girlfriends want to get sexual with each other, and sometimes they just want to comfort each other. Sometimes a mixture of both. No ownership or ego is implied in these interactions - its just a love language that was completely alien to me before. I think when many conceive of the secret world of girls this is what they imagine is (and truthfully is) behind the veil. Its the kind of world where lesbians, straight girls, and everything in between exist in happy harmony because they know they arent a threat to each other. Its something that I both had to learn socially (sometimes awkwardly and through missteps) and also experience as a result of shifting brain chemistry. When we talk about how the brain changes by up to 40% in the first years of transition, this is a large part of it. Its produced experiences I wouldnt have been able to predict... like becoming closed off from former guy friends (because of *course* they dont understand and just want to defend their male-ness), the horror of betrayal from seemingly innocent social moves (tammy u backstabbing bitch how could you be friends with her after what she did), giant sweaty underwear cuddle puddles with my best friends that were completely fulfilling in ways having *nothing* to do with sex, and having an innate connection to new women I meet through a similar body chemistry that automatically places us on the same team (until one of us messes up lol). So many focus on the physical changes of transition. I just think its important to emphasize the mental ones as well . Yes, my face, my boobs, butt, skin, hair, etc etc. have all magically morphed over these past years. But it pains me when people define a transition by those things - they arent the most profound difference (at least, in my humble experience). Its the priceless universe of new friendships and relationships it brought me as well. "
74,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Advice on a toxic relationship with the mother of my children and how to exit maturely.,1,ad8ses,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ad8ses/advice_on_a_toxic_relationship_with_the_mother_of/,2019-01-07 06:23:49,"Preface: I am a 34yo male living with my girlfriend (27) and our two boys (2 and 7mos). I am the sole provider for our family and earn a good income. So here is goes... I met my girlfriend late in 2016. She had a beautiful 5mo old son at the time and as I understood it, the biological father was completely out of the picture. Our first date was great. No red flags at the time and we seemed to mesh very well. So we began officially dating very quickly. The honeymoon phase was great and I believed and acted as such. She had just moved to my state a few months prior to our meeting to get away from the toxicity of where she grew up and the biological father. So we was living with relatives when we met. In February of 2017, I offered her and her son to move in with me. Early, I know, but everything seemed okay. Her father (a heavy drug user whom was mostly shunned from the family) also came out this way, and would visit her from time to time. A little outside my comfort zone but its her dad. Anyway, fast forward a few months, she goes to visit him to bring him groceries, finds him in his shabby apartment dead of OD. Very sad! Her mother had already died when she was very young, so this was her final living parent. This kicked up a whirlwind of chaos and was the catalyst to my finding out way more about her and her past than I could have ever anticipated. She played it off as being very stable and almost as she expected this day would come, so dealt with it very maturely - or at least presented it that way. I lost my father when I was eighteen, so I know there is no one way to act when greeting and people have that right. At any rate, what I did not know, is she was slowly breaking down internally. I learned much later that she has had a very tough upbringing and has been on various physiological, antidepressant and anxiety medications throughout her life. Upon the birth of her first son, she stopped all medication. So this was about the 10 month post medication point when this happened. At this point however, I was not aware of any of the medical history. About a month after this happened and me being as supportive as I possibly could, she mentioned the possibility of an old friend coming out to see her and staying with us at my (our) place. Of course I said yes. Seeing friends and being around people can be great when in mourning, especially in a new state without any friends near. So her girlfriend arrives and all is well, shes a little young (22) but overall seems like a nice girl. One night after a few days she mentions wanting to go out for the night. Bars/Clubs etc. I agreed it could be good to get out and I would stay and watch the boy. They both get all dolled up and everything seemed fine. I am not the jealous type, so to me none of this was a big deal. That night, after getting the boy to bed, I stayed up watching movies as they said theyd most likely be back before midnight. 1am rolls around, nothing. 2am, Im guessing they just wanted to stay until the bars closed. I text around 2:30am... nothing. Well now Im worried. Are they okay? Did something happen? Etc. I send maybe one more text and try to call both of them. No answer or reply. About 5am rolls around, they stumble in and she goes right to bed. Says she tired and will tell me all about it later just needs sleep. Okay, super odd and a bit disrespectful, but whatever. Next morning she goes into a convoluted story of what happened that night that makes no sense. Some friend she knows (from this state?) showed up and they hung out with them.. a group of frat guys. Anyway, all this made no sense to me but whatever, brush the night off as a fluke, but Im on a bit more of alert. Next few days she is becoming super distant and would spend all day on her phone. We went with her girlfriend to a popular scenic area of my state about 2 hrs away, she opts to sit in the back seat and proceeds to be on her phone texting the whole ride and engaging in none of the conversations. Okay, now Im noticing something is majorly up. Ive dated shady girls like this is the past so Im curious as to whats keeping her attention. A couple days later, she wants to look up something on her phone for her that will take a while. So I do it. Pop open her texts (something I traditionally think is not kosher and generally a breach of privacy, but with red flags going off, I felt a bit more justified) I find a massive text thread with the guy she met that night. I read a few paragraphs of their conversation and it is every guys worst nightmare. Furious and hurt, I tell her I saw them and it is over. Tell me exactly what happened that night. She wont and had gotten her phone back and would not allow me to see the text thread in its entirety. I said the only hope for us would be for me to read that entire conversation and for her to spill the beans on everything. Me TRYING to be understanding, thinking an act like this was out of the chaos of mourning etc. even if she cheated that night, we could possibly work it out, but I HAD to see the texts and know what happened. Long story short, she never budged and we broke up. A few months later, after her constant barrage of contacting me talking about needing me back, and being the best thing that ever happened to her, yadda yadda yadda.. her son misses me (who calls me daddy and knows me as such). I caved. I gave her another chance. Against my gut feelings, but Im a softy and love the kid to death. She moves back in, and things slowly rebuild. She tells me about her past and physiological issues and medications. We get her a dr. appt. and get her back on the road to recovery. Together. She tells me all about growing up dirt poor and getting shuffled around family members, and at about 17 one of her friends uncle that is a wealthy older man (around 45 at the time) took interest in her. *eye roll* so she became his mistress. He gave her everything she ever wanted. The life of opulence. Coming from nothing, this was a huge deal for her and to me- he prayed on her naivety and vulnerability, but she would disagree. (Note: hes not the father of her first son) A few months later (September 2017) I buy a new house. Bigger and much more suited for raising a family. Everything seems to be going smoothly for the most part. She quits her job and intends on being a full time parent/homemaker (supposedly her life dream.) I somewhat reluctantly agree, because she worked from home anyway and was making decent wages. She has also been in a long legal battle to get her sons biological fathers rights removed, to which he is in agreement. The state made it more difficult, but I fully extended to adopt him as my own anyway. Mind you Im paying for all these legal fees for the process and its not cheap. The biological father has paid nothing. Whatever. One offshoot random time when the moon is of a blue hue, we have sex. Guess what? She gets pregnant from that. Yikes. Im scared, but totally ready to be an actual father myself. After a ROUGH 9 months, she gives birth to our beautiful healthy baby boy! I am so happy and so ready for another bundle of joy in the house. However, as our relationship progresses, her behavior seems to be all over the place. Some days up, some days down. Some days furious for no reason, picking fights with her family, my family, anybody. Her medication gets switch up a few times and it levels her out but is always short lived. She complains about everything. She acts as if her life is in the gutter and deserves much better. Anything can set her off and she treats me like shit. We have no sex life or intimacy. I know antidepressants can do that so I never push it. And honestly with how things had been going, I never really felt in the mood much anyway. I can count on two hands how many times weve had sex total. It feels more like living with a shitty roommate than a flourishing relationship. I begin to realize much of our life philosophies do not match up whatsoever. She exhibits very poor ethics much of the time and has an odd sense of superiority over everyone. Just, yuck. As a person. She would constantly complain about the boys being too much to handle all day while Im at work. She just could not deal with two young boys by herself. She Gettys stressed and overwhelmed easily. So my thinking was that if she stopped working from home and just watched the boys for the 8hrs a day while I work, wed at very least save money on childcare. Well, she suggests we hire help for her. So we hire a young college kid that would assist her during the day. Assist being a key word. Come to find out the helper girl does ALL of the childcare while my GF runs errands or takes a nap all day. Were not paying this girl full childcare rates. So I feel so bad, but cannot afford a full time babysitter if my GF doesnt work and is home ALL DAY. Thats just ludicrous. I start to lose myself. I am a shell of who I was. Ive gotten out of shape. I have no friends outside of work. I had a passion project that was a flourishing side business that has been essentially abandoned. Everything that made me happy and enjoy life was basically no more. The boys are now my main priority- and rightfully so. I love both of these kids with all my heart and they deserve to grow up to become well adjusted and respectful members of society. In this current situation, I dont see this being possible and it kills me. So anyway, I got her the new iPhone for Christmas. She has been on an old phone on her aunts family plan since I met her. I pay her aunt $50/mo for her plan, I wanted to add her on my plan and it would be free. So with the new phone, this would essentialist serve this purpose. On Christmas when she saw the phone she was FURIOUS. She didnt want to be on my plan. She didnt want a new phone. She threw the biggest fit because Christmas sucked and nobody got her anything good. She wanted a Louis Vuitton bag. *eye roll* She acted like a spoiled brat 13 year old at the age of 27. We have KIDS. The holidays are about them! Not us. Anyway... fast forward to a couple of days ago. We finally get her new phone on my plan and Im backing up her old phone on the computer, etc. I have trusted her and have not had the urge to peek at her messages in a long time - year and a half at least since the first time. I find multiple messages to guys. One old boyfriend from her old state, talking about missing them, memories of having sex, always dreaming about them, one said you were supposed to be the one I end up with and it hurts. One was a long thread with that older guy she was with when she was young. Talking about loving each other and needing each other and figuring out how they can somehow be together. Sending photos. Some of her with our new son cropped out. I mean just the most disrespectful and hurtful things you could image to see. At this time she does not know Ive seen these messages. Im just done. Mentally drained and ready to be out of this mess. I need to get out. But, I have NO clue how to go about it. She lives here. I support her and our boys financially 100%. I do not want to keep the boys from their mother, regardless of what happens with us. I have raised the 2 year old boy as if he was my own and he knows I am daddy. However , I do not have any parental rights legally to him. I do not want to lose him as a son through this. I do not suspect any type of ending of our relationship to go well. She fights dirty and will do or say anything to anyone in order to get her desired result. This scares the shit out of me the most. I think this exit has to be very well thought out, tactful and executed. I can do this as maturely as possible but she does not play by those rules. Thoughts and ideas.. Do I keep an eye on these messages and let it get worse? witch it undoubtably will. Then bring them up when its so obvious theres no way of saying something like its just texts or I was feeling lonely/down or whatever excuse shell attempt to use. She is known to play the victim too, so Im prepared for that response as well. That or some type of guilt trip. All of which is complete nonsense. My other thought was get her aunt (who shes close to) and my mother (who shes close to) together and bring everything to light with them present. I know seems odd, but for perfection of her claiming anything foul from that moment. Kind of having them there as witnesses. Maybe I couldnt get into major details of the messages then, but pretty much plead my case of why this relationship isnt working and how all I want is a quick and appropriate resolution to this where the kids are the top priority. The kids love here and it would make no sense to remove them from my care. She can move out, find a job and work on getting herself to a better place overall. She clearly is not happy with me and the life I provide for her. I honestly want her to be independently happy, and if it is not me. She needs to find it. She shows me nothing but disrespect and zero regard, but I will not stoop to that level. I just need out. For my sanity and for the boys to not grow up in a toxic household. TL:DR - I have no idea how to shorten this. Sorry for the long post. I wrote this in one sitting so there are many points missing, but... Also, am on mobile so forgive any errors in spelling/grammar.

I. Am. Terrified. I have an extreme aversion of being vulnerable physically, mentally, and emotionally. I cant be in any state of undress in front of a boyfriend so I sure as hell cant be in front of an actual stranger. I cant do strangers touching me. God forbid touching me when Im in an extreme state of vulnerability. Im actually shaking while typing this or even thinking about it. Ive had reoccurring nightmares about being naked in a doctors office for literal years (since my highschool health class dropped this terrifying news onto me). I got my wisdom teeth out a few years ago. The only reason i didnt run out screaming is I got to wear clothes. I literally layered clothes on top of me like armor. But still the idea of a medical procedure sent my heart rate so high the nurse practitioner was actually shocked it was that high just sitting in the chair. I had to get some kind of intravenous medicine to slow my heart rate down so it didnt just explode. Honestly? The oh but they could catch something wrong with you doesnt come into the occasion at all. I think Ill actually be traumatized from the experience. And that trauma will outweigh any benefit. None of this is a hyperbole or a joke. It took my now ex TWO years to get me to go anywhere more intimate than hand holding. I have a serious issue with this and Im not sure what to do. Im considering not coming home at all from college during Christmas to avoid it. Even if theyre holding my birth control pills hostage. "

This piece almost sounds like a rape apologist nonsense , as he is arguing that women who go outside without hijab has some blame to fall on themselves. As this sub is one of the most famous feminist online forums , I figured I post this here to get your thoughts on this : &gt; Did you hear about the senior citizen who lost his life savings because of an email scam? &gt; Wow, thats sad. He probably shouldnt have been replying to shady emails. &gt; Did you hear about the recent incident with the college student who got blackout drunk and his wallet was stolen? &gt; Yeah, what do you expect when youre drinking irresponsibly? &gt; Did you hear about the kid who got murdered via drive-by shooting? &gt; Oh, that was a sad story. He was mixing with gang members and a rival gang mistook him for someone else. We need to teach our youth the dangers of associating with gangs. &gt; Did you hear about the small town in West Virginia that has filed for bankruptcy because their local economy collapsed and now thousands of people there have to abandon their homes? &gt; Well, serves them right for voting for Trump! &gt; Did you hear about the thousands who have died this year due to the opioid epidemic? &gt; We have to educate people on the dangers of using these drugs so they can make better decisions. &gt;Did you hear about the young woman who was sexually assaulted by a guy friend whos apartment she went to alone? Probably was a bad idea to be alone with a guy, right? &gt; OH MY GOD, STOP VICTIM BLAMING, YOU DISGUSTING CREEP. YOU ARE PERPETUATING RAPE CULTURE, YOU RAPE ENABLER. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. ___________________________ &gt; #FeministLogic &gt; In all these other scenarios, it is a perfectly human, perfectly rational response to reflect on the causes of victimhood and note practical things victims could have done to minimize their chances of being taken advantage of and suffering their fate. Feminists dont have any problems with this typical dialectic when it comes to any of these other instances of crime, victimization, and suffering. They only focus on one kind of victimization and impose ridiculous, irrational standards for how we should react to those cases. And they are completely oblivious to their inconsistency and double standards. &gt; But if we reflect more deeply, we should ask: Why are feminists so keen to impose this double standard? Why do they want people to avoid discussing the causes of sexual assault in a *holistic* manner? In all other instances of crime, we recognize the importance of a holistic approach. A holistic approach addresses: &gt; 1. Practical steps to stop criminal behavior. &gt; 2. Practical steps people can take to avoid being victimized by criminals. &gt; But feminists say, No! &gt; Tell me: is there any other crime where the ONLY way to reduce it is to insist over and over again that people not commit the crime? Is there any other crime where suggesting practical steps to reduce peoples vulnerability to criminals is considered promoting criminal culture, etc.? &gt; There is only one crime  sexual misconduct against women  where practicality and common sense go out the window. If you say anything about #2, feminists accuse you of being a rape enabler who is perpetuating rape culture. Why? &gt; It is because they know that addressing #2 contradicts their cultural program. Since the 1960s, feminists have been telling women *and* men: &gt; Be open and explicit in expressing your sexuality! &gt; Men and women should mix and flirt and have fun! &gt; Casual sex is liberating! &gt; Theres nothing wrong with being secluded with the opposite sex! &gt; Throw away your inhibitions, get out of your comfort zone, indulge your desires, own your sexuality! &gt; Experiment with sex! &gt; Soliciting sex from strangers makes you empowered! &gt; Dress like a slut because modesty is something the patriarchy invented to control you! &gt; The sheer suffering, misery, and destruction caused by this feminist cultural program is incalculable. One of the many results of it: more sexual assault, more rape, more harassment. But feminists dont want to take responsibility. And they certainly dont want to modify their vile, destructive ideology. So the only strategy is denialism. They just deny that it is their teaching and their messaging that are the true origins of rape culture. &gt; Whats really sad are the Muslim feminists. Like lemmings over a cliff, they militantly agree with their atheist feminist counterparts that Islam cant help women. In reality, Islams insistence on hijab, insistence on male guardianship, insistence on ghira, prohibition of zina, prohibition of khalwa, prohibition of ikhtilat, etc., etc., all significantly reduce incidences of rape and sexual misconduct. &gt; But Muslim feminists are not buying it. They fanatically agree with their atheist feminist friends that none of these Islamic guidelines are relevant to rape or do anything to meaningfully reduce sexual assault. According to them, the ONLY thing that can reduce rape is to tell men not to be rapists over and over again. Theyre too dense to recognize the theological implications of this. The implication is that Allah did not institute a comprehensive system of morality and human relations to minimize the suffering of women. The implication is that there is no deeper, Divine wisdom behind Allahs guidance that, when followed, protects women from assault. &gt; And the other more subtle but damning implication is that Islam doesnt really offer anything unique or different from what feminism has to offer in preventing rape. Think about that. These Muslim feminists are essentially saying that the man-made ideology of feminism is on the same level as Allahs guidance in stopping sexual assault. Instead of recognizing the unique Divine wisdom that permeates our Sharia, they simply take feminist platitudes and try to Islamicize them. And wherever Islam does contradict the feminist narrative, they minimize Islam or outright reject Islamic guidance. This is the depth of their delusion. &gt; Thankfully, the Muslim community is waking up to how toxic, irrational, and vile these feminists truly are. "

It sounds whiny, but the discussion was actually AMAZING and mature and full of raw, emotional honesty - not bashing or anything even remotely like it.

TL;DR -- I need a book about how to build healthy communication in heterosexual relationships that is informed by recent Feminist theory. I'd also love to hear some reading recommendations from men about toxic masculinity and self-healing... Or, something to that effect. &amp;#x200B; (Throwaway for obvious reasons.) &amp;#x200B; OK. I'm a woman in a heterosexual relationship with a man who I love dearly. We were close friends for more than 10 years before we started dating two years ago. The problem is, as a white man who was raised in the American South in the 80s (albeit inside a pretty progressive neighborhood in a major city), he's got some blind spots when it comes to his own microaggressions and biases. &amp;#x200B; My partner was raised by progressive parents who taught him to be sensitive to feminist issues, and he's very supportive about my struggles in the world outside our relationship. However, he sometimes fails to see his own male fragility, his Patriarchal tendency to view emotion as weakness, and how these things affect both of us. He is not strong in emotional availability, vulnerability, communication, and other things which the Patriarchy commonly handicaps in boys: cleanliness, social relationship maintenance, self-care, and self-validation. I know he wants to work on these things, but he seems stuck on how to start. &amp;#x200B; Over the last 18 months of this amazing Feminist power surge, I have changed dramatically. As a woman with a history of abuse, the media coverage of #MeToo really forced me to confront my trauma, beliefs, behavior, standards, and views of others in situations different from mine. But my partner is not yet ready for my new reality, and it's causing a lot of friction. &amp;#x200B; Our primary issue is communication. When he gets emotionally overwhelmed, he shuts down, he goes silent and locks me out, leaving me to feel abandoned and alone. Then I shut down, which means I get loud and emotional and drag him into my feelings when he's not ready. These are very stereotypical male-female communication issues, but I'm not interested in reading some tired and problematic Mars vs. Venus bullshit that only serves to reinforce stereotypes. Can anyone recommend a book that will help us root out the Patriarchal bullshit that sits under the surface in both of us?? &amp;#x200B; Thanks in advance to all you ladies and men and non-binary folks for ""listening"".

We'd been fighting from the very beginning. We basically fell in love fighting. We challenged each other. I always struggled with a low sense of self worth, and our fights made me stand up to the challenge, and it gave me a sense of strength, somehow. For a long time. I thought I was stronger. But I kept fighting for love, for attention, for warmth, while he fought for us to be independent, stronger, 'mature'. I didn't see it as maturity, I just saw it as cold. It seemed easy to dismiss emotional needs, vulnerability, and intimacy, while putting all this weight on performance, success, and a general being on top of your shit. Sometimes I wasn't on top of my shit, sometimes I was a total wreck, and we fought the most in those times, it seemed. Because I wasn't performing up to task. I felt inadequate, and yet over time, the carrot and stick act got tiring. The carrots didn't even taste good anymore. His compliments felt patronizing, I felt like he didn't even believe what he was saying when he said nice things. Maybe that was all in my head, but after having to beg him for positive attention and warmth, after a while that warmth just felt fabricated. I blame myself a lot for the problems. Like, maybe I was just lazy and I needed to grow up, like he said. Maybe I'm just immature. Maybe his emotional intelligence is shit, but maybe I could have loved him anyway, knowing that he loves me so much and even though we have all these problems he'd still want to be with me. I think I couldn't stand the feeling of pressure I felt all the time. The need to validate myself, and not feeling validated. I realized I'm still not comfortable with myself, with who I am deep down. Instead, I always wish I were more like him- stronger, independent, stoic. But I'm not, I'm just not, and I can't hate myself for not being that way, and I can't force him to change either. I know because I tried talking to him about these problems all year and it only made our relationship worse. I would back off for a week or two weeks or three weeks and then something would happen that made me feel like I could and should bring it up again, but no, we'd just fight again. It was exhausting and I did just lose faith in our ability to make this work. I started telling him I'm checking out, I'm thinking about leaving, considering that things have not improved and instead I've just been feeling like shit. He'd always want me to take responsibility for my part, my role, but I didn't think my faults validated his treatment after I've had enough of it. He started telling me to just leave if I am so unhappy and I'd say I wasn't sure that's what either of us really wanted, I just needed him to know that it's on my mind if I keep feeling like he pushes me out a lot and things don't seem to be improving. I suggested therapy, I asked him to look into his superior insurance to see if there was anything available that I couldn't get on mine. The month I started giving up was the month he finally looked into it, but we still kept fighting. I got an apartment and I told him I was putting in the rent check, and over the course of a week updating him on the status of me getting this apartment, he slowly seemed to change his behavior, subtly, until the very day I put in the non-refundable first month's rent, he begged me not to go, and I was floored with confusion. I already put in the money! I don't know how to cancel this lease it's not so easy. Plus, I really do think at this point the space would be good for me. Maybe we could just date from a distance? Maybe we can just take advantage of the time apart to really reflect on ourselves? He wasn't having any of that, he just kept begging me not to go. I put off moving out a few days until I finally cracked under the pressure of him pleading and I just left, just to get some air. 5 days later, I got assaulted right outside of my new apartment. Cancelled the lease, wasted the very expensive month's worth of rent in SF \[I was paying double rent that month\]. I was concusssed and had 2 broken teeth, my self esteem was totally shot, and I returned to my ex's apartment with my tail between my legs, extremely depressed. We spent one week trying to give us another chance. My heart just wasn't in it anymore. He was pushing for physical contact, sex, I wasn't having any of it, I was so stiff, I turned inward so much. I hated myself. I hated everything. I didn't matter anymore. I tried to open up to him better but I just couldn't and it was breaking his heart. He vacillated between begging me to stay and telling me to just leave if I'm not going to be warm like I used to be. It reminded me of the times I would beg him to be warmer to me. I empathized and I also felt so bitter. Oh, \*now\* he wants it, after everything. Better late than never? I still couldn't bring myself to feel optimistic. I panicked and got an Airbnb. I told him a few days later and he was so upset, he said it's over if I leave, I already left once before, I only came back because I was assaulted, and now I'm leaving again, it's obviously over. I told him I don't know what to say to that. I do love him, I really do, but all of this shit just happened between us, it's been such a hard year with him, I've been feeling so frustrated, becoming more aware of my personal need for validation from him, I'm even hoping he validates my need to move out. And when he doesn't, I feel so worthless, that I realize I HAVE to move out or else I'll just feel worthless for the rest of my life. I have to do something for myself, because getting married doesn't feel right anymore, and I can't keep dragging him on a string hoping that I feel better. I have to do this for myself. I can't even blame him for these problems. I know he can be cold and stubborn and honestly a pretty big jerk. I know that. But I still love him, and if I were a stronger person, I wouldn't have hung onto every word he said, I wouldn't have let myself feel worthless for every time he dismissed my feelings or failed to comprehend the value of fulfilling my needs that he deemed petty. I would have been able to leave a long time ago, or to accept him as he is and I could have found other ways to satisfy my needs. Maybe I'm just learning that this is a need I really require to have met by my partner, and I'm just not ready to go back to him when I'm so confused and codependent, I'm afraid that he's saying he'll try now but maybe he'll only try for the sake of getting me to stay, and not because he truly wants to grow for himself. I don't want the pressure of being satisfied with his efforts, right now. I don't want any kind of pressure at all. I just want to figure out what I want, I want to be okay with who I am, how I feel, what I need, and I want to love myself. I loved him more than I loved myself, and I realize now that it was killing me inside, because he loved himself more than he loved me, and I wasn't a priority to anyone. I wish I could stay with him and work on these things but I don't think that's how it works. I think I really have to learn to be alone to stop letting other people influence my thoughts and actions, or find someone who lets me grow as I am ready to grow, into the best version of myself, instead of as they want me to, into some version that sounds really great and I wish I could be, but simply am not. Still, I constantly question it. Maybe this whole thing is stupid and I'm just an immature, petty girl, who couldn't take the criticism from the one I depended on most for validation. I feel so self-judgmental and small."

I didnt really know where else to turn. I have been previously married and was lied to and hurt in that relationship. After two years of being single, I got into a relationship with a guy in May in the town I had just moved to. He was just recently getting out of a four year relationship himself, which I later found out from his sister he had broken things off with her several times and moved in and out of her home twice. He was having a hard time processing their breakup while he was with me, and I stayed patient. I am by no means perfect, but I did a lot for him. I cleaned his apartment, did his laundry, cooked for him, and was supportive in all of his endeavors. We didnt go on any dates, the one time we went to the movies I bought the tickets. He really didnt do much for me, but I loved him and the security of a relationship. He stopped taking his antidepressants and broke up with me because he felt he got into a relationship too quickly, only to ask for me back a few hours later. I felt insecure but I didnt get to express it much, anytime I showed emotion he would get frustrated and I always felt like he would leave me again, so I kept a lot of feelings to myself. He was supportive to an extent, but not as emotionally available as I would have liked. Things were fine for a while, we spent all of our time together. We decided to move in together and we signed a lease. The day after we signed the lease, I lost my job. He could not take how depressed I was and he wanted out of the lease, even though I was sure I would find a job again, which I did. I think my emotions and pressuring him to try to make the lease work was too much, because a week later he broke up with me on my birthday. I was devastated. He came back a week later asking for me back, and I took him back. We went out of town together last weekend for a festival he was helping out with and we stayed with his mom. The weekend was great, and he encouraged me to drink to become more social with his friends, even though he has been sober for four years after being addicted to heroin. I got drunk Saturday night and had bought myself a slice of pizza. I offered to get him something and he declined, and I told him this food was for me for when I was drunk later so that I could put something in my stomach to prevent from getting sick. When I walked away and walked back up, he was eating it. I said are you fucking kidding me and that set him off. We got back into the car, where he told me we were not going to the after party, we were going back to his moms. I got upset and even tried to put his car in park to prevent him from getting more angry about a stupid situation and to not ruin the weekend over a piece of pizza. He told me I overreact and have a bad attitude. After I tried to park his car while he was pulled over, he became so upset he began to punch his steering wheel, something I have seen him done before out of frustration in situations that did not relate to me. He also screamed at me that I was a stupid fucking bitch. He pulled over on the side of the highway in the middle of the night in the rain and told me to get out, which I did. He pulled back around and told me to get in. I felt like I had enough of walking on eggshells and continued the fight at his moms. I told him all of the things I was afraid to tell him before out of fear of upsetting him. I told him I wasnt going to be desperate and stay with him like his ex did and that his own family has told me they are afraid to talk to him because of his selfishness. I pushed him at one point, I regret putting my hands on him, but when someone is yelling in your face that you are a stupid fucking bitch, it is difficult to keep calm. He ended up sleeping in a different room. When he got up, he apologized and asked for a peaceful ride home. He broke up with me when we got home. I am a mess. I know ultimately he is not good for me, but I am having a hard time letting go. I already miss him so much, and I live in such a small city with him right down the street. I have bought a ticket to move back home. I leave Saturday. I have been homesick for a while and have been struggling out here, back home I have a support system that I feel I need. I am very afraid and very confused and I fear that he will come begging for me back and I wont be here and Ill regret moving home. I dont know why I am writing all this here, maybe I am looking for encouragement or advice. Also adding he knowingly gave me an STD. He went on a music tour for ten days and while he was gone I had a severe breakout and had never experienced anything like that. I had to call off work and go to the doctors. He later told me he thought he may have herpes. The doctor confirmed that I do. I had another breakout a week ago, where he told me he thought he may have hpv, and had cured a breakout before with apple cider vinegar. I was not allowed to discuss it that day with him, because he hadnt received his antidepressant refill and he hadnt taken it in six days and he was having a bad day. **tldr: Guy I dated for five months dumped me several times and may have emotionally manipulated me, I am moving back home partly to escape the vulnerability of being around him**"
84,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,"Here on reddit, I told my story of sexual assault from the guys perspective, almost verbatim to actual quotes. The difference in responses was interesting.",0,9c59ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9c59ku/here_on_reddit_i_told_my_story_of_sexual_assault/,2018-09-02 04:18:05,"As the title says, I told the story of my sexual assumptions, exactly as it happened, including the aftermath, using mine and his words exactly. A brief bullet point version of facts in the story: 1) I was 18 he was 23 2) invited me to drinks and ended I up drunk. [For some context, we had kissed a few days before, sober, in my room. I had immediately told him I didnt want to have sex because it was getting close to that point. ] 3) followed me back to my room, and almost had sex. I was about to penetrate unprotected and I made him stop. I had not realised we had gone that far and I wasnt aware my clothes had come off. I told him it was my first time and I didnt want unprotected sex. He left to find a condom and when he came back I told him I didnt want to have sex at all. 4) he climbed on top of me and told me it wouldnt hurt, he would pull out, and I felt ready anyway. I didnt respond but I didnt stop him going down on me. 5) after that we had sex. I slowly sobered up and when I was sober we had sex again, and as far as I knew in the moment I was fine with it. Those are the facts of how it got to us having sex - the other background of the story is after that I found out he had a girlfriend. I had known him for maybe two weeks before that point and he had been texting me almost every day and had asked for my number in the first place. Might seem like irrelevant context but I think it does influence the situation. The guy was very unapologetic but told me not to blame myself and that I shouldnt regret it. I only remembered the entirety of events about two weeks later (this happens when I drink vodka and Im probably never drinking it again).When I confronted him why he didnt stop when Id asked him ti several times, he admitted he knew I wasnt comfortable, but he thought I was flirting with him three days before. That was the night we had kissed, before I had told him I didnt want to have sex. When I posted the story the first time on r/Relationships, with the full context, the responses to me were overall very negative, mostly from men. The useful advice and sensitive/sympathetic responses were generally from women but of course some men too. Actually it was these women who pointed out to me amid the drama that surrounded the event, that it was a sexual assault. Before that all I knew was that it didnt feel right for many reasons which distracted from the initial problem which was that I hadnt consented. I also couldnt recall all the details until after. More disturbingly I received some disturbing/predatory messages from predators who had caught on to the gaslighting and my vulnerability in the situation and wanted to befriend me through social media away from reddit. They also assumed I was naive from the story. The men on the other hand generally concluded that I was used, it was my fault, and the guy didnt owe me respect anyway since we werent in a relationship, and furthermore I shouldnt have expected any more from him. Having been severely gaslighted by the entire experience for a long list of reasons, I thought it would be interesting to tell the story from his perspective. So I told the same story again, as it was, trying to embody his perspective as accurately as possible, using the exact words the guy had said to me in our interactions afterwards. This time I posted it to r/AskMen, and responses here were unanimously disapproving. Commenters, who were again mostly men, were quick to accuse rape, more so than in the first post, where more people commented sounds like rape or sexual assault. It was also much more constructive, explaining distinct reasons why what he did was wrong. I even received very critical and almost threatening PMs from both men and women. What Ive concluded from this whole experience is that we possibly as a society, are not yet at a place where womens voices can be heard. I think its sad that a woman in crisis should have to bear shame in telling her story at all. What also struck me was how the comments from the post in my perspective came from a very defeated approach - a sort of it is what it is. On the other hand the comments from the guys perspective were more constructed and better structured. I also question whether it was the same men who had read my post and criticised me, who were also critical of the guy in the second post. The actual actual advice I had to take away was very limited - it was very much along the lines of he must have smelt your vulnerability, you must have very low self esteem and he sensed it. I disagree that either of these explanations were the case. Finally I would say that on the whole I find the narrative of sex scandals as a genre - given that this was not just an experience but a story heard and read by many people now, seems to punish the woman. A postgraduate journalism student at my university who was in the same circles as the guy, heard the story, and decided he wanted to know more. He sought out to interview my friends or people he knew who hung out with me to find out more. I personally had not shared this experience with many people, and the few I had talked to about this of course declined his attempts. There was one point I was sitting with my friends at the canteen and he asked one of them if he could talk to them by the side. Now note this guy already knew me by name. He was in the same social circle as the guy. He could have easily asked the guy what happened. But he targeted my perspective as the juicier side of the story. I sensed a parallel between this and the predators who jumped on my first account and, it disgusts me to say, were almost turned on by my vulnerability in the story. So yeah. This is an awkward and clunky way to round this off, because I dont know what else to say. What are your thoughts and experiences with this? "
85,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,My male neighbour insisted that I go into his house,1,9cy60k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9cy60k/my_male_neighbour_insisted_that_i_go_into_his/,2018-09-05 04:06:21,"I wouldn't even say we are acquaintances, we've had a handful of quick chats and the normal, friendly 'hello' when passing by. I was out bringing the trash bin back in and he hollered at me and started sauntering over. I can tell he had been drinking or was otherwise inebriated (I'm sober), which made me a little nervous off the bat. He opened his arms for a hug which I obliged (why did I do that?), and began rambling incoherently about something. He then asked me to come over for a beer, which I declined. He rambled some more, putting his hand on my waist/back, then said ""you should come see it"", referring to his house, which is just a few houses down from ours. I said, ""Oh no, I've got things to do,"" , gesturing to the garbage can and mentioning chores. He was insistent, and suddenly his squinty drunk-stoned eyes were wide, his face extremely animated as he repeatedly said ""You have to! Just for a second!"" and grabbed my hand as I was stepping backward away from him. This was the point where I realized I might be in danger, as he had a friend also hanging out on his front porch. I turned away, grabbed the trash bin and went inside my house. Did this guy just try to abduct me? He definitely was intoxicated and there were some socially weird things he did, like touching me, showing me his wallet and how much money was in it, offering me alcohol, telling me his female roommate wasn't around, and asking about my boyfriend, who he may have seen walk out our front door an hour beforehand. How do you deal with situations like this? There are so many aspects that are problematic for me, like setting physical boundaries (no touch) which could have a negative effect in the moment by offending the person initiating the touching. I think I'm becoming more aware of my fear and feelings of vulnerability around confrontations with men. I want to say what's on my mind but is it worth the risk/backlash? Mostly just needed to get this off my chest but also curious about how you evaluate risk/reward during confrontations or interactions where you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. "

I don't think I need to go into too much detail. He was dropping me off after class and forced himself on me in the car. I pulled away and told him to stop. He tried again. So I got out of his car. I texted him this morning telling him that I felt like he was taking advantage of my vulnerability. I just got laid off and my dad is terminally ill, so I've been a little emotional lately. His response? ""I was just trying to cheer you up. Hope you feel better."" I'm really just looking for people to talk to who've had similar experiences.

I've only tried dating once more since then but I found myself in a relationship with another abuser (although not nearly as bad). It was after that, that I decided to work on my mental health and personal goals instead of focusing on any type of romantic relationship. I struggled with PTSD flashbacks quite regularly the first year after my assault but they've decreased significantly now. Well, long story short, I recently became the victim of some social media stalking/harassing and it ended in a violent confrontation. Having just moved into a new apartment literally a week ago, I hadn't had the chance to set up a support system as far as a therapist, etc. Because my anxiety was raging out of control, I isolated myself to my apartment and was having difficulty keeping food down because of the anxious knots in my stomach. A friend of mine became concerned for me and asked if I'd like to hang out and watch a movie. I was hesitant at first but was feeling moderately better than the evening before so I agreed. He came over at a decent time, probably understanding that nighttime wasn't the best time for me, but during our movie I began to feel nauseous. The feeling triggered a sense of vulnerability in me and his presence suddenly became very threatening. I started to disassociate myself from the situation to the point where my friend was speaking to me but I wasn't comprehending him or able to respond to him. I was feeling incredibly dehydrated and therefore out of it at this point which only added to my feeling of weakness. He responded immediately when he realized what was happening (I've made it a point to mention my PTSD to him in the off-chance it ever occurs). He helped me to my bed, gave me space to do what I needed to make myself feel grounded, touched me only after telling me he was going to, and used my name often which helped with the grounding process. But the most amazing part about it was he never made me feel judged about it and was genuinely just concerned about my well being. The poor thing even apparently ended up staying over, although I kind of lost consciousness by that point. I just woke up to him very precariously asleep on the edge of the bed as far away from me as possible. He was respectful and understanding during what was for me a very embarrassing experience. I just wanted to share the story of a guy who totally deserves the recognition that he never asks for. "
88,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,My thoughts on the rape accusations presented against Tool's Maynard Keenan. Is this fair?,8,8ug094,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8ug094/my_thoughts_on_the_rape_accusations_presented/,2018-06-28 13:30:14,"For those of you not familiar with the specifics of the accusation, or for those who would like to read the full account of events presented by the alleged victim (which is what I am basing my response on), here is a link that will serve that purpose: [URL As the username implies, I am a huge fan of Tool and their music. Maynard, in particular, has been an idol of mine for many, many years. Because of this, the news of these accusations have been a topic of great concern and consideration for me over the past couple of days. After a lot of thought, I wrote a response to the accusations that, as far as I can tell, have not been voiced or considered in many avenues. I will be posting/submitting this response tomorrow in an environment of my peers and am worried about bias having clouded my judgement. I think this subreddit will be the best place for some initial feedback and will perhaps be the catalyst for a needed change in perspective. What follows is my response; thanks for your time! ""Obligatory ""I'm not saying these accusations are true or false"", but here are my thoughts on this, utilizing only the information presented. Let's assume the recount of events, presented by the alleged victim, are completely, 100&amp;#37; true; I think there's a huge issue to consider. As is popularly known, Maynard has slept with a ton of girls throughout his many years on tour. Not only that, but there were special passes, essentially an entire system (as the article explains), dedicated to just this; finding groupies for Maynard to sleep with. This is a regular thing, not only for him, but for rockstars and groupies in general. It's a tale as old as time.. everybody knows about/how this culture works. I think it's highly likely Maynard never even considered the fact this girl was not okay/aware of what was happening. The whole process she describes, every step of the way (from not allowing the bf to come, to Maynard inviting her to ""watch a movie"" alone with him on the tour bus), screams groupie sex. It's reasonable to believe he was under the impression this girl was completely aware of the sexual implications, especially when considering the prolific nature of this exact kind of encounter. She made no attempt to communicate the fact that she was uncomfortable or that she was not okay with having sex with him. He has had sex with thousands of women, all but literally throwing themselves at him, it would make sense for him to assume consent (again, I'm not saying this is morally right), especially in these ""groupie/backstage encounters"". Of course, especially considering her age, it was Maynards (Moral, not legal) responsibility to make sure she was not being taken advantage of and to, at the very least, obtain explicit verbal consent. She mentions being a naive 17 year old, which is fair, and if this story is true, I think my biggest issue would have been with Maynard's apparent disregard for her vulnerability and that regadless of whether or not it was technically legal in that state, as an adult, it was his responsibility to make sure she was okay with and aware of the implications, regardless of how obvious he may have thought they were. I would also say there's a complicated moral issue regarding the significant difference in age. I personally believe it's impossible to know for sure if someone this young is truly able to understand/represent themselves properly in a situation such as this, thus, impossible to determine whether or not they're being unintentionally manipulated. Because of this, I would consider sex, in this way, immoral. Even as a 26 year old, sex with an 18 or 19 year old seems wrong in many ways, however, others would disagree, and in any event, there are degrees to morality. If another 26 year old was fine with having sex with an 18 year old, I would not condemn them as a monster. In this particular example, I believe there's likely a very gray area in regards to morality. If what I'm suggesting is true, I'd say Maynard was morally wrong, as per the aforementioned reasons. However, I cannot condemn Maynard for assuming consent, and I cannot say what effect such an extreme level of fame would have on someone in this kind of interaction. I think it's reasonable to assume a normal, good intentioned person, would begin to take liberties in this regard (not saying it is okay to do so) after so many years/encounters jading their judgement. Of course, this is all assuming these anonymous accounts are accurate and honest. If so, I believe I've ascertained a look at the ""worst case scenario"", which is why I felt compelled to analyze the situation in the first place. I could also be completely off base, and her implication that ""he knew what he was getting away with"" could be completely accurate. I believe the former is the more likely reality and, in any event, deserves serious consideration when evaluating the circumstances we have been presented."""
89,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,One of my closest friends mistakenly thinks I raped her years ago and hasn't spoken to me since. Should I try to explain my side of the story?,6,8jht4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8jht4c/one_of_my_closest_friends_mistakenly_thinks_i/,2018-05-15 11:47:18,"This happened about five years ago. It still causes me a lot of pain, and I can't imagine how my friend - let's call her Laura - feels. For her to think that one of her closest friends betrayed her trust and took advantage of her must be horrible. But, at this point, I don't know if explaining my side of the story would cause more help or harm. Laura and I were really good friends in grad school. We had dinner at each other's houses, threw parties together, went out to lunch every week, sat next to each other in numerous classes  I considered her to be one of my closest friends and expected that we would be lifelong friends. Often, after late nights of drinking and dancing with friends, I would walk Laura home to make sure she got back safely. Sometimes, if we were both single at the time, this would end with us kissing on her porch before saying goodnight. Once or twice, it progressed to her spending the night in my bed, but we never did anything beyond make out. Before we go on, you should know a bit about Laura's personality - she is a very matter of fact person who is quite guarded with her deepest emotions. Even after years of friendship, there were things I could tell she kept private. She had more male than female friends and was someone that guys would refer to as a ""cool girl"" - straightforward, down to earth, and level-headed. Very low maintenance, and no drama. After she and I started crossing the bounds of platonic friendship by making out on occasion, we explicitly discussed what was going on and both agreed that it was not romantic and that we would stop if either of us started dating someone. Now, on to the night in question. Laura was out at a bar with some of our mutual friends and I was at my apartment watching a movie. Laura called me on her way home; she was walking alone and it was around 1am so she wanted to be in touch with someone in case anything bad happened. We had a lighthearted conversation and she didn't seem to be slurring her words or any other noticeable sign of intoxication. All of a sudden, I hear her scream and then the line went dead. I immediately jump on my bicycle and rode over to her house, where I found her sitting on her front porch sobbing uncontrollably. She had been mugged and had lost her cellphone and purse. Her roommates weren't home, so she had no way of getting into her house. I stayed with her until she calmed down and then walked her back to my place. We spent at least two hours sitting on my bed cancelling her credit cards and calling her mom. During this time I asked her how intoxicated she was and she replied that she was ""not drunk at all"". Finally we crawled into bed around 4am. Almost immediately we found each other under the sheets and began to kiss, although this time it kept going and we ended up having sex. I will fully admit, in retrospect, that such an emotionally charged occasion was probably not the right time to sleep with someone for the first time, but by every indication, it was entirely consensual. The next morning, in classic Laura fashion, she turned to me and matter-of-factly stated, ""So, we had sex last night"". ""Yep"", I replied. ""Good talk,"" she said. And that was the last we ever spoke about it. I took her out for breakfast and we had friendly conversation - she seemed to have fully calmed down and was back to her normal self. About a week later, she began dating a guy at school; they became serious and Laura and I never had any intimate physical contact again. The only person I told about what happened between Laura and me was a close mutual friend of ours, who we'll call James. About a year later, Laura and James were catching up over dinner. Somehow the topic of sexual partners came up, and Laura mentioned she had only been with five people. James casually mentioned that I was one of them, and Laura was stunned. She said she had no memory of sleeping with me. She called me later that evening in tears, asking if it was true. I of course said yes; I was too bewildered to say much besides that, as I couldn't comprehend how she wouldn't remember what happened. About a week later I got a call from Laura saying she had talked it over with her fianc (the same guy who she had started dating right after our encounter). They had decided that she would completely end her friendship with me. They had also set ground rules for her behavior in the future, including that she would never get blackout drunk without him present. I was too stunned to say anything but that I understood and was sorry for the pain this had caused her. It wasn't until I reflected on the conversation afterward that it fully dawned on me what she must have concluded - that she had been blackout drunk that night and that I had taken advantage of her vulnerability to have sex with her. Because she was unable to give consent, legally this would mean that I raped her. I have no explanation for how she doesn't remember what happened. I am convinced that she was not blackout drunk - she didn't appear drunk at all, she very clearly told me she was not drunk before we went to bed, and she remembered (and brought up) the encounter the next morning. I don't know if the emotions of the night simply overshadowed the event, especially given how casual she was about it when we spoke the next morning. I don't know if it's possible for traumatic shock to cause short term memory loss like this. Whatever the explanation, she concluded that I raped her and ended our friendship over it. I was, and still am, heartbroken over this. I want to explain to her my side of the story. Putting myself in her shoes, I certainly don't expect it would be easy to hear the person you think raped you trying to tell you that you're wrong. But, at the same time, I can't imagine that it would be better for her to go through life thinking that someone she trusted completely had betrayed her like that. I don't know what to do. Should I try to write her a letter explaining what happened? Should I keep my distance and accept that the pain of reopening old wounds would be greater than the benefit of healing them? If it were you, would you want to know? tl;dr: I rescued my close friend after she was mugged and brought her back to my place, where we proceeded to have sex. Even though she wasn't drunk, she doesn't remember the encounter and concluded that I raped her. She ended our friendship and hasn't spoken to me in years. I don't know if I should try to explain my side of the story. "
90,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,A Letter to My (21f) Rapist (22m),0,8na690,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8na690/a_letter_to_my_21f_rapist_22m/,2018-05-31 02:53:31,"Life carries on for you. You've got a girlfriend, she's under your spell. She's thinking you're the best that ever happened to her, buying her expensive things, dates, matching cars, selling her this lie that you'd never do anyone harm, just as you did with me in 2015. I've barely picked up the pieces. It's been almost 3 years since that fateful August. I always hated August. You made me hate it even more. To make things worse, I now live even closer to one of the spots you raped me. It's off of a main road I can't avoid. I'd have to go very out of the way to avoid it. Even worse than that is the fact my mother knows. And why? I broke down crying to an ex, my daughter's father, about what you had done, and just like I had no choice or even a voice to be able to have a say in what I want to do with my life, that was taken from me too. He told her as soon as he found out. I didn't want her to know because she always slut-shamed and blamed me and a year later when I fell into your trap again, she refuted the fact it happened because we started dating. That August later, you took advantage of my vulnerability again. You were never taught to take no for an answer. Instead you watched your mother get high on pills and resented her. You watched your father go on and do whatever he wanted after he left you, your mother, and your brother. You watched him move on, get married, and have another child. Your life wasn't ideal, it wasn't fair. You had no choice in those cards that you were dealt. But you didn't have to deal me the ones you chose to, you knew I was broken and vulnerable. No sane person would give you the time of day, but me? A single mother to a now 3 year old who had just left the abusive, sadistic father of her child, the same woman whose parents and step parents abused her even more by beating her to the point she couldn't attend school, the girl who was bullied because of her weight and called a slut by everyone in middle school even though she didn't even touch a boy like that until she was 16, even if she did whose business was it anyway? I was the perfect victim. So instead of shooting your shot, you took what wasn't yours and continued to harass me until you found another victim. I still wonder if she'll suffer the same fate as me, or if all that pain was just for me. If the fancy dates and things you buy her were reserved for anyone other than me. My body dysmorphia has gotten worse, I hate my body because you stole from it, and I lose weight and keep it on. Right now I've kept a lot of it, and I hate myself even more. Even when I've lost it, I still can't love myself. Because it's the body you took from, and even though I finally have someone who touches me the way I want them to, who cherishes the mind this body carries and treats it like a temple instead of an abandoned building he can trespass in as much as he likes, he calls being in its presence ""home"". Yet I still feel afraid at times that he'll push me against a wall and not allow me to leave. If he stands over me a certain way, I'm brought back to the way you did, so menacing, cornering your prey and tearing their heart and peace of mind out in the process. Those thoughts with him aren't rational. You couldn't take no for an answer that August 2015, when I finally broke up with you in March last year, you couldn't then either. I told you it was over. Yet you still left money for me and flowers for Mother's day. You left more on my birthday, almost as a bribe to show me what you could do for me financially and to buy my love. I used that money to buy my daughter clothes that she desperately needed. But I didn't talk to you until the end of that month when you messaged me again. I told you then I moved on and don't want you in my life anymore. You said you'd always be around as a friend. I blocked you and didn't hear from you for months. Until September and October when you emailed me and I had no choice but to respond again. It wasn't till my mother told you to stop that you finally did. Even then you'd respect someone else's word over my own. And it was a marathon and a half to get her to even tell you to stop. Not even my threat to involve the police would've gotten you to listen, again it was me not having my voice heard. And I still feel afraid no one hears me, it's psychological now. I always feel unheard, dismissed, ignored. And you get to put it all behind you. You get to be happy and move forward and I sit here crying a few days before my birthday, at a new house still terrified of loud cars because you'd show up to intimidate me. I'm still afraid even though you've moved on that you'll find me and take even more. I want to warn your girlfriend but I doubt she'll listen. And it wouldn't make a difference. You only admitted to raping me only after I told you my therapist said it was rape. I didn't think it was technically rape because you coerced me. And when my brother said I probably wasn't raped and I just regretted having sex with you, it crushed my soul. It showed me I was truly alone in this house. The only one I have here is my daughter and she can't understand. Girls aren't harder to raise, they're just the ones that people fail to protect. And my mother, my father, their spouses, they all failed to protect me and to nurture me when I was in pain. I had no solace in this. I still don't. All I have left in me is ""why?"" I don't even know if I'll have anything else, but I tell myself ""you don't get to be happy after doing such an inhumane thing"" yet there you are and here I am. "
91,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Tips on not frightening women at night.,40,8fh4pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8fh4pc/tips_on_not_frightening_women_at_night/,2018-04-28 12:53:00,"I am a 6'2"" male weighing roughly 200 pounds. I'm not exactly a hulking brute, but my build and my gate don't suggest weakness or vulnerability. This works to my advantage when I find myself in unfamiliar and/or potentially dangerous neighborhoods, because it is a posture that exudes agressive confidence. I think that this swaggering is basically a power-up version of my normal stride that is subconsciously activated when I feel threatened. It's like a cat charging sideways to look bigger. So when I find myself walking behind a woman at night, in a place where pedestrian traffic is sparse, I understand that my mere presence, let alone my instinctively prickly posture, could potentially provoke her anxiety. In order to present less of a threat I do one of two things. If I am in a hurry and need to pass her, I walk loudly and hum a tune on approach, clear my throat about five feet behind. I time my overtaking so that my shadow shows I am giving her a wide birth. If I'm not in a hurry, I stop to tie my shoe to give her a head start, then amble along at a slower pace than her's until we have about a half-block between us. If she pauses at any point, I take that as a sign that she wants me to overtake her so she can keep an eye on me. XXers: Please let me know if my intuition is skewed, or if you have any other behavioural tips for mean-mugging BFGs like myself. "

Growling, grabbing my arm and biting me, calling me delicious, enough for a monster. When he stood outside my window at 4 in the morning, banging on it while my mother was out working night shifts. When he wouldnt let me shower, or eat full sized meals. When he would lock my outside at 2am and demand I Go buy ice cream but I didnt have money or know where a store was. I trusted you, Sean, to care for me as a young age, and you failed me. From the days that nothing was private with my step-mother. The days she wrung my arms and scream at me for being stupid and fat. For the days where she would buy me things I did not ask for, and then guilt me about them later on. I trusted you, Karen, to accept me for who I was, and you failed me. From the time that I snuck outside at night to go to the close-by jungle gym, and it ended with my face in the dirt and hands on my hips and my blood pounding in my ears as I choked and screamed. I trusted you, cover of the night, and you failed me. From the time a boyfriend pushed me down a hill because I was scared of heights, and my pace was annoying him. He failed me. From the time I opened up my heart and my vulnerability, and she failed me. From the time my best friend let slip that the only reason she kept me around, was to make herself feel better. She failed me. I told him, I TOLD him I had been raped, and was attempting to get over it. But when the lock slid shut, he only cared about himself, and I was taken again. And I was so tired, I simply waited for it to be over. He failed me. I have been failed, so many times. And even as the love of my life looks me in the eye with wonder and adoration, I wonder every day, when will HE fail me? Tomorrow? Next year? I do not trust the love in his eyes, I do not trust the love in my heart. I do not trust, for I have been failed. "
93,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,The Hardest Thing I Have Ever Done (Warning- Abuse),5,81zg3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/81zg3g/the_hardest_thing_i_have_ever_done_warning_abuse/,2018-03-05 05:25:03,"Mom- &amp;nbsp; You knew that I have been struggling with bulimia for ten years because I confided this to you in a phone call last spring. Your immediate reaction was to tell me that you tried to get me to see a therapist. This is a lie, and it belittled my experience and your role in it. &amp;nbsp; As you well know, I was *obligated* to see a therapist- in 2009, as a requirement, not for bulimia, and in response to a situation wherein you actively campaigned against the idea that I needed a therapist. You have known about my eating disorder since I was 16. When you initially discovered it, you spent a car ride screaming things that included: * You are disgusting. * Dont tell any of your friends. They would think you are disgusting. * Dont start thinking you have a disorder. This is pure laziness plain and simple. * I hope [*prospective college*] doesnt find out about this. &amp;nbsp; In over ten years, you have never attempted to make this right. The four or five times over the next few years where you glared at me and asked Have you been making yourself throw up? is not addressing the issue in a constructive and caring way. In times of darkness, what a kid needs is someone to assure them that they are not a bad person and that someone will be there to love and support them through it all. You did not do this. You humiliated me and shamed me into keeping a secret. Not only is this emotional abuse, withholding treatment for bulimia is child abuse and is against Georgia state law. &amp;nbsp; A few months after our phone conversation, the last thing that I wanted to do was try on a wedding dress. I felt extremely vulnerable. The only way I could try it on in front of another person was by setting boundaries of what is and what is not okay- no criticism of either dress, no telling me which one you prefer. You chose to interpret me protecting myself as an attack on you- that you would have to control your every facial expression. You escalated the situation. In an attempt to de-escalate it, I had to expose my own vulnerability- telling you that I felt fat and didnt want to risk not fitting into any of my dresses or your dress. &amp;nbsp; Instead of dropping the matter and just choosing to be understanding, you escalated again. Telling me that I was *wrong* to feel that way; I was thin. &amp;nbsp; I have spent almost ten years not addressing the way that you raged during my childhood. Not with you, not with anyone. But this time, there was a clear and simple answer to why I felt this way. Because you lashed out at me once when I was a child by asking how I didnt notice how much weight I had put on when I was 130 pounds. This is nowhere close to the worst thing you have ever said to me, so the fact that you thought you werent capable of it is frankly baffling.Then you screamed that I was gaslighting you- just like you used to say when I was a teennager. You brought up [*college*]. &amp;nbsp; You do not know about what happened at [*college*]. You were not open to communication about it. You have made this an unsafe subject for me to speak with you about. I do not feel comfortable telling you about my experience, and because of your consistent pattern of behavior towards me, I never will. I dont know what you think happened- maybe you think that I just choose to lay in bed for months because that is easier than going to 100-level classes. If that is what you believe, then let me put this to you plainly and clearly: You do not know what you are talking about. &amp;nbsp; Returning to the present, when I told you of the specifics of what you said about my weight, you told me that I must have looked bloated that day. The message you convey with this is *I did not say that, and if I did, you deserved it.* &amp;nbsp; I do not know what you are thinking right now. It may be something along the lines of wishing I had told how I felt before. There are several reasons it has taken this long: &amp;nbsp; 1. I have just recounted two events just from within the last year where I attempted to address an issue with you. You completely shut me down both times. 2. Since you discovered I was bulimic, there have been thousands of days you could have reached out to me to tell me that the way you reacted was wrong and to try to get me the help I needed. You have never done this. 3. Since I re-addressed this issue and confided in you that this is something I continue to struggle with, there has been almost a year during which you could have reached out to me, both to accept your role in shaming me and isolating me from the support network I should have had, and to see if I have now been getting the help I need. Not only have you not done this, you have not said another word to me about it. 4. The behavior that you displayed is part of a consistent pattern of behavior that I thought was over. Grabbing my hair and screaming into my face, throwing my binders across the room, saying things like *[best friend] did well on her SATs- why would she want to be friends with someone who got a 0 on this quiz?* These were not one-offs. These are things I heard roughly once per week. They are not appropriate punishments for lying or for bad grades. They are shaming. They are isolating. They made me afraid to address problems with you. How can I express to you how hurt I am when you did not teach me how? &amp;nbsp; It is not my responsibility to come to you asking for an apology over these things. I spent years of my life thinking that you had changed. The behavior you displayed is achingly familiar. You could have reflected on this once you felt more calm and addressed what you said. A teennager lying about their grades to a parent who is incapable of addressing the issue in a constructive way is not gaslighting. It is normal. By the time I was 17, your rages included telling me you believed I was incapable of love. I have spent my 20s believing that I was emotionally abusive because you told me I was, and every shred of self-esteem I managed to scrape together was based on how much I believed I had changed. &amp;nbsp; I no longer believe this. I am not the one who needed to change. &amp;nbsp; I need space and time to heal. I am beginning sessions with a therapist specializing in trauma. I am focusing on me, not on repairing our relationship. Please do not contact me. If there is an emergency, you can email [*husband*] at [*email*] or call him at [*phone number*]. &amp;nbsp; Dad- &amp;nbsp; You enabled this behavior. If you did not know the extent of it, then you were not engaged enough. Either way, you did not do your job. You may contact me, but not yet. I will let you know when I am ready to talk. I have three boundaries, which I am trusting you to respect. Please do not break my trust. &amp;nbsp; 1. Please keep our communication private. I understand that you will want to share summaries and updates of what we discussed with Mom. That is alright with me. Just please keep the emails themselves private. 2. Do not justify this behavior. Do not say things like parents make mistakes. Parents should be capable of critical self-reflection so that even if they do make a mistake, they should identify that behavior and make amends. Children do not know how to do this. Do not say that it was both of us. Mom was the adult, I was the child. I deserved to be punished for lying. I deserved to live in a home where I could trust that my parent would not lose control when I did something wrong. Screaming rages are not punishment. It does not address the problem. I was afraid, and I did not deserve to be afraid. 3. Do not tell me that I am lying. Even something like there are three sides to every story is not acceptable to say to me. There are reasons I lied as a child, none of which apply to me today. I promise you to be completely open and honest in our communication. Please think carefully about whether you are willing to accept this honesty. I will understand if you are not, but as I am trying to heal, it will mean that we will not be communicating during this time. &amp;nbsp; To you both- &amp;nbsp; I have not been successful in my attempts to reach out to [*sister*]. Please make this full letter available to her, but let her know that if she does not want to read it, that is her choice and I will respect it. Whether or not she chooses to respond to my messages is her choice as well. If she does choose to respond, there are no limitations on what she can say. I only ask that she keep any direct communication private. &amp;nbsp; I know that you both will worry. All I can say to that is that I am in a safe and healthy situation with someone who loves me very much. &amp;nbsp; Please do not reply to this email. "
94,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,(CW: sexual assault) I wrote and starred in a consensual non-consent porno and it was probably the most therapeutic thing I've ever done.,103,83b31u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/83b31u/cw_sexual_assault_i_wrote_and_starred_in_a/,2018-03-10 10:14:50,"So full disclosure: I'm a porn performer, so this isn't my first rodeo obviously. But I need to gush about something that I did that I'm absurdly proud of. Tl;dr: I used [desensitization therapy](URL in the process of writing my first porno script to overcome my fear of home invasion. Like 1 in 4 women, I am a survivor of sexual assault. [Contrary to popular belief, porn performers self-report histories of sexual trauma at similar levels to the rest of the population](URL and regrettably I am one of those women whose life has been impacted by sexual violence. For the first several years of my career, I was hesitant to talk about my past with sexual trauma and violence because I have frequently felt silenced by the narrative that says sex workers are damaged goods. Did my previous history lead me to this job? Was I hyper-sexualized? Perhaps! It's impossible for me to tell you with 100% accuracy. I used to think that that was something to be ashamed of, but writing this story and starring in it led me to feel differently. If I sought this job to cope with my trauma, what I can tell you is that it has presented me with many avenues for healing. I am married happily and live a fairly joyful life these days. I am a feminist, while also being a mainstream pornographer (ranked #24 in the world according to pornhub for whatever that's worth) which many 2nd wave feminists would call a contradiction in terms. It is my sincere and heartfelt belief that the people who should have the final say about what they do or dont do on camera is the actors themselves. Not society at large or agencies or directors. What I have learned in my time in sex work is that powerplay, coercion and rape fantasies are extremely common fantasies for women while still being extremely shameful to them. Due to my previous trauma, I have never worked on kink sets or really allowed anyone to dominate me on film. I derive no pleasure from that level of vulnerability; in fact, it actively scares me. I admire the men and women who can perform in the BDSM genre and who find it pleasurable, but it has never been my cup of tea. After I was sexually assaulted, for many years after in fact, I had recurring nightmares of home invasion. Masked men would bang on my bedroom door and try to break into my house. I would rush from room to room trying to make sure all my doors and windows were fortified, but inevitably one would be left open and they would burst in. I would wake up right as they grabbed me in a cold sweat. An attempted kidnapping that was foiled while I visited Bolivia for work did nothing to help this and up until a few years ago I had the same nightmare at least once a month. I decided that I wanted to tell the story of that nightmare  only this time I would control the ending. Pure Taboo (the company I wrote this for) focuses on telling the stories of our sexuality that were ashamed of. Dont get me wrong, I have plenty of fantasies that are kind of unethical and Im willing to bet that you do too. Maybe you get off on schoolgirls, maybe you get off on humiliation or gangbangs, whatever it is Im willing to bet youve never acted on those fantasies in an illegal way. There are ways to ethically purvey the sexual parts of us we consider shameful while not devolving into immorality. So I tasked myself with telling an ethical consensual non-consent story. One where the victim became the victor. The kind of story that a victim (and many victims do report masturbating to coercion fantasies after the fact) would feel good about watching. The movie opens with a young mafia heiress home alone, locking the doors and anxiously calling her father to request that he return home early from his business trip. Why cant you come home, dad? You know the type of men who have it out for us. At least bring more back up than just Bruno, my bodyguard? One security guard isnt enough for such a big house! Her concerns are dismissed and minimized. She settles into uneasy slumber and the screen cuts to an image of Bruno collapsing as three men in black storm the house and sneak into the heiresss bedroom, grabbing her and whisking her away. The heiress regains consciousness in a darkened garage as three men discuss her fate, her father owes them money and theyll either get it, or she will be sent to her dad in pieces. How on earth can this fantasy be feminist? What the fuck is wrong with me? As the story plays out, it begins to look like a classic kidnapping/use me as your fuckdoll kind of fantasy. But we see the heiress carefully observing the inner dynamics of her captors group and subtly manipulating them against one another. She supplies them with information about her fathers finances to endear her to them, while also subtly insulting their manhood when they fail to procure funding from her father. The film climaxes with her telling them that what matters more to her father than her safety is his respectability (a subtle jab at many of the men in my life who failed me during my own trauma) and that in order to make him pay they need to record themselves graphically using her body sexually and send him the evidence and threaten to take it public. The shame would prompt her shrewd businessman father to finally cough up the money. I filmed this closed room scenario over the course of 14 hours in a 50-degree basement wearing nothing but my underwear and not eating the whole day because it was an anal scene. By the time we all started rolling into sex, I was physically exhausted and completely raw, there was absolutely no artifice. I hand picked the men with whom I would be working on this day and all of them were dear friends to me. By the time we were rolling into sex, I was already so deeply in sub space that I actually had to call cut mid-way through the scene just to cry. Not from pain, but just from the raw vulnerability and power of reliving the traumas visited upon me. I visited places in my mind as each of these men used my various orifices for their pleasure (or at least thats what we depicted) that I hadnt visited in a long time. I felt as they were touching me the same survival instincts that I felt in those past moments*just keep breathing, just stay still, this will be over soon, just fucking survive, you can do this.* Even my male talents knew we were doing powerful things and would occasionally break character and whisper sweet and encouraging things into my ear. They were such good souls, I felt so lucky (and weirdly turned on) by their kindness. The scene climaxes with the three assailants ejaculating on my face and then leaving me in a pile of cum, similar to my own trauma story. Only this time, when my assailants got up to high five, they left the gun on the table. Without calling cut, I crawled towards the gun and truly was hyperventilating as I held it up to their backs, the camera pans close to my face as you see me physical trembling as I envisioned the face of every man who ever hurt me. Then I pulled the trigger. When I gripped the gun and shot, the physical catharsis in my chest was. amazing. Every single person in the room (a half dozen people) jumped to their feet and cheered for me, clapping their hands and immediately giving me hugs and encouragement. My knees buckled underneath me from the weight of it but *it felt so fucking good.* No orgasm or physical sensation I have ever felt in porn felt better than that moment. I told my story and this time I fucking won. More than that, I won every single day I ever got out of bed in those days after my assault. I win every day I live the truth that I am not a victim but a survivor. I wonder if men who enjoy watching women being abused for misogynistic reasons will even really enjoy this sceneto me, it doesnt really matter. I profit from them no matter what, they still must pay to access my body. My hope is that if you are a man or woman who has suffered from trauma and who feels shame about continuing to masturbate to consensual non-consent scenes, that you will feel joy when you watch this scene. At the very least you will feel no guilt because this was not a story of abuse but of victory. Every day that a woman gets paid (a lot of money, actually) to do a scene like this is a story of victory. We choose, our choice is our constant happiness. Theres such a sensation of power and joy in flipping these power dynamics on their head and turning the tables. Please do not feel guilty for enjoying it with us. If you do watch the movie when it comes out, please let me know your thoughts. "

Since it has happened, I've spent every day trying to make sense of what happened. My apologies if this turns out to be huge wall of text - however, I would really like to share my story. I'm shaking as I type this. Sorry if some parts are rambly and don't make sense. As cliche as it sounds, I never thought it would happen to me. My only regret was that I didn't end it sooner. Although I mourn the loss of the good times and I miss my Ex-bf, I'm glad that I got out. I was in denial for a long time. We were in a committed relationship for 5 months. If you count the times that we casually dated, our total ""relationship"" was about ~8 months. I've knew him before I started dating him. When we were casual acquaintances, he has always been kind, helpful, and get along (or so it seems) with everyone. I didn't know this could happen to me. I thought I knew all the red flags in an abusive relationships. Love blinded me. As the relationship progresses, I had a nagging feeling that **something wasn't right. ** That feeling was fear. Please, if you are finding yourself in a similar situation, **please trust your intuition.** My Ex-bf, on the surface, seems like a well-rounded guy. He was friendly to everyone and volunteered in kids event. We worked together. At the time, I would overhear him talk about his exes and he would always casually mention how smart she was. He didn't have a mean thing to say to anyone. I was new to the job and I there was a lot of things that I didn't know. He offered his help freely. He helped every one of his coworkers. I thought that meant he was a good person. When we started spending more time together, he was the perfect gentleman. When I declined a kiss on the second date, he immediately backed off. He was always eager to lend a helping hand. At first, it was like a dream come true - he was funny, charming, and he would rush over to my place when he sensed that I was going through a bad depressive episode. I was under a lot of stress at that time. He would hold me, kiss me, and tell me how beautiful and worthy I am so I wouldn't feel alone. He was like a dream come true. He treated me like I was his delicate doll. Because of this, I overlooked a lot of red flags. A LOT OF RED FLAGS. - He told me about his self-harm and abuse history, about ~2 months into the casual dating phase. I didn't think much about it at the time. I had mistaken his vulnerability for intimacy. He had openly told me: ""If you would like to walk away now, I would not hold it against you."" He told me that he had ""anger issues"", but it was because of trauma he had suffered in the past. I BELIEVED HIM. **Mistake #1.** - Move the relationship really fast. Within a month or so after we decided to become exclusive, he said he wanted to marry me. Again, I thought I was on Cloud 9! I was ""special"". **He told me how his exes have abused and cheated on him.** But I wasn't like that. He told me that I was sweet and special and I wasn't like his monster exes. I promised that I would never be abusive to him. **Red flag #2.** - Inconsistencies in his story. At first, I took his stories at face-value and I thought he had incredibly bad luck at dating abusive women. Then one day, the stories *clicked* and I became suspicious that he wasn't giving me the whole story. He could never tell me how certain arguments or conflicts started out - it always seem like his exes just started beating him/cheating for no reason. **Red Flag #3** Slowly, the ugly side of his became to trickle out. At first, he accused me of not loving him enough, of not caring enough, of not making him feel appreciated. I thought he was going through a depressive episode and wanted to help. I conceded in arguments and texted him 5 times a day saying ""I love you"". I began questioning and criticizing myself. I was afraid to make demands because, somehow, he would make it seem like I was greedy and uncaring if I wanted him to do a favour or provide support when *I* need it. Gradually, I was afraid to disagree with him. I was afraid to express my own desires and wants in the relationship. I was losing myself. At first, he was moody. Irritated. But he was able to brush it off and it seemed like he was just stressed at work. Then the irritation and ""moodiness"" start to add up and escalate. He would start blaming me for things out of my control. It was ""my fault"" that he was so stressed at work and he wanted to quit his job. It was ""my fault"" because I wanted a stable life, and I was the one putting the demands on him and I was ""greedy"" and ""pressuring"" him into stress. I broke. I cried and told him that it didn't matter what I want anymore, and **I apologized to him for wanting a stable life with him and unintentionally stressing him out**. I felt so bad. That was my first taste of being gaslighted. Overtime, his accusations of things being ""my fault"" became worse. He would pick apart my neutral statements and accuse me of not doing enough, not loving enough, and not be grateful. I stress him out if I don't tell him about a bad day, and I stress him out if I do (????). He would berate me for my depression. He says that my depression makes him feel bad about himself. I don't know how it happened, but I soon find myself comforting him and validating his own self-worth, while struggling through my own depression issues. At first, the conflicts were mild enough that I thought they were normal arguments. About 3 months into the relationship, he starts raising his voice in arguments. **At first, it started with him talking over me and interrupting me at every stage.** I thought it was normal. Then he starts yelling. Screaming. Profanities thrown at me even though I begged and cried for him to stop. **He would always apologize. He promised to get counselling.** He threatened to kill himself if I leave. He told me graphic descriptions of how he would do it. Slit wrists. Jumping in front of cars. Stabbing himself. Cutting his own throat. I became numb. Desensitized. He reassured me that he didn't mean it. He apologized. Again. He promised to get help. Again. Then he starts throwing things. Punching objects. Apology after apology, I watch myself being sucked into the cycle of abuse. I found myself being tense when I'm with him. When he holds my hand, all I can think about is the next time he gets frustrated. The next time his blows would finally land on *me*. I broke up with him six days ago. As predicted, he broke his promise and he had keys in his hand. He threw the keys AT ME. It didn't hit me but landed right at my feet. It was over. He promised that he would never throw anything at me anymore. He promised he won't swear at me anymore. ""FUCK YOU!!!"" he screamed as he stormed off. I'm glad I got out. I'm glad that I didn't wait for it to escalate. My heart is broken and I miss the sweet side of him so much some days... but I'm glad it ended. Some mornings I wake up and I think about his crying face, how he begged me to stay and promised that he will make counselling appointments so he won't get angry at me anymore. I think about the tears. I still think about it, a lot. But I'm glad it ended. Thank you for reading."

I was so naive that when he touched me I thought it was in the consoling way a father might. Over the summer I realized how wrong his actions were and how he had taken advantage of my vulnerability after I met a man (my boss who is my teachers same age) who showed me respect unlike my teacher. When I finally broke down and told my parents and reported it to the school office and the police the rumor of the teacher came out and everyone knew it was me. However either people think we had sex (we did not. Im actually a virgin not that it matters) and Im a slut or I made it up to get him fired. Now the vast majority of the students and my teachers treat me like Im worthless. Almost no one talks to me. And the teacher has yet to be arrested and most likely wont be for a long while so it seems evident that I lied. I cant stop thinking about what he did to me. I cant sleep. I cry constantly. I cant focus in school. My grades took a nose dive and I cant get them up no matter how hard I try. Im going to the doctors Friday for treatment of my depression but Im skeptical it will help. I dont want to get my hopes up. I feel like a whore. I feel like I let it happen and if I hadnt been such a slut I wouldnt be in this situation. Why didnt I realize it was wrong when it was happening? I remember having gut feelings something was wrong but hed always reassure me everything was fine. Hed make jokes about fucking me and all the things he wanted to do to me and then tell me he was joking even when I asked him to stop. Nothing makes me happy anymore. Absolutely nothing. And on top of all this my manager (female) accused me of trying to seduce my boss who is 30 years older than me. She accused me before she knew about my teacher if she even knows about him. Honestly Im such a wreck. The thought of living is absolutely appalling and I feel so alone. What do I even do?
98,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Finally realizing my relationship might not be what I thought after viewing it through my psychologist's eyes,749,6vr22v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6vr22v/finally_realizing_my_relationship_might_not_be/,2017-08-25 00:05:31,"I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years, started halfway through college. I come from a sexually manipulative/abusive relationship so it's hard for me to understand what 'normal' is. Anything that is better than what I had to me always seemed better, and that was enough. I've been seeing my doctor (he's a psychologist and psychiatrist) for about 4 months , and all of a sudden things have become so clear to me. It's like my eyes have been opened and I can actually SEE things for what they are. I haven't just been working on this relationship. Relationships in general have been hard for me. I seem to be drawn into, or people are attracted to, my vulnerability and so I've had a lot of people shit all over me throughout my life. This culminated in a coworker that I thought was my friend (looking back he was always an asshole) sexually harassing me, and all of the other (men) that were my friends taking his side. So a simple issue comes up--my boyfriend and I were drinking and, like usual, he started to get angry. His voice was getting louder and louder as we were in an intellectual argument over something pretty dumb. An argument that started by me asking him to keep his voice down turned into him telling me that maybe I am just a bitch and that's why everyone leaves me and that's why people treat me like shit. Maybe it's that I'M messed up. (full disclosure I said ""you're being kind of an ass"" before this.) He admitted it the next day and said he didn't actually believe it, he was just trying to hurt me. When I told my doctor, he said that there are actually people out there that won't intentionally try to hurt you. Hm, that was a thought that had never really occurred to me before. We started talking, and a whole list of other issues came out--that he gets angry when he drinks, that he has physically pinned me down and grabbed me. In fact, the night that my coworker sexually harassed me, my boyfriend picked me up while I was crying and was extremely angry--not just at the guy, but at me. I was bawling and he told me to shut the fuck up, stop being so fucking stupid. Screaming this at me as my crying is getting more and more hysterical. Later, he admitted he was drunk. So anyways, getting it all out and noticing the reaction my doctor had was like a switch was flipped in my brain. Not all at once, but slowly. It started when the next day I brought up what he had said. ""Well I just said you were a bitch to me, I was only talking about myself."" Usually I would've gullibly believed him, thought I was wrong. I might timidly say ""I don't think that's what happened""--but instead, I recognized it immediately as manipulation. Next thing that happened--because of my sexual abuse in the past, sex can be extremely difficult for me. In the middle of sex, he asked if I wanted to stop and I said yes--something that never happens. I will typically hold it in and let him keep going, usually ending in dissociation or a panic attack. But he did stop, and I said we could have sex later. Later came, and I feel panic and couldn't do it. He got extremely angry and went to the restroom. When he came back, I started a conversation about the hurt I feel when he behaves this way and what I perceive as a lack of understanding. He responded, ""Well what about earlier today when I stopped in the middle of [sex]"" I said, ""Do you want, like, an award for that?"" ""No, but you said I'm not understanding. I feel like that was pretty damn understanding."" ""Umm.. No. I feel like it's what anyone except a rapist would do?"" ""Whatever."" THIS. WAS. A. HUGE. BREAKTHROUGH! I would NEVER have stood up for myself before. If he had told me that a month earlier, my whole body would have shut down, and I would have felt such immense guilt that I would likely stay in my room for several hours just staring at a fucking wall. Then again, I never would have even ADDRESSED the issues at hand. I don't know what the future holds--but it really is like a new lease on life. I don't know what happened exactly, but I guess an outsider's view made me finally have some sense of self worth. I still felt sad, but usually the sadness is a kind of self hatred that will manifest itself into suicidal ideation. Now, it was a sadness filled with self-compassion and hurt. I have tried so long to try to not play the victim, been so afraid that I am the victim, that I'm 'overdramatic' etc--that I had actually become allowed myself to be victimized by the closest people in my life. I'd let everyone shit all over me and I have never, up until now, done anything about it. So, I'm essentially starting over--but it feels so good. Edit, or update, or whatever you say: I am crying out of gratitude for everyone who has commented. It's made my day. Wasn't expecting this, wrote it mostly to get it out of my system and honestly expected to be down voted. Thanks everyone for the well-wishes. "
99,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,I was raped and I feel like I'm overreacting,5,6vupjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6vupjk/i_was_raped_and_i_feel_like_im_overreacting/,2017-08-25 09:23:18,"This may sound really dumb and I'm really sorry if this isn't the place for this post, but being in the middle of a panic attack and really wanting insight led me to this subreddit. I'm also sorry for my formatting; I'm on my phone. Here goes: I'm 18, and about a month ago I think I was raped by a friend. I'll leave out explicit details, but I was beyond wasted (drunk and high, couldn't walk, could barely talk), I did say no, push him away, give in because I was scared he'd hurt me more physically. That last part makes me feel like I'm being sensitive and silly. Why would I give in? Like he said, I must have wanted it, that I was asking for it. So, for the past month I've been trying to tell myself that. But now it's getting more and more and more difficult to push it away and act like it never happened. It's hindering my life now in ways I didn't anticipate. I can't get high without having horrible panic attacks, I can't drink at all without thinking I'm back there. Sex isn't enjoyable (even though I do it for my boyfriend who wouldn't be able to guess I never finish). I feel so numb inside, especially in moments of vulnerability. I feel like a big wimp. I was abused as a child, I should be able to ignore this too. But I can't. I can't stop thinking about it, no matter how hard I try. My boyfriend knows and tries to support me, but he doesn't know what to do and I don't blame him or want to burden him. I don't know how to ask for help. I just want to forget. I want to be happy, but I feel like that may never happen. I'm sorry for the long rant, but I guess my questions are am I overthinking this and how do I ask for help. Thank you. Edit; I marked this NSFW because I don't want to trigger anyone with the content or subject. "

101,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,I'm healing from an abusive relationship with a narcissist that ended 2.5 months ago. I could use some advice.. or simply an ear.,13,6j1v3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6j1v3z/im_healing_from_an_abusive_relationship_with_a/,2017-06-24 01:23:50,"Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I would love to hear your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I really appreciate all your voices and Reddit so so much. I'll try to keep it condensed and simple. I dated a narcissist for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged.. wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. It doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both ""breaking"" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its what broadens and builds your mind and heart, I love that. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I appreciate open-mindedness and the will to adapt. Effort is so beautiful. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would do things like tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because my brain is not wired to be a coder or engineer. This is one of the most painful parts. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and masturbate next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. There were times I would be very ill or very drunk and he would just go ahead and fuck me.. even when I'm barely conscious. I would just lie there in the fetal position. He said that was one of the great things about me.. ""I never left him wanting."" He was so proud that he's slept with 120 women. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just didn't care. He would say sometimes sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. It's just about him. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe 3 times in 8 months. He blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. He would fall asleep after I drove 22 miles to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed. He once dropped me on the side of the road with all my luggage to take an uber home after a road trip when I said I wanted to go back to my apartment, not his. He has a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by ""fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable"" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest ""id"" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to ""jokingly"" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, overly caring, sensitive, ""squishy"" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They ""lick the earth"" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist. Being a sensitive ""squishy"" ..That all seemed so empty to me. His dream is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. he impregnates them and doesn't take care of the babies. ""Like a Viking king"" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of this manifestation. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this poor 7 year old boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating and sometimes you dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out. He began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider ""many types of arrangements"" with the help of his lawyers. Anyway.. 8 months we dated. He made me cry 1-3 times a week. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love similar music and movies. He would sing to me.. we loved going on long drives and talking about life.. this existence.. our hopes and dreams. We are both class clowns. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who always lived in a big house.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he get married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. ""poverty mentality"" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. One time when he dumped me he said.. his mother is so strong she has never cried ever in his life. And I cry all the time. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say ""my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force."" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and would end in tears going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how her abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve.. and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he ""protected"". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. I see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. As a woman.. as a super sensitive aware woman.. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. My ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is ""untouchable"". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the ""jackpot"" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. Anyway.. We are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college. I always drove to his place in Santa Monica (22 miles away from my place and my work.) I always planned amazing adventures.. things he's never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit dinner once. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was my idea and I treated him. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I stayed with him while he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money like this for anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought care and effort that is so special. He just never got it. Honestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, contemplation and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love.. to GIVE the love I hope to receive.. and the yearning to settle down blinded me. I gave the love that I wish to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have self love and strength to walk away. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. The very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. I was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against it.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be in it? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? Poisoning your life with my love? After getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. ""Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people."" That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserve a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another so he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he loves his life. He said ""I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again"" He said he had already fucked someone new and she is ""very sweet"". He went on a date with someone and ""she is fucking awesome"". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. We often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises broke in me. He finally cut the remaining karmic tie between us. This was never about me. I was never going to make this guy happy and we were never going to work. All this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone... was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging in anyway. Control everything. That, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. So here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying ""OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better."" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. Is it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.) Living a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to ""make"" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. ""shit.. now I see"" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire to be awake and mindful... it takes time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. URL URL As the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? Thank you so much for the wonderful comments and messages. I cannot express how moved I am. Its even more special because we are all anonymous strangers yet we are all so interconnected in how we feel and the hardships we face. I am so thankful. I choose to take this painful experience and life lesson and continue to explore myself.. love myself... open myself to others.. and love. He texted and emailed me a few weeks ago. He wrote: Text: It's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Email: It's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Sorry for how things went down. I couldn't respond. "
102,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Open letter to my drug addicted ex boyfriend,44,6fjfsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6fjfsm/open_letter_to_my_drug_addicted_ex_boyfriend/,2017-06-06 13:59:31,"When we first met, I was unfamiliar with drug addiction. I didnt understand how addiction rewires the brain to do ANYTHING to get a fix; I didnt understand that addiction possesses people like a demon, leaving the beautiful person that was once there to succumb to his sickness. Had I known how evil addiction was when we met, I would have stayed very far away from you. But, those big brown eyes.. Big muscles.. Big personality.. I couldnt say no to you. I was so attracted to you, and I couldnt just walk away when I saw a good man trapped inside a diseased body; the way you held me and kissed me was so pure, like it was the only thing you lived to do. In the total of our two year relationship, I think I saw you sober for about a month (when you add all the days together, not a month straight). So, a part of me believes I never got to actually know you, because you were either moody, coming down from a high, hiding something from me, or getting high. A part of me thinks that you were never in love with me, but in love with the way I made you feel, the way I enabled your addiction. When I started to question whether or not you should continue using, you hissed at me like a rattlesnake warns its prey, and the issue would be dropped because I didnt want to get bitten. But two years in, I said enough is enough. No, I didnt give you an ultimatum, but I said that I couldnt do it anymore. Ill never forget that night I confronted you, because your reaction stunned me: instead of being angry, you started to wail like a child crying for its mother. You uttered in between your uncontrollable sobbing, Im going to fight this; Im going cold turkey because I dont want to lose you. I love you so much, baby. Your vulnerability was so overwhelming that it made me cry; I thought you were for real this time, because Ive never heard you cry like that before. For the next week, you were sober. Although you were going through withdrawals and moods, I felt like I could see the real you. Our two year anniversary was on the second day you were sober; all we did was go out to dinner and get ice cream, but the time we spent together was so wholesome and true that it didnt matter what we did, as long as we were together. You were really there with me, laughing at the inside jokes we had together, reminiscing about things weve done in the past, and trying each others food. I could see your courage, and it made me proud. I remember a few nights after that day, we were laying on our bed in the darkness of the night, limbs intertwined, faces close, souls serene. It was quiet, then you had a strange sense of self awareness, and whispered in my ear, Baby, I know I havent been good to you, but things are going to change. Im going to be better for you, because I love you. I love us. A few days later, your words would be retracted by action. It only took eight days for your addiction to win. I was heartbroken; I didnt see it coming, because I believed in you, in us. I thought that our love could triumph anything, only to realize I was hurling myself at a brick wall. I was going to make you a scrapbook of happy memories we shared as a surprise gift for two weeks of sobriety, but you shredded the pages before I could start. The hardest part of your addiction was the ability it gave you to lie to me, and I could always tell when you were lying. You were addicted to drugs, but I was addicted to you, which is why I let you walk all over me. I thought if I held out, Id see the miracle happen. Unfortunately, addiction doesnt work like that, and if it did, a lot of people would still be together/alive. Do you remember how passionately you kissed me the night you promised to choose me, like you would never get the chance to kiss me again? Do you remember the way I curled on your lap and said everything would be okay? I bet youre doing everything you can to forget me. I know so, because Im doing the same damn thing. I drove 2,000 miles to get away from you, but I can still feel your breath on the back of my neck. Im sick of you; Im sick for loving you still. I didnt want to say it, but fuck it, I miss you. I only left you a letter in my permanent absence; goodbyes have never been my forte. I couldnt even do it in person, because I couldnt bare to see how you would react. I felt like I said all I had to say in the letter and I should have closure, but I dont get closure when I still feel you here with me as if you were tangled in my veins. Its been three weeks since Ive left. No, Ill never send this letter to you, because I dont want to rip the stitches I so carefully placed to heal from you. The way I see it, you would have reached out to me if I was worth it. Your silence answers all of my questions. The miracle was not your sobriety, but my strength. All I want to do is get over you, because your addiction caused me so much pain. So if theres anything else I want to say to you, its a simple prayer: Dear ex lover, Who I loved dearly with everything I had; I hope you sleep well tonight. I hope you do everything you can that makes you happy. I want you to know that Im not angry with you, because I understand you. I understand that I couldnt be enough for you, and thats okay. Im sorry I had to go, but it was time to protect myself from the monster that lived within you. And as for me, I just want to be normal again Amen "

Long story short, I had quite a rough start at life I don't want to go into too much details, but my early 20s made me vulnerable to some pretty predatory men I considered friends. Between 2014 and 2016 there was a gap where I was just working, dealing with my mental health, and saving to go back to school. My family disowned me because of my personal values in December, there is a history there of verbal and physical abuse - I love them dearly and wish them the best but it took a bit of a toll on me. in 2016, a man befriended me and helped me out a lot - he was a financial advisor, was a respected member of my community and was well off - I assumed it was in my best and legal interest to share some aspects of my financial identity. I had just lost my job to a kitchen fire and was without a home. There were red flags, but evidently desperation and vulnerability don't go very well together. The ""kind wise friend"" faade fell when I found out he was married and his wife was overseas. I had an OK credit, and he tanked it to the 400s without my knowledge. Things started becoming abusive for me when he would not let me get a job when I was staying with him and infantilized and mocked me. He had raped me and pinned me down to slap his member on my face ""as a joke"". I tried claiming fraud but the 2500$ responsibility still falls on me. I got out of that situation, I could have gotten out earlier if I had mustered the courage to get over my pride. I did not want to tell people that this was the 2nd time I was raped. Or that I was naive enough to be duped out of my finances this way. What I am doing now: I am involved in helping out at a youth centre. I am planning on going back to school in September and I am getting a job soon. I finally have a roof over my head I am blessed to pay minimally for. My age (between 21 and 24) has gotten me free counselling services at the hospital near my place. I am looking for help in terms of the ""what now"" - how do I get him to pay back? Should I even? He has my pet, what are the steps to get him back? How do you self-care? How do you become more financially literate? How does independence and autonomy look like? Thank you in advance. tl;dr: I got out of a bad situation, what can I do now? "
105,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,"As a girl who ended up not aborting, I am more pro-choice than ever. It is your life.",14901,61fhcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/61fhcl/as_a_girl_who_ended_up_not_aborting_i_am_more/,2017-03-26 00:19:58,"Hello everyone. First of all, I would like to apologize in advance for the numerous grammar mistakes I will be making, since English is not my first language. Also, I am very tired and my head is foggy writing this with less than 3-5 hours sleep for the last 2 weeks, so there is a possibility this will be a incomprehensible mess. Quick back story: I am 21-years-old with a baby who is 1 year and 8 months old. I became pregnant at 19 for my then-boyfriend-ish dude. He isn't really in the picture anymore, with his whole heart. He has his own life with a new girlfriend, he studies, he parties, he goes on vacations. He has a fun and active life. That fun and active life doesn't leave that much of time for our daughter. His effort is maybe once a month, usually a lot less, reaching out to ask how she is doing, otherwise it is 99% of time me who sends the whatsapp messages (who are left unanswered) and calls (who he seems to ignore happily pretty often), trying to get him see our daughter. He doesn't pay child support since he is a broke student, but most of all we had a deal of leaving third parties out of this to have his relationship with her as good as possible. In his words, he will make it up with love with what he can't pay. Obviously I am considering to break our ""deal"" since he has 0 respect to it anyway. It will be a long, exhausting fight where I will be the cruel, money-thirsty manipulating bitch, his new girlfriend will see me doing this because I want to sabotage their relationship and he will be the victim. Anyway, this post wasn't about my ex, I don't know why I wrote about him. Maybe because I just saw his instragram travelling photos from exotic beaches and felt a sting of jealousy and saddness. As I said, I was 19 when I became pregnant. You know those girls who say ""I _always_ wanted to be a mother!""? Yeah, I am the complete opposite of that. I can't understand that, like someone would be speaking a different language. What do you even mean with that?? How can someone dream of having children? My first instinct was to abort, immediately after I took the test. I don't like kids. I never wanted to be a mother. I never, for a second, dreamed of having kids in my life. My then-boyfriend, took a strong pro-life stand, but made it clear he will respect my choice even if I abort. He didn't push or bully me to anything, let's make that clear. What he did do, though was that he did manipulate me with a rosy view how fun it will be to play with our little kiddo. In his mind it was only ponies and rainbows. I thought we will raise this kid together. He told me so, very clearly. I did book an abortion date. The days before that after school I spend scrolling through pro-life-websites, youtube-videos, sites (even reddit) where women like me where called a whore, why didn't I use contraception, this is my punishment, I will go to hell for this. I could spend 9-10 hours glued on my phone and fall asleep at 3-4 in the morning, since I was too anxious to sleep. My mom was the only one who was relieved that I will abort and supported me. My crazy religious relative (the nuts one in our family) who got to know about my situation and harassed me that I will ""pay for my sins"". Good stuff like that. I live in probably the best country in the world for women. I am _not_ religious. I have never been religious. My country's overall position to abortion is very relaxed and respectful towards the women. The conditions to keep my child as a poor (well, let's be honest, I had no income then, have no income now) woman are the best in the world. We have a fantastic welfare system, free health care, free education. Everything. I saw that a lot on those so called pro-life sites, and have seen them later on. Women who say they are feminist and want the _conditions_ to be so well women don't have to abort. I had those conditions. From that day I became pregnant (or let's say, more precisely, that first day when I started to scroll those websites) I have lost my real will to live. That kind of will that makes you dream and enjoy life. That kind of passion where you _look forward_ to things. Where you are anxious to go to the world and fight for your place in life. Anything can happen, life is so exciting and fun. That was my life before I became pregnant. I had dreams of university, maybe a foreign husband, erasmus, travelling, partying, experiencing. Learning languages, dancing till the morning, drinking, making friends. The day before my abortion I had the worst panic attack, my first. After that there has been plenty. I cancelled my abortion the morning of it. I felt enormous relief. Let's be honest about the reasons here: I, a person who was raised in a very non-religious-only-namely-christian household, was convinced I am going to hell if I do this. Yes, you read that right. I would never confess this to anyone else, ever, but I did not keep this baby because I saw a future with her or because I wanted to, I did because I did not see that I could terminate it now. I felt 100% trapped, everything was over. The mistake was already happened, nothing could save me anymore. Either I was going to be a baby-killer or then I was going to have a stupid, boring life. No good options. I am more pro-choice today, as a mother for a very challenging but beautiful almost 2 year old, than ever. I know motherhood now. I know what my life is now when I had this child. I lost myself. I am still not in the university because I can't concentrate on reading for the entrance exam with her. I am trying this year, but it won't happen. I am exhausted. Money is tight and it is _very_ strictly controlled, even though because I live in an awesome country I am not missing anything. More than anything, life is lonely. My friends are living their own life, no one is a mother. I am the boring, frumpy shell that is nothing like what I used to be. I have strecth marks, my boobs are sagging at 21, I am overweight. I had a very difficult and painful birth that still manifestates itself today in form of me having trouble of holding on farts. I don't use make up anymore, nor do I dress up since I don' have money for clothes and I hate my appearance so much there would be no point anyway. Oh I am sorry, I know that when women become mothers appearance and ""superficial stuff"" don't matter at all since we don't care about anything else than our children's welfare. If we do, it is just to please our husbands. Well, I don't have a husband, and I mourn the loss of my looks very much. It affects my self esteem. I am perfectly aware how society even the most feminist, free countries in the world sees single mothers. I am a fuck up, a mess up, I was ""pumped and dumped"", I deserve this. No good man wants me anymore. I have lost even the boys who used to be my friends, not to mention when my boyfriend left us absolutely no one was interested in me anymore. I spend my days with my little human. I take care of her, I feed her, I bathe her, I play with her, I go to the park with her, I read to her. I am constantly, absolutely constantly, scared of parenting her wrong. I try to learn about parenting methods which I can't seem to really keep up with in real life. Now, let's get to the important part of my mindless, long rambling: **I love her**. With all my heart. I have short times of immense joy with her. My life is for her. I am trying to get into university in a field that would have 9-16 days so I can construct my life around her. I will fight with everything I have to ensure she has a good life. If I was sent to that day right now, holding my phone with shaking hands, convinced I have to cancel my abortion, would I still do it? No. I wouldn't. I would abort. People don't like extremely complicated answers, answers that actually reflect life that is hard and has a million different view points. They want ""oh not aborting was the most wonderful decision of my life, my child gave me a reason and happiness and everything"". They don't want young women with no realistic opportunities to support themselves without the help of the government to have children, but will judge those who abort. If I could, I would go back and abort in a heart beat, actually understanding what it means to stay up alone all by yourself, be left my your boyfriend who has the freedom to just merrily fuck off to his exciting student-life bubble with our old friends. I would understand how taxing the bodily, mental and hormonal changes are. I would understand, than once you have a child _that's it_. Your life is over, or at least put on on hold, and you _never_ get life or those precious years of freedom, fun, studying and networking back. The reason people make babies in stable marriages is because parenting is FUCKING HARD. It is FUCKING EXHAUSTING. I would give _anything_ in this world to do this when I am significantly older, with a supporting husband, living our on own money, in house. It would be wonderful to have that now, but still it wouldn't be what I really want in life. It would still be a second-place good. I don't need help, or reassuring, or cheering or ""it will be get better when that baby reaches age x""-thing. Nor I am looking for compassion. I know clear well my post comes off as a selfish, whining bitch. That's how women are seen. We have a motherhood myth, and if you don't fit in you are a monster. I don't need advice or ""why don't you just adopt/quit bitching and enjoy what you have/at least you have a healthy child/most people have it worse"". I don't give a fuck. I know perfectly well I am a good mom and will be a good mom, and I will do everything for her. However I don't like it, I don't like my life. Its lost. I have been to the doctor and yes I am depressed. I don't need ""this is your post natal depression speaking, it will get better when you get sleep, when she is an adult you are grateful for her blah blah, you would be depressed anyway"". I don't believe depression being an illness that just pops out randomly for no reason at all. I am depressed because I hate my life and have no way out, and the reason it is because I hate being a mother. You can reverse every single thing in life except having kids and death. **TL;dr**: Women who are pregnant and thinking whether or not to abort: Do not give a single fuck for _any_ outside opinion. Not the opinion of your boyfriend, or even husband, relative, friend, church member, whatever (I know the husband and boyfriend-part will trigger a massive roar, don't care.) . Look at _your_ life in the future, what you want, and then act accordingly. Keep your child ONLY if you WANT TO BE A MOTHER. Everything else, finances, relationships, people shaming and guilt-tripping you, is bullshit. I am **not** encouraging anyone to abort. I am saying that in the end no one else will be there, and it will be you and only you, with your one, unique life. It needs to be _your_ decision you know you can live with the rest of your life. Those people wanting to influence you are not going to care or help you in the end. The end. **Edit**: I have to go now and it can take me a long time until I get back (I can't be on phone or computer when I am with my kid) , so I am upset I can't answer to each and every post made here, but. Please know that all your positive messages have made a huge impact on me. I am in tears. I shared something painful and instead of a few trolls and ignoring, I got to have so encouraging and beautiful messages and other women sharing their feelings and life situations. I thank all of you for your PMS (except the trolls) and your messages. I will read all of them and try to answer to as much as I can. And to that person who gave me gold, I have no words. Just... Thank you. Thank you so much. **Quick edit 2 since this is important**: I would never say to my daughter that she wasn't really wanted, and I will do everything I can ever to feel the complete opposite. I will never tell her anything what really happened when I considered my options. I've always said to her I loved you since the moment I knew you were coming and that she is my greatest gift, and those things are true. My daughter is the light of my life, and I don't blame her on anything, what I do blame is myself and wish that women could have more support. I know my feelings are more complex than mothers are allowed to have, but to those asking if I hate my daughter that is the last sentiment I have. I will be the best I can for her, and I am sticking to my decision. **Edit 3** : Good god I am shaking. I don't understand what is happening here. I am honestly in a state of shock. I thought I would just quickly check this before crashing since I can hardly keep my eyes open, and came back to blown up inbox of hundreds of messages, _four fucking golds_, this is being in the r/all. I can't wrap my head around what is happening. Your messages. Your private messages. It would be impossible for me to try to put in words how I am feeling right now. It would be too little to say that I am overwhelmed. I have read message after message with my hand covering my mouth since I can't take all these people reaching out to me, telling their stories and sharing how they feel about their situations that are from every perspective of this issue, people sending just LOVE, just lovely, encouraging, loving messages for a complete stranger (and yes so, so many hateful trolls too, btw I don't read further immediately when I spot on a message that was mean simply to hurt). I don't know what to do with all this love. My heart is beating so fast. It would be absolutely impossible for me to go through all of them right now, it is very late and I have spend much longer on this than I really could. I will read each and every single of them and reply to as many as I possibly can. I can't believe just letting the world see my ugly raw hopelessness and feelings of being trapped could open a gate like this. I dwell on these thoughts hour to hour, day to day alone, month to month, usually when grandma takes my daughter to her so I can have a short break I write to myself in my diary. I can't believe the amount of women reaching out and sharing how they feel. As I said, I am not religious, but I believe in the universe. But let's just say I've have a _very_ hard couple of months, and _extremely_ hard couple of days, especially this day. i think. I think I was supposed to write this. Something has cracked inside of me, I can't handle my emotions right now but this, this has been more therapeutic than the 7 months I have spent with a professional. I know this sounds ridiculous, but this is some kind of turning point for me. I feel it. I don't know how to say thank you. Thank you. Just **thank. you**. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Now I am going to drink about 6 liters of water to hydrate myself after all this crying and then I think I am going to lay down to the bed and be actually able to breath without the heavy feeling of creeping pain and soul-crushing anxiety blocking it. Then I am going to sleep well. For the first time in so long I don't want to write it. I just know it. Since I have this one short chance to say how I feel about this and maybe reach out to someone (also because I received so many of those messages of how I promote and encourage abortion), I will repeat this in a shorter way: **Nothing else matters than your own, personal, deep desire and inner voice on choosing what to do. It has to be YOUR choice. Do it ONLY if it TRULY is YOUR choice. Nothing else should do, since nothing else really matters.** Everything and everyone trying to manipulate, influence, bully, shame, or convince you is indifferent. It should go without saying, but since it was confusing to so many people, this applies to those women wanting to keep your baby but feeling that you are too much of x, have too much or too less of x or are being pushed by a partner/parent/important person in your life to abort. That decision _will_ hurt you, greatly. Let's get through this one more time: your marital status, age, education, wealth, what the society and community thinks, your image, how religion/someone from the outside views your decision, every single one of those are not what should be the reason you do what you do. ""But women are struggling to conceive so I should feel lucky, but my married lover wants me to abort, but I have everything I need in life, I am ready"", do not give a single fuck if it goes against your inner voice. If it comes from the outside, it is not yours, and you will have more than a hard time living life that is not yours. If it is, you will find a way to cope with everything and anything that comes along the way, since nothing in life is a greater motivation, source of power than knowing what you are doing comes from you. And lastly for those attacking me for bringing up the pro-life propaganda and how much it affected me, being skeptical about how it can get through to someone like me: when you are a confused hadly-an-adult, in a situation that is so panicking you feel like you are in the roof of a burning apartment with no opportunities to save yourself, with a huge hormonal rush, not knowing what to do (or more like thinking you aren't supposed to do what you want to do), you submit to powers you would normally not pay a second to. And I consumed that shit _a lot_. I understand it is hard to understand for an outsider, but when you are in a state of complete vulnerability feeling like it is something too big for you to decide, it is easier to listen to someone who says they know exactly what is right for you even if you know it isn't. They use stuff that cuts down to your emotions and really fucks up your mind. I am not blaming my boyfriend, my internet habits, or anyone outside for my decision. I take full responsibility of what happened. No one forced me with a gun to do anything, even though it felt like it in some way. But just like it was my choice, I should have seen it truly is _only_ my choice and absolutely no one is invested in that I am. And that is my goal for women to realize. I belive we are strong together and should celebrate and look out for each other. Womanhood is a beautiful but hard thing and we need to help each other. Thank you, you wonderful ladies and gentlemen. I will get back to all of you soon. Thank you for giving me hope, since that is what I got from this. Hope. So much hope. I am now going to bed with a lighter heart I've had in years."

107,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,How do you know if you're in an abusive relationship?,103,5u5y8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5u5y8r/how_do_you_know_if_youre_in_an_abusive/,2017-02-15 17:51:47,"Here are 12 signs you are in an emotionally abusive relationship. That your partner is establishing coercive control: 1. The relationship is intense from the start You're swept off your feet. Theyre larger than life, charming, funny and usually, the life of the party. Theyll shower you with flowers or gifts early on. Theyll focus their undivided attention on you. Then things move fast. You've not known them for long. But, before you know it, they're talking love, marriage, babies. You're moving in together. The sexual chemistry is off the scale. You are the only one for them, the one they've needed all along. They put you on a Madonna-like pedestal. These early days feel so good, you'll do anything for them. If they have no car, you'll drive them around. No money, you'll pay for everything. Nothing matters except seeing them again, feeling the intoxication of it. 2. They question your behaviour Before long, they start to question your behaviour and your past. How many people you've slept with before. They may imply you're not the 'Madonna' they expected you to be. Having put you on that high pedestal, they're now judging whether you live up to it. But their bar is high. They imply you may be 'like the others girls (or guys)' they've dated before. You've not even known them for long, but already you have to defend yourself as a 'good girl (or boy)'. 3. They isolate you They criticise your friends, implying they're a bad influence on you. If you go out with your friends alone, you face the Spanish inquisition when you get home. 'Who were you with?' 'Did you talk to anyone else?'. It becomes easier to avoid the implications and stay at home. They do the same with your family, criticising what they do or say. Even for who they are. They embarrass you by not turning up to family events, or behaving badly if they do. Again, it's not worth it. So you start to making excuses and limiting contact with them. Your partner justifies it all by telling you you only need each other. No-one else. 4. They are jealous of others When you are out with them, they monitor who you talk to. What you say. They insinuate that you are flirting if you even speak to another guy (or girl). If you take a bit longer than usual to return home from work, they'll imply you're having an affair. They may justify it by saying they trust you, but not other guys (or girls). It's a double standard, as they have no problem flirting with others. But you daren't question them about it. 5. They micro-manage you They make it clear what clothes they approve of and, if you are female, the ones which make you a 'slut'. They hate you wearing makeup. They decide what you watch on TV, who you speak to, they monitor your texts. They listen to your conversations and question who you're talking to and why you said what you said. They use their moods to control you. You try to second guess them and attempt to manage them. You change your behaviour, what you say and do, to appease them. To try to please them. To do everything you can to make them happy. So as not to inflame the anger they're now starting to reveal. The anger that frightens you. 6. They move the goal posts They expect you to live up to their rules, sometimes rules that to you, may seem a little random and crazy. But as you try to understand what they are, they shift the goalposts. They need to keep you on the back foot at all times. None of it makes any sense to you. 7. They justify their anger They justify their bad behaviour  I was tired; I was upset; 'You did x or y'. But they never take responsibility for it. It's all about Me, me, me - everything revolves around their needs, their wants. Not yours. 8. Your self-esteem erodes Your sense of self starts to erode, your confidence to whittle away. You can't do anything right and you are always to blame. But you still have hope. They give you enough glimpses of the charismatic person you first met. Enough to stay and give you hope that man (or woman) will come back. If only you can behave in the right way, to make them happy. But nothing ever seems to work. 9. They use intimacy as a weapon against you They want you to prove you love them, so you show your vulnerability. But any intimacy you trusted them with gets later used as a weapon to hurt you. Your body issues get hurled back in your face. Any sexual desire only proves that you are a 'whore'. Their words hurt as much as if they'd hit you. Sometimes you even wish they'd hit you instead. 10. The first signs of violence appear They destroy things that are meaningful to you, like a gift they or someone else gave you. They tear your clothes, sometimes when you are wearing them. Then one day in a fit of anger, they'll give you a push or a shove. They'll be full of remorse as soon as they've done it, though. There may even be tears. They apologise over and over. But again, it's your fault that they've hurt you. Or they blame an 'unhappy past'. Anything but take responsibility for it. 11. You keep their secret You keep what is happening to you a secret. You lie to others about their behaviour. You feel ashamed about what is happening to you. But you start to believe what they are saying about you. 12. The lows get lower The fights become more frequent. The lows get lower and the highs further between. The verbal and/or physical abuse has escalated. You are walking on eggshells by now. By now, there is little of you left. You feel trapped, with no way out. They've got you where they want you. They have complete control. It takes courage to walk away from an abusive relationship. It took every once of strength that I had to do so. But the first step is to recognise you are in one. Even if there has been no violence in your relationship to date, you should heed these warning signs. If they are familiar to you, I would urge you to get out. There might not be physical violence now, but emotional abuse can be the precursor to it. (And the shocking statistic remains: their partners kill 1-2 women every week). But please bear in mind: of all the domestic violence homicides, 75% of victims are killed as they try to leave. You need to take care. Don't do it without support, advice and help, particularly from the Family/Domestic Abuse resources that are available to you. It will be the hardest step that you take, but no love is worth dying for. (I'm not an expert but I'm a survivor of domestic abuse, who turned my life around from that of a young, single mother to finding success in love, career and life. I am now writing regularly on this subject, in the hope that I can help others to do the same. Please DM me if you want details to my blog where you can read more)."

I just found out from her best friend (who didn't know that I didn't know) that my wife was raped while she was in grad school, several years before we met. I'm not sure what to do. I've always sort of suspected something terrible might have happened to her during that period of her life, just by the way she has always talked about it (and avoided talking about big chunks), but I also completely believe it is entirely her choice whether or not to tell me about something of that magnitude and to be fair we've had some problems discussing our sexual pasts due to some sexual issues we both have with former long term partners (she was physically abused by another long term partner, and I was cheated on and left for someone else after a ten year relationship). There's a lot about her sexual past I recently found out she didn't tell me about (and I still know very little about) because she was afraid of my reaction because she's had more partners than me (I've only had two partners including her). I don't care about any of that but I don't think I've done the best job in the past making that clear to her, or helping her feel that, because I've kinda avoided asking her about her past relationships as well. Her friend apologized and I don't believe has told my wife I know, but I think my wife might suspect that I found out and has told me she wants to tell me something about that period in her life soon. I do not want to tell her I know (or force her to tell me) because, again, I feel like it should be her choice. I do hope at this point, though, that she will tell me just because it's kinda a huge thing to have to not tell her I know. Anyway, if she does tell me, how can I best react to support her and make her feel safe and some relief in telling me about it? Of course I'm shocked, and feel helpless and so angry that someone would have done that to her, but I'm afraid that when those kinda instincts are engaged (alpha-male ""i'll protect you"" crap) that it then becomes too much about me and not about her experience and the vulnerability she is having to show to tell me about it. I also don't want her to feel bad for not telling me before-- a part of me does feel a bit hurt that she didn't feel close enough to confide in me about it, but I also understand that I shouldn't take it personally and there's a multitude of reasons-- all valid-- she may not have wanted to go there, and again, I think that's her call, not mine. I also do not want her to have to relive too much of the trauma nor feel like I will somehow view her differently because of it. How should I react? What can I tell her to assure her I love her and nothing can change how I view her? Is that even what she needs to hear from me? What questions should I ask? What questions should I not ask? TL;DR - Found out from friend wife was raped years before I met her, think she's about to tell me, need advice on the best way to react to show support and love."

Basically, I do want a relationship with someone. I've never had a boyfriend and I'm 22 years old. This isn't a sexuality issue, I've had sexual encounters with men and I know I'm attracted to them. I usually realize I want a boyfriend when I feel very lonely - when I go to the movies alone, when I don't have anything to do on the weekend, when I want someone to watch Netflix with, play videogames with, generally talk to. All my friends have boyfriends and they spend time with them, so I often have nobody to do things with. And having a few drinks in you helps as well. But then I think about the commitment of being in a relationship. I realize that if I got a BF, I'd have to adjust my life around this person. I no longer could just stay at home, drink Cuba Libres and do fuck all. I also realize that I can't open up fully to anyone - I'm always this ""cool"" person who never shows any vulnerability and everyone around me, including the guys I'm interested in, have never seen another side of me and I'm afraid of opening up. Everything about being in a relationship, from commitment, to showing your regular side to someone, scares me. There have been multiple occassions where I've spent a fun night with someone and I have, for the lack of a better word, pussied out when they ask me on a proper date. I usually give an excuse like ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" or something. I wouldn't know how to act on a date. I'd much rather stay at home in my regular environment. Has anyone been in this situation and how have you forced yourself to go out of your comfort zone? I know I'm just 22, but it still feels extremely weird that I haven't had a relationship yet."

I'm so alone, fighting depression on my own and she doesn't have a clue. The days she does catch me crying to myself, she shrugs it off and tells me to stop crying. No mother, my heart is broken, I'm going to cry. I need you there for me. I need you to tell me that I'm going to be okay. I need you to sugarcoat things for me, even if they're lies. I can understand why you are the way you are, but whos hurt you so badly that you had to develop such a thick skin and a callous personality? Yeah sure, be a narcissist so youre not prone to vulnerability. Yeah sure, showing sympathy is weak. Yeah sure, show the world that youre capable of insensibility and lack empathy cause its not enough that the world is already a cold and cruel lonely place, why don't you add more of that negativity right on top for your daughter, right? Yeah? Youre right mother, put your guard up. Put your guard up around everybody, including me. Because at least then you'll have reassurance that nobody could hurt you. Sure. ...But nobody could make you happy that way either mother. How can anyone live like this? Expressionless and detached.

I had just woken up from a nap and was crying, you tried hushing me saying ""you don't have to cry, mum loves you"". You haven't told me you loved me since my 1st birthday? I'm not strong. I can't be you. I can't keep it together. I can't be alone. I need you. I need you the most. I only need you. I've done everything I could to try make you proud and it's not good enough. You threw away my childhood, forced me to grow up way too fast, pushing a share of the real life responsibilities onto my shoulders all at once so abruptly. I'm sorry I'm just not good enough. "

The kind of things that, in the moment, are more shocking than hurtful. It's categorized by person, so far it's mostly SOs and a few from my parents. This sounds fucked up and masochistic but I have a good (I think?) reason for starting. I had a manipulative and emotionally abusive internet boyfriend from 2007-2010. The kind of person who thinks he's a white knight and tells you youre only a good person because of how he's shaped and influenced you. After I broke it off he'd contact me on holidays and birthdays, and got ""back together"" after Christmas 2014. Nothing was good, everything as shitty, broke it off by May 2016. A bit help for me to not get sucked into another facade was my shit list. It really helped me realize that my delusions and optimism weren't supported by any evidence coming from the relationship. It's now June 2016 and I'm getting emails again from new addresses that I haven't blocked. How its ""stupid that we're not in each other's lives"" and how ""obviously being in a relationship is bad but that's only because of complicated feelings"" but we can be friends etc etc. They seem so much nicer when they want something. When I kept ignoring him he started blackmailing me, saying he'd post pics. I keep reading through my shit list and realize nothing will ever be worth hearing him say those thigs to me ever again. If he follows through with his threats, that embarrassment will be manageable compared to what he's already put me through. I have a terrible memory and even though this record of events isnt the healthiest way to deal with ex's, it has helped me a lot to realize why I have the boundaries and standards I set years ago. I was tired of going back and restarting the cycle so this is my way of keeping myself and my vulnerability/gullibility in check. Anyone have similar or better coping mechanisms?"
112,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,What about the thousands of other rapists out there besides Brock Turner?,0,4o74y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4o74y9/what_about_the_thousands_of_other_rapists_out/,2016-06-15 22:48:34,"This is not meant to incite anyone or cause controversy. But I genuinely cannot figure out why so many people are targeting Brock Turner who, while he committed a despicable act and should have received greater jail time, is one of literally thousands if not millions of men on this planet to commit a rape of a woman who is in an unconscious state. I see the fact it was behind a dumpster, and the woman's vulnerability, as being major factors. But I do not understand our culture. A man does something despicable and disgusting, and rather than focus our attention on the victim and thousands of other potential rapists and victims out there who need help, people gang up and focus on a story long in the past. We can blame and shun and ostracize him but it doesn't make the situation any better, except scaring other men away from doing this which is good. Still (and this is where I suspect any vitriol against this post may be released) I have forgiveness for him in a sense. His mugshot is plastered everywhere; his life will never be the same again. Neither will the victim's of course. It's just seems so strange, with so many other reported rapes on a deranged scale, society chose to focus on this one (I can understand how his background and Stanford reputation played a role as well). I think another part of me is upset because I was raped, during a time when I was intoxicated. In one instance three men tried to manipulate me into sex, and one succeeded even while I was saying no. Years later, at a friends house, I passed out on his couch only to wake up with a stranger groping and touching me. This is all true, not an exaggeration. There may have been more times. I had s drinking problem. I understand if people want to blame me. But I tell you, no one helped. I told my parents and they said it happens to so many people, I told a therapist and she said they were wrong but it's time to move on. Both true things, but there was an element reeking of victim blaming. I lived with this for many years. It hurts a lot, that no one cared. And I always thought it was true-that I was a slut and horrible person and drunk and deserved it. Until I saw the support for this woman. Maybe it's still true, but it helps. And still, I realize the importance of letting the hatred go. It hasn't served me. It doesn't serve us to plaster Turner's face everywhere for SO long, as it has happened, to publicly shame others into not dong it. We cannot use one person as the poster child for the immense wrongs that occur with rape-he is a human being after all. we must look at all of them, and acknowledge them at atrocities and dole out punishment The other important thing is that *there are so many of us*. It's time we remember this, share our stories, be there in an empathetic way if possible. We don't have to hide, or shame each other. Heck, after my rape, I didn't tell anyone if course out of shame, but the men spread rumors as some do, and told everyone I had sex with all of them, and everyone in the school found out and I was bullied. So on top of a confusing horrible time for a sensitive young girl, people ostracized and blamed me. ""Why did you let them do that?"" I will never forget those words uttered by one of the men. It wasn't even true, and yet no one will believe me. I'm sorry to make this about myself, and that it may sound conflicting in some regards. Maybe the answer is just much more complicated. And yet it's very painful. I hope anyone else reading this, who had experienced something similar, knows that it's not your fault and there are options and people who care. I do. I think it's time we try harder to develop more empathy and less blame for each other as a whole. "

I'm a little afraid to post this, as I think I will get a lot of judgement, but I've been having a lot of dark thoughts about being female and femininity, and I'm having trouble shaking them off. For one, I am only 23, but I'm having awful feelings about aging--not just fear of wrinkles, but what comes with it--loosing my cuteness and vulnerability, and how it will make me unlovable to my partner. I already look at pictures of myself a couple years back and feel like I looked much cuter (and this is with full awareness that it will get much worse). My last boyfriend was a sweet, supportive, pro-feminist guy who would tell me how sexy it was when I took on any kind of leadership role, but honestly, I could sense that my vulnerability and sweetness were what appealed to him sexually. Honestly, part of the reason I broke it off was because I felt like after graduating and beginning work full time, I was becoming ""tougher"" and sensed that I was loosing my appeal to him. I used to be proud of moments when I was able to be assertive, but lately I've been downplaying it, feeling like it makes me less feminine. I'm at a point in my life where I need to decide on a career direction, and as I'm researching careers, at the back of my mind I'm asking myself, will this job allow me to stay feminine and ""soft,"" or do I have to become hardened and assertive to succeed? There is a girl I work with--beautiful, Hispanic, always wears a long fishtail braid. She has such a sweet, soft demeanor; she looks so lovely and feminine even when she is just mopping the floor. When I speak with her, I get a glimpse of her through a man's eyes, and I feel like certainly, any man (even my good-hearted ex) would want her instead of me. She is vulnerable and feminine, worthy of love and protection, while I'm not. I know anyone reading this will think my thoughts and insecurities will make me a crazy jealous mess and I will ruin all my relationships because of it, but really, I have no interest in taking out my anger towards any man I'm with. I refuse to be angry at him for things he can't control. Really, I think there are plenty of men who will stay by their woman for life, and I think it's plausible that I will find one---but lately, I feel like it would be impossible for a man to be with me only, AND be truly satisfied, especially as time goes on. I really don't understand the urgency women feel to find a man before loosing your looks--if a man wouldn't want me after a certain age, why would I want to marry him in the first place? So he's stuck with me when he no longer wants me? I know I'm severely depressed so these thoughts aren't coming from the most sensible place (and honestly I'm appalled at how pathetic I sound now that I've written it down). But really, deep down, I feel like it's impossible to really be happy in life as a female. I'm afraid that nature made us insecure and miserable so that we would attach ourselves to a stronger male. How did I become this mouse of a woman? Can someone offer some thoughts to help me get a grip? "

Hear me out. For whatever it's worth. Approximately one year ago I broke up harshly via text message with a woman I was falling in love with after an argument we had in which she said some pretty hurtful things about my family.I never gave her the chance to air her side. She was upset and I understand why but this was a huge trigger for me. I hung up, sent her a harsh text saying ""we are over"" the next day. For the next six months, she was the villain in the narrative I had built in my mind. Six months later: I realized I made a terrible mistake, and that my unwillingness to embrace vulnerability was the source of failure in the relationship. Sent her a message on Whatsapp asking for forgiveness. Justifiably, she said she's moved on and blocked me. A couple months later: I dropped gift outside of her apartment door at night (spent hours in the kitchen cooking), with a hand written letter, thanking her for the time we were together again begging for forgiveness. I had someone let me in the building. This was stupid. Saw her on the subway a week later and she smiled awkwardly. So then I mailed her a letter apologizing for intruding on her space, explaining that I realize I should not have done that, promising that I these efforts would not escalate. Mailed a couple more letters, (2 over a three month period) again apologizing, insisting that I didn't want to harass her, that she had the right to ignore me...but I loved her and was 'not too proud to persist'. She eventually sent me a whatsapp message saying she feels harassed by my actions and to leave her alone. I have entirely. Except for the fact that I miss her insanely and want so badly to repair the damage I have done. I recognize that these ""acts of vulnerability"" are deeply gendered, and in some ways acts of attempting to excerpt ""power"" over this woman. I don't want to be that guy. Are there any online resource on how to do the type of healing that will help me stop? (Already looking into seeing a therapist). "

Externally, people call her an angel and she looks like one but she is so ugly on the inside. Also, apologies for wall of text. I'm a female (16) and she is 15. A bit of background information; We are a really fucked up family. We were born into a collection of fragmented shards. My father had a family prior to us, 4 children, 3 of which don't talk to me at all because they they think I 'stole' their father. He came together with Mum and together they had 4 more children. Prior to this is my Mum had another child. Altogether that's 9, with over half of them estranged from us for being born. Ok, moving onto my sister. I've tried to have civilized conversations with her about her behavior but she straight up denies that she has any imperfections. I've tried to find ways to stir reflective thoughts in her head, but her mind is like a steel beam and it deflects anything that might hurt her ego (which needs to be cushioned 24/7 by constant praise) She puts on this weird facade when she is with friends/anybody outside our immediate family and acts docile, subservient and agreeable when in reality she is a super manipulative person. She deliberately incites violence in anybody who annoys her, she has, on multiple occasions, turned to my younger sibling when she is mad at me and hangs out with them in order to instill a sense of jealousy. She does it in a really obvious fashion, but our younger sibling is too oblivious to notice the insincerity of her affections. She accentuates her laugh, become desperate/clingy to my younger sibling and she has this...side look..while doing so that is supposed to monitor my response. She put herself at the centre of the family, like the sun, and we all gravitate around her. If one of us 'planets' are unhappy then it doesn't really effect anybody else but if my sister is unhappy, she is hellbent on sharing that misery with everyone. I've always thought there was some sad, deprived child underneath her exterior personality but I was so wrong. She doesn't like unification. When me and my other siblings hang out she gets really angry, snappy about it and tries to turn us against each other or she tries to turn the shame to someone else. She has literally pushed us apart while walking on the pavement multiple times and forced herself into the middle. My Mum knows she is the instigator of most fights and she used to be on the receiving end of a lot of punishments, but it only made her grow colder and harder. If you guys want an example of her behavior, here is one. She really loves The Walking Dead and makes most of the family watch it with her, and if not she makes them feel extremely guilty, gets snappy and then treats them with silence. Once, our older sister turned up crying on our doorstep because she'd just received news that her friend was in a coma in hospital after a heart attack (at age 19 and this was in the same week where another one of her friends had died from a brain aneurysm) We all went to comfort her (except manipulative sister) because instead she complained about how nobody was watching The Walking Dead with her and got angry at my older sister and Mom. I started crying because it wasn't fair how my older sister had suffered through so much and the manipulative sister called me a over sensitive and dramatic and 'rabbit'. We have this thing where she calls me 'rabbit' because I'm born in the year of the rabbit. She pounces on any hint of emotion/vulnerability with this insult. I call her 'snake' in turn because she is, weirdly enough, born in the year of the snake. She also does this thing where when I try something new, for an example, clothes or hairstyles and she gives a little laugh or chuckle or smirk as if my appearance is wrong then when I ask whats wrong she makes up some lame excuse that she was just laughing at 'a memory or something' she knows I know the truth and she likes that. I've been playing her game daily. I'd do anything to keep her from getting the better of me, but sometimes I lose it. Today I hit her and I feel so ashamed that I did that. I hurt her. I try to do all I can to keep in her good graces. I refused a trip to Australia because she got mad when I was offered such. I've told Mum I feel suffocated by her behavior and she told me to just ignore her. Snake is so good at painting me as the enemy, maybe I am. I've done everything I can to try amend my wrongs, I'm constantly on the look for my own personal flaws, I try to stay outside human bias and try to give as much empathy as can but nothing is really coherent in my head because it all whirls around. I'm not sure who the bad person is? At the start I call her manipulative, but I wonder what I am from her perspective. What would she write in this text instead of me? I just need some outside sources, but even then, your only hearing it from one side of the story so I guess its inherently biased. Please, is she or am I? I lose control sometimes, I have very little restraint, I don't think things through as much as I should. "

118,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,My story of rage and sadness - how do you trust people after you've been dragged through the mud?,9,47nm21,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/47nm21/my_story_of_rage_and_sadness_how_do_you_trust/,2016-02-26 16:26:41,"(I've been a lurker for about 5 years, made this account just now for the sole purpose of this post. Not sure what I'm hoping for... Support? Advice?) So... Approximately 4 months ago my trust was betrayed by someone I considered a friend, let's call him M. Despite my very clear communication that I was not interested in having sex with him (""no"" multiple times), he proceeded to rape me. Obviously there is more to it than that - confusion, anxiety, darkness, accusation, denial, followed by a deep numbing emptiness - but that's the gist of the beginning of this. The morning after, the first person I called was a guy that had been a friend with benefits last summer, who we'll call W. I was more than confused... Somehow I felt fine? But I wasn't fine, my exterior was calm but inside I was like a hive of bees, humming and agitating into a deafening roar. (Humanities major. I try to understand myself with word pictures). But I was also just scared and dazed at how this could happen to me. W listened to me and took me to dinner a few days later. He helped me know what to say to M (""what you did was wrong, stay away from me. I have every right to contact the authorities.. Blah blah""). I thought W was really there for me. Then came the not so great choices. A week after I was raped, I started sleeping with W again, in spite of the cloud I was in and everything else that I was feeling. Something about saying yes to someone, or even given the option to say yes to someone, was intoxicating. I look back at my journal from that time and I genuinely thought I was making sound choices and that W cared about me and was there for me. But I was clearly in a pretty vulnerable spot to convince myself so easily of this in the aftermath of an all out betrayal. You can probably tell where this is going. A few weeks went by. I'm still kind of a mess at this point, but not really acknowledging it to myself. I was drinking more than usual and I ended up telling W I loved him... Which he quickly followed with ""I love you but I'm not in love with you."" I got very angry (irrational drunk angry, which is unfortunately my specialty) and sobbed and sobbed. When I sobered up and collected my thoughts the next day, I thought what he said was fairly reasonable. He's just a friend, this is casual right? After that little episode I didn't hear from him for several weeks. We talked on the phone in early January. He has texted me a few times saying hi and asking how I am. There was one infuriating weekend where he said we'd hang out but when I texted him at the appointed time he was all of a sudden busy. (He also made a joke about just wanting my ass, which I did not take well). After talking with a therapist I started to think more and more that maybe W took advantage of my vulnerability in the wake of the assault... Which in a way felt more painful to confront than the assault itself. At least with the rape I could chalk it up to ""M is a horrible person,"" but with W... He was the first person I told about the worst thing to ever happen to me! thought I could trust him. He told me today he's seeing someone new, and I feel... Betrayed all over again. I'm really upset. I don't think it's so much that he found someone new. I'm upset because I seem to be expendable to men. That's maybe overdramatic. I'm upset because I misunderstood him... I'm upset because I trusted him and he used that for sex and then dropped me...? I'm upset because he should have seen that I was out of control and stopped me? I'm not convinced that's a fair characterization, but regardless I feel doubly used. Anyway... I gave up alcohol for lent and am resolved to stay away from guys for a while. Trying to re-center a bit and deal with my emotions in healthier ways that don't involve heavy drinking or codependency. I just want to hear what others think about this mess. And any advice on moving forward. How do you trust anyone after you've been let down to such an extreme? Edit: W texted me today about something random and I let him know I had strong feelings on the way he had treated me over the past few months and that we shouldn't be in contact right now. He basically said ""okay, good luck"" (nicer than that) and ""just know that you deserve happiness and respect."" So, just like everything in life, it's not all bad, he's not all bad, he just is not a person I should be relying on for validation and emotional support. "
119,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Can we just agree that shaming of all varieties is bad?,0,487owy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/487owy/can_we_just_agree_that_shaming_of_all_varieties/,2016-02-29 12:46:35,"I'm writing this in response to the thread of similar name on the front page. The more I learn about shame, the more I feel compelled to talk about it. My hope is you find this in some way useful. Shame and the act of shaming isn't anything new but the research about it very much is. Shame researcher [Brene Brown](URL has written extensively about the cultural impact of shame, the way shame impacts men and women, and the way shame is positively correlated to a whole host of powerful negative behaviors. She goes so far as to call shame lethal. I'm certain we've all experienced shame. It's been used widely as a parenting technique, socialization tactic, and a even major tool in education. It's the major component behind bullying, suicidal ideation, and addiction. The net gain is isolation, highlighting our most basic sense of vulnerability and unworthiness. It drives a wedge between people that is ""sustained through silence, secrecy, and judgment.""([citation](URL It causes a lasting and permissive pain. Pain people can have a very difficult time letting go. When I examine the world around me, I can no longer see a world that is separated by anything but the inclusion of shame or the lack thereof (aka compassion). Body shaming. Gender shaming. Racial shaming. Parent shaming. Child free shaming. Economic status shaming. Work ethic shaming. Political shaming. Education shaming. Eating shaming. Fashion shaming. The list is as endless as it is exhausting. It boils down to this: Shaming is a lazy and highly effective way to tell others that they aren't good enough and they will never be good enough. It leaves a gaping wound in its wake that can't be filled without deliberate action. And it's no easy task. Brown has stated that the only antidote to shame is empathy. The antidote is letting the shamed know that he/she is not alone emotionally. The post that inspired this one is exactly what we need more of. And it takes a ton of courage to leave one's self so vulnerable. Thank you to that OP and thanks for reading. "

This may be a little all over the place, but I really just need to get these words down. Yesterday, a man in his car pulled up beside the bus shelter I was standing in. It was a minute or two before I even looked up to wonder why the car had been stopped there for so long, and it was at this point that I realized the man had his penis out, and was touching himself. I immediately left the bus stop and walked around the corner, at which point the man sped off in his car before I could even decide whether or not he had been driving a Toyota or a Mazda. I did not even see his face. I didnt call anyone. I didn't text anyone. I contemplated turning around and going back home. All day I tried to process what had happened. My parents urged me to go to the police station and file a report, but unfortunately the police said I didnt have enough information to do so. I kicked myself for being in too much shock to remember his license plate. Today, I am struggling with how I should feel. This man didnt get out of his car. He did not touch me, or hurt me, or make any attempt to do so. But I still feel violated. As I waited for the bus again today, at the same bus stop, I continuously checked around myself and worried about every black car that drove by. I feel like a victim, but at this same time I dont feel like I have the right to. There are so many girls who have experienced worse, and who will experience worse. And I am thankful he did not get out of his car. But that doesnt change the fact that I feel so incredibly vulnerable. It doesnt change the fact that now every time I walk down the street I will be that much more aware of my surroundings. It doesnt change the fact that now I am worried about all the young girls who attend the elementary schools in my area. It is so easy to believe outside of a situation like this that if it were to happen, it wouldnt bother you that much. The people around me don't make me feel like I have the right to feel vulnerable. After all, he didnt actually do anything to me physically. He just took my ignorant sense of safety and sped off with it. I cannot stop thinking. I cannot stop trying to come up with explanations for something that was not my fault. I cannot stop thinking about how because I am a woman I will always feel some level of vulnerability. But worst of all I cannot stop thinking about how I wont be able to forgive myself if something happens to someone else because I didnt think to remember his licence plate. I curse him silently for somehow making me believe that it is my responsibility to save others from his pathetic existence. Thank you for reading. Thank you for any advice on how to sort out these feelings. TL;DR: Man waved his penis at me, didn't actually touch me, but I still feel scared and vulnerable, and am struggling to convince myself otherwise. "

Her bf has known my family for years, but since they started dating things have changed. Things started off well, she was happy with the relationship, and our siblings and parents got along with him. Recently, though, we have noticed some things that seem like red flags to us. He has started to be more detracting of both her and the rest of the family. He also has started to talk loudly and publicly more and more about their sexual life. When i say that, i mean VERY explicit references to their sex life around not just her friends but family as well. This alone is insensitive, but there are other flags too. He may be using her phone to either manufacture responses to texts she's received and/or deleting messages. He also constantly calls and texts her when she isn't immediately near him. We have seen bruises and marks on her as well. His mother recently passed, and while I may be reading into things the wrong way, it seems that he's been using this as an excuse to justify some of his changing behavior. I have to mention this, though; our mother and father divorced when my sister and I were very young. I don't think she ever really recovered from that. I'm really scared that her current bf is taking advantage of some latent vulnerability. Just yesterday she had a confrontation with our mother about the relationship, and it ended in tears. Personally, I'm into BDSM, so I understand how important consent and communication is. What I'm really scared of is that my sister has met someone who is manipulating her into alienating her from her family so that he can abuse her physically and emotionally. If anyone in this sub can help, please do. I have no idea how to help my sister."

I reported it the next day. 4 months later the detective talks to another detective who had talked to me about a completely unrelated incident more than a year earlier. My statements about different events are different obviously so therefore she closes the rape investigation.** Since I posted about a month ago, I have left sent several emails and left voicemails for the detective, explaining that I didn't speak with that other detective about this case. I have also, thanks to the amazing detective work of a user I met through my original post, actually found my rapist's facebook page (using information from his OK Cupid profile that the police have had since August) and with it, his full name. Through that, another friend was able to track down two phone numbers and two addresses associated with him. I forwarded all this information to the police more than a week ago. Then two days ago I emailed saying that I hadn't heard from them, but we have this information so we could make another attempt at calling. I said he may have raped someone else while we have been wasting time. And that at the very least, she has to return my belongings. In response, she wrote to me this morning: ""Good morning. I received a couple of emails from you shortly after I responded to your last email, so it looks like you might not have seen the last email that I sent. In short, we are no longer investigating this because based on your statements, his actions did not rise to the level of being criminal. If you have any further questions about this, Id be happy to discuss it further. My contact information is below."" The feelings of fury and shame and vulnerability and helplessness this brings up, it's hard to really put into words. I regret ever reporting because now I am even more vulnerable because now I know the police are not on my side. The only person she really investigated was me."

Sorry if this seems jumbled, I'm a bit of a mess right now. I originally posted this on /r/relationships and they removed it, so I'm posting here. **Background** I have always been closer with my eldest male cousin, we'll call Dalton[22]. Dalton and I were always close as children, we would go exploring at our grandparents large farm, go fishing, he would tell me funny stories and we would bond over little kid stuff. Now that we have gotten older, we became close friends. Inseparable- some would call us, until these past few months where we have drifted apart for unrelated reasons. My younger cousin, Derek [20] and I were never particularly close. In fact, I don't think I have spoken to him in the past two years. There has always been tension in my mother's side of the family. My grandmother was always verbally and emotionally abusive to my mother as a child, and treated my Aunt, (mom's sister) like a princess. As a result of this, my mom is pretty fucked up as a person. Most of the time I would consider her to be a semi-normal mother, but a lot of the time she can be a bully who uses me as a punching bag for her emotional issues. My father usually enables this kind of behavior. Not only is my mother fucked up, but due to my grandmother being abusive to her, relations with my mother's side of the family is typically very rocky. Growing up there were spells where we would not speak to my Aunt and my cousins, along with my grandmother. Due to some nasty comments my grandmother made about me recently, we are on speaking terms with Dalton, Derek, and my Aunt, but not with my grandmother. **The Assault** Today, I was scrolling through my newsfeed on facebook and saw an article posted on Huffington Post Women that talked about rape. I clicked on it and began reading. I guess something about the article triggered some repressed memories I had from when I was a very small child, because one particular memory came flooding back. I was laying on my stomach. I was a small child, under 7 maybe? I'm not exactly sure. They pulled down my pants and anally penetrated me with something. I remember screaming to be let go. They didn't let me go. I think Derek was holding me down and Dalton was sodomizing me. That is all I really remember. When the memory came back, I immediately started dying laughing. I was in hysterics. I guess I didn't know how to process the information so my natural reaction was to laugh. I took a shower, I felt/feel dirty. Used. Like I have this tag attached to my arm that says ""Damaged"". Not only physically, but emotionally. I texted my best friend who has consistently stood by me through the shit storm that is my life. We freaked out together, at least I wasn't alone. I see a therapist semi-regularly and made an appointment with her on Wednesday. I haven't told my parents. I am an extremely private person, and my best friend is the only person I tend to confide in, or show any vulnerability or weakness towards. I think I need to speak with my therapist to process what is happening before I tell anyone else. To be frank, I am genuinely scared that when I tell my parents that my dad will kill Dalton and Derek. Not figuratively, literally. My dad has said before that if anyone ever violated me in that way that he would kill them. My dad is not a traditionally violent man, he's educated, and works an office job. I need my dad. Not only to be around through this, but to be a buffer from my mother. He is one of my biggest supporters, but can also be very much of a ""macho man"". I don't want him to be in prison. That would kill me even more. How do I go about delivering this news to my parents? On top of this, I am not emotionally prepared for the blowout fight and rift that will occur when my mother confronts my Aunt and Grandmother with this information. Part of me is still in denial. I keep telling myself that I am overreacting, or making it up, or even that I liked it and asked them to do it. I keep alternating between hysterically laughing and trembling with fear. There are times when I feel extremely unattached from the situation, right now is one of those times. I'm writing this and feel strangely calm. Like I'm writing a short story about events that never happened. Except they did happen, and I am left to pick up the pieces. What the fuck do I do? Do I contact RAINN? Do I laugh? Do I cry? Do I tell my parents immediately? I have class in the morning, I'm dual enrolled at the community college but I don't think I have the strength to go. I consistently feel like I'm about to throw up. Please help me. I know this whole post is a mess, but so am I right now. **tl;dr**: Repressed memories of cousins sodomizing me came back. I'm unable to process and scared shitless. Help."
125,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Really Conflicted About Having Another Baby,0,3pp9fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3pp9fc/really_conflicted_about_having_another_baby/,2015-10-22 10:29:02,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this but I'm guessing so based on what I've read? So, here's the deal. I've been married almost 7 years to my husband. We initially did not want any children. About 1.5 years into our marriage we accidentally got pregnant and had a little girl. We decided we didn't want to have an only child and so had another girl 16 months later, so they are very close in age. A few months later I was feeling like I really wanted another, but we didn't because 1) My husband was VERY against it - we were in a bad place in our marriage, I'm a terrible beast when I'm pregnant, he was happy with just two and 2) I didn't push it because I thought it might be just the hormones pushing me to have more. Also I had really really wanted a boy both times and ended up with 2 girls, he comes from a family of 4 sisters and is sure that we will never have one, doesn't want to keep trying. He has said many times the only reason I want more is to try for a boy. I've said in the past I really didn't want 3 girls either. Fast forward 3 years later, we have a 4.5 year old and a 3 year old. My husband is happy where we are in life. We are looking to move to another job in the next year - hopefully - because he's a farmer with terrible hours and is basically non-existent to us from May-October. We aren't rich but are financially stable, but we do have $140K in student loan debt we are slowly paying off. I know money is a stress for him but we always agreed it wouldn't affect our choices regarding having kids. For the last 3 years, I've been wanting another baby. Thinking about it, all the time, to the point now when people tell me they are pregnant I cry. But at this point I'm so confused still - we never wanted kids, and I look towards the future we wanted and what we have now - we love our kids to pieces - but we are also excited for when they move out and we sort of pick up the piece of our old dreams from when we were newlyweds. Obviously the sooner we are done with kids the sooner this can happen. I don't want a kid that my husband didn't want. I'm not 100% sure that this isn't still hormones. Also, over half the time I feel like a crappy parent for losing my temper or doing something wrong with parenting, and I think, I can barely handle these two, how on earth could I do another? Do I really want more? So then I second guess myself...until I think about having another. Some days I so badly want a bigger family. My husband used to tell me that I just wanted another baby, not another child, and so he had me second guessing that as well. We've also talked about adoption - which I would love to do - but it's not the same as having your own baby and I don't want to adopt babies, I would rather adopt older children who won't be looked at. So...I'm not really even sure what to ask. I just have no one to talk to. My husband already knows how I feel - he knows I have wanted another, he knows I feel conflicted about it, he knows I cry about it. Talking to him until I could either A) say I'm done or B) present a convincing argument to have another is pretty pointless. My mother knew I wanted another but he didn't and now she has a problem with him - she's a divorced man hater - and tells me that I ought to trick him or do whatever I can to guilt him into it - so she's not a help. All my friends are having babies or older and done or single...and there's not really anyone I feel comfortable talking to about this honestly, because hi, I have a problem with vulnerability :-p Is this normal? Is this a baby fever that I'll slowly get over? The fact that I couldn't 100% guarantee that this isn't a faze makes me unable to really push the issue. The fact I've been thinking about it - that hearing about other people getting this makes me sob - makes me KNOW that I'm not over it. I don't want to wait 10 years and then regret not having more. I don't see how we could really regret having another, even if it changes everything (and it will, we've been out of diapers for almost a year, our girls are growing and active and we plan to homeschool them, so an infant will really change the dynamic of the family). Is it fair to our two older girls who will have a lot put on hold because of a newborn? Will I feel obligated to have another so that child will have an age appropriate playmate? Because 4 is pretty much off the table, even I said I never wanted to have to buy a new car... I just need someone to hear me :-( tl;dr I want another baby (95%) Husband does not, I don't know what to do. Or how to get over it. Edit: Thanks everyone. I want to be clear that under no circumstances am I interested in forcing him to have another, tricking him into having another, etc. The whole reason it's been 3 years is because in this time he's been reluctant and I've told him that unless his mind changes, we wouldn't have another. But we have a really great relationship now and he's also always wanting to give me what I want, so the door to another baby isn't closed, just awkward and confusing. It would be easy if he really wanted one, but since he doesn't have the desire(he says he isn't opposed but is just happy with what he has right now) then I would have to come begging for him to think and change his mind. Also, a big hang up for him is he had a really terrible childhood, he's constantly worried that he will be like the parents he had instead of the great dad he actually is, and also he has a younger sister with hydrocephalus and a seizure disorder, and he feels like having another kid is temping fate since we have two healthy ones. Also - thanks for the financial concerns but we are in a solid place there and that just doesn't come into play with us and children, and its not a factor for him either way. So telling me to give up having more kids because you don't think we can afford them isn't an argument I'll consider. "

I asked the women on the sister sub but I would like all possible views too please when I was 18, I was drugged by my then boyfriend and woke up the next morning in his bed with him and three of his friends covered in bruises , some blood and their 'bodily fluid'. what had happened is pretty obvious ha. I dont actually have any memory of the event just of the next morning and the chaos that resulted. now its been almost six years and I feel like I have transformed as a person...iI broke away and studied and travelled in europe and made some incredible lifelong friends and learned to heal and love myself and had some amazing CONSENSUAL encounters with sexy europeans. its been a rollercoaster. for the past two years ive settled in a city with my best friend who I actually met the night before I was attacked. we kept in touch over the years and I actually moved to his city to continue my study. its been amazing and ive met the best people and made some incredible friends. I do suffer from depression and flashbacks but im therapy amd medicated up , ive lost tons of weight and transformed myself into something im proud of. Now, my best friend has a friend in his social circle , we'll call him jack. A guy who literally looks like he came out of an abercrombie and fitch mag but also the most down to earth , genuinely good, kind, nicest, funniest person ive ever met. We've become incredibly good friends - our chemistry was instant , that sort of magnetic tension that other people notice and always point out and encourage y'know. Nothings ever happened between us and we've never acknowledged our feelings towards another and pushed only a friendship but lately there have been so many moments where lines could be obliterated. the looks, the flirting, the banter , the slight touches all seem to mean something deeper and not just friendly or cheeky. you know when you get the drop in the pit of your stomach and just crazy butterflies? like that CONSTANTLY. my best friend told me once that whenever me and jack are in the same room...its safe to say everyone else becomes background noise and we look as if we're seconds away from ripping each others clothes off even in a perfectly innocent interaction. safe to say im flipping terrified..I have no idea how to relationship or escalate something like that. one night stands and casual hookups are a doddle but actual vulnerability and trust and love are things I never even thought I could let in. he knows nothing of my past but has always pointed out that he notices I keep such a guard up even when im happy and full of joy and it makes him sad and hurt to see me push him away from getting too close at times etc. I want to tell him but how? .im so afraid that he will run a mile or be completely turned off. I also feel so inadequate..i mean im in great shape and quite conventionally attractiveish ( too arrogant I know lol) and smart and whatever but ive issues out the fucking wazoo. I cant help feeling im not good enough for a guy who has every type of woman throwing themselves at him constantly ..normal women who quite happily give me that look that just screams 'he will always choose me over someone like you' .i cant compete with that at all. I dont know how I would ever be confident enough. Any advice on how to approach this?. would this sort of baggage be too much for you guys to hypothetically deal with? and what do I even do or say urgh!"

Now I get that in a crowded city this can be mere coincidence that someone is going the same direction as you often for blocks at a time, but what I'm talking about has been much more deliberate, and on quiet nights when very few or even no one else is around. I'm tall (6'4"") and have pretty decent luck with the ladies, but I don't think that is what this is about. I can't even tell you how many times a girl traveling a much different pace all of a sudden tails me from about 10 feet for blocks at a time. I've had more than a few male friends tell me I can be quite intimidating from a physical standpoint, but a lot of females have also told me they like me around because ""I feel safe"" so I don't know what to think as far as that goes. I guess what I'm getting at is do any city girls ever find an otherwise random guy at night to walk near for safety reasons? I thought about this the last time I felt like it was happening (last night walking home from the grocery store) and it was really, kind of sad. I mean I get it, I'm a tall fit guy and feel threatened more often than I'd like wandering around this city at night, I can't imagine the vulnerability a petite girl may feel trying to walk alone. TL;DR: I've noticed since moving to the city, as a tall male I seem to get followed at near distances by girls walking alone at night. Do any of you ever do this for a sense of safety or am I just overthinking this?"

Her post was taken down before I could comment, and I know not if was a personal choice or otherwise but I would like to offer empathy/compassion to her in any case. This is what I would have liked to comment on your post : This was well written and heart felt and sincere. I know words are just that, words but the intention here is true, You are not alone, someone out in the world cares for you and at this moment I care for you. You are so very correct in that I do not know you well, but the character you have presented is what I have compassion for in this moment. My heart goes out to you. To specifics, I know a feeling, perhaps similar to yours, perhaps not, of when you just want that moments respite to collect yourself and they just won't stop hounding and everything can be held back if we only had just a moment to breath but... that moment never comes and there is... a scene. It happens. I know the feeling of not wanting them to see so bad it hurts but sometimes they do. When they do I console myself with the knowledge that life goes on. It just keeps going and I am able to lose myself in the larger picture. My 'pettyness' will be forgotten in 50 years, 20 years, a few months, a week. It will not matter in the larger course and I will not give such 'scenes' value/worth/importance/control over me. They are 'happened', they are done and they are past. The past does not exist in a physical place that you and I can travel to and we cannot let such 'petty' things rule us. To the subject of your bf, there are many things/angles to view an event/thing from. Perspective plays such an important role in determining anything. I think you are correct in saying he loves the mask, its hard even for me to admit to myself that somehow we must let others get a glance at what lies beneath. Maybe he was hurt that you would turn to your more established support systems over him, that seems a natural prideful response. It doesn't make sense but it happens. There are all different kinds of calibre of people. Was what he did unforgivable? Perhaps... perhaps it shows his character in the face of sudden adversity, perhaps it shows his innate reaction to unforeseen and not easily fixed situations, perhaps it just shows that not everyone knows that sometimes the best thing that can be done for a fellow individual during a difficult time is to merely be there. Not saying or doing anything. I hope I can offer, at least in a mental sense, that for you. I'll leave you with this, Thank you. Thank you for demonstrating to me the true value of strength/vulnerablity. To have all this happen and then to have you so eloquently be able to express it is the height of it. You've enlightened me on the importance and trust present when people open up to each other. That is a lesson beyond value, truly thank you. From one heart to another, from me to you. PS. I almost missed it, there is no guilt in asking for help. There are merely goals and tools available to reach those goals. That brass ring we reach for, each in our own way, we shall grasp it! "
129,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,I got into a creepy guy's car; luckily I got out again,0,3c88i8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3c88i8/i_got_into_a_creepy_guys_car_luckily_i_got_out/,2015-07-06 06:42:01,"I was just reading another 2X story about a girl who was (maybe?) nearly abducted, and I thought I'd share my own story. This happened just less than 3 years ago now, when I was 19. I had a job interview, and the office happened to be quite close to the airport. There was no public transport to the area, and it was a long way to walk. I got a taxi to the interview, and that went fine. The problem was getting home. Since this direction was away from the airport, no taxis were available to pick me up. All the taxis going in the right direction were full, and no taxi came to pick me up even after I called the company to send someone. At this point I was worried, and I'm sure it showed on my face. Eventually, a guy in a silver car pulled up beside me. He looked about 50-something. As soon as I saw him, I felt creeped out. I didn't like the look of him at all. He rolled down the window and said ""Are you going to the city, baby? Let me give you a ride."" I knew it was a bad idea to get in this guy's car. Everything seemed wrong. I just knew it was wrong. But somehow...I thought it was rude to refuse? That added onto the fact that I could see no alternative on the horizon for getting home. My feet were already sore and starting to blister from the heels I'd worn to the interview. My parents always said to never walk barefoot on the sidewalk, because you could get a needle in your foot. All these thoughts were running through my head as I opened the door and got into this guy's car. As soon as I sat down and put the seatbelt on, I realized what I'd done. My brain kind of went...""Holyyy shit. What the fuck did you just do. You got in a car with a creepy guy. This is the shit your parents told you to never, ever do."" At that point, I decided there was only one thing to do: get the fuck out of that car. I made up my mind that that was the most important thing, and I wouldn't let anything get in the way of it. The guy had an open can of beer in the cup holder next to him, and asked me if I wanted a beer. I said, ""no thank you"". Then he asked me if I was even old enough to drink. I told him I was 19. The drinking age in this country is 18. I silently cursed myself for not saying I was 17. That might have been a more strategic move. He offered me the beer again, and I said ""no thank you"". Then he asked me why I was where I was, I told him about the job interview and then started talking about my boyfriend. I don't know why I thought that would work, but I was trying things. He told me he'd never driven so slowly in his life, because he wanted to spend time with me. I didn't look at him, I kept my eyes out of the windows, looking for landmarks. I think the critical thing was that I knew the area fairly well. It was a long way to walk from my house, but I kept my eyes focused on the road and things outside, and after a very short while of driving, the guy passed by landmarks that I knew. That was my 'eureka' moment. I told him ""I know exactly where I am"". I made up my mind then and there, that I was going to give him very specific directions, and if he didn't follow the directions, I was going to open the car door and start screaming. Luckily, it was the middle of the day, and there were plenty of people around to see me if it came to that. I told him ""I know exactly where I am"" a few times. I was trying to get across my message: drive me anywhere other than where I expect to go, and I'll know it. Then, the guy asked me if I wanted to stop and get coffee with him. He said he wanted to do it in a public place, so I wouldn't get ""the wrong idea"". I told him that my dad would be expecting me home. That was a lie, but it seemed to work pretty well. The guy said ""It'll only take 5 minutes"", and I said ""well, he's expecting me home *really soon*."" I think at that point the guy realized he wasn't going to be driving me anywhere other than home. So instead, I guess he wanted to get what he could out of me. So he asked me if he could hold my hand. I didn't want to, but I said ""Uhh..ok"". I figured I wanted things to go smoothly. I don't know. It creeped me out, but I held his hand. He started massaging my hand. I felt so gross. At this point we were only a minute or so away from my home. He let go of my hand and touched my thigh. I guess my reaction deterred him because he took it away a second later. I told him where to turn, and he pulled up in my street. He asked me if he could kiss me. I smiled, trying to keep up appearances I guess, but I said ""no"" firmly, and told him my dad would be waiting for me. He said ""well he won't be looking out the window, will he? How about just one little kiss?"" I said ""no"" again, and stepped out of the car. I thanked him for driving me and then I ran to my door as fast as I could in those heels. I thought about taking down his license plate...I thought of that even as I was running, but I decided that getting to my house was more important. I got home and called my boyfriend (we're married now). I was shaking and I told him what happened. He was very concerned, and said I was lucky I didn't get raped and murdered. I guess it was lucky. I think the main thing I learned is that predators aren't going to target you when you can easily say no. They look for people who are vulnerable. This guy saw me in my heels on the side of the road, looking a little bewildered, and he saw an opportunity. I guess my advice would be to try and be aware of when you're vulnerable, since you can't always avoid being in that position. Being aware of your vulnerability might help you to say no. Carry comfortable shoes with you. Mobility is important, it keeps you independent, and therefore less vulnerable. Under the circumstances, it would have been better for me to walk the hour home barefoot. When you have options, you are less vulnerable, and I should have let myself take that option. Dad was always very insistent about the not walking around with shoes off thing, but I'm sure he would prefer that to me getting in the car with a strange guy. If he knew that this happened. I've never told my parents."
130,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,A woman in my country published an open letter to her rapist. It's heartbreaking and touching.,1,356w89,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/356w89/a_woman_in_my_country_published_an_open_letter_to/,2015-05-08 02:35:15,"It's in Spanish but I translated it. She was raped in a taxi and has been getting backlash by some because she was drunk, alone and had no money (she had given her purse to a friend). Trigger warning. &gt; I write this because otherwise I won't be able to study tonight, or sleep, or think, or breathe well. I don't really know who I write to or in what purpose, but I assume that everyone will take the hint. &gt; I'm 20 years old and have some emotional, school-related and familial failures under my belt. I also have dreams and hobbies, falls and friendly hands that help me get up. And today, or rather from Saturday, April 18th, at a set time, on a particular place, I have under my belt, in this chapter of my life, a rape. &gt; And I want to tell you what that means. &gt; It's about an act, a sexual act against my will. It's about how my intuition failed and I was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong person. It's about a mistake I made. &gt; I got into a taxi, I agreed to get into a car because the person driving that car offered to take me home, that I didn't have the keys of because I trusted and thought the wrong person was my friend. And I, in a moment of vulnerability, got in. &gt; I want to tell you why. &gt; I got in, firstly because it was a premium taxi. That same taxi that parents and uncles/aunts tell us to take because they're safer. That's where I made my first mistake. &gt; Because rapists aren't only in dark alleys waiting to attack, or on the train tracks. They are in offices, in coffee shops, in families, in parks, and in taxis, it seems, too. &gt; My second mistake was having lost consciousness. So yeah, I made two mistakes. But I want to talk to you about the other person that was with me inside that car, my rapist. About him, that, unlike me that I made two mistakes, committed a crime: rape. &gt; Who am I not, nor I want to be? &gt; I didn't come into this world to be mediocre. So I don't want to be. I don't want to say that this beast ruined my life because I own up to my mistakes, but can't own up to the crime he committed. And the entirety of my life can't be reduced to having been raped by a guy who, by the way, not only is fugitive but also free. For me, freedom is the most precious thing we have and he doesn't deserve it. &gt; Every time he raped me against my will, he dirtied, stomped, insulted and betrayed that freedom. I don't want this rapist free, I want him deprived of his freedom, locked and harrassed, like I was that morning inside that car. &gt; I deserve to be free and dreaming again. I deserve to feel nice things again, and not this poison I have inside me. I deserve to go back to laughing heartily, and to cry only for things that should be cried for. I deserve to have a family and friends who can count on me. And if that is too much to ask, then, at least I deserve to be able to eat, sleep and study. I deserve to be able to trust in somebody again. Because when you get raped, time becomes dense and waiting is horrible. &gt; I want life to stop hurting. I want being awake to be a desire and not a torture. I want sleep to be resting and dreaming about nice stuff, no more nightmares with the face of this animal (sorry to animals). &gt; I want my mom to be able to smile without pain. I don't want people to pity me. I want people to want justice. &gt; I may never be able to forget that eternity in which I was forced to the hell of having to listen to his breathing and arousal while he raped me. Or his face of pleasure in front of mine of fright. I may never forget his face or his voice. But neither will I ever forget what I deserve or who I am, and someday it will hurt less. And the life I had before April 18th (that now seems like an utopia) will someday be mine again. &gt; I swore to myself that I won't give up until justice is made. &gt; Manuela &gt; PS: Nobody will ever make me believe that I was, am or will be guilty of having been raped.

Today is mother's day here in the UK. I'm from Canada but I live here now; most of you probably know that in North America mother's day is in May. I now get two days a year where I can think about not having a mom. A little information is needed to understand this post-I am a 26 year old girl from Canada who is now living in the UK. I grew up with abusive families, half of which I don't speak to anymore. That includes my mother and her husband. Without getting into specifics, I can tell you that being NC (no contact) with my mom is the best and hardest decision I've ever made. I was raised by narcissists (shout out to that extremely eye opening and helpful sub) and have managed to come out the other side alive. This post isn't about whether or not I should speak to her again. I should not and will not. I am happy with this. I started dating my ex boyfriend a little over 4 years ago. We dated for a few years and decided to move the the UK. I wanted to stay, forever, and he couldn't stand to be here even for 4 months. He wasn't happy and it showed. Clearly it wasn't going to work out no matter how much we loved each other, and we did. We both moved with different expectations but neither of us properly communicated what we really thought. I was scared I was going to love it here so much that I wouldn't want to move back and that's exactly what happened. He only moved here to appease me for 2 years so we could move back to Canada and start a family (something I'm doubtful I even want). Besides this complete breakdown in communication, we had an amazing relationship. One of the most fulfilling friendships I've ever had and certainly one that taught me how to love deeply and with vulnerability. The best part was that I was a part of his family. He invited me in and I felt like one of them. This is where his mom comes in. I'll call her Theresa. So, Theresa is a nurse, as was her mom. They are both extremely good at taking care of people. I spent a lot of time getting to know Theresa, asking her about her childhood, hanging out with her friends, her family, her parents, etc. I felt a bond that was beyond just a mother-in-law type of situation. She was one of my best friends. I would choose her every single time if I had the choice. She is truly an angel. I don't say that because I think she's perfect. She has flaws, of course, but she exercises compassion and good judgment so often that you rarely see them. She didn't tell me who to be or how you should be-she showed me. She was the kind of person that made you want to be a better person. She was always looking out for others. She was always concerned with making sure people were comfortable in EVERY sense of the word. She'd start conversations between two people who didn't know each other. She'd fix a drink or a snack or get a blanket if she thought you looked cold. She knows what you need before you even realize what it is you need. Needless to say, she's amazing. I shared a lot with her that I haven't felt comfortable sharing with people before. She was the first woman and only woman in my life who I felt deserved the title of Mom. She was there for me in a way that nobody else was. I believe that she loved me unconditionally. She was so bright and funny and intelligent and sunny and beautiful. She's so beautiful and has the most amazing eyes. Just one look from her and I'd feel like everything would be okay. I never really thought I'd experience love like that. I think I could argue that I never will again. Like what are the odds I'll actually find a one true love again like I did with my ex? And then have him have a family as amazing as my ex's was? It feels impossible. I always felt like I was the odd man out because his family is so wonderful and supportive and loving and mine is so fragmented and broken and abusive. My dad has a wife that likes me when she's sober but as soon as she starts drinking tells me I dress too slutty or I flirt with everyone too much or I wear too much makeup or I'm an arrogant know-it-all. I'll never have that relationship with her as long as she has a relationship with alcohol. Even then, it's hard to forget words and actions that she's said and done. I don't really know what I'm saying or what I'm asking for or if anyone has ideas. I've read a lot about ambiguous loss. My best friend died at 18 and it was sudden and unexpected. I think about Theresa so often. I think about all the things she's said to me. I think about the strength she has herself and the strength she gives to others. She continues to inspire me to be a better person. I will always carry a part of her with me. It doesn't feel fair. It was so hard breaking up with my ex, but I broke up with an entire family. His whole family treated me like one of their own. I feel like a foster kid who was given to a perfect loving family just to be yanked away 3 years later. My one true passion in life is traveling. I wish it was what my ex wanted. I thought it was. I think he thought it was too, until we did it. You never know how you're going to react to something so please don't mistake it as anger at him. Traveling can be so hard to do from Canada, and with only 10 vacation days per year vs the UK's 28. It makes sense for me to travel from here. Also, I feel at home here in the UK. The only place I ever felt at home in Canada was at Theresa's house. I have pictures of it that I keep in my room. However, I can't explain the magnetic force that keeps me in the UK but I just love it here. I feel like I belong. I've felt like I've belonged since the first time I visited 5 years ago. I wish it was what he wanted too. When I grew up, I didn't feel at home in Canada. I never thought I'd get a chance to move away and here I am. I grew up extremely poor where most people lacked ambition beyond having children at an early age with many partners without seeking any fulfillment from anything besides from an SO. I'm not saying that's always wrong, I'm saying that's not for me. That's not the life I've ever wanted. I don't know if it's better to have loved and lost. Sometimes I don't think I'm meant to have unconditional love. My best friend and I have fought and gone months without speaking. My sister is the same story. Everyone in my family has abandoned me at some point. I don't know if I believe that anyone will love me unconditionally. I know I believed for years that my ex and Theresa would (and their family). I know I have some issues, and I guess I know it's not healthy to think that nothing is permanent. But I have yet to see permanent love when it comes to me. Theresa and her husband's marriage is one that I'd kill to have. They're one of the few couples I've ever seen that make me understand unconditional love. I thought my ex and I had it. I think I've said enough. I could go on for ages about her. I guess all I can do is try to be half the woman she is. She continues to be a part of my life even though we don't speak. I will always hold a spot in my heart for her. She taught me how to love and let love in. She made me feel worthy of love. And I don't know what to do without her. **TL;DR**I'm 26 years old and I feel fucking pathetic for crying about not having a mother. I had one for three years and now she's gone. No idea what to do or what I'm trying to say. I guess it's kind of pointless. Happy mother's day to all you moms out there who are truly there for your kids, whether biological or not. "
132,vulnerability,TwoXChromosomes,Trigger warning- Thinking of writing a book about an experience with abuse,0,30v5mg,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/30v5mg/trigger_warning_thinking_of_writing_a_book_about/,2015-03-31 10:29:05,"As the title states, I have been considering writing a book about sex abuse I endured as a child. First and foremost, this abuse was at the hands of a 13-15 year old male relative. The reason it stopped was because my Father caught him in the act and immediately put us both in intensive therapy and removed any possibility it could ever happen again. With that being said, there are several issues I'm struggling with though: 1. The vulnerability I have to be willing to endure to put myself out there with the detail of this 2. Other than my parents, I don't think anyone else in the family knows it happened... so if I use my true identity and the book sells, I could open the family up to exposure. 3. Potential that this person could pursue me legally if I let his identity out there... although it's true and there is record of it so-to-speak, part of me thinks I'd use pseudonyms but the other part of me is like, ""Why would I protect him?"" Overall, I've struggled with the after-effects of this abuse since I was 9 and I'm 31. I feel like it is complete bullshit that I've been kept to suffer in silence with it... although no one ever told me not to say anything to anyone else in the family, I've worn it like a scarlet letter. That if anyone knew they would judge me. It recently occurred to me that perhaps by owning this story as my own and getting this story out that it would help remove some of the self shame after effects. Further and most importantly, if there's any other women who experienced a similar occurrence, I want them to read my story and realize they're not alone and they too have a voice. Anyhow, I'd like to know your thoughts on this... just any constructive feedback would be great and thanks in advance."

See you in March. I always thought that if I were to write a book, I would call it Arguing With Adults; and here I find myself in such a strange place -- arguing with myself. I fought my whole childhood against the immorality, the hypocrisy, the lack of compassion within the adults surrounding me. Now, I see them as my peers. Some are better than others and Ive found it unimportant to argue against them anymore. The fight worth having is the argument for whats within me. At my core, I desire nothing more than to give love, to shine with compassion, and to always be progressing. There are truths and there are falsehoods, and mostly its left to perspectives, some things are notably more harmful than others and other things are recognizably good. Ive found no trouble thus far in finding and fighting for whats good. I will never please everyone, nor will everyone please me; so, Ive agreed with myself to try my best to progress, love, understand, and carry myself as well as I can, because at the end of the day if I can lie down and think I did the best I could to be good, thats the only thing that matters: was it a good fight? ... Dinner. Guaponandi, come meet us at the Whiskey Bar. Ok, Ill be there. Salutations exchanged, and I find myself feeling confused. Ready to leave, yet not at all. We go to the Rock, we talk. I leave. The girl who is my friend, who he is staying with is angry I think. Ive had a really tough month -- so much pain -- I feel like Im breaking. Chris, be there, help heal me, help me with my pain. I need help. I cant keep up this facade, this charade, this pain is beginning to overflow: how can I seal the cracks, fix the break, what can I do but look out, helpless, drowning? God, it hurts. The hippo is winning the physical fight today. Bye, Chris. Guaponandi, youre looking for help in the wrong places. You need to shift your path -- let go of the familiar old ways; they no longer serve you well. Testing your toes in the waters of the unfamiliar will be scary, but it can only be better. Remember? Youre progressing. Guaponandi, bring Po! says the the girl, my friend. Sniffles: Ok, Ill be there. I let the pain flow out: it hurts, Im frustrated, Im frightened, my eyes are puffy and my skin -- its like Ive been burned. Thats okay, Po loves the girl's dog; he will have fun, and I dont think I want to be alone with this. I need help. The girl goes for James and coke. Its just him and me. I express. He judges, then stops. Im reluctant. But, thats old, thats how Ive been doing it: keep it in, keep up that facade, Guaponandi, be okay. No, Im not feeling okay. Express. Face gets worse. Panic. Help? What is this? Where is it coming from? No, no its not normal at all. He puts his hand on my hip, and I wonder why, yet I know its fated and has been for a long time.Be sneaky -- dont let the girl know, she likes him -- thats bad, Guaponandi, very bad, not considerate of her, but considerate of yourself. Selfishness or self-care? Maybe both. Here, give me your number, if you want to, you dont have to. Did I want that hug? No, not around the girl. Ask for raincheck. Yes, hug, yes tea, yes dinner, yes Im free. Lots of deals. Breakfast. Do you want breakfast with me? Raincheck. Breakfast alone. Work, texts. Yes, Im free; we can try to find tea. Excited apprehension. Couldve met me someplace, amusing to watch the California car go by. T-Swifts CD and its Style; I just heard that this morning on my way to work -- it is great. Im terrible at giving directions. No, I didnt struggle with my family as a teenager because they wouldnt let me go to a party or use the car, or because I didnt want to do dishes. Its more than that. A lot more than that. Express? Yes, express. Quickly. Mom couldnt write, talk, or walk, dad couldnt play anymore. I was afraid to go anywhere because something bad always happened when I left. I had to help them. Parent me, parent her, miss my dad. Stuart protected and guided me, he wanted me. I lost him and I lost my love. No love left for me. She was more violent and my dad more absent. Sister totally absent after a while. But I fought. I fought for me, for my feelings, for the love I knew was mine to have and mine to give. It just didnt end up coming from the places/people it should have. I fell madly in love with the peace and solitude of this land. I felt more connected to spirit, more connected to love, more certainty, less fear. I love this place. My bodys limitations sometimes make me feel heartbroken; maybe thats better, or else I mightve just gotten lost in nature long ago. This wasnt too much for him? It felt like a lot. It felt easy. Deal. Enjoy the Park in each others company. Yes, love to! Lets walk. Deal. Wait, laundry. Laundry? Hmm...maybe that was too much life story at once. The girl wants me to take her dog. Everyone seems very angry. I want to run, run away. But, thats not how its supposed to be, because thats how I wouldve been before. Progress, be brave. Walk? Okay, lets walk. Tension. I choose Sprague. I love Sprague; its beautiful, its easy, its a sacred spot in my list of spots. Hes bad at walking. Its amusing, too, I like his laugh. We talk - I talk. Talk talk talk talk. This is so strange! So... freeing? Do I feel free? Where is my lisp? Where is the lump in my throat? Why is this easy? He finds his balance. We hit a wall of mine. No, no I really dont want to express the girl's (unbeknownst to her) nickname. Its mean. I dont ever want to be mean. I wont do it. Dont push. Just saying the words isnt a good -- shes a person, she has pain, I want to give her love how I can. We talk in the snow-globe. I love my dad. I really do. Why should he care? He seems to. How odd. Yet, comfortable. Juicing -- that's ridiculous. I dont know how much I weigh. He thinks I say it well. I feel like I have to do a double-take: how can he think what I say is valuable or well-said? But he seems to and I believe it. I look around and I just let myself feel. I feel astounded -- could this be it? And, now I feel cold. Theres a snowman, theres joy. Talk talk talk talk; dont you want me to stop yet? I think it, but I go on because it feels okay. more okay than anything else. healing? The Primrose Path. Yes, I want to come up. I want to keep talking, keep enjoying your company. Everyone still feels angry with me. Wine. Too much wine. Did I eat dinner? Im not sure. I feel unstable and uncomfortable. Hide. Old pattern. Hide. Touch the girl's dog for comfort, as a barrier. I remember two things I said. Will it upset you if I stay? No. For what its worth I really do like you. For what its worth, I like you, too. We made a pinky promise about something, though I cant remember what -- he did it a different way -- I think I kissed my thumb? I remember distinctly how I felt. We laid there next to each other. Talk talk. Tired. He rubbed his hand through my hair. It felt comfortable. I said something, he said wow. Hands, caresses, squeezes. I felt that he contemplated the ring on my finger, he didnt want to let go of me or of the time, he didnt want my neck to hurt. I waver between sleep and awake. Much bliss. How could this have come to be? He kisses my neck and pulls me close. Its nice. So nice. But I dont want to kiss back. I want to take time. Just enjoy. He goes to take a shower. His hair isnt wet. We trade spots. Theres sunshine, we hug. This experience is defining. I lose two friends. Po loses two playmates. Worth it: inline with goodness. Good for me. I feel it. I look forward to a last night. But Im not welcome back. I ask for the chance to have a last night. Agreed. Hand holding, no unsaid words. How will this be I wondered. It will be how its meant to be, trust. Im there, its comfortable. We talk. I think hes scared, but Im not sure what of exactly. He talks about a hike -- I dont entirely follow, but it means something to him: we dont always act how we expect when we find ourselves in uncharted places. I dont understand. You just be how you are - that is you - you embrace every bit of you. Its impossible to expect and plan for it all, thats not life. We sleep. You could join me in the shower. I could, I should shower. Theres not much time and I like starting my day with showers. More lively. Cold water, uncertainty, we embrace, its meaningful. Im happy. Get out of shower, have to get dressed. He says: I think I agree, everything happens for a reason, and Im not sure why, but I know Im better for having known you than not. My heart feels even more open and I trust even more. I dont want him to forget how he feels. We leave the hotel. The driver of that car is probably just handicapped. Always look on the bright side. I wonder if hell ever use my hair tie. See you in March. Text. Text. Text. Open, flowing, smiles, encouraging, care, vulnerability. More talking than I ever expected, much more. I like him a lot. Truly. Plans, pictures, openness. Lovely. Finding each other, being there, open and fearless. Heartwarming. Oh, Boy. Im laying on the bed about to do homework and Im overcome with this deep, undeniable sense -- he has a girlfriend, they live together. These damn feelings are never wrong. How can I confront him? Do I want to? Yes, I have to. Im right, but he wont say it -- just half say it. Trying to compare me to him. NO, totally different. Why lie to me? Im no one to lie to. Dont make me less than I am. That hurts me. Making Sense. I dont know how to come to terms with this. I didnt know. I would never have done this had I known. She should know, shouldnt she? Of course, but it cant be me. Im not even sure how to find her. He has to have the dignity of doing it himself. She can respect him more for that and feel more respected for it. That gesture of painful honesty in wake of tragic dishonesty. I have nightmares. I feel horrible. Ive participated in something reprehensible. How do...how do I do this? I feel smushed by all this pressure to do the right thing. But, whats right? My birthday is clouded by conflicting feelings. My energy is blocked. I dont feel so open anymore. Friends? How can I work on a friendship. I cant. I cant do that. So many questions. So many feelings. So much. Too much. Who do I talk to? This all sounds crazy. He has to do it. He has to think about it, think through it, feel it deeply and truly. I cant do anything. If hes not ready hell just blame me and I know thats not a truth. Im not sure whats truth for him. I know whats true for me. Im sad. Im worried. Im trying to see where I go from this place. You didnt do the hurting. I did. So, I let go. Go to where? What did it all mean for me? I fought with myself over this. Me against adult me. Ive concluded it was destined. It all happened. It was all real. I felt it all. I dont think it wouldve happened for him with anyone. Im not sure what impact its made in his life. But I know in going forward, I did what was good for me -- and I didnt know it was in any way not a good. I found a confidant. I trusted myself. I was deeply honest with myself and with another person and that was such a profound gift. I concede. I will go forward. I will ask for help. I cant keep running and hiding from my pain. Live life unencumbered. Maintain abundant happiness. Im acceptable as I am. Thank you for you. I am so very sorry. "

Mine basically lectured me about being out too long/late (For background's sake, I'm in my early 20's, so it's not like I'm still in HS). Anyway, at one point, she ended up saying to me: ""It's not like you're a man. You're female..."" and that I have to be more mindful of my surroundings because of it. That's the thing though...she's right. I know she is. I think that's the sad part about it. This is what I took away from the conversation: It doesn't matter that I'm a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. It doesn't matter that I have experience in hand-to-hand combat. It doesn't matter that I strength train 4-6x a week... ...and it's just because I'm female. It doesn't matter how prepared I am because I'll always be seen with some type of vulnerability as a result of my gender. I realize that this is a result of how society is set up and that gender perceptions/expectations play a large role... But it just sucks sometimes and I wish it weren't the case :/ TL;DR- it sucks that society tells us women that we're too weak to defend ourselves and need someone to protect us from the ""bad guys."""

Well, weird about my feelings. I play music, right - just as a hobby, I write my own songs... And I'm really scared at my own femaleness when it comes out. It makes me feel uncomfortable, I feel being so vulnerable with my emotions makes me really scared that I'll be ridiculed or destroyed or rejected somehow for feeling them... Feelings like desolation, desperation, loneliness, homesickness, broken-heartedness... Even the more fun feelings like sensuality, felicity, playfulness, hell, even compassion. Maybe its that I'm becoming more accustomed to my craft I'm finding I'm becoming super attuned to my emotions and my femaleness and I don't know how to feel. I feel uncomfortable owning how I feel and using that to my benefit or for the benefit of others. (As a backdrop, I grew up under a type a personality mom who always insisted I be strong and tough and who would get frustrated with me when I divulged into crying or frustration so I eventually cut myself off from accepting my feelings for so long. I'm 25 years old.) Any advice as to how I can embrace this side of myself I've obviously been avoiding for so long? Much appreciated.."

He said it was unfair that Apple can dictate what apps are allowed in the store, and I brought up how Apple is strict with the apps it allows in order to protect users from downloading malware. He kept questioning everything I said, and tried to quiz me on cybersecurity terminology. When I pushed back, he said well I just doubted what you said, Im not saying you dont know what youre talking about ...which would be fine if he didnt refute everything, even when I was stating facts. Its so infuriating. I dont understand how nothing I say is right, even if I have the experience and education to back myself up."

I was a little weirded out, but let it go. Later that week, he asked me to drive the hour to his house for the weekend, located in a very rural area. I declined and said I thought we needed to get to know each other better before a weekend sleepover. That's when things got bad. I can only describe it as dissociation or a loss of touch with reality. He started screaming at me, calling me another woman's name.

Idr). I hung around them a lot, stayed late at their house sometimes and other than the husband (autistic, anger issues, mentally unstable) was flirty as fuck and would sometimes make advancements, there wasnt much wrong, or so I thought. After I turned 18 there was a particularly bad day at work, long story short I wasnt trained to do something properly and I almost got fired for it. Being the anxiety-ridden legal child I was, I went over to my friends house (boyfriend was leaving to go to college for the week) to hang out. Getting there, it was rainy, I was cold and a bit soaked, so I took off my overshirt of my uniform. Telling them about my day, and them seeing how shot I was from anxiety, they suggested marijuana, and had a pen on them I could use. I decided why the hell not, since I didnt have class the next day, so I got high. A few hours of talking, laughing, and watching drop dead gorgeous later, our mutual friend Dario leaves, and the wife goes to bed with their newborn, so its just me and the friend. We were on a couch and I was cuddling up to him because I was cold, watching drunk history. After awhile, the effects start to take hold, and I close my eyes, in a state of consciousness and unconsciousness at the same time, able to recognize stimuli, but reacting was too much for my brain to do. After awhile, Im not going to go into detail because I dont feel like bursting into tears at 12:36 AM, he starts to feel me up in nearly any place that sexual gratification could be achieved. After awhile I was finally able to move and I jumped up and devolved into a panic attack, triggering my PTSD from my molestation in middle school. After being calmed down, I fell back asleep, to which he resumed after about 5-10 minutes after I closed my eyes. Next time I wake up, I swear I saw him standing over me, with his penis in my face. after a few hours I leave and head home, too tired to process what happened. The next day, I shook it off and thought that I was just having memories of my stepbrother. It was only on Thursday (the day of the D&amp;D game at the store we both frequent) that I care to the reality that I wasnt dreaming, it wasnt a memory, but something that actually happened, and that the thought of being in the same store terrified me for some unknown reason. I finally broke down and told a friend, who suggested that at the very least, I tell people of what happen, especially the D&amp;D friend group I had. After I think a few days, I told one of their best friends, and she went behind my back and told the wife, which exploded at their house, which I wasnt able to see. I started getting messages from the guy saying why would I do this, why am I spreading rumors, etc. I asked him if he would be willing to take a polygraph test, to gauge his reaction. He was high too, so I dont know if he genuinely doesnt remember, or if he is just trying to cover his ass. Anyways a day later, I get a message from his wife, giving me information about polygraph testing with a message that basically said that she fully supports her husband, and shell be blocking me, etc. I told her that is it not even worth hearing my side? Shes a past victim too so I dont understand why she wouldnt at least hear me out, and I told her the blind faith is disgusting, and that obviously she doesnt care about my side, so I didnt know if it would be worth taking, not to mention the money. She says shell pay, but shell be late on rent. I forgot to mention this, but she has other kids as well, and I didnt want them to have to suffer for the mistakes of their parents. During this time I was working in a Cybersecurity competition so I said Ill do it later, then they BOTH (friend and wife) start sending messages casually taking shots at my intelligence and basically ganging up on me. Eventually she says she will give the money to a mutual friend of ours. The next day Im at work and am busy, and she asks me to pick it up. I told her Im busy and she can wait. At this point I was furious because they are being insulting and awful to me, whilist Im going through emotional hell. As a side note I was molested in middle school, my emotional stability and mental health was severely stunted, and controlling my hurt, fear, pain, rage, self-doubt, and confusion was nearly impossible. While my boyfriend wasnt there for that, he could see a glimpse of how volatile I was then because I started to revert back to how I was. YEARS of effort and help had gone down the drain, and I was powerless to stop it. I told the wife that I dont need to deal with her feelings, because it wasnt my problem, and that Ill get to it when Im ready, because I needed to heal. I was in pure agony over this (Im getting better, but nights like this dont make it easier) and just wanted to rest my weary conscience. The wife says that she proceeded to make the arrangements, and will ask for my schedule. I told her that if she does this before Im ready, she will be wasting her money, because I needed to focus on keeping myself upright, and I will revisit this when I was ready. She proceeded to say many things, most along the lines of shes just wanting to get this done, so should I since her kids are in danger, etc. I was at work so I couldnt respond, but she left me with a beautiful looks like you learned wonderful manipulation from your mother (mother is a narcissist, ouch.) and left with her friend taking screenshots. Its been about two months almost, and Im still a bit of a wreck, but Ive finally started to eat again, and kinda maintain responsibilities with school and relationships, but Im still trying to climb out of this."

I constantly hear men in tech say that they support women. In fact, their company has a variety of efforts, such as women engagement groups and female leaders, that prove that they care about women in tech. I worked in a cybersecurity lab with a group of men. This group of men would tell you that they support women. They have sisters, mothers, girlfriends, fiances, and wives. They report to a female executive. This does not mean that they support women in tech. Gender discrimination is real and it is painful as hell. I felt worthless every day I went to work. I felt excluded. I felt isolated. I felt less than. I always see people sharing statistics and numbers on the gender gap. Those numbers do not speak to what its like to work in this environment day to day and how much it hurts. I cried almost every day a few months before I put in my two weeks. I would hide in the bathroom to cry. I would cry at my desk. I would cry on my way home. I would use my lunch break to cry in my car. I would use my lunch break to visit a therapist and cry in her office. I would text my friends and family for emotional support and cry in a call room. I felt so alone and so hurt. This was my first job. I was so excited. I wanted to learn, I wanted to give my best, I wanted to do my best. I moved to a new city in a new state right after graduation. I was so excited to give this new city and my new job my all. I was the first girl to work in the lab full-time. For over a year, I gave it my all and I shouldn't have. I am leaving broken and empty. It started with small things. Comments said. Comments made towards me. Attitudes that would not be tolerated if more women were present in the room. At first, I didn't let it bother me but it would just add up. I finally said something to a female coworker who asked me how I was doing. She was the first person to ask me how I felt as the only girl. I told her about some comments made. I was told to not go over my manager's head. The manager agreed the environment was toxic and that he was working on it. The environment never changed. I was told I was too competitive. I was told I was weak. I was told I was not strong. I was told that I did not need to be included. I was told I wanted to be right all the time. I was told I was too emotional. I was told I was too sensitive. I was told I was too dramatic. I was told I was over thinking it. I was told that no one else saw it the way I saw it. No one prepares you for how emotionally taxing it is to walk into a room where your voice does not matter. In fact, you are ridiculed for your voice and no one will acknowledge it. You can tell all the managers, directors, HR staff, you want. They will tell you change happens in small movements and you will be stuck sitting in that room, feeling voiceless, powerless, and worthless. Every day I struggled to walk into that room. I struggled to spend 8 hours a day with these men. I expressed these concerns and was told to sit outside of the lab. Sitting outside helped a little bit. At least I wasn't being excluded while I was in the room. I was choosing to be excluded. I was taking control over how I was choosing to be treated. I no longer just felt emotionally excluded, I felt physically and emotionally excluded. It would suck to look into that glass room that I never I was a part of. I would see them huddled discussing something as a team. I felt emotional pain of being excluded but I would tell myself I was better off sitting outside because I don't have to hear their voices. I would never have been invited to that conversation. I would have just been too competitive. I would have just been showing off. I would have just been trying to make it about me. It wasn't a glass ceiling for me, it was a glass wall. I can sit in the same room, do the same work as the men in the room, be just as competent as the men, but I will not have the same experience. There is a glass wall that separates me from the men in that room. It may looked on the outside that I was a part of the team but don't let the glass fool you, I was never a part of that team."

He practically yelled at me when I told him to knock it off and I was here to learn. I went to my professors about him. One was very helpful and made sure we were separated in the classroom and never paired him up with me on class projects. The other professor said he's never noticed inappropriate behavior coming from this guy and he wasn't going to do anything about it. He also said I will have to get used to it if I was to continue a degree in computer science. IT is a ""Man's field"", he said. It was very disheartening. So all semester long this classmate did all he could to sit close to me and make snide comments on how good my bum looked in my pants and other inappropriate things. It got to the point where a few other classmates talked to the professor and still nothing was done. I began absolutely dreading going to class. It was a rough semester but I got through it. I'm not taking classes this summer and from now on, I'm going to avoid that professor."
143,cybersecurity,TwoXChromosomes,An Open Letter to My Stalker,4,8pe51m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8pe51m/an_open_letter_to_my_stalker/,2018-06-08 07:22:02,"Its been two years since you decided to be my friend. Its been a year-and-a-half since you decided to violated my trust. Its been a year since you decided that your own convoluted obsessions were worth more than my mental health, my sense of safety, and my voice. I wanted to tell you this over the phone but, just like last year, you were too much of a coward to address me directly. I tried to give you the opportunity to redeem yourself but you never took it. Nevertheless, you deserve to know what impact your actions make. Let me make this clear, I know that every text, every account, every fucked-up receipt was from you. When the subpoenas confirmed that fact, I was relieved. And yet, it didnt matter because your own selfishness mattered more than anything I could have brought to that school. Even though its been a year, I think about you a lot, specifically when I read about the next schoolyard tragedy. Every single one has a headline about how the attacker berated a girl for months before ending her life with a bullet in her head. Do you know what its like to hear your lawyer tell you that if theres a lockdown, its probably meant for you? I wrote a letter to the president of our school that pleaded with her to be more wary of girls safety. But I never received a response. I started our school excited to meet new people as a transfer student. My sophomore year was filled with transitions and my junior year followed as I cemented my friendships and social standing. I expected my senior year to flash by me with memories of football games and dances. Instead, it dragged on as the administration found it easier to protect a psychopath than myself. It started in environmental science. I thought you were clever and I loved that we shared similar political views. Your remarks on our nations leaders were funny and cutting and I found myself looking forward to fourth period every day so I could discuss the election with my new friend. When I talked about you, some people said that you were a bit antisocial or that you bullied them in years past. But I didnt see those things. I figured you had changed. I liked to see the best in people then and so I pushed myself to see the best in you. I even made you those bags so that you could feel more accepted. When we went to the movies, I felt horrible that you thought it was a date. I was a firm believer in loyalty and thought that if I dropped you, I would be a bad friend so I tried to make it clear that that was all we were: friends. When you kissed me around Halloween, I didnt know what to do. You ignored me for a week but then seemed to come around to the idea of a platonic relationship. I was so relieved. I wouldnt want to lose you from my life. In reality, I should have asked the teacher to change my seat. I should have never made you those bags. I should have realized that even though not one of the things I endured last year was my fault, you were too selfish to recognize that I was a person, not an idea. When the first texts came, I thought the situation was funny. With the poor grammar and the aggressive tone, I tried to make a joke out it. I sent the texts to my friends and like you, many of them texted that number. I thought it was even more bizarre that the voicemail message sounded like a childs. In hindsight, I am less angry about the initial texts than I am about their execution. How could you bring your little brother into that? How could you use a childs phone to try to hurt someone? After that, the texts only got worse and that was when I started to feel nervous. One year later, my anxiety flares when I think of how you orchestrated every conversation. Whenever I talk to someone about my senior year, they all ask the same question: You mean he texted himself as the stalker? That fact was beyond fucked-up. That fact shows that you need serious mental health. I still cannot figure out what your end-goal was in the entire game. Did you think if I relied on you for a sense of safety that I would find you attractive? Did you think if you undermined my security that I would fuck you? What was your goal? And yet, despite the psychotic messages - the ones about love language and about teaching me a lesson and about hurting me - the worst part of it all was the aftermath. That is what makes my heart race and my anger pique. I can understand on some level why the school did not take action at first. Though I had evidence on how you used your little brothers phone, how you sent texts by my home, and how you used a proxy server, they did not want to wrongly punish you. However, we spent thousands on cybersecurity analyses and lawyers after that. And your claim of innocence was more convincing, or rather, more convenient, than any evidence that a girl could bring to the table. You could have just admitted to it. You could have accepted your shame. I wouldnt have pursued anything more than an apology. Instead, you took the most selfish route possible. You put the wellbeing of your family below your own reputation. And consequently, you destroyed everything in my path. I had to endure months of ridicule from the administration. Most of them refused to believe that the school would ever have a menace in its student body and if they did believe me, they would say that I had no right to justice. I put some of my favorite quotes from our administrators in bullets for your ease. - You should learn to forgive as Christ forgives. (Although, please remember that Christ also endorsed righteous justice.) - Its more of a he-said, she-said scenario. (Even with copious amounts of evidence.) - Why would he do something like this if he was your friend? (I ask myself the same question.) - Those football bags led him on. (Nothing that I could have done would justify what you did to me.) - Boys do crazy things when theyre in love. (Not only was what you did devoid of love but men cannot be given a pass simply because they want to fuck a girl.) - We dont want to him to be bullied so you cant talk about this. (I hope that my anger and anxiety was worth your already shitty reputation.) After I came forward, things got worse. First, the school made me transfer out of our shared classes. Because of YOUR actions, I had to suffer the consequences. Second, you went on Kairos. I was a front-runner to lead. Yet the school considered my leadership as less important than your ability to hang around younger girls at their most vulnerable. You took something that I loved and you ruined it. Third, I spent my graduation in a fit of fury. To know that my spot as graduation speaker was taken away because I was too controversial hit me harder than someone as shallow and disgusting as you could ever know. When I walked across the stage, I had to shake the school president's hand as she tried to apologize to me. I mustered a quick fuck you as I passed by her. Then, I had to watch you get your diploma even though I brought the subpoenas to the administration days before. Nevertheless, it has been a year. Im glad that I got out of our hometown and you didnt. I get texts a few times a week from former classmates when they spot you on campus. People still remember what you did. We even made a joke at a graduation party: Whats the difference between the administration and you? You'll will always find my home address. Im much happier than I was a year ago. I dont give my phone number out anymore but Im living in my dream city. A doctor diagnosed me with PTSD so I can finally work on trusting others, especially positions of authority. But even with how well my life is going, you deserved to know what a twisted person you are. You deserve to know that you are a menace to women. You deserve to know that you are a selfish coward. You can always call me if you disagree. "
144,cybersecurity,TwoXChromosomes,Its been a year since I found the identity of my stalker. #MeToo,9,7tzars,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7tzars/its_been_a_year_since_i_found_the_identity_of_my/,2018-01-30 18:10:06,"I know that few people will probably read this but I wanted to share my story on a forum that can maybe help connect with other people and in a place where I wont be ridiculed. My life has changed so much and I needed to get it out somewhere and somehow. Last January, I found out that the person who had been sending me rape and death threats from sixteen different numbers and emails was a fellow student at my high school. He sat next to me in two of my classes and we had become friends. I first met him in September of 2016 as he sat at my table in science. He was quiet and kind of an outcast so I made him bags for his football games as a gesture of friendship. Its a tradition where girls fill up baskets or backpacks or Victorias Secret bags with snacks and drinks for their friends or boyfriends. He was grateful and we quickly began to bond over our mutual love of politics. When he followed me in a parking lot and kissed me on an October night, I explained I just wanted to be friends and he seemed to understand. Cut to a month later and I began to receive texts from unknown numbers. They began with calling me a slut which I took as a joke and would post on my Twitter. But then more messages from disguised numbers and perverted email addresses would contact me. They would mention how I needed to be taught a lesson, should figure out my sexual and love languages, and threatened to rape me at all hours of the day. Luckily, my friend would text these numbers defending me no matter the cost. I started to get suspicious and tracked the numbers and the IP addresses of the emails. Some were sent from in front of my house as early as 2 AM. He left a variety of trails that he forgot to cover up and my family hired various cybersecurity firms to confirm our suspicions. Once we had enough evidence, we went to my school. At first they sided with me. But that lasted about a week. Then I got a wave of opposition from the administration. The greatest hits include Its a he-said, she-said scenario, Did you lead him on?, and my personal favorite of You should learn to forgive as Jesus forgave. (I went to a Christian school.) Nothing happened to him. He graduated with me. I was punished for speaking out - I had to transfer out of my classes that I shared with him, I lost my leadership position on a religious retreat, and I lost my chance at graduation speaker as a teacher told me that I was too controversial. He even went on the retreat I hoped to lead in which he was the only senior and surrounded by emotionally vulnerable underclassmen. My school told me that I was not allowed to say it was him even though we had confirmation from three cybersecurity firms and subpoenaed evidence from the phone company. I lost some friends too. But thats not the point of this story. The point of this story is the fact that as Ive been typing this out, I am no longer filled with the sadness and panic that I once was. I no longer feel unsafe. I dont get into my car and scream because I dont know what I did wrong in all of this. I dont question our efforts to bring him to justice. When I think back to where I was 365 days ago, Im just angry. And I think thats what I need right now. Im angry because theres no reason that I shouldve felt that way. And if youve ever been in a situation like this, theres no reason that you should ever blame yourself. Im angry because I know that if these events happened this year, the administration wouldve taken action. Not because they cared about the fractures in rape culture today but because they fear bad publicity. Im angry because even if I want to talk about all of the other events of assault and harassment Ive endured, I have to pick and choose. Otherwise, they will all be cast aside and no matter what evidence I bring to the table, I will always be thought of as crying wolf. But I like anger. Its a mobilizer. Marching with all of these women in the District showed me that anger is not a poison but a key to liberation. Im at my dream school, studying for my dream job, and (lucky me!) have received no rape threats in the past semester. But if I want to do anything with my degree or myself, I need to be angry to make change. I know not a lot of people will read this but if you did, thank you for reading my anonymous rambling. Im proud of me and Im proud of you. #TimesUp"
145,cybersecurity,TwoXChromosomes,Looking for outsider's perspective on whether or not I should make a slight career change.,1,7kfnqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7kfnqb/looking_for_outsiders_perspective_on_whether_or/,2017-12-18 06:08:50,"I originally posted this in ITCareerQuestions but realized I might better get an objective perspective from fellow techie women. TL;DR: 32 y/o woman has possible better job op in a more tech-heavy position but has reservations of leaving a good thing. Given the factors below, what would you do? I'm having a hard time deciding whether or not I want to leave my position. Apologies for length, but this is harder than I thought to consider. Currently, I work for state government. I have a myriad of duties, but my primary title is an Information Security Officer working with FBI technical security policy compliance. It's a great job, I have a lot of fun, I travel a lot, and despite some typical work bullshit, it's pretty awesome. FWIW, Dana Scully was an idol growing up and while I don't work FOR the FBI, this is a damn close second. There's another job that I'm thinking of applying for on the health services side of things in another state department. It's a jump above what I make now, which would be about $13000 a year more (gross). The title is not nearly as cool, as it's actually considered a Programmer but it's not really programming at all. It's doing a lot of the stuff I do now (tech audits, security policies, incident response, etc.) but because the other department doesn't have a relevant job position available in their roster that are applicable to the job's duties, they had to pick one that was close enough but not exact. I know the department hiring manager; he and I have worked together because I've actually audited his department (they deal with some FBI data which means they're subject to audit) and I believe we've developed a really good rapport and professional relationship. I reached out to him and said I was thinking of applying and he said he was surprised that I was thinking about it but seemed extremely supportive and said I would be a very competitive candidate. Not that I have this in the bag, and I'm sure there are plenty of other good candidates, but I think my chances are really good. Anyway, I'm weighing the pros and cons. I really just don't know if this would be a smart move. I love what I do, but I think this other job has more opportunities. I think I'm still young(ish) enough that I can still have a lot ahead of me for career growth and changing up jobs wouldn't necessary be a bad thing. Also, I have my GCIH certification. Please.. any advice. What would you do in my situation? I've bulleted out my major thoughts and concerns. Life goals: * Have a better-paying job (possibly in the private sector) where I can telecommute full-time or do independent consulting so that I can travel for leisure/work * Make enough money so my husband doesn't have to work or move to a place where he can find a job in a big city that he wants to live in (his field is pretty specialty and hard to get employment, so if we move like we want to, I'd have to make enough money to support us until he could find another job) * Reach relative financial independence by 40 * Learn a lot more about IT and get more certifications * Considering enrolling in WGU for a BS in cybersecurity * Finish writing a book (my first love is writing, so my independence/freelance/telecommuting possibility would permit me more time to do this) Pros of current job: * Lots of travel (mostly in-state, some out of state) * Bad ass title * Great experience doing on-site technical audits * Have learned a lot about network security * Currently a supervisor * Am well-liked by other management and staff * Have a lot of awesome coworkers and friends that I get along with and that I truly enjoy * Amazing network of peers across the country and at the FBI * Potential to get good federal job based on current field and experience * Actually really enjoy what I do Cons of current job: * Limited growth. This is my biggest one. There's nowhere to move into, unless one of our IT managers leaves and even then, I'd end up losing my current title and job duties. I'm the only one who does what I do and it's assigned to my current position. There's no promotion that would allow me to keep this type of work. I'm basically stuck. Any promotion would of course be more money but I'd be doing something different. * Understaffed. Because it's government, we're limited on resources and staff. I work a lot of unpaid overtime (however, I do get to take a portion of extra time worked to bank as vacation time. I've accumulated over 100 hours this year which may be a pro in a way.) * Overall stress of meeting deadlines. Because I'm the only one that does what I do and can do what I do, I'm solely responsible for hundreds of agencies and there's a lot of pressure/lack of support by upper management who don't realize how much work goes into this job. Keep in mind, the IT auditing/FBI stuff is only part of my job and I have a shit ton of other duties to do (which could be a pro since I have a lot of hats). Before I got into the job, they had a TON of turnover (at least four other people in fewer than two years cycled through). Which leads me into: * Somewhat unhealthy work environment. My immediate boss overworks *tremendously* and management above her does not seem to care or want to do anything about remedying this issue. My direct report has been on permanent OT for five years. Again, management just poo-poos it, because at least our jobs are getting done. Another coworker has had a couple of breakdowns at work because of pressure, deadlines, and work refusing to let her get OT to get things done. The expectations are unreasonable and unrealistic across the board, not just for me. * Inflexible with scheduling. They don't allow telecommuting and they don't allow flexible work schedules (such as doing four 10s or getting every other Friday off by working longer days). This is actually kind of a big deal for me. I *hate* doing the typical M-F 9-5. Pros of new job: * I have an advantage over other applicants because I have the compliance experience with one of their required policies * More opportunity to grow and get more experience relevant to IT. I'd probably be better able to increase my knowledge and skills a lot faster. It could also mean I could take what I learn at this new job and get something better in the private sector * I know some of the people there already, so I think I'd easily fit in * My new boss is awesome and very easy to talk to. I know it'd be different if I ended up working under him instead of ""with"" him, but he's very knowledgable, laid back, and really nice. * More relaxed work environment (casual dress and probably better opportunity for flexible work schedule) * More money (approximately an extra $600 a month more after taxes) and since I wouldn't be a supervisor, I'd be eligible for OT * Doing similar stuff I do now * Closer to home * Would learn more compliance requirements of other industries which could benefit me in a possible future of being an independent consultant/auditor Cons of new job: * No longer would be a supervisor, which I would be sad to lose. Having that experience is really good for advancement into other managerial positions * General possibility that new job would suck/wouldn't be good fit/wouldn't be enjoyable * Leave the current field I'm in that I REALLY like and lose access to that networking/peer group (well, some of them) * Probably wouldn't travel much at all * Doesn't look nearly as impressive on a resume as current title * Would be harder for me to get a federal job (if I end up going that route) back in the field that I'm currently in What would you do? What are your thoughts? Am I too emotionally attached to my current job and title? Would I be shooting myself in the foot if I left? Or should I stick it out with a good title/job and responsibilities for a while longer and leverage that into other future jobs?"

But like, all the potential is gone. I'm whatever I'm going to be right now and that's that, and whatever I am right now is not very good, but it's hard to say what should change. I feel like I've wasted all my time and there's no getting it back, and because I didn't do certain things there's no way to move forward. A lot of people look at my life and think there's a lot going on but there really isn't. I have a dead-end programming job, I'm studying for a master's in cybersecurity and all the classes so far have just taught for tests and I haven't learned anything. I'm writing a lot but I'm very close to giving up hope for ever doing anything with it. I'm trying to get more active in the LGBT community but I just don't think it's working. Everyone else my age is already settled down and knows what they want and I'm just climbing this endless pile of shit and I don't even think there's anything worth the effort on top anymore. I hate where I live but I don't think I could make it anywhere else. I don't have much to say for relationships, I've only had one really, but it was LDR and didn't go anywhere, so I'm way behind everyone else there, too. It's like, this is my life for the rest of my life, with nobody to care about and nobody to care about me, just working on these endless projects that mean nothing to anyone. That's it, the end, all potential squandered. Maybe things could have been different if I had started earlier but no, I'm a fully grown adult, so it's over. I guess I'm posting here because it seems like it's different for guys, like they have the luxury of getting to this point much later in life... also the advice that guys tend to give other guys on reddit on the matter isn't very helpful.
